FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION REGULATIONS\\n1. Statutory Authorization, Finding of Fact, Purpose and Objectives: Statutory\\nauthorization. The legislature of the State of Connecticut has in Section 8-2 of the\\nGeneral Statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt\\nregulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its\\ncitizenry. Therefore, the Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Plymouth\\ndoes hereby promulgate the following:\\ni.\\nThe flood hazard areas of the Town of Plymouth are subject to periodic inundation\\nwhich results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of\\ncommerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood\\nprotection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect\\nthe public health, safety and general welfare.\\n37\\n\\nNEW PAGE 42\\nThese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in\\nfloodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy\\nin flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which\\nare inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood\\ndamages.\\nii.\\nIt is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety and\\ngeneral welfare and to minimize the public and private losses due to flood\\nconditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:\\na. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due\\nto water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion\\nhazards, or which result in damaging increase in erosion or in flood heights or\\nvelocities;\\nb. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such\\nuses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;\\nC. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural\\nprotective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;\\nd. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase\\nerosion or flood damage, and;\\ne. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally\\ndivert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\\niii.\\nThe objectives of these Regulations are:\\na. To protect human life and health;\\nb. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\\nC. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and\\ngenerally undertaken at the expense of the general public;\\nd. To minimize business interruptions;\\ne. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas\\nmains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in\\nfloodplains;\\nf. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and\\ndevelopment of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight\\nareas; and,\\ng. To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.\\n38\\n\\nNEW PAGE 43\\n2.\\nGeneral Provisions: These Regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood\\nhazard within the jurisdiction of the Town of Plymouth.\\n39\\nCELL (1, 1): \\ni.\\nCELL (1, 2): \\nSuch areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency\\nManagement Agency in its report entitled \"Flood Insurance Study\", Flood\\nInsurance Rate Maps, Town of Plymouth dated November 6, 1998, with\\naccompanying floodway maps and other supporting data, and any revision thereto,\\nare adopted by reference and declared to be part of these Regulations;\\nCELL (2, 1): \\nii.\\nCELL (2, 2): \\nA zoning permit or subdivision plan approval shall be required in compliance with\\nthe provisions of the Zoning Regulations and/or Subdivision Regulations (including\\nthese Flood Damage Prevention Regulations) prior to commencement of any\\ndevelopment activities;\\nCELL (3, 1): \\niii.\\nCELL (3, 2): \\nNo structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally\\naltered without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and other\\napplicable Regulations;\\nCELL (4, 1): \\niv.\\nCELL (4, 2): \\nThese Regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing\\neasements, covenants, or deed restrictions.

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION REGULATIONS\\n1. Statutory Authorization, Finding of Fact, Purpose and Objectives: Statutory\\nauthorization. The legislature of the State of Connecticut has in Section 8-2 of the\\nGeneral Statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt\\nregulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its\\ncitizenry. Therefore, the Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Plymouth\\ndoes hereby promulgate the following:\\ni.\\nThe flood hazard areas of the Town of Plymouth are subject to periodic inundation\\nwhich results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of\\ncommerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood\\nprotection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect\\nthe public health, safety and general welfare.\\n37\\n\\nNEW PAGE 42\\nThese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in\\nfloodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy\\nin flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which\\nare inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood\\ndamages.\\nii.\\nIt is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety and\\ngeneral welfare and to minimize the public and private losses due to flood\\nconditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:\\na. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due\\nto water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion\\nhazards, or which result in damaging increase in erosion or in flood heights or\\nvelocities;\\nb. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such\\nuses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;\\nC. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural\\nprotective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;\\nd. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase\\nerosion or flood damage, and;\\ne. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally\\ndivert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\\niii.\\nThe objectives of these Regulations are:\\na. To protect human life and health;\\nb. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\\nC. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and\\ngenerally undertaken at the expense of the general public;\\nd. To minimize business interruptions;\\ne. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas\\nmains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in\\nfloodplains;\\nf.

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION REGULATIONS\\n1. Statutory Authorization, Finding of Fact, Purpose and Objectives: Statutory\\nauthorization. The legislature of the State of Connecticut has in Section 8-2 of the\\nGeneral Statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt\\nregulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its\\ncitizenry. Therefore, the Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Plymouth\\ndoes hereby promulgate the following:\\ni.\\nThe flood hazard areas of the Town of Plymouth are subject to periodic inundation\\nwhich results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of\\ncommerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood\\nprotection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect\\nthe public health, safety and general welfare.\\n37\\n\\nNEW PAGE 42\\nThese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in\\nfloodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy\\nin flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which\\nare inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood\\ndamages.\\nii.\\nIt is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety and\\ngeneral welfare and to minimize the public and private losses due to flood\\nconditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:\\na. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due\\nto water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion\\nhazards, or which result in damaging increase in erosion or in flood heights or\\nvelocities;\\nb. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such\\nuses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;\\nC. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural\\nprotective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;\\nd. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase\\nerosion or flood damage, and;\\ne. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally\\ndivert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\\niii.\\nThe objectives of these Regulations are:\\na. To protect human life and health;\\nb. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\\nC. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and\\ngenerally undertaken at the expense of the general public;\\nd. To minimize business interruptions;\\ne. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas\\nmains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in\\nfloodplains;\\nf. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and\\ndevelopment of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight\\nareas; and,\\ng. To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.\\n38\\n',\n",

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION REGULATIONS\\n1. Statutory Authorization, Finding of Fact, Purpose and Objectives: Statutory\\nauthorization. The legislature of the State of Connecticut has in Section 8-2 of the\\nGeneral Statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt\\nregulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its\\ncitizenry. Therefore, the Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Plymouth\\ndoes hereby promulgate the following:\\ni.\\nThe flood hazard areas of the Town of Plymouth are subject to periodic inundation\\nwhich results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of\\ncommerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood\\nprotection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect\\nthe public health, safety and general welfare.\\n37\\n\\nNEW PAGE 42\\nThese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in\\nfloodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy\\nin flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which\\nare inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood\\ndamages.\\nii.\\nIt is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety and\\ngeneral welfare and to minimize the public and private losses due to flood\\nconditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:\\na. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due\\nto water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion\\nhazards, or which result in damaging increase in erosion or in flood heights or\\nvelocities;\\nb. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such\\nuses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;\\nC. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural\\nprotective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;\\nd. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase\\nerosion or flood damage, and;\\ne. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally\\ndivert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\\niii.\\nThe objectives of these Regulations are:\\na. To protect human life and health;\\nb. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\\nC. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and\\ngenerally undertaken at the expense of the general public;\\nd. To minimize business interruptions;\\ne. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas\\nmains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in\\nfloodplains;\\nf. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and\\ndevelopment of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight\\nareas; and,\\ng. To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.\\n38\\n\\nNEW PAGE 43\\n2.\\nGeneral Provisions: These Regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood\\nhazard within the jurisdiction of the Town of Plymouth.\\n39\\nCELL (1, 1): \\ni.\\nCELL (1, 2): \\nSuch areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency\\nManagement Agency in its report entitled \"Flood Insurance Study\", Flood\\nInsurance Rate Maps, Town of Plymouth dated November 6, 1998, with\\naccompanying floodway maps and other supporting data, and any revision thereto,\\nare adopted by reference and declared to be part of these Regulations;\\nCELL (2, 1): \\nii.\\nCELL (2, 2): \\nA zoning permit or subdivision plan approval shall be required in compliance with\\nthe provisions of the Zoning Regulations and/or Subdivision Regulations (including\\nthese Flood Damage Prevention Regulations) prior to commencement of any\\ndevelopment activities;\\nCELL (3, 1): \\niii.\\nCELL (3, 2): \\nNo structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally\\naltered without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and other\\napplicable Regulations;\\nCELL (4, 1): \\niv.\\nCELL (4, 2): \\nThese Regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing\\neasements, covenants, or deed restrictions.

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION REGULATIONS\\n1. Statutory Authorization, Finding of Fact, Purpose and Objectives: Statutory\\nauthorization. The legislature of the State of Connecticut has in Section 8-2 of the\\nGeneral Statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt\\nregulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its\\ncitizenry. Therefore, the Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Plymouth\\ndoes hereby promulgate the following:\\ni.\\nThe flood hazard areas of the Town of Plymouth are subject to periodic inundation\\nwhich results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of\\ncommerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood\\nprotection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect\\nthe public health, safety and general welfare.\\n37\\n\\nNEW PAGE 42\\nThese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in\\nfloodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy\\nin flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which\\nare inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood\\ndamages.\\nii.\\nIt is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety and\\ngeneral welfare and to minimize the public and private losses due to flood\\nconditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:\\na. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due\\nto water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion\\nhazards, or which result in damaging increase in erosion or in flood heights or\\nvelocities;\\nb. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such\\nuses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;\\nC. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural\\nprotective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;\\nd. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase\\nerosion or flood damage, and;\\ne. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally\\ndivert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\\niii.\\nThe objectives of these Regulations are:\\na. To protect human life and health;\\nb. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\\nC. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and\\ngenerally undertaken at the expense of the general public;\\nd. To minimize business interruptions;\\ne. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas\\nmains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in\\nfloodplains;\\nf. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and\\ndevelopment of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight\\nareas; and,\\ng. To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.\\n38\\n\\nNEW PAGE 43\\n2.\\nGeneral Provisions: These Regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood\\nhazard within the jurisdiction of the Town of Plymouth.\\n39\\nCELL (1, 1): \\ni.\\nCELL (1, 2): \\nSuch areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency\\nManagement Agency in its report entitled \"Flood Insurance Study\", Flood\\nInsurance Rate Maps, Town of Plymouth dated November 6, 1998, with\\naccompanying floodway maps and other supporting data, and any revision thereto,\\nare adopted by reference and declared to be part of these Regulations;\\nCELL (2, 1): \\nii.\\nCELL (2, 2): \\nA zoning permit or subdivision plan approval shall be required in compliance with\\nthe provisions of the Zoning Regulations and/or Subdivision Regulations (including\\nthese Flood Damage Prevention Regulations) prior to commencement of any\\ndevelopment activities;\\nCELL (3, 1): \\niii.\\nCELL (3, 2): \\nNo structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally\\naltered without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and other\\napplicable Regulations;\\nCELL (4, 1): \\niv.\\nCELL (4, 2): \\nThese Regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing\\neasements, covenants, or deed restrictions.

You are looking for facts inside a\\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"I-1 Industrial\" and with an\\nabbreviated name \"I-1\".\\n\\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which also goes by the\\nfollowing other names: min lot size, min lot coverage, min parcel size, min lot and building, area and bulk, min dimensional, min lot area, lot area, min area, min lot area, min lot and area, min lot, min lot requirements, min parcel area, lot size, lot and building, dimensional, min lot, lot requirements, lot and building requirements, area requirements, area and bulk requirements, dimensional requirements. Only output values that are seen in the\\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\\nshould not return an answer. For min_lot_size in residential districts, we are only\\ninterested in the answer as it pertains to single-family homes.\\n\\n# Schema\\n{\\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted.

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION REGULATIONS\\n1. Statutory Authorization, Finding of Fact, Purpose and Objectives: Statutory\\nauthorization. The legislature of the State of Connecticut has in Section 8-2 of the\\nGeneral Statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt\\nregulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its\\ncitizenry. Therefore, the Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Plymouth\\ndoes hereby promulgate the following:\\ni.\\nThe flood hazard areas of the Town of Plymouth are subject to periodic inundation\\nwhich results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of\\ncommerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood\\nprotection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect\\nthe public health, safety and general welfare.\\n37\\n\\nNEW PAGE 42\\nThese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in\\nfloodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy\\nin flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which\\nare inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood\\ndamages.\\nii.\\nIt is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety and\\ngeneral welfare and to minimize the public and private losses due to flood\\nconditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:\\na. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due\\nto water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion\\nhazards, or which result in damaging increase in erosion or in flood heights or\\nvelocities;\\nb. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such\\nuses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;\\nC. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural\\nprotective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;\\nd. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase\\nerosion or flood damage, and;\\ne. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally\\ndivert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\\niii.\\nThe objectives of these Regulations are:\\na. To protect human life and health;\\nb. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\\nC. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and\\ngenerally undertaken at the expense of the general public;\\nd. To minimize business interruptions;\\ne. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas\\nmains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in\\nfloodplains;\\nf. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and\\ndevelopment of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight\\nareas; and,\\ng. To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.\\n38\\n\\n\\n Output:'}],\n",

Only output values that are seen in the\\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\\nshould not return an answer. For min_lot_size in residential districts, we are only\\ninterested in the answer as it pertains to single-family homes.\\n\\n# Schema\\n{\\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \"\\\\n\" and any type of special characters.\\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\\n    \"answer\": str // The value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

Preamble: These Regulations are designed to further the purpose set forth in Public Act\\n83-388 entitled \"An Act Concerning Soil Erosion and Sediment Control\" as it may apply\\nto activities subject to Sections 8-2 and 8-25 of the General Statutes of the State of\\nConnecticut, to strengthen and extend the soil erosion and sediment control activity in the\\n34\\n\\nNEW PAGE 39\\nTown and to reduce the danger from storm water runoff, minimize sediment pollution\\nfrom land being developed and to conserve and protect the land, water, air and other\\nenvironmental resources of the Town.\\nThe Commission, acting under the authority of Public Act 83-388 of the General Statutes\\nof the State of Connecticut, hereby adopts and enacts these Regulations as the \"Soil\\nErosion and Sediment Control Regulations for Land Development of the Town of\\nPlymouth, Connecticut.\" All references to the Connecticut General Statutes refer to the\\nRevision of 1958, as amended.\\nNo land development which is cumulatively more than one-half acre in area may be\\nundertaken in any district unless certification therefore in compliance with the provisions\\nof these Regulations has first been obtained from the Commission or its appointed agent.\\n2. Activities Requiring a Certified Erosion and Sediment Control Plan: A soil erosion\\nand sediment control plan shall be submitted with any application for development when\\nthe disturbed area of such development is cumulatively more than one-half acre.\\n3. Exemptions: A single family dwelling that is not part of a subdivision of land shall be\\nexempt from these soil erosion and sediment control Regulations.\\n4. Erosion and Sediment Control Plan: To be eligible for certification, a soil erosion and\\nsediment control plan shall contain proper provisions to adequately control accelerated\\nerosion and sedimentation and reduce the damages from storm water runoff on the\\nproposed site based on the best available technology. For methods and practices\\nnecessary for certification refer to the \"Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and\\nSediment Control (2002)\", as amended, published by the Connecticut Council on Soil\\nand Water Conservation. Alternative principles, methods and practices may be used with\\nprior approval of the Commission.\\nSaid plan shall contain, but not be limited to:\\ni.\\nA narrative describing:\\na. The development;\\nb. The schedule for grading and construction activities including:\\n1) Start and completion dates;\\n2) Sequence of grading and construction activities;\\n3) Sequence for installation and/or application of soil erosion and\\nsedimentation control measures;\\n4) Sequence for final stabilization of the project site.\\nC. The design criteria for proposed soil erosion and sediment control measures and\\nstorm water management facilities;\\nd. The construction details for proposed soil erosion and sediment control\\nmeasures and storm water management facilities;\\n35\\n\\nNEW PAGE 40\\ne.
