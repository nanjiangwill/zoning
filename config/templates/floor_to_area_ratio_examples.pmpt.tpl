(d) General Requirements.
1. Along existing streets, new buildings shall create a transition in spacing,
mass, scale, and street frontage relationship from existing buildings to
buildings in the Transit-Oriented Employment district.
a. New buildings are expected to exceed the scale and volume of
existing buildings, but shall demonstrate compatibility by varying
the massing of buildings to reduce perceived scale and volume.
The definition of massing in Article 12 illustrates the application
of design techniques to reduce the visual perception of size and
integrate larger buildings with pre-existing smaller buildings.
b. Subsection 3.2.14(d)(1) shall not apply to development on
parcels where multifamily structures are an allowable use and
the development contains two or more affordable housing units
for families or individuals with incomes below eighty percent
(80%) of the area median income.
2. On new streets, allowable building and lot types will establish the
development pattern.
(e) Design Provisions.
1. Every building shall share a frontage line with a street, or urban open

space; lots fronting directly onto an urban open space (i.e., without
intervening street) shall be provided rear alley access.
2. New construction favors general office uses, with accessory retail,
personal services, restaurant, and similar uses located at street level and
residential uses permitted on third and higher floors.
3. Notwithstanding the height restrictions of Article 4, Building and Lot
Types, new buildings in the Transit Oriented Employment district are
limited to seven stories or 80 feet in height, whichever is greater.
Minimum building height is 26 feet, measured at the leave line.
4. Minimum permitted Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is .35; preferred FAR will
range from .5 to 1.5.
