TYPES OF USES WITHIN DISTRICTS.\n8.2.1. Regulations for each district shall be enforced and interpreted according to the following\nrules:\na)\nUses by Right. All uses listed as permitted uses are permitted by right according to the\nterms of this ordinance.\nb) Uses with Conditions.

OUTDOOR LIGHTING\n10.31. PURPOSE.\nSufficient outdoor lighting at night increases safety, enhances the County's night time character, and helps\nprovide security. New lighting technologies have produced lights that are extremely powerful, and these\ntypes of lights may be improperly installed so that they create problems of excessive glare, light trespass,\nand higher energy use. Appropriately regulated, and properly installed, outdoor lighting will contribute\nto the safety and welfare of the residents of the County.\n10.32.

When an ordinance \"grandfathers\" a luminaire, it means that such\nalready-existing outdoor lighting does not need to be changed unless a specified period is\nspecified for adherence to the code.\nHeight of Luminaire: The height of a luminaire shall be the vertical distance from the ground directly\nbelow the centerline of the luminaire to the lowest direct-light-emitting part of the luminaire.\nIndirect Light: Direct light that has been reflected or has scattered off of other surfaces.\nLamp: The component of a luminaire that produces the actual light.\nLight Trespass: The shining of light produced by a luminaire beyond the boundaries of the property on\nwhich it is located.\n10-35\nArticle 10, Scotland County Zoning Ordinance\nAdopted 4/4/2022\n"}, {"page": "263", "text": "Article 10 - Off-Street Parking and Loading, Signs, Landscaping and Buffering, Outdoor Lighting\nLumen: A unit of luminous flux.

A vested right for a site specific vesting plan shall remain vested for a period\nof two years. This vesting shall not be extended by any amendments or modifications\nto a site specific vesting plan unless expressly provided by the County. The County\nmay provide that rights regarding a site specific vesting plan shall be vested for a\nperiod exceeding two years, but not exceeding five years, if warranted by the size\nand phasing of development, the level of investment, the need for the development,\neconomic cycles, and market conditions or other considerations.
