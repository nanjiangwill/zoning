Upon issuance of a development approval, the statutory\nvesting granted in section 21-11(b)(1) for a development project is effective upon filing\nof the application in accordance with section 21-11(a), for so long as the permit remains\nvalid pursuant to law. Unless otherwise specified in this chapter all development\napprovals expire one (1) year after issuance unless work has substantially commenced.\nFor the purposes of this section, a permit is issued either in the ordinary course of\nbusiness by planning staff or as a court directive.\nUnless a longer vesting period is provided herein, the statutory vesting granted by this\nsection, once established, expires for an uncompleted development project or a non-\nconforming use of property if development work or property use is intentionally and\nvoluntarily discontinued for a period of twenty-four (24) consecutive months. The\ntwenty-four (24) month discontinuance period is automatically tolled during the\npendency of any BOA or court proceeding regarding the validity of a development\npermit, the use of the property, the existence of the statutory vesting period granted by\nthis section, or litigation involving the project or property that is the subject of the\nvesting.\n(3) Multiple permits for development project. Subject to section 21-11(b)(2), where\nmultiple development approvals are required to complete a development project, the\ndevelopment permit applicant may choose the version of each development regulation\napplicable to the project upon submittal of the application for the initial development\npermit. This provision is applicable only for those subsequent development permit\napplications filed within eighteen (18) months of the date following the approval of an\ninitial permit. For purposes of the vesting protections of this subsection, an erosion\nand\nsedimentation control permit is not an initial development permit.\n(4) Phased development plan. A phased development is vested for the entire\ndevelopment with the regulations in place at the time a plan approval is granted for the\ninitial phase of the development. A right which has been vested as provided for in this\nsubsection remains vested for a period of seven (7) years from the time a plan approval\nis granted for the initial phase of the development. For the purposes of this section, a\nphased development means:\na. Contains at least twenty-five (25) acres;\nb. Submitted for development approval to occur in more than one phase; and\nC. Subject to a master development plan with committed elements showing the\ntype and intensity of each phase.\n34\n"}, {"page": "35", "text": "As of 01/17/23\n(5) Continuing review. Following issuance of a development approval, planning staff\nmay make subsequent inspections and reviews to ensure compliance with the\napplicable development regulations in effect at the time of the original application.\n(6) Amendments. Amendments in development regulations are not applicable without\nthe written consent of the owner with regard to any of the following:\na. Buildings or uses of buildings or land for which a development permit application\nhas been submitted and subsequently issued in accordance with section 21-11(a).\nb.

In accordance with G.S. 160D-108.1, a site-specific\nvesting plan means a plan submitted pursuant to this subsection describing with\nreasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel(s). The plan may\nbe any one or more of the following plans or approvals: a planned development\nsubdivision, a subdivision plat, a site plan, a special use permit, or a conditional zoning\ndistrict. Information required for each type of plan or approval shall be as defined for\nthe specific development approval indicated in this or other applicable chapters of the\nRowan County Code of Ordinances. Plans which fail to describe with reasonable\ncertainty the type and intensity of use for a specified parcel(s) may not constitute a site-\nspecific vesting plan. A variance shall not constitute a site-specific vesting plan and\napproval of a site-specific vesting plan with the condition that a variance be obtained\nshall not confer a vested right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained.\n(2) Establishment of Vested Right. A vested right is established with respect to any\nproperty upon the valid approval, or conditional approval, of a site-specific vesting plan\nas provided in this subsection. Such a vested right confers upon the landowner the right\nto undertake and complete the development and use of the property under the terms\nand conditions of the site-specific vesting plan, including any amendments thereto.\n(3) Approval and amendment of plans. If a site-specific vesting plan is associated with\na development requiring administrative approval, a legislative hearing and notice in\naccordance with section 21-315 (1)(a) - (c) shall be provided to consider the vesting\n35\n"}, {"page": "36", "text": "As of 01/17/23\nplan once the development plan(s) has been reviewed and approved by staff.

An approved site-specific vesting plan and its conditions may be amended\nwith the approval of the owner and the planning director if considered a minor change in\naccordance with section 21-58(f)(1). All other changes must be reviewed and approved\nin the same manner as the original approval.\n(4) Continuing review. Following approval or conditional approval of a site-specific\nvesting plan, the board may elect to require subsequent reviews and approvals by the\nPlanning Department to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original\napproval, provided that such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original\napproval. The board may, pursuant to G.S. 160D-403(f), revoke the original approval for\nfailure to comply with applicable terms and conditions of the original approval or\napplicable regulation.\n(5) Duration and termination of vested right.\na.\nA vested right for a site-specific vesting plan remains vested for a default\nperiod of two (2) years or up to five (5) years if warranted by the size and phasing\nof development, the level of investment, the need for the development, economic\ncycles, and market conditions, or other considerations as determined by the board\nin accordance with this subsection.

General zoning districts defined; purpose and intent.\n(a) Rural Agricultural, RA. This district is developed to provide for a minimum level of land use\nregulations appropriate for outlying areas of the county. These outlying areas typically consist\nof rural single-family housing, larger tracts of land used for agricultural purposes, and instances\nof non-residential uses intermingled. Multifamily uses are discouraged in this district. This\ndistrict would provide for protection from the most intensive land uses while containing\nprovisions for a variety of home-based business opportunities and other non-residential uses\ndeemed appropriate through a special use permit process. It is the intent of this district to rely\nupon development standards to protect residences from potential adverse impacts of allowed\nnon-residential uses. The most intensive land uses would not be allowed in this district.\n(b) Rural Residential, RR. This zoning district is comprised of areas of the county in which\nmoderate levels of single-family housing has occurred or is occurring. In this district,\nagricultural uses have been replaced to a significant degree with single-family housing. The\nregulations in this district are intended to provide a land owner with an opportunity to engage\nin limited business or commercial activities. Multifamily uses are not allowed.\n(c) Residential Suburban, RS. The purpose of this zoning district is to protect existing residential\nneighborhoods and promote the creation of more residential neighborhoods. These areas are\ntypically near major thoroughfares and have or could be provided significant infrastructure.\nCommercial uses, business uses and multifamily uses are generally not allowed.\n(d) Multifamily Residential, MFR. This district is intended to allow for a wide range of residential\nuses and will be the primary location for multifamily development. This district will typically be\nlocated near arterials or collectors. The development of multifamily developments within this\ndistrict cannot be predetermined and cannot be adequately controlled by general district\nstandards. Therefore specific development proposals for multifamily developments in this\ndistrict shall be reviewed and approved by the board of commissioners. Approval of the site\nplan may include the addition of reasonable and appropriate standards to the site plan. No\nother uses allowed in the MFR district shall require site plan approval by the board of\ncommissioners unless expressly required by this chapter. Additional approval standards for\nmultifamily residential developments are listed in article III.

Special\nrequirements shall be applied to these parks which shall specify improvements to the\npark to ensure the public health, safety and welfare of the park inhabitants as well as\nthe surrounding area. Designation of an area as being in the MHP district provides\ndesign and appearance criteria which are more appropriate for rental manufactured\nhousing and/or spaces, including vinyl or similar skirting, clustering of units and reduced\nroad construction standards. These standards are not applicable to manufactured\nhomes and/or lots located outside a MHP district. This district requires site plan review\nfor development of manufactured home parks by the board of commissioners. This\nreview is required because the use may have particular impacts on the surrounding area\nand the county as a whole. Approval of the site plan may include the addition of\nreasonable and appropriate standards to the site plan. No other uses allowed in the\nMHP district shall require site plan approval by the board of commissioner unless\nexpressly required by this chapter.\n(2)\nManufactured home parks, existing at the effective date of this chapter and registered\nas provided by the county mobile home park ordinance are zoned as conforming uses,\neven though they may not meet the development standards of this chapter. Expansions\nof the existing registered manufactured home parks or construction of new\nmanufactured home parks, approved under the county mobile home park ordinance may\nbe initiated or continue unless no work has begun within six (6) months of the date of\nissuance of a \"permit to develop\" under that ordinance, or work has ceased for a period\nof twelve (12) months.\n(3)\nOther manufactured home parks, which meet the intent of this section by having\nimprovements similar to the requirements of this chapter may also be zoned as\nconforming uses. However, all expansions of any manufactured home park, existing at\nthe effective date of this chapter shall meet all requirements of this chapter unless\nexpressly provided otherwise. Development standards for a manufactured home park\nare listed in article III.\n(f) Commercial, Business, Industrial, CBI. This zone allows for a wide range of commercial,\nbusiness and light to medium industrial activities which support both the local and / or regional\neconomies. The CBI district is generally appropriate in areas identified by an adopted land\nuse plan that recommend \"highway business\" along identified NC and US highways;\ncommunity / regional / potential development nodes; commercial corridors; and existing\ncommercial areas. Areas served by public water / sewer represent significant public\ninvestment to foster tax base growth and employment opportunities for the citizens, which\ncould be served through CBI designation. The CBI district may also exist or be created in an\narea other than listed in this subsection if the existing or proposed development is compatible\nwith the surrounding area and the overall public good is served.\n(g) Industrial, IND. This district is intended to provide for industrial activities involving extraction,\nmanufacturing, processing, assembling, storage, and distribution of products. The district is\nalso designed to accommodate other, more intense non-residential uses which generate\nadverse side effects such as noise, odor or dust. The IND district is generally appropriate in\nareas identified by an adopted land use plan for industrial corridors, potential development\nnodes, locations accessible to rail lines and utility infrastructure, and existing industrial areas.\nThese corridors represent significant public and private investment, which should be identified\nto foster tax base growth and employment opportunities for the citizens. The IND district may\n41\n"}, {"page": "42", "text": "As of 01/17/23\nalso exist or be created in an area other than listed in this subsection if the existing or proposed\ndevelopment is compatible with the surrounding area and the overall public good is served.\n(h) Neighborhood Business, NB. This district is primarily designed to provide rural business\nopportunities typically in the form of small retail, service, office, and light manufacturing uses\nto serve the community's existing and future needs for goods, services, and employment\nopportunities. Standards within the district are intended to promote context sensitive\ndevelopment appropriately scaled and organized in a manner that would not be detrimental to\nthe surrounding area. Development within this district would contain impacts inherently more\nintensive than those associated with uses permitted with special requirements in the RA district\nbut significantly less than those in CBI zoned areas. The NB district is generally appropriate\nin areas identified by an adopted land use plan for rural businesses located on identified minor\nand major thoroughfares and within community nodes. However, additional consideration may\nbe necessary as some thoroughfare segments would not be conducive to NB designation due\nto surrounding land use and / or potential negative impacts such as traffic, noise, and visual\nimpacts. Generally, the NB district shall be two (2) acres or larger. However a lot of record,\nsmaller than two (2) acres may be considered for rezoning to NB if the owner of the lot does\nnot own adjacent property which may be included in the rezoning request.\n(i)\nInstitutional, INST. The purpose of the Institutional district is to recognize and permit the\ncreation of defined areas for the unified and orderly development of major cultural, educational,\nmedical, governmental, religious and other institutions in order to support and enhance their\nbenefits to the community in a manner which protects adjacent residential uses. Trade school\nfacilities teaching a trade, for example truck driving or welding, which have that activity on site,\nshall meet zoning requirements for that use.\n(j) Airport Industrial, Al. This district is established for airport-specific or related businesses that\nwill be located, designed, constructed and maintained in a manner compatible with aviation\noperations. Uses in the Al district tend to focus on manufacturing, transportation, services and\npublic administration with standards designed to promote safety and compatibility with the Mid-\nCarolina Regional Airport Layout Plan (ALP) adopted by the Rowan County Board of\nCommissioners. Any use(s) or proposed structure(s) located on Rowan County property is\nsubject to approval by the Rowan County Board of Commissioners and shall comply with Mid-\nCarolina Regional's minimum standards and applicable Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)\nrules and regulations including FAA 7460-1 Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration.\nProperties owned by Rowan County, NC that encompass and adjoin the Mid-Carolina Regional\nAirport will comprise the district.

Overlay districts.\nOverlay districts are zoning districts, which are applied only in conjunction with other zoning\ndistricts, and may grant additional use of development requirements upon the underlying zoning\ndistricts. The effect is to have both the overlay district and the underlying zoning controlling the\nuse and development of the lot. Overlay districts are applicable on an area wide basis to support\nspecific public policy objectives and as such should be consistent with adopted land use plans.\nOverlay districts may be applied to conventional and conditional zoning districts.

These civil airport imaginary surfaces are established with relation to the\nRowan County Airport runway and proposed extensions of thereof. Such imaginary\nsurfaces are defined in Section 21-4 and shown on the Official County Airport Zoning\nMap dated September 19, 2022, which is adopted and incorporated herein by\nreference. The size of each such imaginary surface is based on the category of each\nrunway according to the type of approach available or planned for that runway.

The purpose of the watershed overlay is to\nprovide for the protection of public water supplies as required by the Water Supply\nWatershed Classification and Protection Act (G.S. 143-214.5) and regulations promulgated\ntherein. The watershed overlays may be an overlay in any conventional or conditional\nzoning district established in this chapter.

Density Averaging.\na. Purpose and Intent\n1. Purpose. Density Averaging provides non-residential developments in\nwatershed overlay districts the option to aggregate density between two\nnon-contiguous properties for the purpose of compliance with the water\nsupply watershed development standards of 21-33(2)(d). This process\ninvolves the allowable built upon area of a donating property being\ntransferred to a receiving property to comply with the built-upon limits for the\nrespective water supply watershed.\n2. Intent. Density Averaging is intended as an alternative method of\ncompliance for built-upon limits within the subject parcel boundary,\nstormwater control measures with High Density standards, or SNIA\napplications for non-residential development.\nb. Eligibility. An applicant may average development density between two non-\ncontiguous properties (i.e. one (1) Donating Property and one (1) Receiving\nProperty) for purposes of achieving compliance with the water supply watershed\ndevelopment standards if all of the following circumstances exist:\n1. The properties are within the same water supply watershed, located\nentirely within Rowan County's Zoning Jurisdiction. Properties located in the\ncritical area of the watershed are not eligible to be a Receiving Property but\nmay be used as the Donating Property for projects outside the critical area.\n2. Overall project density on the collective Receiving and donating Property\nmeets applicable built-upon area requirements (existing and proposed) as\nprescribed in section 21-33(2)(d). Built-upon area received from the critical\narea of the watershed is still subject to the requirements of the critical area.\nBuilt-upon area calculations from both properties including any remaining\nbalance of the Donating Property shall be provided.\n3. The Donating Property must be an existing or proposed tract of land\nhaving sufficient acreage or square footage to offset all, or requisite portion\nof the built-upon area on the Receiving Property. If the Donating Property will\nbe a new tract and it is not exempt under sec. 22-6, the new tract must meet\nall lot requirements except for road frontage.

Rowan County recognizes the important role RHOs offer residents\nand the community in creating business opportunities to fulfill or supplement the resident's\nemployment needs. Standards are established herein to protect adjoining properties from\npotential adverse impacts associated with these uses.\nb.\nDevelopment Standards. All proposed operations are subject to general standards\nidentified in sections 21-55, applicable specific standards in section 21-56, and other\npertinent requirements of this chapter.\nC.\nCombination Use. In addition to the principal residential use, development of a RHO may\nconstitute a second principal use whose occupancy classification is subject to the North\nCarolina Building Code for non-residential use as determined by the Rowan County\nInspections Department.\nd. Change in Operation. RHOs permitted to comply with the provisions of section 21-55(2)\nshall be classified as non-conforming if a change in association between the residence and\nbusiness operator occurs. As such, applicants should consider potential investment in the\ndevelopment of land and / or structures for RHOs and the inherent future limitations should\nthe use become non-conforming. Many RHO locations would not adhere to the purpose\nand intent or land use recommendations for rezoning to a non-residential district.\n(2) Specific criteria for uses listed as SR.

There are instances where a rezoning request to a general district would be\ninappropriate and could not effectively be managed by the district's general development\nstandards. As an alternative manner to evaluate such a request, a conditional district may\npropose specific development standards necessary to address anticipated impacts on\nsurrounding properties and the county, establish consistency with adopted plans, and / or\nprovide a clear understanding of the type and degree of future development allowed within the\ndistrict. This can often be achieved by the commitment to a specific use or uses permitted in\nthe conditional district, increased development standards, or site plan details, which are tailored\nto address the aforementioned objectives and sufficient to allow for an appropriate evaluation\nof the request. This voluntary procedure must be petitioned by the property owner or their\nauthorized agent as a development proposal and not for securing early zoning for tentative\nuses which may not be undertaken for a long period of time.\n(b) Applications. Applications for conditional districts shall be on forms provided by the county\nplanning and development department. Only property owners or their authorized agents shall\napply for rezoning to an appropriate conditional district (amended 6-19-00).

Among other possibilities, a nonconforming situation may arise because a lot does not\nmeet minimum acreage requirements, because structures exceed maximum height limitations,\nbecause the relationship between existing buildings and the land (in such matter as density\nand setback requirement) is not in conformity with this article, because signs do not meet the\nrequirements of this article, or because land or buildings are used for purposes made unlawful\nby this article.\n(b) Unless otherwise specifically provided for in this article and subject to the restrictions and\nqualifications set forth in the remaining sections of this article, nonconforming situations that\nwere otherwise lawful on the effective date of this article may be continued.
