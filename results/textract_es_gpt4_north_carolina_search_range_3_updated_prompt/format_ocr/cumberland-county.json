In cases where one of the two signs placed back-to-\nback is larger than the other sign, the calculation of the sign face area shall be based\nupon the larger sign.\n3.\nWhen two identical sign faces are placed back-to- back so that both faces\ncannot be viewed from any point at the same time, the total sign area shall be\ncomputed by the measurement of one of the faces.\n4.\nFor multi-faced signs, the sign area shall be computed by adding the total\narea from each sign face.\n5.\nIn the case of cylindrical signs, signs in the shape of cubes, or other signs,\nwhich are substantially three-dimensional with respect to their display surfaces, the\nentire display surface is included in computations of area.\n150\nJune 20, 2005 County Zoning Ordinance\nw/ Amendments through January 16, 2024\n"}, {"page": "163", "text": "Area = Width X Height\nWIDTH\nWIDTH\nWINDOW\nEMBLEM\nOR\nWIDTH\nDECAL\nCHANNEL\nLETTERS\nWIDTH\nODD\nSHAPE\nSIGN\nEMBELLISHMENT\nTEXT\nWIDTH\nAll display surfaces count toward sign area\nArea = TT X Radius X Radius\nArea = 3.14 X Radius X Radius\nExample: Cube with content on 4 sides\nArea = Height X Width X 4\nCIRCLE\nRADIUS\n3D\nSIGN\nWIDTH\nB.

In\ncases where the sign face area or support structure moves, then the minimum setback\nshall be measured from the closest potential location of the sign face area or support\nstructure to the lot line or other location requiring a setback.\nD. Wall Area Size Determination. For the purposes of determining allowable wall\nsign area, a wall is the vertical exterior surface of a building, the area of which shall be\ndetermined as follows:\n1.\nThe area of all parallel vertical surfaces along a single building elevation\nregardless of offsets shall be counted as one wall.
