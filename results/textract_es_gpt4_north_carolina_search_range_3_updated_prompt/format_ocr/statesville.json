No. 31-21, adopted Feb. 1, 2021, amended \u00a7 2.07 and in doing so changed the title of said section from \"Conditional Use Overlay Districts\" to\n\"Conditional Zoning Districts,\" as set out herein.\nSection 2.08 - Vested Development Rights\nA. Purpose\nThe purpose of this section is to implement the provisions of NCGS 160D-108 pursuant to which a statutory zoning vested right is established upon the\napproval of a site-specific vesting plan.\nB. Definitions\n1.\nLandowner Any owner of a legal or equitable interest in real property, including the heirs, devisees, successors, assigns, and personal\nrepresentative of such owner. The landowner may allow a person holding a valid option to purchase to act as his agent or representative for\npurposes of submitting a proposed site specific vesting plan in the manner allowed by this code.\n2. Property All real property subject to zoning regulations and restrictions of the City of Statesville.\n3. Site Specific Vesting Plan In general, a plan which has been submitted to the City by a landowner describing with reasonable certainty the type and\nintensity of use for a specific parcel(s) of property. More specifically, a site specific development plan must contain, as a minimum, the information\ncalled for in Section 2.08 C.\n4. Zoning Vested Right The right, pursuant to G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 160D-102(33) and 160D-108, to undertake and complete the development and use of the\nproperty under the terms and conditions of an approved site-specific development plan.\nC. Submission of a Site Specific Vesting Plan\nTo apply for a zoning vested right, a landowner shall first submit to the Planning Department a site specific vesting plan. Unless otherwise expressly provided\nby the City, such a plan shall include:\n1. Name, address, and phone number of the property owner (or his agent) and the tax parcel number(s) of the property.\n2. A boundary survey and vicinity map, showing the property's total acreage, zoning classification, general location in relation to adjoining streets,\nrailroads and/or waterways; date and north arrow; scale one inch equals fifty feet (1\" = 50') maximum.\n3. Existing land uses of all adjoining properties.\n4. Proposed use of all land and structures, their approximate completion time for the project or phase.\n5. Proposed location and number of all structures, their approximate exterior dimensions.\n6. A description of all screening and buffering as required by this code or proposed by the applicant.\n7. All existing and proposed easements, reservations and rights-of-way.\n8. Proposed phasing, if any, and approximate completion time for the project or phase.\n9.\nDelineation of areas within the regulatory floodplain as shown on official Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Hazard Boundary\nMaps for the City and extraterritorial areas within the City's zoning jurisdiction.\n10. Traffic, parking and circulation plans, showing the proposed location and arrangement and size of parking spaces and ingress and egress to\nadjacent streets. The driveway/street cuts must be approved by the local District Highway Engineer's Office of the North Carolina Department of\nTransportation or the City Public Works Director for all street connections made.\nD. Processing Application for a Zoning Vested Right\nAn application for a zoning vested right shall be processed in a like manner for a zoning amendment. After having obtained a recommendation from the\nPlanning Board and having conducted a public hearing on subject application in which proper notice therefore was given, the City Council shall determine\nwhether or not to approve the site specific vesting plan and to accord the vested right. The City Council may approve the site specific vesting plan if it has\nevaluated the application and has determined that:\n1. The use meets all required specifications of this code.\nabout:blank\n47/285\n"}, {"page": "48", "text": "6/26/23, 6:20 AM\nStatesville, NC Code of Ordinances\n2. The use will not materially endanger the public health or safety and will not substantially injure the value of adjoining property if located where\nproposed. City Council may stipulate certain terms and conditions as a prerequisite to approval of the site specific development plan for assurance\nin this regard.\n3. The effect of the City Council's approval of a site specific vesting plan shall be to vest such site plan for a period of two (2) years from the date of\napproval. If the landowner requests, however, the City Council may approve a vesting period not to exceed five (5) years from the date of approval.\nThe vesting of any site plan beyond a two-year period may only be authorized by the City Council where it has found that due to (1) the sizing and\nphasing of the development; or (2) the level of investment; or (3) the need for the development; or (4) economic cycles; or (5) market conditions,\nbuilding permits for all phases of the development cannot be secured within two (2) years. A multi-phase development shall be vested for the entire\ndevelopment with the zoning regulations, subdivision regulations and unified development ordinances in place at the time a site plan approval is\ngranted for the initial phase of the multi-phased development. This right shall remain vested for a period of seven (7) years from the time a site plan\napproval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased development. \"Multi-phased development\" means a development containing twenty-\nfive (25) acres or more that (i) is submitted for site plan approval for construction to occur in more than one (1) phase and (ii) is subject to a master\ndevelopment plan with committed elements, including a requirement to offer land for public use as a condition of its master plan approval.\nE. Establishment and Termination of a Zoning Vested Right\nA zoning vested right shall be deemed established upon City Council approval of a site specific vesting plan. A vested right shall confer upon the landowner the\nright to undertake and complete the development and use of said property under the terms and conditions of the site specific vesting plans as provided for in this\nsection.\nApproval of a site specific vesting plan with the condition that a variance be obtained shall not confer a zoning vested right until the necessary variance is\nobtained.\nA zoning vested right is not a personal right, but shall attach to and run with the applicable property. After approval of a site specific vesting plan, all successors\nto the original landowner shall be entitled to exercise such right while applicable.\nA vested right once established as herein provided, shall preclude any zoning action by the City which would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish or\notherwise delay the development or use of the property as set forth in the approved site specific vesting plan except under the following conditions:\n1. The affected landowner provides written consent to the City of his desire to terminate the vested right; or\n2. The City determines, after having advertised and held a public hearing, that material or man-made hazards exist on or in the immediate vicinity of\nthe property which poses a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare if the project were to proceed as indicated in the site specific\ndevelopment plan; or\n3.\nThe City determines, after having advertised and held a public hearing, that the landowner or his representative intentionally supplied inaccurate\ninformation or made material misrepresentations which made a difference in the approval by the City of the site specific development plan; or\n4.\nUpon the enactment or promulgation of a State of Federal law or regulation which precludes development as contemplated in the site specific\ndevelopment plan. In such case the City may, after having advertised and conducted a public hearing, modify the affected provisions upon a finding\nthat the change in State or Federal law has a fundamental effect on the plan.\nF. Review of Conferred Vested Rights\nOnce a vested right is granted to a particular site specific vesting plan, nothing in this section shall preclude the City from conducting subsequent reviews and\napprovals to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval, provided such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original\napproval.\nThe vested right resulting from the approval of a site specific vesting plan may be revoked as provided for in this section. In addition a revocation may occur if\nthe City Council determines that the landowner has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the approval or with any other applicable portion of the this\ncode. The vested right shall otherwise expire at the end of the approval period established by the City Council.\nG. Voluntary Annexation\nA petition for annexation filed with the City under G.S. \u00a7 160D-1012 or shall contain a signed statement declaring whether or not any zoning vested right with\nrespect to the properties subject to the petition has been established under G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 160D-102(33) and 160D-108. A statement that declares that no zoning vested\nright has been established under G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 160D-102(33) and 160D-108 or the failure to sign a statement declaring whether or not a zoning vested right has been\nestablished, shall be binding on the landowner and any such zoning vested right shall be terminated.\nH. Limitations\nThe establishment of a zoning vested right shall not preclude the City from establishing and putting into place overlay zoning that imposes additional\nrequirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations that are general in nature and are applicable to all property\nsubject to land use regulations by the City including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes. Upon the expiration,\ntermination, or revocation of a vested right, all applicable new or amended regulations shall become pertinent to that property subject to a site specific\ndevelopment plan.\nI.\nabout:blank\n48/285\n"}, {"page": "49", "text": "6/26/23, 6:20 AM\nStatesville, NC Code of Ordinances\nStatement of Inclusion\nNoting in this section is intended or shall be deemed to create any vested right other than those established pursuant to G.S. 160D-108.\n(Ord.

Purpose\nVariances provide relief for property owners when the strict application of this Code would result in a particular hardship, and shall be the minimum act\nnecessary to permit reasonable use of the land.\nB. Applicability\nThe Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide all requests for variances. No variance shall allow a use not authorized by this Code or a density in excess of\nthat allowed in the applicable zoning district. The practical hardship must be clearly presented, and shall not result from the actions of the current or previous\nowners.\nC. Application and Procedures\nThe application, with the required information shall be filed with the Planning Department.\nD. Required Findings\nWhen unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of a zoning regulation, the board of adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of\nthe zoning regulation upon showing all of the following:\n1. Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the regulation. It is not necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the\nvariance no reasonable use can be made of the property; and\n2. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal\ncircumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for\ngranting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair\nHousing Act for a person with a disability; and\n3. The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that\ncircumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance is not a self-created hardship; and\n4. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the regulation, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice\nis achieved.\nE. Decision Maker\nThe Board of Adjustment shall review the request for a variance at an evidentiary hearing, duly advertised in accordance with Table 2-1 of the Code, and shall\nrender a quasi-judicial decision to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the request.\nF.

Joint Use of Required Parking Spaces\n1. One (1) parking area may contain required spaces for several different uses, but except as otherwise provided in this section, the required space\nassigned to one (1) use may not be credited to any other use.\n2. To the extent that developments that wish to make joint use of the same parking spaces operate at different times, the same spaces may be\ncredited to both uses. For example, if a parking lot is used in connection with an office building on Monday through Friday but is generally ninety\npercent (90%) vacant on the weekends, another development that operates only on weekends could be credited with ninety percent (90%) of the\nspaces on that lot. Or, if a church parking lot is generally occupied only to fifty percent (50%) of capacity on days other than Sunday, another\ndevelopment could make use of fifty percent (50%) of the church lot's spaces on those other days.\nH. Satellite Parking\n1. If the number of off-street parking spaces required by this ordinance cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot where the principal use\nassociated with these parking spaces is located, then spaces may be provided on adjacent or nearby lots in accordance with the provisions of this\nsection.

Satellite parking spaces intended for employee\nuse may be located within any reasonable distance.\n3. The developer wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this section must present satisfactory written evidence that he has the permission of\nthe owner or other person in charge of the satellite parking spaces to use such spaces. The developer must also sign an acknowledgement that the\ncontinuing validity of his permit depends upon his continuing ability to provide the requisite number of parking spaces.\n4. All such off-street parking areas located in a Residential (R) district shall require the issuance of a Special Use Permit by the City Council in\naccordance with the following section.\nI. Number of Required Off-Street Parking Spaces\nThe number of required off-street parking spaces shall be as set forth in the Table 6-4.\nJ.

Purpose and Applicability\nThe purpose of this article is to ensure that the physical characteristics of proposed development are compatible when considered within the context of the\nsurrounding area. Guidelines should be read in conjunction with the general development regulations and zone-specific standards. This section does not apply to\nthe CB, CBP, HD, LI or HI zoning districts.\nB. General Compatibility Requirement\nAll development subject to this article shall be compatible with the established architectural character of the city by using a design that is complementary to\npredominant architectural styles, designs, and forms. Compatibility shall be achieved through techniques such as the repetition of roof lines, the use of similar\nproportions in building mass and outdoor spaces, similar relationships to the street, similar window and door patterns, and the use of building materials that\nhave color, shades, and textures similar to those existing in the immediate area of the proposed development.\nC. General Principals Site\nThe environmental/architectural inventory shall be the foundation on which all site design decisions are based. Minor variations to these regulations may occur\nbased on environmental/architectural conditions at the site. The Planning Director shall approve all site design decisions based on the inventory.\nD. Building Relocation to Surrounding Properties\nabout:blank\n201/285\n"}, {"page": "202", "text": "6/26/23, 6:20 AM\nStatesville, NC Code of Ordinances\nBuildings shall not significantly overshadow secluded private open spaces or main public area windows into adjacent buildings, ensure no significant loss of\namenity to adjacent dwellings, open space or streetscape. Buildings shall not significantly block scenic vistas from public view. Active recreation and service areas\nshall be located away from secluded private open spaces on adjacent buildings.\nE. Building Aesthetics, Purpose\nBuilding aesthetics establish a base criteria related to the appearance of specific structures. These regulations strike a balance between creativity and\ninnovation on one hand, while avoiding obtrusive, incongruous structures on the other. The City strongly discourages architectural styles that do not build upon\nand promote the existing character of the City. The City supports the view that inspiring, well-maintained, and harmonious development is in the best economic\ndevelopment interests of all residents and businesses.\nF. Building Design\n1. Emphasize Human Scale\nBuilding design shall emphasize a human scale at ground level, at entryways and along street frontages through the creative use of windows, doors,\ncolumns, canopies, and awnings.\n2. Major Building Design Features Proportional\nMajor building design features, such as windows, doors, leaves, and parapets shall be designed to be in proportion to one another.\n3. Structural Lines Retained at Storefront Level\nThe structural lines of a building and its materials shall be retained at the storefront level. For instance, brick piers and columns shall be carried\ndown to street level.\n4. Awnings and Canopies\nAwnings and canopies shall complement the color and material of the building to which they are fixed.\n5. Massing\nA single, large, dominant building mass shall be avoided. Where large structures are required, mass should be broken up through the use of\nsetbacks, projecting and recessed elements, and similar design techniques. Roofline offsets shall be provided to lend an architectural interest and\nvariety to the massing of a building and to relieve the effect of a single long roof.\nG. Avoiding Monotony in Design\nMonotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided by varying detail, form, and siting to the maximum extent practicable, within the\nstandards set forth in this article, to provide visual interest.\nH. Harmony of Design\n1. Purpose\nThe purpose of this section is to achieve good design, not a certain stylistic result. It will also establish a consistent framework for assessing\nproposed development, to protect the visual pattern of the community, and to promote harmony in the visual relationships and transitions\nbetween new and older buildings. New buildings shall respect the scale, form, and proportion of existing development. This can be done by\nrepeating building lines and surface treatments and by requiring some uniformity of detail, scale, proportion, texture, materials, color, and building\nform.\n2. Building Materials\nBuilding materials shall either be similar to the materials already being used in the neighborhood or, if dissimilar materials are being proposed,\nother characteristics such as scale and proportions, form, architectural detailing, color, and texture, shall be utilized to ensure that enough\nsimilarity exists for the building to be compatible, despite the differences in materials. All sides of the building shall use materials consistent with\nthose on the front if visible from public streets, public parking and/or drive-thru areas, and should be carefully designed with similar detailing,\ncompatible quality, and compatible materials. Materials used only on one (1) face of a structure which gives the impression of thinness and\nartificiality are prohibited.\n3. Similar Size and Height for Infill Development\nNew Infill development shall either be similar in size and height or, if larger, be articulated and subdivided into massing that is proportional to the\nmass and scale of other structures on the same block, or if no buildings exist thereon, then on adjoining blocks.\n4. Unify Individual Storefronts\nIf several storefronts are located in one (1) building, the individual storefronts shall be unified in all exterior design elements, such as mass, window\nand door placement, color, materials, and signage. The unified design should represent a theme, rhythm and/or design flow.\n5. Additions and Renovations\nabout:blank\n202/285\n"}, {"page": "203", "text": "6/26/23, 6:20 AM\nStatesville, NC Code of Ordinances\nBuilding additions and facade renovations should be designed to reflect existing buildings in scale, materials, window treatment, and color. A\nchange in scale may require a transitional design element between the new development and existing buildings.\n6. Varying Architectural Styles\nIn developments with multiple structures of varying architectural styles, buildings shall be compatible by such means as a pattern of architectural\nfeatures, similar scale and proportions, and consistent location of signage.\nI. Architectural Character\n1. Purpose\nArchitectural character focuses on the micro-level details that greatly affect the overall appearance of a particular development. These architectural\ncharacter regulations provide direction in aspects of color, facade materials, rooflines, and the enhancement of entryways. The primary goal is to\ndefine the \"finishing touches\" that provide the development with a sense of permanence, style, and compatibility. The City prohibits proposals that\nhave not taken these materials into account. The City desires that all development be treated as a lasting contributor to the community and as a\n\"good neighbor\" to its surroundings.\n2. Roofs\na. Roof lines shall be varied to reduce the scale of structures and add visual interest. Flat roofs and roof pitches less than 3/12 shall include\ncornices, parapets and/or other detailing.\nb. Roof shape (for example: flat, hip, mansard, or gable) and material shall be architecturally compatible with facade elements and the rest of the\nbuilding.\nJ. Facades\n1. Recesses and Projections\nFacades greater than one hundred (100) feet in length, measured horizontally, must incorporate recesses and projections along at least twenty\npercent (20%) of the length of the facade. Windows, lawnings, and arcades should total at least sixty percent (60%) of the facade length abutting a\npublic street.\n2. Repeating Design Patterns\nFacades greater than one hundred (100) feet in length, measured horizontally, shall incorporate a repeating pattern of change in color, texture, and\nmaterial modules. All elements should repeat at intervals of no more than thirty (30) feet, either horizontally or vertically.\n3. Materials\nBrick, stone, or wood facades shall not be covered or replaced with artificial siding or panels except in residential neighborhoods where the\npreservation of such facades are economically or environmentally impractical. The use of mirrored glass is not permitted.\n4. Exterior Wall Cladding\nAll exterior walls visible from a parking lot or public right-of-way shall be clad with the same material required for the front of the building.\nK. Entryways\nEach principle building on a site should have a clearly defined, highly visible customer entrance featuring no less than two (2) of the following: canopies or\nporticos, arcades, arches, wing walls, planters, recesses/projections, raised corniced parapets over the door, peaked roof forms, display windows, and/or\narchitectural details such as tile work and moldings which are integrated into the building structure. Emergency exit doors, service doors and ventilation grates on\nthe first floor and visible from a public street shall be decorative.\nL. Mechanical Screening\nProjecting elements like mechanical equipment, utility meters, storage areas, trash enclosures, transformers, generators, propane gas tanks and other utility\nhardware on the building, roof or ground shall be screened from public view with material similar to the structure or they shall be so located as not to be visible\nfrom any public view with materials similar to the structure or they shall be located as not to be visible from any public view or from potential buildings, streets or\nresidences nearby. Rooftop mechanical equipment shall be screened. Abandoned mechanical equipment is prohibited and shall be removed.\nM. Color and Materials\n1. Predominant Exterior Building Materials\nPredominant exterior building materials shall be high quality materials, including brick, wood, sandstone, other native stone, aluminum composite\nmaterials and tinted/textured concrete masonry units. Tinted textural concrete masonry, can be used as accent block. Metal with no exposed\nfasteners may be used up to fifty percent (50%) on facades visible from public streets, public parking areas and/or drive-thru areas. Metal with\nexposed fasteners may be used up to thirty percent (30%) on facades visible from public streets, public parking areas and/or drive-thru areas as\naccent materials. Metal siding with exposed or non-exposed fasteners may be used up to one hundred percent (100%) for service facades not\nvisible from public streets, public parking and/or drive-thru areas.\nabout:blank\n203/285\n"}, {"page": "204", "text": "6/26/23, 6:20 AM\nStatesville, NC Code of Ordinances\n2. Colors\na.\nFacade colors shall be of low reflectance and/or subtle colors. Building trim may feature brighter colors. Neon tubing is not allowed as an accent\nmaterial. The use of high intensity colors or fluorescent colors shall be prohibited.\nb.

Findings\nIt is hereby determined that:\nDevelopment and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil\nerosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge;\nabout:blank\n210/285\n"}, {"page": "211", "text": "6/26/23, 6:20 AM\nStatesville, NC Code of Ordinances\nThese changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to public\nhealth and safety as well as to the natural environment; and\nThese effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and well-planned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites.\nFurther, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (\"Clean Water Act\") and Federal Phase II Stormwater Rules promulgated under it, as well as rules of\nthe North Carolina Environmental Management Commission promulgated in response to Federal Phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized areas,\nincluding this jurisdiction, to adopt minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this section.\nTherefore, the Statesville City Council establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law\nregarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge.\n3. Purpose\na. General\nDevelopment shall be laid out to provide proper drainage of the area being developed, including facilities such as curb and gutter, catch basins, culverts,\nbridges and natural waterways. Drainage improvements shall accommodate potential runoff from the entire upstream drainage area and shall be designed\nto reduce or prevent increases in downstream flooding. Stormwater drainage systems shall be separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system\nwhether public or private. The City shall require the use of control methods such as retention or detention, and/or the construction of off-site drainage\nimprovements to mitigate the impacts of the proposed development to achieve these purposes.\nThe purpose of this section is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum\nrequirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution\nassociated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of construction-related and post-development\nstormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure; safeguard the public health, safety and general welfare; and\nprotect water and aquatic resources.\nb.
