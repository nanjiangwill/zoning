within the State in accordance with minimum\nstandards was mandated by NCGS 143-214.5.\n(2)\nThe quality of water in drinking water reservoirs can be affected by human\nactivities including farming, construction of highways and roads, subdivision\ndevelopment, industrial development, and other land-disturbing activities. Types\nof water pollutants resulting from these activities include sediment, bacterial\ncontamination, heavy metals, synthetic organic compounds and low-level\nradioactivity.\n(B)\nThe intent of the Watershed Protection Overlay Districts is to apply a set of regulations\ninvolving land use and, in some cases, structural best management practices which\nprotect the watersheds by reducing the pollution from future development which enters\ndrinking water supplies.\n(1)\nLand use management practices involve minimum lot size and impervious\nsurface restrictions, since impervious surfaces such as roads, roof tops and\ndriveways are a major source of pollution.\n(2)\nStructural best management practices allow for more intensive land use by\nproviding for temporary detention of stormwater runoff so that pollutants may\nsettle.\n4.2.2 Applicability\n(A)\nThe Watershed Protection Overlay Districts as established herein overlay other zoning\ndistricts established in this Ordinance.

The Stoney Creek Basin Small Area Plan and Map was adopted by the\nOrange County Board of Commissioners on August 5, 1996.\n(B)\nWith Other Regulations\nExcept for certain provisions as specified in Section 4.7.4, all other regulations for the\nunderlying zoning districts are applicable.\n4.7.3 Land Use Intensities\nThree levels of land use intensity are contained in the Stoney Creek Basin Small Area Plan.\nThese areas are designated in the Plan as lower, intermediate, and higher intensity areas, which\nare identified, respectively, as Lower Intensity, Intermediate Intensity, and Higher Intensity\nDevelopment Areas within the Stoney Creek Basin Overlay Zoning District.\n(A)\nLower Intensity Development Area\nThe Lower Intensity Development Area includes land designated as lower intensity area\nin the Stoney Creek Basin Small Area Plan. The Lower Intensity area best typifies the\narea's remaining rural character and is proposed to have the lowest average\ndevelopment densities in the future. The current character of the area is residential\ndevelopment on relatively large lots, with a considerable number consisting of large\nundeveloped tracts (both open and forested), and active farm land. The Lower Intensity\narea lies mostly in the central and southern part of the study area. A portion also extends\nnorth to I-85 in the undeveloped area east of Strayhorn Hills. It contains 2502 acres, 725\nof which are contained in Duke Forest or the Stoney Creek wildlife corridor.\n(B)\nIntermediate Intensity Development Area\nThe Intermediate Intensity Development Area includes land designated as intermediate\nintensity area in the Stoney Creek Basin Small Area Plan. The Intermediate Intensity\narea is intended to provide a transition between higher and lower intensity areas. It is\nenvisioned as being predominantly residential with density being determined in large part\nby the character of existing development. The Intermediate Intensity area contains 1205\nacres, and includes the existing residential developments of Strayhorn Hills and\nWyngate, areas bordering University Station Road along the eastern side of the Plan\narea, and area west of NC 86 adjacent to the I-40/Old NC 86 Economic Development\nDistrict.\n(C)\nHigher Intensity Development Area\nThe Higher Intensity Development Area includes land designated as higher intensity area\nin the Stoney Creek Basin Small Area Plan and is generally synonymous with areas\nOrange County, North Carolina - Unified Development Ordinance\nPage 4-20\n"}, {"page": "228", "text": "Article 4: Overlay Zoning Districts\nSection 4.7: Stoney Creek Basin\ndesignated in the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan as Ten- or Twenty-Year\nTransition Area.

This\nresults in additional stormwater runoff flowing directly into streams and other water bodies.\nBecause this additional direct stormwater runoff has not been filtered through the soil, pollutants\nfrom the air and land surface enter streams and increase the potential for pollution of\nhydrologically connected aquatic ecosystems and drinking water supplies.\n6.14.2 Purpose\nIt has been determined that proper management of construction-related and post-development\nstormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure;\nsafeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare; and protect water and aquatic\nresources. The purpose of the Board of County Commissioners in adopting stormwater\nmanagement regulations is to protect the water quality of the streams that lie within Orange\nCounty by reducing and controlling stormwater runoff and addressing nutrient reductions for both\nnew and existing development.\n6.14.3 Jurisdiction-Wide and Inter-Local Approaches\n(A)\nOrange County shall have the option of implementing jurisdiction-wide and/or inter-local\napproaches to control stormwater runoff and achieve nutrient reductions.\n(B)\nAny jurisdiction-wide and/or inter-local approaches must be approved by the Orange\nCounty Board of Commissioners, and the North Carolina Environmental Management\nCommission before implementation.\n6.14.4 General Methods\nThe following general approaches shall be utilized to minimize the effects of stormwater pollution\non hydrologically connected aquatic ecosystems and drinking water supplies in Orange County:\n(A)\nNon-Structural Methods\nOrange County, North Carolina - Unified Development Ordinance\nPage 6-96\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \n(1)\nCELL (2, 2): \nThe stormwater run-off generated by one inch of rain from all project area\nsurfaces shall be controlled to the extent possible through on-site infiltration and\nthrough the use of methods which rely on natural soil properties for absorption\nand treatment.\nCELL (3, 1): \n(2)\nCELL (3, 2): \nStormwater runoff from roads, parking lots, and/or sidewalks shall be directed to\nundisturbed areas through use of berms, grassed diversion ditches or swales, or\nother acceptable means to reduce stormwater runoff velocity and volume, and\nfilter out pollutants.\nCELL (4, 1): \n(3)\nCELL (4, 2): \nImpervious Surface Limits\nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \n(a)\nIn order to promote infiltration of stormwater runoff into the soil and\nminimize direct and immediate runoff into streams and water supply\nimpoundments, the maximum percentage of the total lot area which may\nbe covered with an impervious surface shall be specified.

Where the subdivider clearly provides\nbenefits such as enhancing entrances or streetscapes off an adjoining public\nroad, saving trees, providing large lots, reducing disturbance, and \"fitting\" lots\nbetter into their natural surroundings, the Planning Department, Planning Board,\nand Board of County Commissioners may permit the use of private roads.\n(2)\nThe County is concerned about the logical and safe extension of public roads\nthroughout the County and notes that private roads cannot be served by school\nbuses and sometimes not by rescue squads and fire trucks. Private roads are\ngenerally unpaved and property owners who use the road are solely responsible\nfor maintenance of the road.\n(3)\nThe County will approve only private roads where the \"benefits\" outweigh the\nnegative aspects.\n(4)\nPrivate roads shall never be approved simply to save money.\n(5)\nPrivate roads are a privilege, and not a right, and must be justified by the\nparticular lot arrangement and benefits provided by each development.\n(B)\nGeneral Requirements\n(1)\nPrivate Roads serve lots within subdivisions that do not have access to state-\nmaintained roads.\n(2)\nPrivate Roads ensure that all lots have documented legal right-of-way and\nprovide adequate access for residents and emergency vehicles.\n(3)\nPrivate Roads may be allowed in a subdivision where, in the judgment of the\nPlanning Board and with the approval of the Board of County Commissioners, it\nis found that the nature and location of the subdivision are such that a private\nroad is justified.\nOrange County, North Carolina - Unified Development Ordinance\nPage 7-16\n"}, {"page": "534", "text": "Article 7: Subdivisions\nSection 7.8: Access and Roadways\n(a)\nIn determining whether to permit Private Roads in subdivisions, the\ndesign features contained in subsection (F)(5) of this Section shall be\nconsidered.\n(b)\nIt is the responsibility of the subdivider to supply a written statement\njustifying the reasons for Private Roads in the proposed subdivision.\n(4)\nAfter approval of, and initial construction of the Private Road, maintenance must\nbe provided by the property owners of lots located along the road.
