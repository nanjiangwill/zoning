The following are some of the purposes for zoning:\nTo be in accordance with and to achieve the objectives outlined in the comprehensive plan;\nTo lessen congestion in the streets;\nTo secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers;\nTo promote health and the general welfare;\nTo provide adequate light and air;\nTo prevent the overcrowding of land;\nTo avoid undue concentration of population;\nTo provide for each type of community development-more specifically, to facilitate the\nadequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public\nrequirements;\nTo utilize land uses in the community in such a way as to be beneficial on both an individual\nlevel and a community level;\nTo promote, maintain, or restrain an appropriate intensity or density of development in\neach area at a level which can be satisfactorily serviced by such public facilities as the street,\nschool, recreation, and utilities systems;\nabout:blank\n5/281\n"}, {"page": "6", "text": "6/26/23, 8:05 AM\nGranite Quarry, NC Code of Ordinances\nTo protect and stabilize property values; and\nTo preserve the natural environment and beauty of the community.\nB. Further, the regulations are to be made with reasonable consideration, among other things, to\nthe character of the district and its unique suitability for particular uses, and with a view to\nconserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout\nthe town's territorial jurisdiction.\n3.1.3 Zoning District Authority.\nA. In accordance with the requirement of NCGS [G.S.] 160D-703 that zoning regulation be by\ndistricts, the Town, as shown on the Zoning Map accompanying this Ordinance, is hereby\ndivided into districts which shall be governed by all of the uniform use and dimensional\nrequirements of this Ordinance.\nB. Zoning divides a town's territorial jurisdiction into districts, or zones, of any number, shape, and\narea that may be deemed best suited to carry out the purposes of NCGS [G.S.] 160D-703. Within\nthose districts, the municipality may regulate and restrict the erection, construction,\nreconstruction, alteration, repair, or use of buildings, structures, or land. All regulations must be\nuniform for each class or kind of building throughout each district, but the regulations in one\ndistrict may differ from those in other districts.\n3.1.4 District Interpretation.\nEach zoning district has uses permitted by right, uses permitted with special requirements, and\nconditional uses. A detailed permitted uses table showing the uses allowed in each district. The following\ndescribes the processes of each of the three categories that the uses are subject to:\nA. Permitted by Right. Administrative review and approval subject to district provisions and other\napplicable requirements only.\nB. Permitted with Special Requirements. Administrative review and approval subject to district\nprovisions, other applicable requirements, and special requirements outlined in Chapter 4.\nC. Conditional Uses. Board of Adjustment review and approval of Special Use Permit subject to\ndistrict provisions, other applicable requirements, and conditions of approval. Some Conditional\nUses may also be subject to special requirements outlined in Chapter 4.\n3.1.5 Zoning Map Interpretation.\nThe map entitled Town of Granite Quarry Zoning Map, as adopted by the Granite Quarry Board of\nAldermen establishes the official zoning districts and overlay districts.

The purpose is to provide a voluntary alternative procedure for the rezoning of a property for a\nspecific use. A broad range of uses are permitted in the conventional district. However, there\nare instances where a general zoning district designation is clearly inappropriate for a property,\nbut a specific use permitted under this district and subject to development requirements would\nbe consistent with the spirit and intent of this ordinance. Conditional districts, herein\nestablished, are intended to accommodate such situations. This voluntary procedure is\nintended for firm development proposals, and is neither intended nor suited for securing early\nzoning for tentative uses which may not be undertaken for a long period of time.\nC. Just as there are 11 base zoning districts, there are 11 corresponding Conditional Districts. PUD\ndistricts will only be considered as Conditional Districts.\nCD RR Conditional Residential Rural District.\nCD RL Conditional Residential Low Density District.\nCD RM Conditional Residential Medium Density District.\nCD RH Conditional Residential High Density District.\nCD OI Conditional Office and Institutional District.\nCD NB Conditional Neighborhood Business District.\nCD CB Conditional Central Business District.\nCD HB Conditional Highway Business District.\nCD LI Conditional Light Industrial District.\nCD HI Conditional Heavy Industrial District.\nCD PUD Conditional Planned Unit Development District.\n3.5.2 Applicability.\nA. Property may be placed in a Conditional District only in response to a petition by the owners of\nall the property to be included. Specific conditions applicable to these districts may be proposed\nby the petitioner or the Town or its agencies, but only those conditions mutually approved by\nthe Town and the petitioner may be incorporated into the zoning regulations or permit\nrequirements.

Conditional District\nzoning allows specific standards for a particular use after review and comment from the public. A petition\nto\nrezone a property to a Conditional District shall be accompanied by a site-specific plan.\nB. Within a CD, only those uses authorized as either permitted or conditional uses in the zoning\ndistrict with which the CD corresponds shall be permitted, and all other requirements of the\ncorresponding district shall be met as minimum standards. Such district may further specify the\nlocation on the property of the proposed use or uses, the number of dwelling units, the location\nand extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways and access streets, the\nlocation and extent of buffer areas, and other special purpose areas, the timing of\ndevelopment, the location and extent of right-of-way and other areas to be dedicated for public\nuse, and other such matters as the applicant may propose as conditions upon the request, but\nnot to include conditions not generally a part of land development controls. In approving a\nConditional District, the Board of Aldermen may impose such additional reasonable and\nappropriate safeguards upon such permit as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose\nand intent of this Ordinance are served, public welfare secured, and substantial justice done.\nC. If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these regulations is found to be illegal or\ninvalid or if the applicant should fail to accept any condition, it is the intent of this Ordinance\nthat the authorization of such Conditional District shall be null and void and of no effect, and\nthat proceedings shall be instituted to rezone the property to its previous zoning classification.\nD.

PUD districts shall only be considered as Conditional\nDistricts. The intent of a PUD is to:\nPermit a creative approach to the development of land;\nProvide for an efficient use of land;\nEnhance the appearance of neighborhoods through preservation of natural features;\nProvide for recreational areas and open space where appropriate.\n3.5.3.2 Applicability.\nThe provisions of this section are shall be applied:\nWhenever a tract of land of at least 25 acres is within the zoning limits of the Town of\nGranite Quarry.\nabout:blank\n28/281\n"}, {"page": "29", "text": "6/26/23, 8:05 AM\nGranite Quarry, NC Code of Ordinances\nThe provisions of this section shall apply only to proposed new developments and shall not\napply to any PUD plan which is now fully or partially developed, nor to any such\ndevelopment for which a final authorization has been granted pursuant to the previous\nOrdinance.\n3.5.3.3 Uses.\nA.

B. Findings of fact.\n(1) The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of Granite Quarry are subject to periodic\ninundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of\ncommerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection\nand relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety,\nand general welfare.\n(2) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing\nincreases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses\nvulnerable to floods or other hazards.\nSec. C. Statement of purpose.\nIt is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize\npublic and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:\n(1) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or\nerosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;\n(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected\nagainst flood damage at the time of initial construction;\n(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers,\nwhich are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;\n(4) Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood\ndamage; and\n(5)\nabout:blank\n93/281\n"}, {"page": "94", "text": "6/26/23, 8:05 AM\nGranite Quarry, NC Code of Ordinances\nPrevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may\nincrease flood hazards to other lands.\nSec.

With a mixture of old and\nabout:blank\n271/281\n"}, {"page": "272", "text": "6/26/23, 8:05 AM\nGranite Quarry, NC Code of Ordinances\nnew buildings of various styles and forms, these guidelines will attempt to provide some level of uniformity,\nproportion, and compatibility of the structures, landscaping, walkways and streetscape that will promote the\nform, function, and beauty of our Town.\nB. - General guidelines.\n1. Since the existing buildings in the downtown area are of many forms, building locations, building\nmaterials, etc., these guidelines will be used to create a campus of buildings of complementary size,\nshape, form and function. Rule enforcement will take into consideration how the new building will\nbe impacted by existing buildings and vice versa.\n2. The quality of building materials and finishes is critical to the overall appearance and appeal of the\nDowntown Area. Suggestions of what materials and finishes will be accepted or rejected are\nincluded in these guidelines but others can be approved on a case by case consideration by the\nTown Planner.\n3. Building proportions will be in relative scale to adjacent structures but the impact on the overall\nDowntown Area appearance should be paramount.\n4. Understanding that the appearance of some existing buildings, their parking lots and outbuildings\nmay not currently fit the long-term vision of the Downtown Masterplan but that these buildings and\ntheir business presence are critical to the success of our downtown, Section 2 of this chapter\nspecifies changes that can/will be made over time. Most changes will only be required during major\nrenovations or additions but will be encouraged as soon as possible.\n5. Subjective decisions allowed by the Town Planner in this Downtown Building Design Guidelines can\nbe appealed to the Planning Board at their regular monthly meeting.\nC. - Downtown building design guidelines.\n1. New and Infill Development.\na. Building Design.\ni. Buildings should be designed and constructed to be compatible with neighboring\nstructures. Architectural design and details are important and must be exhibited in\ndrawings submitted to the Town Planner for approval prior to construction. Buildings\nshould be of a proper scale, massing, and proportion. Large masses of wall should be\nbroken by architectural details, offsets or windows.\nb. Facade Design.\ni. The first-floor facade of any retail structure should include large areas of storefront\nglass, glass windows and/or glass doors. For office or institutional buildings, doors and\nwindows will be spaced proportionally to the building. Upper floors on all buildings will\ninclude windows, framed openings and/or architectural details that follow the pattern\nset on the first floor.\nabout:blank\n272/281\n"}, {"page": "273", "text": "6/26/23, 8:05 AM\nGranite Quarry, NC Code of Ordinances\nC. Building Siting.\ni. Where possible, new buildings will be sited to the front of the lot, parallel to the main\nstreet. Parking will be to the rear and side of the building.\nii. Where adjacent buildings are located further back on their lots, some adjustment to this\nrule will be allowed if strict adherence would accomplish little aesthetic improvement.\nWhere buildings are set back from the street for any reason, sidewalks will be extended\nfrom the street to the new storefront by the building owner.\nd. Building Orientation.\ni. Buildings located at the front of their lots will be parallel to the street. Buildings not\nlocated at the lot front should also be parallel to the street but may be canted slightly\naway from parallel if there is a legitimate functional or architectural reason.\ne. Window Requirements.\ni. Glass storefronts and windows should be constructed of high quality materials. The\nglass may be low-E and have internal blinds or curtains and/or external canopies and\nawnings for shading but should not be tinted or painted. Permanent letters may be\napplied to the glass to identify the store name and/or address but windows and\nstorefront glass shall not be used for temporary advertising of products or services for\nsale or rent.\nf. Awnings and other shading devices.\ni. Canopies and lawnings should be professionally made and securely attached to the\nbuilding structure. Their lowest component must be at least ten feet above sidewalk\nlevel.\ng. Signage.\ni. All signs located on or about buildings in the Downtown Area will meet or exceed the\nrequirements found in Chapter 6 of this Uniform Development Ordinance.\nii. Signs will be maintained in a like-new condition. Missing lettering shall be replaced,\nbroken lenses repaired or replaced, painted signs touched up to maintain a good\nappearance.\nh. Building materials.\ni. Materials for a building front, entrance side or any side visible from a public road shall\nbe brick, decorative concrete block, stone, stucco or other similar materials as approved\nby the Town Planner.

It is expected that most roofs in the downtown area will be flat and hidden from view by\nraised facade and parapet walls. If a pitched roof is proposed, the roof will be\nconstructed of standing seam decorative metal panels, slate, tile or highly textured\nasphalt shingles. Gutters and downspouts and an underground stormwater piping\nsystem will route rainwater away from the building.\niv. Color schemes for downtown buildings will be of low reflectance, earth tone, muted,\nsubtle or neutral colors. Properly mixed trim and wall colors are encouraged. Bright,\nshiny, garish, fluorescent, or neon colors and finishes will not be allowed.\ni. Parking.\ni. All parking for buildings in the Downtown Area will meet or exceed the requirements\nfound in Chapter 9 of this Uniform Development Ordinance.\nii. All parking areas for new buildings will be to the side or rear of new buildings when the\nbuilding is sited to the front of the lot.
