In order to determine that there are\npractical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, the Board must find that the five\nfollowing conditions exist:\nA. If the complies with the provisions of the Ordinance, the applicant can\nsecure no reasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of, his\nproperty. Merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit to\nbe made from the property will not be considered adequate to justify the\nBoard in granting a variance. Moreover, the Board shall consider whether\nthe variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of the\nOrdinance that will make possible the reasonable use of his property.\nB. The hardship results from the application of the Ordinance to the property\nrather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardships.\nC. The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such\nas its size, shape, or topography, which is different from that of neighboring\nproperty.\nD. The hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly\nor unknowingly violates the Ordinance, or who purchases the property\nafter the effective date of the Ordinance, and then comes to the Board for\nrelief.\nE. The hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property, rather than the result\nof conditions that are widespread. If other properties are equally subject to\nthe hardship created in the restriction, then granting a variance would be a\nspecial privilege denied to others, and would no promote equal justice.\n(ii) The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the\nOrdinance and preserves its spirit.\n(iii) In the granting of the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured\n205 of 446\n3/9/24, 13:42\n"}, {"page": "206", "text": "Bladen County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nand substantial justice has been done.

In granting the variance, the Board may attach thereto such conditions regarding\nthe location, character, and other features of the proposed building, structure, or\nuse as it may deem advisable in furtherance of the purpose of this Ordinance. If a\nvariance for the construction, alteration or use of property is granted, such\nconstruction, alteration or use shall be in accordance with the approved site plan.\n4.

The existing screen must meet the minimum standards for screening\nestablished by this Ordinance and it must be protected from damage by pedestrians or motor vehicles.\nHowever, the burden to provide the necessary screening remains with the use to be screened and is a\ncontinuing obligation that runs with the land so long as the original use continues in operation.\nConsequently, should the screening on the adjoining lot be removed, the use required to be screened\nshall, at that time, provide screening in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance.\n10.20-10.28 - RESERVED\n10.29 - GUARANTEE IN LIEU OF IMMEDIATE INSTALLATION\nIt is recognized that land development occurs continuously and that vegetation used in landscaping or\nscreening should be planted at certain times of the year to ensure the best chance of survival.

The purpose of this Section is to ensure reasonable certainty, stability, and fairness\nin the development regulation process, secure the reasonable expectations of landowners,\nand foster cooperation between the public and private sectors in land-use planning and\ndevelopment. This purpose is based upon the General Assembly's recognition that local\ngovernment approval of development typically follows significant investment in site\nevaluation, planning, development costs, consultant fees, and related expenses. The General\nAssembly has found that it is therefore necessary and desirable to provide for the\nestablishment of certain vested rights. These provisions strike an appropriate balance\nbetween private expectations and the public interest.\nState Law reference- G.S. 160D-1014(a)\n17.1.2. Permit choice.

A\nnonconforming situation occurs when, on the effective date of this Ordinance, an existing lot or structure\nor use of an existing lot or structure does not conform to one or more of the regulations applicable to\nthe district in which the lot or structure is located. Among other possibilities, a nonconforming situation\nmay arise because a lot does not meet minimum acreage requirements, because structures exceed\nmaximum height limitations, because the relationship between existing buildings and the land (in such\nmatter as density and setback requirement) is not in conformity with this Ordinance, because signs do\nnot meet the requirements of this Ordinance, or because land or buildings are used for purposes made\nunlawful by this Ordinance.\nThe purpose and intent of this article is to regulate and limit the continued existence of those uses,\nstructures, lots of record, and signs that do not conform to the provisions of this Ordinance, or any\nsubsequent amendments.\n18.2 - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS-GENERAL\n18.2.1. Applicability. This Article applies to any nonconformity. There are four categories of\nnonconformities as defined below:\n(a) Nonconforming Lot. A lot, parcel, or tract of land lawfully established prior to the adoption\nor amendment of the Zoning Ordinance that fails to meet all current requirements for\narea, width, and/or configuration of the zoning district in which it is located.\n(b) Nonconforming Site Feature. A feature, or absence of a feature, of a development site that\nwas lawfully established before the adoption or amendment of the Zoning Ordinance.\n(c) Nonconforming Structure. A structure lawfully established before the adoption or\namendment of the Zoning Ordinance that no longer complies with all regulations\napplicable to the zoning district in which the structure is located.\n(d) Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming situation that occurs when property is used for a\npurpose or in a manner made unlawful by the use regulations applicable for the district in\nwhich the property is located. The term also refers to the activity that constitutes the use\nmade of the property. The term includes any pre-existing structure, object of natural\ngrowth, or use of land or building that is inconsistent with the provisions of this Ordinance\nor an amendment thereto. Any use or structure not established legally at the time, it shall\nbe considered a violation of this Ordinance and is not a nonconformity.\n18.2.2.

For instance, the discontinuance of a small portion\nof a nonconforming use for a reasonable or limited period of time, such as the temporary\nvacancy of a single manufactured home in a nonconforming manufactured home park,\nwould not require the entire park to be discontinued.\n18.2.3. Minor Repairs and Maintenance.\n(a) Minor repairs and normal maintenance that are required to keep nonconforming uses,\nstructures, lots of record, and signs in a safe condition are permitted, provided the minor\nrepair or maintenance does not extend, expand, or enlarge the nonconforming aspect. For\nthe purposes of this section, \"minor repair or normal maintenance\" shall mean:\n(1) Maintenance of Safe Condition. Repairs that are necessary to maintain a\nnonconforming use, structure, lot of record, or sign in a safe condition; and\n(2) Maintenance of Land for Safety. Maintenance of land areas to protect against health\nhazards and promote the safety of surrounding uses.\n18.2.4.
