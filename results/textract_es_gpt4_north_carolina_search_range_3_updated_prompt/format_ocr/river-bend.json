Among other possibilities, a non-conforming situation may arise because:\na) A lot does not meet minimum square footage requirements;\nb) Structures exceed maximum height limitations;\nc) The relationship between existing buildings and the land (in such matters as density and\nsetback requirements) is not in conformity with this chapter; or\nd) The land or buildings are used for purposes not permitted by this chapter.\nB. Continuation of non-conforming situations and completion of non-conforming projects.\n1. Non-conforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this chapter\nmay be continued, subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in the divisions\nbelow.\n2. Non-conforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of\ndivision (H) below.\nC. Non-conforming lots.\n1. When a non-conforming lot, existing prior to the adoption of this chapter, can be used in\nconformity with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use, except that the lot is\nsmaller than the required minimum set forth in the town's Zoning Chapter, the lot may be\nused as proposed just as if it were conforming. However, no use, (e.g., a duplex) that\nrequires a greater lot size for a particular zone is permissible on a non-conforming lot.\n"}, {"page": "32", "text": "68 River Bend Land Usage\n2. When the use proposed for a non-conforming lot is 1 that is conforming in all other respects\nbut the applicable setback requirements (see Town of River Bend Zoning Chapter \u00a7\n15.02.047) cannot be complied with, then the Board of Adjustment, authorized by this\nchapter may issue a permit for the proposed use, in accordance with Town of River Bend\nZoning Chapter \u00a7 15.02.175, variance if it finds that:\na) The property cannot be developed for the use proposed without these deviations; or\nb) The property can be developed as proposed without any adverse impact on surrounding\nproperties or the public health or safety.\n3. This section applies only to undeveloped non-conforming lots. A lot is undeveloped if it has\nno structures upon it.\n4. If, on the date this division becomes effective, an undeveloped non-conforming lot adjoins\nand has continuous frontage with 1 or more other undeveloped lots under the same\nownership, then neither the owner of the non-conforming lot nor his successors in interest\nmay take advantage of the provisions of this section. This division shall not apply to a non-\nconforming lot if a majority of the developed lots located on either side of the street where\nthe lot is located and within 500 feet of the lot are also non-conforming. The intent of this\ndivision is to require non-conforming lots to be combined with other undeveloped lots to\ncreate conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein, but not to require the\ncombination when that would be out of character with the way the neighborhood has\npreviously been developed.\nD. Extension or enlargement of non-conforming situations.\n1. Except as specifically provided in this section, no person may engage in any activity that\ncauses an increase in the extent of non-conformity of a non-conforming situation. In\nparticular, physical alterations of structures or the placement of new structures on open\nland is unlawful if the activity results in:\na) An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a non-conforming use; or\nb) Greater non-conformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback\nrequirements, height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as\nparking requirements.\n2. Notwithstanding division (D)(1 above, any structure used for single family residential\npurposes (other than manufactured homes) and maintained as a non-conforming use may\nbe enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so long as the enlargement\nor replacement does not create new non-conformities or increase the extent of existing\nnon-conformities. Manufactured homes used for single family residential purposes may be\nenlarged or replaced in accordance with this division; provided, however, the enlargement\nor expansion in the case of those manufactured homes that have remained vacant beyond\nthe 180 day discontinuance period shall be prohibited by this chapter. This division is subject\nto the limitations stated in division (G).\nE. Repair, maintenance and reconstruction.\n1. Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where non-conforming situations\nexist are permitted and encouraged. Renovation work estimated to cost more than 25% of\n"}, {"page": "33", "text": "69 River Bend Land Usage\nthe appraised valuation of the structure prior to damage and/or renovation, may be done\nonly in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this section.\n2. For purposes of division (E)(1 above:\na) The cost of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the fair market value of the\nmaterials and services necessary to accomplish the renovation, repair, or replacement.\nb)\nThe cost of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all the\nintended work, and no person may seek to avoid the intent of division (E)(1) by doing\nthe work incrementally.\nc)\n(1) The appraised valuation shall mean either the appraised valuation for property tax\npurposes, updated as necessary by the increase in the consumer price index since\nthe date of the last valuation or the valuation determined by a professionally\nrecognized property appraiser.\n(2) It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to supply the town with the\nappraised valuation of the property. The valuation shall include the necessary\ndocumentation to support the valuation.\n(3) The Zoning Administrator may issue a permit authorized by this section if he finds\nthat, in completing the renovation, repair or replacement work:\n(a) No violation of division (D) above will occur; and\n(b) The permittee will comply to the extent possible with all provisions of this\nchapter applicable to the existing use except that the permittee shall not lose\nhis right to continue a non-conforming use, except for those reasons outlined in\ndivision (G) below with a requirement of this division is not possible if\ncompliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where\nthe non-conforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure\nthat is on a permanent foundation.\nF. Change in use of property where a non-conforming situation exists.\n1.\na) A change in use of property that is sufficiently substantial to require a new zoning\npermit (\u00a7 15.02.166) or special use permit (\u00a7\u00a7 15.02.120 et seq.) may not be made\nexcept in accordance with divisions (F)(2) and (3) below.\nb) However, this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed.\n2. If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the\nproperty is located, and all of the other requirements of this ordinance applicable to that\nuse can be complied with, permission to make the change must be obtained in the same\nmanner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot. Once conformity with this\nchapter is achieved, the property may not revert to its non-conforming status.\n3. If the intended change in use is to a principle use that is permissible in the district where the\nproperty is located, but all of the requirements of this chapter applicable to that use cannot\nbe complied with, then the Zoning Administrator may issue a permit authorizing the change.\n"}, {"page": "34", "text": "70 River Bend - Land Usage\nIf the Zoning Administrator finds, in addition to any other findings that may be required by\nthis chapter, that:\na) The intended change will not result in a violation of division (D) above; and\nb) All of the applicable requirements of this chapter that can be complied with will be\ncomplied with. Compliance with a requirement of this chapter is not possible if\ncompliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the non-\nconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a\npermanent foundation. And in no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant\nto this division to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional non-\nconformities would thereby be created.\n4. A change in use to another principal use that is also non-conforming is not permissible.\nG. Abandonment and discontinuance of non-conforming situations.\n1. When a non-conforming use is discontinued for a continuous period of 180 days, the\nproperty involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes.\n2. If a non-conforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance\nof a non-conforming use for the required 180 day period shall terminate the right to\nmaintain it thereafter.\n3.\nWhen a structure or operation made non-conforming by this chapter is vacant or\ndiscontinued at the effective date of this chapter, the 180-day period for purposes of this\ndivision begins to run at the effective date of this chapter.\nH. Completion of non-conforming projects.\n1. All non-conforming projects on which construction was begun at least 180 days before the\neffective date of this chapter as well as all non-conforming projects that are at least 25%\ncompleted in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date of this\nchapter may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits, so long as these\npermits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired. If a development is\ndesigned to be completed in stages, this division shall apply only to the particular phase\nunder construction.\n2. Except as provided in division (H)(1) above, all work on any non-conforming project shall\ncease on the effective date of this chapter, and all permits previously issued for work on\nnon-conforming projects shall be revoked as of that date. Thereafter, work on non-\nconforming projects may begin or may be continued only pursuant to a zoning, special use\nor sign permit issued in accordance with this section by the individual or Board authorized\nby this chapter to issue permits for the type of development proposed. The Zoning\nAdministrator may issue a permit if he finds that the applicant has in good faith made\nsubstantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changed\nhis position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the land use law as it existed\nbefore the effective date of this chapter and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced\nif\nnot allowed to complete his project as proposed. In considering whether these findings may\nbe made, the Zoning Administrator shall be guided by the following, as well as other\nrelevant considerations.\n"}, {"page": "35", "text": "71 River Bend - Land Usage\na) All expenditures made pursuant to a validly issued and unrevoked building, zoning, sign\nor a special use permit shall be considered as evidence of reliance on the land use law\nthat existed before this chapter became effective.\nb) Except as provided in division (H)(2)(a) above, no expenditures made more than 180\ndays before the effective date of this chapter may be considered as evidence of reliance\non the land use law that existed before this ordinance became effective. An expenditure\nis made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure.\nc)\nTo the extent that expenditures are recoverable, a party shall not be considered\nprejudiced by having made those expenditures. For example, a party shall not be\nconsidered prejudiced by having made some expenditure to acquire a potential\ndevelopment site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the new\nclassification as it was under the old, for the expenditure can be recovered by a resale of\nthe property.\nd) To the extent that a non-conforming project can be made conforming and that\nexpenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion\nof a conforming project, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made\nthese expenditures.\ne) An expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant both in dollar amount\nand in terms of:\n(1) The total estimated cost of the proposed project; and\n(2) The ordinary business practices of the developer.\nf) A person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual knowledge of a\nproposed change in the land use law affecting the proposed development site could not\nbe attributed to him.\ng)\nEven though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use\naffecting a development site, the Zoning Administrator may still find that he acted in\ngood faith if he did not proceed with his plans in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the\neffects of the proposed chapter. The Zoning Administrator may find that the developer\ndid not proceed in an attempt to undermine the proposed chapter if he determines\nthat:\n(1) At the time the expenditures were made, either there was considerable doubt\nabout whether any ordinance would ultimately be passed, or it was not clear that\nthe proposed ordinance would prohibit the intended development; and\n(2) The developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures.\n3. The Zoning Administrator shall not consider any application for the permit authorized by\ndivision (H)(2) above that is submitted more than 60 days after the effective date of this\nchapter.

Conditional zoning districts are applicable if the regulations and restrictions of a general use\nzoning district are inadequate to ensure the compatibility of the proposed development with\nthe immediately surrounding neighborhood in accordance with the principles of the Town's\nCode of Ordinances. In these circumstances, a general zoning district designation allowing a use\nby right would not be appropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could, if\nproperly planned, be appropriate for the property consistent with the objectives of the Code of\nOrdinances and adopted land development plan, comprehensive plan, transportation and\ncorridor plans, and other land use and transportation policy documents.\n2. The rezoning process established in this section provides for the accommodation of the uses by\na reclassification of property into a conditional zoning district, subject to additional conditions\nwhich ensure compatibility of the proposed use with the use and enjoyment of neighboring\nproperties. A conditional zoning district bears the same designation as a general use zoning\ndistrict but is a conditional zoning district subject to additional conditions in which limited uses\nare permitted and that are contained in the ordinance approving the conditional zoning district.\nA conditional zoning district allows a particular use or uses to be established only in accordance\nwith specified standards and conditions tailored to each individual development project. This is\na voluntary rezoning procedure that is intended for firm development proposals. It is not\nintended or suited for securing early zoning for tentative proposals that may not be undertaken\nfor some time.\n3. Conditional zoning districts parallel general use zoning districts. Only those land uses (including\nuses by right and special uses as identified as in the Schedule of District Use Regulations)\npermitted in a general use zoning district to which a conditional zoning district corresponds shall\nbe allowed. All requirements of any corresponding general use district and all other\nrequirements of the Code of Ordinances apply to a conditional zoning district except to the\nextent that the approved rules, regulations and conditions included in the petition for rezoning\nare more restrictive than the general use district requirements.\nB. Process required.\n"}, {"page": "75", "text": "111\nRiver Bend - Land Usage\n1. A person petitioning for rezoning of a tract of land may elect to request a conditional zoning\ndistrict for that tract. The conditional zoning district application must specify the actual use or\nuses, and all other development regulations authorized by state law, which are intended for the\nproperty identified in the petition. The intended use or uses and development regulations must\nbe permitted in the corresponding general use district.\n2. The Town Council is to approve or disapprove the application on the basis of the specific use or\nuses and development regulations requested. Development in a conditional zoning district\nrequires approval of a single application similar to a general use district rezoning application.\n3. Property may be placed in a conditional zoning district only in response to a petition signed by\nthe owners of all the property to be included or by an agent authorized by all of the owners to\nfile the application. A petition for conditional zoning shall include:\na)\nA master site plan prepared in accordance with \u00a7 15.02.137 of the Code of Ordinances for a\nMaster Land Use Plan for a Planned Development;\nb)\nWritten supporting documentation that specifies the actual use or uses proposed for the\nproperty;\nc)\nProposed rules, regulations, and conditions that, in addition to all predetermined\nrequirements of this Code of Ordinances, will govern the development and use of the\nproperty; and\nd) A statement analyzing the reasonableness of the proposed rezoning.\n4. During its initial review of a conditional zoning petition, which will follow the process as\nprescribed in $15.02.190-15.02.194 of the Code of Ordinances for traditional rezoning, the\nPlanning Board shall consider whether or not a community informational meeting, to be\norganized, advertised, conducted and documented by the petitioner, would be beneficial to\nmaking project information available to those most likely to be impacted by the proposed\nzoning change. If the Planning Board concludes that a community informational meeting should\nbe held, the petitioner shall conduct such meeting in accordance with the following provisions.\na) The community informational meeting shall be held prior to the date of the next Planning\nBoard meeting at which the petition will be reviewed. The meeting shall be held within\nseven miles of the Town of River Bend.\nb) Written notice of such a meeting shall be given by the petitioner in the same schedule and\nmanner as prescribed in $15.02.191 (D) and $15.02.193 (A) of the Code of Ordinances for a\nzoning amendment and public hearing respectively.\nc)\nWithin 10 days following the meeting, but prior to any further consideration by the town,\nthe petitioner shall file a written report of the community informational meeting with the\nZoning Administrator. The petitioner's report shall include, among other things, a listing of\nthose persons and organizations contacted about the meeting and the manner and date of\ncontact; the date; time and location of the meeting; a summary of issues discussed at the\nmeeting; and a description of any changes to the rezoning petition made by the petitioner\nas a result of the meeting. Additionally, the petitioner shall make available at the meeting a\nroster for all attendees to voluntarily sign so that a record of attendees may be created. The\n"}, {"page": "76", "text": "112\nRiver Bend - Land Usage\nroster shall include a location for attendees to provide their name, mailing addresses, and\ntelephone number. A copy of the roster of attendees shall be included in the report of the\nmeeting.\nd) The purpose of the community informational meeting is for the petitioner to:\n(1) Provide specific information and maps regarding the proposed development including\nbut not limited to a description of the proposed zoning change, proposed use(s) of the\nproperty, the proposed density and intensity of land uses, the location and arrangement\nof the proposed land use(s) on the property, the proposed development schedule, and\nproposed regulations or conditions, in addition to those required by this Ordinance, that\nwill govern the development and use of the property; and\n(2) To receive comments and input from citizens likely to be impacted by the proposed\nzoning change and subsequent development of the property.\ne) In the event the petitioner has not held at least one meeting pursuant to this section with\n45 days of being notified that a meeting is required, the petitioner shall file a report with the\nZoning Administrator documenting efforts that were made to arrange such a meeting and\nstating the reasons such a meeting was not held. The petitioner shall also notify the Zoning\nAdministrator efforts to schedule a meeting. No further Planning Board action may be taken\nuntil the meeting has been conducted.\nf)\nThe adequacy of a meeting held or report filed pursuant to this section shall be considered\nby the Town Council but shall not be subject to judicial review.\n5. Review and approval process. The review and approval process for conditional zoning district\npetitions involves a legislative hearing and legislative decision by the Town Council, following a\nrecommendation by the Planning Board. The review of conditional zoning district petitions shall\nbe undertaken in accordance with the provisions of this section.\na)\nIn the course of evaluating the proposed use, the Town Council may request additional\ninformation deemed appropriate to provide a complete analysis of the proposal.\nb) Conditional zoning district decisions are subject to judicial review using the same procedures\nand standard of review applicable to legislative zoning decisions.\nc) Conditional zoning district decisions shall be made in consideration of identified relevant\nadopted land use plans for the area, including, but not limited to, land development plans,\ncomprehensive plans, strategic plans, district plans, transportation and corridor plans and\nother land development policy documents.\nd) If the conditional zoning district application is approved, the Town Council shall authorize\nthe requested use with reasonable conditions as mutually agreed to in writing by the\napplicant and Town Council and determined to be desirable in promoting public health,\nsafety and general welfare.\n6.

Conditions and site-specific standards\nimposed in a conditional zoning district shall be limited to:\n(1) Those that address conformance of the development and use of the site to ordinances\nand officially adopted plans and\n(2) Those that address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the\ndevelopment or use of the site.\nb) Any such conditions should relate to the relationship of the proposed use to surrounding\nproperty, proposed support facilities such as parking areas and driveways, pedestrian and\nvehicular circulation systems, screening and buffer areas, the timing of development, street\nand right-of-way improvements, water and sewer improvements, stormwater drainage, the\nprovision of open space, the mitigation of environmental impacts, and other matters that\nthe Town Council may find appropriate or the petitioner may propose.\nc) Such conditions to approval of the petition may include dedication to the town or state, as\nappropriate, of any rights-of-way or easements for streets, water, sewer or other public\nutilities necessary to serve the proposed development.\nd) No condition shall be less restrictive than the standards of the general use district or the\nstandards of any overlay district that applies to the property.\ne) No condition shall be made part of the application, or shall be attached to approval of the\nconditional zoning district, which specifies the ownership status, race, religion or character\nof the occupants of housing units, the minimum value of improvements, or any illegal\nexclusionary device; or which states that the use of the property will not be subject to\nregulations or restrictions set forth in the Code of Ordinances which would apply to the\nproperty in any event, such as the regulations for an overlay district which covers the\nproperty.\nf) If for any reason any condition for approval is found to be illegal or invalid or if the\npetitioner should fail to carry out any condition in the written and signed agreement, the\napproval of the site plan for the district shall be null and void and of no effect and\nproceedings shall be instituted by the town to rezone the property to its previous zoning\nclassification or to another zoning district.\ng) The conditions shall be agreed upon, put in writing, and signed by both the petitioner and\nTown upon final approval of the rezoning by the Town Council.\nh) After the town has delivered to the newspaper the notice of public hearing for the\napplication, the applicant shall make no changes in the conditions stated in the application,\n"}, {"page": "78", "text": "114 River Bend - Land Usage\n7. If a petition for conditional zoning is approved, the development and use of the property shall\nbe governed by the predetermined ordinance requirements applicable to the district's\nclassification, the approved site plan or master plan for the district, and any additional approved\nrules, regulations and conditions, all of which shall constitute the zoning regulations for the\napproved district and are binding on the property as an amendment to this Ordinance and to\nthe zoning map.\na) If a petition is approved, only those uses and structures indicated in the approved petition\nand site plan shall be allowed on the subject property. A change of location of the structures\nmay be authorized pursuant to division 3)(8) below provided that the change in building\nlayout does not result in an increase in the number of structures.\nb) Following the approval of the petition for a conditional zoning district, the subject property\nshall be identified on the zoning map by the appropriate district designation. A conditional\nzoning district shall be identified by the same designation as the underlying general district\nfollowed by the letters \"CD\" (for example, \"R-20 (CD)\").\nc) No permit shall be issued for any development activity within a conditional zoning district\nexcept in accordance with the approved petition and site plan for the district.\nd) Any violation of the approved site plan or any rules, regulations and conditions for the\ndistrict shall be treated the same as any other violation of the Code of Ordinances and shall\nbe subject to the same remedies and penalties as any such violation.\n8. Alterations to approval. Except as provided in division (B)(8)(a) below, changes to an approved\npetition or to the conditions attached to the approved petition shall be considered a change to\nthe conditional zoning district and shall be processed as a new conditional zoning application in\naccordance with the procedures set forth in this section.\na) The Zoning Administrator shall have the delegated authority to approve administrative\nminor modifications - limited to no more than 5% total changes to the originally approved\nsite plan.

Review of approved Conditional Zoning Districts. It is intended that property shall be\nreclassified to a conditional zoning district only in the event of firm plans to develop the\nproperty. Therefore, no sooner than two years after the date of approval of the petition, the\nZoning Administrator shall examine and report to the Planning Board the progress made\ntoward developing the property in accordance with the approved petition and any conditions\nattached to the approval.\na) If, following such examination and report of progress, the Planning Board determines that\nsubstantial progress has not been made in accordance with the approved petition and\nconditions, the Planning Board shall forward to the Town Council a report which may\nrecommend that the property be rezoned to its previous zoning classification or to another\nzoning district. If the Town Council concurs with the Planning Board's recommendation, the\nTown Council may initiate the rezoning of the property in accordance with the procedures\ndelineated in this ordinance.\nb) If, upon written request of the developer or petitioner, the Planning Board determines that\nsubstantial progress has been made to develop the property, the Planning Board may\nrecommend that an extension of time be granted. The Town Council, after reviewing the\nrecommendation of the Planning Board, may approve an extension of time not to exceed an\nadditional 12 months. Approval of such a time extension by the Town Council may be made\nwithout conducting a formal public hearing.\nc) If, after the expiration of the original or extended time period, the Planning Board\ndetermines that no substantial progress has been made and the Town Council concurs with\nthat determination, the Town Council shall proceed to: conduct a legislative hearing on the\nmatter to evaluate whether or not another extension of time is warranted; or initiate the\nrezoning of the property to its previous zoning classification or to another zoning\nclassification using the procedures delineated in this ordinance.\nd) 15For purposes of this section, examples of substantial progress may include: the approval\nof construction plans for streets, utilities and other infrastructure; the initiation of land\npreparation activities such as clearing and grading; the initiation of the construction of the\nprincipal building(s); and the initiation of the construction of streets, utilities, other\ninfrastructure or required site amenities.\n"}, {"page": "80", "text": "116\nRiver Bend - Land Usage\nMANUFACTURED HOMES\n\u00a7 15.02.150 NEED AND PURPOSE.\nThe River Bend Town Council recognizes that manufactured homes provide affordable housing for many\nresidents.

Timber Harvesting Zoning Permits shall be subjected to the following requirements:\nAmended 09/19/2007 and 04/16/2009\n1.\na) For tracts of land that are 5 acres or less in size, the owner shall retain a minimum 25-\nfoot tree/vegetation buffer along all property lines, except those adjoining other lands\ndevoted to recognized timber management as evidenced by a \"Forest Management\nPlan\" which was prepared by a forester registered in the State of North Carolina and on\nfile with the Tax Office of Craven County, North Carolina.\nAmended 09/19/2007 and 04/16/2009\nb) For tracts of land that are greater than 5 acres in size, the owner/developer shall retain\na minimum 50-foot tree/vegetation buffer along all property lines that abut a residential\nuse or residential zoning district. A 25-foot tree/vegetation buffer shall be retained\nalong all other property lines, except those adjoining other lands devoted to recognized\ntimber management as evidenced by a \"Forest Management Plan\" which was prepared\nby a forester registered in the state of North Carolina and on file with the Tax Office of\nCraven County, North Carolina.\nAmended 04/16/2009\nc) To the extent practicable, retained trees shall be evenly distributed throughout the\nbuffer area. The buffer area shall also consist of naturally growing understory\n(underbrush) vegetation that has the effect of providing additional buffering. To the\nextent practicable, the understory (underbrush) vegetation shall remain in an\nundisturbed state, to allow for the removal of selected trees in the designated buffer\narea.\nAmended 04/16/2009\nd) Prior to harvest, the boundary buffer area must be delineated and marked with flagging\nor paint and observed by the Zoning Administrator prior to harvest. Trees that are to be\nharvested from the buffer area should be painted at a height of 54 inches and at the\nbase of the tree. In the event that the basal area (total area of trees calculated using the\ndiameter at breast height, 54 inches above the ground on the uphill side of the tree\n"}, {"page": "111", "text": "147\nRiver Bend - Land Usage\nincluding the bark) within a proposed property buffer area is less than 60 square feet\nper acre in trees greater than 5.6 inches dbh (17.59 inches circumference breast height)\n(a standard size for a marketable tree) prior to harvest, then no trees may be removed\nfrom the buffer area.

If no trees are harvested from the property buffer area, then no\ncollection of post-harvest data will be required.\nAmended 04/16/2009\nf) In order to ensure compliance with this section, the stocking in the buffer shall be\ndetermined by establishing sample plot systematically (every 300 feet of buffer lineal\ndistance). Each plot will be rectangular in shape being 25 feet wide for tracts less than 5\nacres and 50 feet wide for tracts greater than 5 acres(perpendicular from the property\nboundary to the edge of the buffer area), and 100 feet in length. All trees at least 17.59\ninches in circumference, measured at 54 inches above ground within the plot will be\nmeasured. The sum of the basal areas of the measured trees will be expanded to per\nacre basis and should exceed 60 square feet per acre in 90% of the plots. If a plot falls\nwithin a non-stocked area such as a roadway leaving the property or in a stream, the\nplot should be moved to eliminate inclusion of areas void of trees.
