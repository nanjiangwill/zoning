Base Districts. Base zoning districts are intended to establish the general character of an\narea through the regulation of uses, lot sizes, density and other development standards\nunique to each district. Base Districts are further divided into the following classes:\na. Residential Districts. Residential Districts are intended to provide for the use and\ndevelopment of land for household living, while also permitting limited nonresidential\nuses, such as civic and institutional uses, that may be developed and used in a\nmanner that is compatible with the residential character of these areas.\nb. Nonresidential Districts. Nonresidential Districts are intended to provide for the use\nand development of land for commercial, office, civic, institutional, industrial and\nsimilar uses of land in areas that are suited for more intensive land uses and\ndevelopment.\n2. Overlay Districts. Overlay Districts are intended for use as a method of implementing\nadditional regulatory provisions that address situations that are unique to portions of the\nTown's jurisdiction, irrespective of the boundaries of the Base Districts. These districts are\nalso intended to facilitate the use and development of land for a unique purpose or in a\nunique manner, where such use or development would not be appropriate throughout a\nparticular Base District. Where assigned, Overlay Districts shall apply in addition to the Base\nDistrict, Conditional District or Special Purpose District that is used to classify the land.\n3. Conditional Zoning Districts. Conditional Zoning Districts are established as \"equivalent\"\ndistricts that mirror the Base Districts in all respects, including permitted uses, density and\ndevelopment standards. These districts may only be established upon application by a\nproperty owner, and are intended for use in situations where the minimum standards of a\nBase District may not fully address all of the development concerns associated with a\nproposal for the use or development of a particular property. To address such situations, the\nConditional Zoning Districts provide the opportunity for a property owner to propose such\nconditions and restrictions, in addition to the generally applicable standards of the Base\nDistrict, as he determines is reasonable and necessary to permit the use or development of\nhis property. In approving a Conditional Zoning District map amendment, the Board of\nCommissioners may also impose such conditions and restrictions, in addition to the\n"}, {"page": "35", "text": "standards of the Base District and what is proposed by the property owner (with their\nagreement), as it deems reasonable and necessary to facilitate the compatible use and\ndevelopment of the property.\n4. Special Purpose Conditional Districts. Special Purpose Conditional Districts are similar to\nthe Conditional Zoning Districts in that they may only be established upon the approval by\nthe Board of Commissioners of an application by the property owner. These districts,\nhowever, differ from the Conditional Zoning Districts in that they are not tied to an individual\nBase District. Special Purpose Conditional Districts are intended to facilitate larger scale\ndevelopments containing a mixture of land use types and intensities where the approval of a\nmaster plan and accompanying regulations that are unique to the district will achieve an\nequal or better result than the application of multiple Base or Conditional Zoning Districts\nwould otherwise achieve.\n5.3 Base Districts\n1. Residential Districts\na. Residential-Agricultural (RA). The RA district is established as a district in which the\nprincipal use of the land is for low-density residential or agricultural purposes. It is\nestablished to provide and protect low-density residential areas for those desiring that\ntype of environment. This district is intended to ensure that residential development\nnot having access to public water supplies and dependent upon septic tanks for\nsewage disposal will occur at a sufficiently low density to provide a healthful\nenvironment.\nb. Residential Low Density District (RL). The RL district is established as a district in\nwhich the principal use of land is for low-density single-family residences, along with\nlimited home occupations and public and private community uses. These districts are\nintended to insure that residential development not having access to public water\nsupplies and dependent upon septic tanks for sewage disposal will occur at a\nsufficiently low density to provide a healthful environment.\nC. Residential Medium Density District (RM). The RM district is established as a\ndistrict in which the principal use of land is for medium density single-family and two-\nfamily residences, along with limited home occupations and public and private\ncommunity uses. The regulations are intended to prohibit any use that, because of its\ncharacter, would interfere with the residential nature of this district. It is expected that\nmunicipal water and sewerage facilities will be available to each lot in the districts, or\na reasonable expectation of service in the near future.\nd. Residential High Density District (RH). The RH district permits high-density\nresidential development. Single-family, two-family and multi-family dwellings\nare\npermitted. The regulations of this district are intended to provide the community with\nareas of relatively high-density neighborhood for residents desiring small dwelling\nunits and multi-family structures.\n2. Nonresidential Districts\na. Office and Institutional District (OI). The OI district is intended to serve as a\ntransitional land use between higher intensity districts and lower intensity districts,\nwhile permitting the establishment of certain moderate intensity non-residential uses.\n"}, {"page": "36", "text": "b. Central Business District (CB). The CB district is established as the centrally\nlocated trade and commercial service area of the community. The regulations of this\ndistrict are designed to encourage the continued use of land for community trade and\ncommercial service uses, and to permit a concentrated development of permitted\nuses while maintaining a substantial relationship between the intensity of land uses\nand the capability of utilities and streets.\nC. General Business District (GB). GB districts are generally located on major\nthoroughfares and collector streets in the Pilot Mountain planning area. They are\nintended to provide for offices, personal services and the retailing of durable and\nconvenience goods for the community. Because these commercial uses are subject\nto public view and are important to the economy of the area, they should have ample\nparking, controlled traffic movement and suitable landscaping.\nd.\nHighway Business District (HB). The HB district is intended primarily to\naccommodate higher intensity commercial uses and facilitate the redevelopment of\nlegacy commercial areas along the Old US 52 Corridor in the Town's planning\njurisdiction.\ne.\nGeneral Manufacturing District (GM). The GM district is established for those areas\nof the community where the principal use of land is for manufacturing, industrial and\nwarehousing uses. These uses, by their nature, may create some nuisances, which\nare not properly associated with residential, institutional, commercial and/or service\nestablishments. These uses normally seek outlying locations on large tracts of land\nwhere the operations involved do not detract from the developmental potential of\nnearby undeveloped properties.\nf.\nLight Industrial District (LI). The LI district is established to provide for industries\nthat, in their normal operations, have minimal adverse effect upon adjoining\nproperties.\n5.4 Overlay Districts\n1. Downtown Design Overlay District (DDO). The DDO is established to provide for high\nquality development within Pilot Mountain's downtown area by requiring adherence to a set\nof urban design requirements that enhance the aesthetic appearance and compatibility of\nnew development and redevelopment projects within the town's vital historic downtown core.\n2. Watershed Overlay (WO). The Watershed Overlay District is established to comply with\nstatutory mandates for the protection of water quality within drinking-water supply watersheds\nby imposing limitations on certain uses, requiring storm water controls and limiting\ndevelopment density.\n5.5 Conditional Zoning Districts\nA Conditional Zoning District directly corresponding to, and having the same intent and basic\nregulations as each Base District is established. Such districts shall be differentiated from the Base\nDistrict by the notation of CD (Conditional District). In addition to the \"CD\" designation, each adopted\nConditional Zoning District shall be assigned a unique identifier in the Town's GIS database that\nconstitutes the Official Zoning Map. Such identifier shall be based on the case number of the Zoning\nMap Amendment by which it was established to ensure that all associated conditions and restrictions\n"}, {"page": "37", "text": "unique to that district are indexed for future reference. Each adopted Conditional Zoning District shall\nconstitute a distinct district with unique conditions specific to that district that are more restrictive\nthan those established for the equivalent Base District.
