Determining Proposed Uses:\n1. The listings of uses in the various districts in this Ordinance, as shown in the Table of Uses,\nTable 25.02, are considered to be specific in regard to the types of uses intended for each of\nthe various districts. In determining proposed uses, the Zoning Administrator shall classify\nthe form and function of the use. When a proposed use is not specifically listed in the Table\nof Uses, the Zoning Administrator shall determine if the use is the same as, or manifestly\nsimilar to, a listed use in form and function. The Zoning Administrator shall refer to the\nStandard Industrial Classification (SIC) Manual to assist in this determination. The SIC\nManual shall serve as a guide in classifying any unlisted uses. If the Zoning Administrator\nfinds that the proposed use is the same as or manifestly similar to a listed use, he shall\nclassify the proposed use as the listed use. If the Zoning Administrator finds that a proposed\nuse is not the same as, or is not manifestly similar to a listed use, he shall classify the\nproposed use as not permitted. In such case, the Zoning Administrator shall maintain a\nwritten record of such determinations.\n2. The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Manual - 1987 Edition was utilized for each listed\nuse and listed in a column on the Table of Uses to the right of the name of the use. It is to be\nused as a guide for the purposes of interpretation by the Zoning Administrator. The SIC\ncodes are used to refer to SIC Classifications, which assist in defining the nature and\ncharacteristics of a type of use. Entries with 0000 in that column do not correspond to any\nclassification in the SIC Manual.\n3. Rental and leasing of any commodity shall be permitted under the same classification and in\nthe same districts as sales of that commodity, unless rental or leasing of that commodity is\nlisted separately in the Table of Uses.\n4. If a business or industrial facility involves two (or more) activities with different SIC codes on\nthe same lot with the same zoning classification, the activities shall be permitted only in\nthose zoning districts where the more restricted activity is permitted.\n"}, {"page": "9", "text": "B. Permissible Uses Not Requiring Permits:\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, no zoning, special use, or conditional\nuse permit is necessary for the following uses:\n1. Roads\n2. Electric power, telephone, telegraph, cable television, gas, water, and sewer lines, wires or\npipes, together with supporting poles or structures, located within a public right-of-way.\n3. Communication towers located on government facilities and structures (all other\ncommunication towers are permitted only in accordance with the requirements of Article\nIII).\nC. Determining Principal Use:\nIn determining principal use, the principal use shall be considered as the primary purpose or\nfunction that a lot or structure services or is proposed to serve. An accessory use shall be\nconsidered a structure or use that:\n1. Is clearly incidental to and customarily found in connection with a principal building or use.\n2. Is subordinate to and serves a principal building or principal use.\n3. Is subordinate in area, extent, or purpose to the principal building or principal use served.\n4.\nContributes to the comfort, convenience, or necessity of occupants, business, or industry in\nthe principal building or principal use served.\n5. Is located on the same lot and zones the same as the principal building or use served.\nTwo or more principal uses may, in some cases, be permitted to occupy the same land or building as\nlong as each use is a permitted use; however, the most restrictive use/activity shall determine the\nappropriate zoning district - see A-4 within this subsection.\nD. Changes in Use:\n1. A substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character or nature of\nthe activity conducted on a lot changes. This occurs whenever:\na. The change involves a change from one principal use category to another.\nb. If the original use is a combination use, the relative proportion of space devoted to the\nindividual principal uses that comprise the combination use changes to such an extent\nthat the parking requirements for the overall use are altered.\nC. If the original use is a combination use, the mixture of types of individual principal uses\nthat comprise the combination use changes.\nd.\nIf the original use is a planned residential development, the relative proportions of\ndifferent types of dwelling units change.\ne. If there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot (regardless of whether\nthat business or enterprise consists of one individual principal use or a combination\nuse), that business or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in\n(even though the new business or enterprise may be classified under the same principal\nuse or combination use category as the previous type of business). For example, if there\nis only one building on a lot and a florist shop that is the sole tenant of that building\nmoves out and is replaced by a clothing store, that constitutes a change in use.\nHowever, if the florist shop was replaced by another florist shop, that would not\nconstitute a change in use since the type of business or enterprise would not have\nchanged. Moreover, if the florist shop moved out of a rented space in a shopping center\n"}, {"page": "10", "text": "and was replaced by a clothing store, that would not constitute a change in use since\nthere is more than one business on that lot and the essential character of the activity\nconducted on that lot (shopping center - combination use) has not changed.\n2. A mere change in status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice-versa does not\nconstitute a change in use. Whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by\ncomparing the two active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period\nduring which the property may have been occupied, unless the property has remained\nunoccupied for more than 180 consecutive days or has been abandoned.\n3.\nA mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in the name shall not be\nregarded as a change in use.\nE. Combination Uses:\n1. When a combination use comprises two or more principal uses that require different types\nof permits (zoning, special use, conditional use), then the permit authorizing the\ncombination use shall be:\na. A special use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a special use permit.\nb. A conditional use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a conditional use\npermit.\nC. A zoning permit in all other cases.\n2.\nWhen a combination use consists of a single-family detached residential subdivision that is\nnot a planned unit development and two-family or multi-family uses, the total density\npermissible on the entire tract shall be determined by having the developer indicate on the\nplans the portion of the total lot that will be developed for each purpose and calculating the\ndensity for each portion as if it were a separate lot.\nSection 25.02 Table of Uses\nA. Categories of Uses:\nThe Table of Uses that follows contains a listing of uses that may be permitted in one or more of\nthe carious Zoning Districts established by this Ordinance.

When selecting new plantings for a particular\nsite, a developer should first consider the types of plants which are thriving on or near that site.\nAccordingly, native North Carolina species should often be favored. However, if an introduced\nspecies has proven highly effective for screening or shading in this area, it too may be a proper\nselection.\na.

Specific requirements for the provision of off-street parking and\nloading shall be provided under this Division.\nSection 50.02 Application of Regulations\nA. The requirements will be enforceable at the time of the erection of any building and/or at\nthe time any principal building is enlarged or increased in capacity (through the addition\nof dwelling units, guest rooms, seats, or floor area\nB. The requirements will be enforceable before the conversion from one type of use and/or\noccupancy to another use or occupancy. If a change in use causes an increase in the\nrequired number of off-street parking, stacking or loading spaces, such additional spaces\nshall be provided in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance; except that if\nthe change in use would require an increase of less than five percent (5%) in the required\nnumber of parking spaces, no additional off-street parking shall be required.\nC. All parking spaces required by this division shall be a minimum of 200 square feet in area\nwith a minimum width of ten (10) feet. Handicap spaces shall be provided according to\nthe requirements set forth in the North Carolina State Building Codes, Volume I-C.\nD. Parking spaces may be provided in a parking garage or a properly graded and surfaced\nopen space.\nE. No spaces that are rented, except as provided in 50.06, or are located on a public right-of-\nway may be counted toward compliance with this division.\nF. All parking, stacking and loading facilities shall be permanently maintained by the\nowners or occupants as long as the use they serve exists.\nG. All parking, stacking and loading facilities shall have vehicular access to a public street\nor approved private street.\nH. Land used to provide required parking, stacking, and loading shall not be used for any\nother purposes, except for temporary events. If such land is devoted to any other purpose,\nthe Certificate of Occupancy of the affected principal use shall immediately become void.\nI.

The lot may be used only for parking and not for any type of loading, unloading,\nbusiness sales, dead storage, repair work, dismantling or servicing.\n2. All entrances, exits, barricades at sidewalks, and drainage plans shall be acceptable\nper the subdivision regulations of the Town.\n3. A strip five (5) feet wide shall be reserved as open space adjoining any street line of\nany lot zoned for residential use and shall be guarded with wheel bumpers and\nplanted grass and/or shrubs, according to the buffer yard requirements of this\nOrdinance.\nSection 50.04 Certification\nEach application for a zoning permit for a commercial, industrial, institutional, or multi-family\nresidential unit submitted to the Zoning Administrator shall identify the location and dimensions\nof off-street parking spaces and driveways in accordance with the requirements of this Division.\nSection 50.05 Combination of Required Parking Space\nA.

Therefore, the permit issuing\nauthority may permit deviations from the requirements of Table 50.07 and may require\nmore parking or allow less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely\nto satisfy the general standard delineated in subsection (D). The permit issuing authority\nmay allow deviations, for example, when it finds that a residential development is\nirrevocably oriented toward the elderly, disabled or other population that demonstrates a\nlesser parking need or when it finds that a business or service is primarily oriented to\nwalk-in trade.
