Purpose.\nThis article provides regulations and conditions for selected uses which are unusual in their\nnature or complexity. These uses may require areas of unusual size, or are potentially incompatible\nwith their surroundings unless special development standards are applied, or which depend on\nsound site planning and design to prevent them from becoming detrimental to the health, safety,\nor general welfare of the public or neighboring land uses.\n(Ord. of 1-19-98, \u00a7 IV)\nSec. 21-52.

Permitted uses with special requirements and rural home occupations\n(RHOs).\nUses listed as SR (Special Requirements) in section 21-113, except those in the NB zoning\ndistrict, which are subject to section 21-65, shall comply with the pertinent regulations listed in the\nfollowing subsections. Site plan approval by the zoning administrator shall be required unless\nexpressly provided otherwise prior to issuance of a zoning permit and such approval shall be given\nif all requirements herein are met. The plan shall become part of the building permit.\n(1) Rural Home Occupations [RHO].\na.\nPurpose and Intent. Rowan County recognizes the important role RHOs offer residents\nand the community in creating business opportunities to fulfill or supplement the resident's\nemployment needs. Standards are established herein to protect adjoining properties from\npotential adverse impacts associated with these uses.\nb.\nDevelopment Standards. All proposed operations are subject to general standards\nidentified in sections 21-55, applicable specific standards in section 21-56, and other\npertinent requirements of this chapter.\nC.\nCombination Use. In addition to the principal residential use, development of a RHO may\nconstitute a second principal use whose occupancy classification is subject to the North\nCarolina Building Code for non-residential use as determined by the Rowan County\nInspections Department.\nd. Change in Operation. RHOs permitted to comply with the provisions of section 21-55(2)\nshall be classified as non-conforming if a change in association between the residence and\nbusiness operator occurs. As such, applicants should consider potential investment in the\ndevelopment of land and / or structures for RHOs and the inherent future limitations should\nthe use become non-conforming. Many RHO locations would not adhere to the purpose\nand intent or land use recommendations for rezoning to a non-residential district.\n(2) Specific criteria for uses listed as SR. The SR standards required in Section 21-55 do not\napply to uses in the residential group from 21-113; Common Sand Mining (SIC 1442); Dead\nstorage of manufactured homes (SIC 42); Co-location of wireless facilities, eligible facilities\nrequests, alternative tower structures, public safety tower and utility wireless support structures\n(SIC 48 (pt)); and uses listed as SR in non-residential districts.\n61\n\nNEW PAGE 62\nAs of 01/17/23\n(Ord. of 1-19-98, \u00a7 IV; Amend. of 12-2-13; Amend. of 4-21-14; Amend. of 10-15-18; Amend. of 9-\n3-19; Amend. of 6-21-21; Amend. of 11-15-21; Amend. of 6-20-22)\nSec. 21-54.

Conditional districts.\n(a) Purpose. There are instances where a rezoning request to a general district would be\ninappropriate and could not effectively be managed by the district's general development\nstandards. As an alternative manner to evaluate such a request, a conditional district may\npropose specific development standards necessary to address anticipated impacts on\nsurrounding properties and the county, establish consistency with adopted plans, and / or\nprovide a clear understanding of the type and degree of future development allowed within the\ndistrict. This can often be achieved by the commitment to a specific use or uses permitted in\nthe conditional district, increased development standards, or site plan details, which are tailored\nto address the aforementioned objectives and sufficient to allow for an appropriate evaluation\nof the request. This voluntary procedure must be petitioned by the property owner or their\nauthorized agent as a development proposal and not for securing early zoning for tentative\nuses which may not be undertaken for a long period of time.\n(b) Applications. Applications for conditional districts shall be on forms provided by the county\nplanning and development department. Only property owners or their authorized agents shall\napply for rezoning to an appropriate conditional district (amended 6-19-00). The applicant may\npropose additional limitations or restrictions that address: compatibility between the\ndevelopment and surrounding area; anticipated impacts; land use plan objectives; or other\nconcerns.

Purpose and intent.\nIt is the intent of these provisions to regulate and limit nonconforming situations established\nprior to the effective date of this article, or subsequent amendments, to prescribe guidelines for\ntheir continuance which will strive to achieve the desired character of the county and preserve the\nintegrity of this article. Any nonconforming situation may be continued, maintained, or expanded\nin accordance with the terms of this section. It is also the intent of this section to provide relief\nmechanisms which may allow the use of nonconforming lots under certain conditions.\n(Ord. of 11-19-01(2))\n*Editor's note: An ordinance adopted Nov. 19, 2001, amended art. VI in its entirety, in effect repealing\nand reenacting said article to read as herein set out. The former art. VI, \u00a7\u00a7 21-131--21-139, pertained to\nsimilar subject matter and derived from \u00a7 VII of an ordinance adopted Jan. 19, 1998.\nSec. 21-132. General provisions.\n(a) A nonconforming situation occurs when, on the effective date of this article or subsequent\namendment, an existing lot or structure or use of an existing lot or structure does not conform\nto one (1) or more of the regulations applicable to the district in which the lot or structure is\nlocated. Among other possibilities, a nonconforming situation may arise because a lot does not\nmeet minimum acreage requirements, because structures exceed maximum height limitations,\nbecause the relationship between existing buildings and the land (in such matter as density\nand setback requirement) is not in conformity with this article, because signs do not meet the\nrequirements of this article, or because land or buildings are used for purposes made unlawful\nby this article.\n(b) Unless otherwise specifically provided for in this article and subject to the restrictions and\nqualifications set forth in the remaining sections of this article, nonconforming situations that\nwere otherwise lawful on the effective date of this article may be continued.

When an undeveloped lot has an area or width which does not conform to the\ndimensional requirements of the district where located, but such lot was approved and\nlot of record at the time of adoption of this article or any subsequent amendment which\nrenders such lot nonconforming, then such lot may be used for a use permitted in the\ndistrict where located, provided that the setback dimensions and other requirements,\nexcept area or width, are complied with. Notwithstanding the above standards,\nsetbacks for nonconforming lots of record may be reduced as provided by section 21-\n332 of this chapter.\nb.\nIn the RS, RR and RA residential zones, only a single-family dwelling or a manufactured\nhome shall be permitted on the nonconforming lot, if allowed as a permitted use in that\ndistrict.\n(2) Lots with contiguous frontage in one (1) ownership. When two (2) or more adjoining and\nvacant lots of record are in one (1) ownership and said lots individually have a lot area or lot\nwidth which does not conform to the dimensional requirements of the district where located,\nsuch lots shall be combined to create one (1) or more lots that meet the standards of the district\nwhere located prior to issuance of a zoning permit.\n(3) Other standards for lot sizes. Nothing contained herein exempts the contiguous lots\nconsidered as a single buildable lot or lots from meeting the applicable provisions of the county\nboard of health regulations or other applicable state standards.\n(Ord. of 11-19-01(2); Amend. of 4-21-14)\nSec. 21-133. Continuation of nonconforming use of land.\nAny nonconforming situation legally existing at the time of adoption or amendment of this article\nmay be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to conditions provided in this\nsection.\n(Ord. of 11-19-01(2))\nSec. 21-134. Conditions for continuance for a change in nonconforming situation.\nSuch nonconforming use of land shall be subject to the following conditions:\n(1) No nonconforming situation shall be changed to another nonconforming situation unless\nsuch use is determined to be of equal or less intensity through a special use permit process\nsubject to procedures established for quasi-judicial hearings. In determining whether a\nproposed nonconforming situation is of equal or less intensity, the board of commissioners\nshall consider the following and determine findings of fact relevant to their determination:\na. Probable traffic impacts of each use.\nb. Parking requirements of each use.\nC. Probable number of persons on the premises of each use at a time of peak demand.\nd. Off-site impacts of each use, such as noise, glare, dust, vibration or smoke and other\nimpacts on surrounding properties or the public health or safety.\n(2) The number of dwelling units in a nonconforming residential use shall not be increased.\n110\n\nNEW PAGE 111\nAs of 01/17/23\nReasonable and appropriate conditions, permit duration, and revocation process identified in\nsection 21-135 (c) shall also apply to this section.\n(Ord. of 11-19-01(2)); Amend. of 6-21-21\nSec. 21-135. Extension, enlargement or replacement of a nonconforming use.\n(a) Except as provided for in subsections (b) through (g), no nonconforming use shall be\nextended, enlarged, or replaced.\n(b) Any single-family residential nonconforming use (which may be a manufactured home) or\naccessory structure associated with a residential use may be enlarged or replaced with a\nsimilar structure of the same size or of a larger size, so long as the enlargement or\nreplacement does not create new nonconformities or project further into the required setback.\nAccessory structures permitted in accordance with Sec. 21-54 or as rural home occupations\nmay only be extended, enlarged, or replaced subject to subsections (c) through (f).\n(c) Any other nonconforming use may be extended, enlarged, or replaced only upon the\nissuance of a special use permit, subject to procedures established for quasi-judicial\nhearings, if the county board of commissioners finds that, in completing the extension,\nenlargement, or replacement work:\n(1) There is no increase in the operational area existing on the effective date of this\nordinance;\n(2) There is no greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as\nsetback requirements, height limitations, or density requirements or other requirements\nsuch as parking, loading and landscaping requirements; and\n(3) There is no significant adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or\nsafety including but not limited to no increase in the level of noise, dust, odor, glare or\nother nuisances.\nIn issuing a special use permit, the board of commissioners may affix other reasonable and\nappropriate conditions such as, but not limited to, landscaping and buffering to separate\ndissimilar uses or to screen parking and loading areas. If approved, a special use permit\nshall expire two (2) years from the date of issuance if the work authorized by the permit has\nnot substantially commenced unless a vesting period longer than two (2) years is granted in\naccordance with section 21-11. Revocations may be considered in accordance with the\nprocess identified in section 21-58 (j) and this subsection.\n(d) A nonconforming situation may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building\nthat, when the use therein was made nonconforming by this article, was manifestly designed\nor arranged to accommodate such use. However, a nonconforming situation may not be\nextended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building unless specifically\nauthorized in accordance with subsection (c). In addition, the level of noise, dirt, odor, glare\nor other nuisance shall not increase.\n(e) A nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was\noccupied by that use when it became nonconforming, except that a use that involves the\nremoval of natural materials from the lot (e.g., a sand pit) may be expanded to the limits of\nthe site plan upon which the mining permit was granted if such permit was obtained in\ncompliance with all applicable laws and ordinances in effect at the time of approval.\n(f) The volume, intensity, or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming use exists may\nbe increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming use\nexists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of\n111\n", "page_number": 109, "page_range": [109, 110, 111], "highlight": ["10): \nNonresidential\nCELL (2, 11): \nCELL (2, 12): \nCELL (3, 1): \nSIC\nCELL (3, 2): \nUse\nCELL (3, 3): \n<em>RA</em>", "In the RS, RR and <em>RA</em> residential zones, only a single-family dwelling or a manufactured\nhome shall be", "<em>Parking</em> <em>requirements</em> of each use.\nC."], "score": 4.9819107, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Rural Agricultural\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RA\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RA\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RA\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking space for each\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [60, 61, 62, 91, 92, 93, 94, 101, 102, 103, 109, 110, 111]}
