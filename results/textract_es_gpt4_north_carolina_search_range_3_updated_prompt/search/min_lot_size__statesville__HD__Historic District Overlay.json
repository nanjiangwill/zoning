this\nSection.\n(b) When floodway or non-encroachment area data is available from a Federal, State, or other source, all new construction and substantial\nimprovements within floodway and non-encroachment areas shall also comply with the requirements of this Section.\n(c) All subdivision, manufactured home park and other development proposals shall provide Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data if development is\ngreater than five (5) acres or has more than fifty (50) lots/manufactured home sites. Such Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by\nreference in accordance with this Section and utilized in implementing this ordinance.\n(d) When Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is not available from a Federal, State, or other source as outlined above, the reference level shall be\nelevated or floodproofed (nonresidential) to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in this Section. All other applicable\nprovisions of this Section shall also apply.\nV. Standards for Riverine Floodplains with Base Flood Elevations but Without Established Floodways or Non-Encroachment Areas\nAlong rivers and streams where BFE data is provided by FEMA or is available from another source but neither floodway nor non-encroachment areas are\nidentified for a Special Flood Hazard Area on the FIRM or in the FIS report, the following requirements shall apply to all development within such areas:\n1. Standards of this Section; and\n2. Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is designated, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements,\nor other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided\ndemonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will\nnot increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community.\nW. Floodways and Non-Encroachment Areas\nAreas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in this Section. The floodways and\nnon-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris and potential projectiles.\nThe following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in this Section, shall apply to all development within such areas:\n1. No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless:\n(a) it is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood,\nbased on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain\nAdministrator prior to issuance of floodplain development permit, or\n(b) a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon\ncompletion of the proposed encroachment.\n2.

The BFE used in determining the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be determined based on the following criteria:\nabout:blank\n77/285\n\nNEW PAGE 78\n6/26/23, 6:20 AM\nStatesville, NC Code of Ordinances\n(a) When Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is available from other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas\nshall also comply with all applicable provisions of this ordinance and shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with standards in this\nSection.\n(b) When floodway or non-encroachment area data is available from a Federal, State, or other source, all new construction and substantial\nimprovements within floodway and non-encroachment areas shall also comply with the requirements of this Section.\n(c) All subdivision, manufactured home park and other development proposals shall provide Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data if development is\ngreater than five (5) acres or has more than fifty (50) lots/manufactured home sites. Such Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data shall be adopted by\nreference in accordance with this Section and utilized in implementing this ordinance.\n(d) When Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is not available from a Federal, State, or other source as outlined above, the reference level shall be\nelevated or floodproofed (nonresidential) to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation, as defined in this Section. All other applicable\nprovisions of this Section shall also apply.\nV. Standards for Riverine Floodplains with Base Flood Elevations but Without Established Floodways or Non-Encroachment Areas\nAlong rivers and streams where BFE data is provided by FEMA or is available from another source but neither floodway nor non-encroachment areas are\nidentified for a Special Flood Hazard Area on the FIRM or in the FIS report, the following requirements shall apply to all development within such areas:\n1. Standards of this Section; and\n2. Until a regulatory floodway or non-encroachment area is designated, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements,\nor other development, shall be permitted unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided\ndemonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will\nnot increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community.\nW. Floodways and Non-Encroachment Areas\nAreas designated as floodways or non-encroachment areas are located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in this Section. The floodways and\nnon-encroachment areas are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters that have erosion potential and carry debris and potential projectiles.\nThe following provisions, in addition to standards outlined in this Section, shall apply to all development within such areas:\n1. No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments shall be permitted unless:\n(a) it is demonstrated that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood,\nbased on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice and presented to the Floodplain\nAdministrator prior to issuance of floodplain development permit, or\n(b) a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) has been approved by FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) must also be obtained upon\ncompletion of the proposed encroachment.\n2. No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except replacement manufactured homes in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision,\nprovided the following provisions are met:\n(a) the anchoring and the elevation standards of this Section; and\n(b) the no encroachment standard of this Section.\nX. Effect on Rights and Liabilities Under the Existing Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance\nThis ordinance in part comes forward by re-enactment of some of the provisions of the flood damage prevention ordinance enacted September 17, 1979 as\namended, and it is not the intention to repeal but rather to re-enact and continue to enforce without interruption of such existing provisions, so that all rights and\nliabilities that have accrued there under are reserved and may be enforced. The enactment of this ordinance shall not affect any action, suit or proceeding\ninstituted or pending. All provisions of the flood damage prevention ordinance of the City of Statesville enacted on September 17, 1979 as amended, which are\nnot reenacted herein are repealed.\nY. Effect Upon Outstanding Floodplain Development Permits\nNothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans, construction, size, or designated use of any development or any part thereof for which a\nfloodplain development permit has been granted by the floodplain administrator or his or her authorized agents before the time of passage of this ordinance;\nprovided, however, that when construction is not begun under such outstanding permit within a period of six (6) months subsequent to the date of issuance of\nthe outstanding permit, construction or use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.\n(Ord.
