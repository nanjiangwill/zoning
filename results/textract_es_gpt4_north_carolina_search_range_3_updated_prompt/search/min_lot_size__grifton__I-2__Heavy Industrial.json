(These are not precise development criteria, but more illustrations of light\nmanufacturing uses.)\n(C) I-2 Heavy Industrial District.\n(1) This district is intended for areas established to accommodate a wider range of industrial,\nwholesale and related business uses/services than permitted in the I-1 District. Uses here may in their\nnormal operations, have a high impact on the community, particularly adjoining properties. High\nimpact is defined generally to include activities that:\n(a) Are in structures containing more than 50,000 square feet on large lots (five acres or\nmore);\n(b) Employ more than 100 people on any single shift; and\n(c) Conduct some of their operation outside the principal structures on the property with\nnegative external impacts such as outdoor storage of equipment or products, high volume of truck or\nrail traffic, high noise levels or offensive odors or smoke.\n(2) Because of the potential negative impacts, these types of uses generally need to be located\nnear major highways or railroad lines on relatively large tracts of land, away from commercial or\nresidential areas. (These are not precise development criteria, but more illustrations of heavy\nmanufacturing uses.)\n(Ord. passed 1-11-2005, \u00a7 3-3)\n\u00a7 152.098 GREENWAY-RECREATIONAL DISTRICT.\nThis district is intended to accommodate a limited range of uses adjacent to Contentnea Creek that\nare consistent with best management practices (BMPs) within floodplains.\n(Ord. passed 1-11-2005, \u00a7 3-4)\n\u00a7 152.099 FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT.\nThe floodplain district is established to promote appropriate development in the 100-year\nfloodplain that will protect humans and minimize damage to property. As an overlay district it shall\nsupplement, not replace, the underlying zoning regulations. Pitt County administers the Flood Hazard\nOrdinance within the planning jurisdiction of the town. The specific development guidelines are\nspecified in \u00a7 7.2 of the Pitt County Zoning Ordinance.\n(Ord. passed 1-11-2005, \u00a7 3-5)\nZONING MAP\n\nNEW PAGE 35\n\u00a7 152.110 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.\n(A) There shall be a map known and designated as the \"Official Town of Grifton Zoning Map\",\nwhich shall show the boundaries of all zoning districts within the town's planning jurisdiction. This\nmap shall be dated and shall be kept in Town Hall.\n(B) Should the Official Town of Grifton Zoning Map be lost, destroyed or damaged, the\nAdministrator may have a new map prepared. No further authorization or action by the Board of\nCommissioners is required SO long as no district boundaries are changed in this process.\n(Ord. passed 1-11-2005, \u00a7 3-6)\n\u00a7 152.111 AMENDMENTS TO OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.\n(A) Amendments to the Official Town of Grifton Zoning Map are accomplished using the same\nprocedures that apply to other amendments to this chapter.\n(B) The Administrator shall update the Official Grifton Zoning Map as soon as possible after the\nTown Board of Commissioners adopts amendments to it. Upon entering any amendment on the map,\nthe Administrator shall change the date of the map to indicate its latest revision. New prints of the\nupdated map may then be issued.\n(C) No unauthorized person may alter or modify the Official Town of Grifton Zoning Map.\n(D) The Administrator shall keep copies of superseded prints of the zoning map for historical\nreference.\n(E) The official zoning map shall be in a paper, Mylar or digital format.\n(Ord. passed 1-11-2005, \u00a7 3-6)\nUSES BY ZONING DISTRICTS\n\u00a7 152.125 GENERAL.\n(A) Except as hereinafter provided, the regulations set forth in this chapter for each zoning district\nshall be minimum regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or land.\n(B) Buildings, structures and land must conform. No building, structure or land shall hereafter be\nused or occupied, and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed,\nreconstructed, moved or structurally altered, except in conformity with all the regulations specified\nherein for the district in which it is located.\n\nNEW PAGE 36\n(C) Limits. No building or other structure shall hereafter be erected or altered:\n(1) To exceed the height limits;\n(2) To accommodate or house a greater number of families than specified;\n(3)\nTo have narrower or smaller front yards, side yards, rear yards or other open space than\nrequired;\n(4) To occupy a greater percentage of lot area than permitted herein; or\n(5) In any other manner contrary to the provisions of this chapter.\n(D) Yards, open space must remain separate. No part of a yard or other open space required about\nor in connection with any building for the purpose of complying with this chapter shall be included as a\npart of a yard or other open space similarly required for any other building or use.\n(E) Reductions below minimums prohibited. No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this\nchapter shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth herein. Yards\nor lots created after the effective date of this chapter shall meet at least the minimum requirements\nestablished.\n(F) One building per lot. Every principal building hereafter erected or moved shall be located on a\nseparate lot and in no case shall there be more than one principal building and permitted accessory\nbuildings on the lot, except for a planned unit development, planned business development, planned\nindustrial development or multi-family developments.\n(G) Lot adjacent to street right-of-way required. Every building hereafter erected or moved shall\nbe on a lot adjacent to a dedicated public street right-of-way or town-approved private street or drive,\nand all structures shall be SO located as to provide safe and convenient access for services, fire\nprotection and required off-street parking.\n(H) Front yard setbacks.\n(1) The front yard setback requirements of this chapter shall not apply to any lot where the\naverage setback of existing buildings located within 100 feet on either side of the dwelling and on the\nsame side of the block is less than the minimum required front yard depth.\n(2) In such cases, the setback on the lots may not be less than the average of the existing\nsetbacks, but not less than ten feet from the street right-of-way.\n(I) Corner lots. In any residential district, the side yard requirements for corner lots along the side\nstreet right-of-way shall be the same as the front yard setback.\n", "page_number": 34, "page_range": [34, 35,
