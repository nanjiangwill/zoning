However, the applicant must provide documentation proving to\nthe town that the proposed tower does comply with all applicable Federal Radio Frequency Emission\nStandards.\n(G) All accessory structures on the ground which contain switching equipment or other related\nequipment must be designed to substantially resemble the neighborhood's basic architecture, or the\narchitecture and style of any principal use on the property.\n(H) An opaque screen of vegetation shall be required along all sides of the perimeter of the\ntelecommunication tower site. In addition, a minimum eight foot high fence is required immediately\naround the tower and any equipment building(s) with the screening to be located on the outside of the\nfenced area.

(These are not precise development criteria, but more illustrations of light\nmanufacturing uses.)\n(C) I-2 Heavy Industrial District.\n(1) This district is intended for areas established to accommodate a wider range of industrial,\nwholesale and related business uses/services than permitted in the I-1 District. Uses here may in their\nnormal operations, have a high impact on the community, particularly adjoining properties. High\nimpact is defined generally to include activities that:\n(a) Are in structures containing more than 50,000 square feet on large lots (five acres or\nmore);\n(b) Employ more than 100 people on any single shift; and\n(c) Conduct some of their operation outside the principal structures on the property with\nnegative external impacts such as outdoor storage of equipment or products, high volume of truck or\nrail traffic, high noise levels or offensive odors or smoke.\n(2) Because of the potential negative impacts, these types of uses generally need to be located\nnear major highways or railroad lines on relatively large tracts of land, away from commercial or\nresidential areas. (These are not precise development criteria, but more illustrations of heavy\nmanufacturing uses.)\n(Ord. passed 1-11-2005, \u00a7 3-3)\n\u00a7 152.098 GREENWAY-RECREATIONAL DISTRICT.\nThis district is intended to accommodate a limited range of uses adjacent to Contentnea Creek that\nare consistent with best management practices (BMPs) within floodplains.\n(Ord. passed 1-11-2005, \u00a7 3-4)\n\u00a7 152.099 FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT.\nThe floodplain district is established to promote appropriate development in the 100-year\nfloodplain that will protect humans and minimize damage to property.
