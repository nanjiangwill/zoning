Purpose.\nCertain land uses, because of their character and intensity, may create an adverse impact\nwhen developed adjacent to other less intensive land uses. The general purpose of this article is\nto establish guidelines to preserve the value and appearance of property in the county and to\nrecognize that the transition between certain uses requires attention to protect less intensive land\nuses. The goal is to identify land use relationships that may be incompatible and to specify an\nappropriate buffer or screen in order to minimize adverse impacts.\n(Ord. of 1-19-98, \u00a7 X)\nSec. 21-212. Applicability.\nThe buffering and screening shall be adequate to meet the intent of section 21-211, but shall\nnot exceed one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the length of the development activity\nrequired to install the buffer and screening, unless required on a site plan approved by the board\nof commissioners.

Buffers shall be required in accordance with the table in section 21-216 when any\nuse is being developed abutting an existing developed lot, however less intensive uses locating\nnext to more intensive uses shall not be required to comply with the screening portion of the\nrequirements of this article. Where a conflict exists between the buffer requirements for a use\nand setback requirements for a zoning district, the use requirements shall control. The required\nbuffer may not be used for loading, storage, or similar operational area needs that are either\npart of or accessory to the proposed use unless otherwise indicated herein.\n(b) Modification of buffer requirements.

For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a\nnonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section, all of the buildings, activities, and\noperations maintained on the zone lot are generally to be considered as a whole. If a\nnonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a\nnonconforming use for the required period as provided in subsection (a) shall terminate the\nright to maintain it thereafter.\n(c) Existing nonconforming manufactured homes. Existing nonconforming manufactured homes\nmay be replaced with a newer manufactured home; however, the new manufactured home\nshall meet current building codes for manufactured housing as set forth by the department of\nhousing and urban development, unless expressly provided otherwise in this article. The new\nmanufactured home shall be as large or larger that the replaced manufactured home. If the\nspace is left vacant for more than one hundred eighty (180) days, the space shall only be used\nfor a conforming use. If the manufactured home is not replaced within one hundred eighty (180)\ndays it can only be replaced with a conforming use.\n(Ord. of 11-19-01(2); Amend. of 9-6-16)\nSec. 21-138.

Any lot reduced in size by\nmunicipal, county or state condemnation or purchase of land shall obtain nonconforming lot or\nbuilding status to the extent that said condemnation or purchase causes noncompliance with\nany provisions of this article.\n(b) Nonconforming parking created by change of use. Whenever a change of use that does not\ninvolve the enlargement of an existing structure is proposed for a lot on which the parking\nrequirements of this article for the proposed new use cannot be met due to insufficient lot area,\nthe proposed change of use shall not be regarded as an impermissible extension or\nenlargement of a nonconforming situation. However, the permit-issuing authority shall require\nthat the parking requirements be satisfied to the extent possible utilizing the lot area that is\navailable.\n(Ord. of 11-19-01(2))\nSec. 21-139.
