In order to maintain a predominantly undeveloped land use intensity\npattern, residential and non-residential uses shall be allowed at a maximum of one (1)\ndwelling unit per two (2) acres and six percent (6%) built-upon area respectively.\na. Limitations on Certain Permitted Uses\ni. Agriculture, provided that all agricultural activities will be encouraged to\nparticipate in the agricultural Cost Share Program and subject to the\nprovisions of the Food Security Act of 1985 and the Food, Agriculture,\nConservation and Trade Act of 1990. Agricultural activities conducted after\nJanuary 1, 1993 shall maintain a minimum ten-foot vegetative buffer, or\nequivalent control as determined by the Soil and Water Conservation\nCommission, along all perennial waters indicated on the most recent versions\nof U.S.G.S. 1:24,000 (7.5 minute) scale topographic maps or as determined\nby local governments studies. Animal operations greater than 100 animal units\nshall employ Best Management Practices (BMP's) by July 1, 1994\nrecommended by the Soil and Water Conservation Commission.\nii. Silviculture, subject to the provisions of the Forest Practices Guidelines\nRelated to Water Quality (15 N.C.A.C. 11.0101 - 11.0209).\niii. Residential development at one dwelling unit per two acres on a project-by-\nproject basis. For purposes of density calculations, total project acreage shall\nnot include any area within the designated right-of-way of any public or private\nstreet within the project, nor shall it include any area within the project donated\nor dedicated to the public, except for storm water control structures approved\nunder the high-density option. No residential lot shall be less than two acres,\nexcept within an approved cluster development.\nb. Prohibited Uses\n\nNEW PAGE 91\ni. Sanitary landfills are prohibited.\nii. No new chemical storage or new underground fuel storage tanks are allowed.\niii. The storage of toxic and hazardous materials is prohibited unless a spill\ncontainment plan is implemented.\niv. Sites for land application of sludge/residuals or petroleum-contaminated soils\nare prohibited.\nC. Development Applications. In addition to the standards for Site Plans, the following\nshall be contained on applications for development in the Watershed Overlay:\ni. Total impervious area;\nii. Location of perennial streams;\niii. Septic tank drainage field; and\niv. Sedimentation and erosion controls.\nd. Minimum Lot Area. 87,120 square feet (or two (2) acres) minimum lot area per\ndwelling unit. Because of the high likelihood of a septic tank, a potential buyer should\nfirst check with the Surry County Health Department to determine adequacy of the lot,\nas a larger lot could be required.\n11. WSII-BW (O) WSII-Balance of Watershed (Overlay). The WSII-BW (O) is established as an\noverlay district to impose lower standards in the balance of the watershed area because the\nrisk of water quality degradation from pollution is less than in the critical area of the\nwatershed. The regulations of this district will allow residential uses at a maximum of one (1)\ndwelling unit per acre and non-residential development at twelve percent (12%) built-upon\narea. Projects must minimize built-upon surface area, direct storm water away from surface\nwaters and incorporate Best Management Practices to minimize water quality impacts. Non-\ndischarging landfills and sludge applications sites are allowed.\na. Limitations on Certain Permitted Uses\ni.

Alteration of Signs. The replacement of sign faces, lettering, or other features of a sign shall be\nconsidered maintenance and shall not require a permit. No alteration that modifies the area,\nheight, or illumination of a sign, or alters its location shall be permitted under this provision.\n2. Signs on Public Property Forfeited. Any sign installed or placed on public property or within a\npublic right-of-way, except in conformance with the requirements of this Article shall be forfeited to\nthe public and is subject to confiscation. In addition to other remedies hereunder, the Ordinance\nAdministrator shall have the right to recover from the owner or person placing such a sign the full\ncosts of removal and disposal of such sign.\n3. Sign Permits. To ensure compliance with the provisions of this Article, all persons proposing to\ndisplay a sign shall obtain a sign permit, in accordance with the general procedure established for\nthe issuance of permits in this Ordinance, unless otherwise expressly exempted from such\nrequirement. When a permit is required, a permit shall be issued prior to the installation or\nplacement of such sign.\na. Permanent Signs Requiring a Permit.

Failure to obtain a permit for a temporary sign that is required to be permitted prior\nto displaying it is a violation of this Ordinance.\n4. Sign Area Computations. The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and\nsign height:\na. Computation of Area of Single-faced Signs. The area of a sign face shall be computed\nby means of the smallest square or rectangle, that will encompass the extreme limits of the\nwriting, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color\nforming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign\nfrom the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting\nframework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets\nzoning ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself.\nb. Computation of Area of Multi-Faced Signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one\nface shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one\npoint. When two (2) identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot\nbe viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same\nsign structure and not more than forty-two (42\") inches apart, the sign area shall be\ncomputed by the measurement of one (1) of the faces.\nFigure 10-1: Measurement of a Sign Face\n", "page_number": 92, "page_range": [92,
