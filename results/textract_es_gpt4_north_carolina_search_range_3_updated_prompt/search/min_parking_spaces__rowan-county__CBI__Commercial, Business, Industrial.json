Flexibility of administration.\nThe presumptive standards set forth in the parking requirements table cannot cover every\npossible use or situation, nor can the table be considered exact. Therefore, the administrator is\ngiven flexibility to administer this section as follows:\n(1) Similar use. Parking space requirements for a use not identified in the table shall be based\non a similar, listed use.\n(2) Other use. In the case of unique land uses or those that have unusually high parking\nrequirements, the landowner shall demonstrate to the administrator that sufficient off-street\nparking can be provided.\n(3) Numerical standard. Deviations from the number of spaces are permitted when the\nadministrator determines that the requirements for a particular situation are unreasonable.\nThe reasons for allowing the deviation or requirement shall be noted in writing by the\nadministrator.\n(Ord. of 1-19-98, \u00a7 VIII)\nSec. 21-166.

Purpose.\nCertain land uses, because of their character and intensity, may create an adverse impact\nwhen developed adjacent to other less intensive land uses. The general purpose of this article is\nto establish guidelines to preserve the value and appearance of property in the county and to\nrecognize that the transition between certain uses requires attention to protect less intensive land\nuses. The goal is to identify land use relationships that may be incompatible and to specify an\nappropriate buffer or screen in order to minimize adverse impacts.\n(Ord. of 1-19-98, \u00a7 X)\nSec. 21-212. Applicability.\nThe buffering and screening shall be adequate to meet the intent of section 21-211, but shall\nnot exceed one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the length of the development activity\nrequired to install the buffer and screening, unless required on a site plan approved by the board\nof commissioners. The requirements of this article shall apply to the side and rear yard of the\noperational area except driveways, sediment ponds, and detention areas unless otherwise\nindicated herein.\n(Ord. of 1-19-98, \u00a7 X; Amend. of 9-6-11; Amend. of 9-3-19)\nSec. 21-213. Buffer requirements.\n(a) Generally. Buffers shall be required in accordance with the table in section 21-216 when any\nuse is being developed abutting an existing developed lot, however less intensive uses locating\nnext to more intensive uses shall not be required to comply with the screening portion of the\nrequirements of this article. Where a conflict exists between the buffer requirements for a use\nand setback requirements for a zoning district, the use requirements shall control. The required\nbuffer may not be used for loading, storage, or similar operational area needs that are either\npart of or accessory to the proposed use unless otherwise indicated herein.\n(b) Modification of buffer requirements.

Purpose.\nCertain land uses, because of their character and intensity, may create an adverse impact\nwhen developed adjacent to other less intensive land uses. The general purpose of this article is\nto establish guidelines to preserve the value and appearance of property in the county and to\nrecognize that the transition between certain uses requires attention to protect less intensive land\nuses. The goal is to identify land use relationships that may be incompatible and to specify an\nappropriate buffer or screen in order to minimize adverse impacts.\n(Ord. of 1-19-98, \u00a7 X)\nSec. 21-212. Applicability.\nThe buffering and screening shall be adequate to meet the intent of section 21-211, but shall\nnot exceed one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the length of the development activity\nrequired to install the buffer and screening, unless required on a site plan approved by the board\nof commissioners. The requirements of this article shall apply to the side and rear yard of the\noperational area except driveways, sediment ponds, and detention areas unless otherwise\nindicated herein.\n(Ord. of 1-19-98, \u00a7 X; Amend. of 9-6-11; Amend. of 9-3-19)\nSec. 21-213. Buffer requirements.\n(a) Generally. Buffers shall be required in accordance with the table in section 21-216 when any\nuse is being developed abutting an existing developed lot, however less intensive uses locating\nnext to more intensive uses shall not be required to comply with the screening portion of the\nrequirements of this article. Where a conflict exists between the buffer requirements for a use\nand setback requirements for a zoning district, the use requirements shall control. The required\nbuffer may not be used for loading, storage, or similar operational area needs that are either\npart of or accessory to the proposed use unless otherwise indicated herein.\n(b) Modification of buffer requirements. Buffer requirements may be modified in accordance with\n117\n\nNEW PAGE 118\nAs of 01/17/23\nthe provisions of section 21-217.\n(c) Responsibility for requirements. One hundred (100) percent of the applicable buffer\nrequirements shall be the responsibility of the developing land use, unless expressly provided\notherwise.\n(d) Standards for trees and shrubs.

If it is demonstrated that existing vegetation meets the intent of\nthis section, the zoning administrator may waive the requirements for the plant material.\n(f) Maintenance of buffer. The owner of the property where the buffer or screening is shall be\nresponsible for maintaining the buffer and all required plantings in good condition.\n(g) Buffering of expanded uses. Expansion of a use existing prior to the effective date of this\nchapter shall require the expanded portion of the facility to come into conformance with these\nrequirements.\n(h) Watershed buffer areas required. A minimum 30-foot vegetative buffer for low density and 100-\nfoot buffer for high density and SNIA development activities is required along all perennial\nwaters indicated on the most recent versions of U.S.G.S. 1:24,000 (7.5 minute) scale\ntopographic maps.\n(i) Development in required watershed overlay buffer areas. Development in the buffer area shall\nbe limited to the following exceptions in conjunction with minimizing built-upon surface area,\ndirecting runoff away from surface waters and maximizing the utilization of stormwater best\nmanagement practices:\n(1) Artificial streambank or shoreline stabilization;\n(2) Water dependent structures such as piers, docks, etc.;\n(3) Other structures such as flag poles, signs, and security lights which result in only minimal\nincreases in impervious area;\n(4) Public projects such as road crossings and greenways where no practical alternative exists.\n(Ord. of 1-19-98, \u00a7 X; Ord. of 4-20-98; Amend. of 11-2-09; Amend. of 9-6-11; Amend. of 4-21-14;\nAmend. of 8-19-19)\nSec. 21-214.

Conditional districts.\n(a) Purpose. There are instances where a rezoning request to a general district would be\ninappropriate and could not effectively be managed by the district's general development\nstandards. As an alternative manner to evaluate such a request, a conditional district may\npropose specific development standards necessary to address anticipated impacts on\nsurrounding properties and the county, establish consistency with adopted plans, and / or\nprovide a clear understanding of the type and degree of future development allowed within the\ndistrict. This can often be achieved by the commitment to a specific use or uses permitted in\nthe conditional district, increased development standards, or site plan details, which are tailored\nto address the aforementioned objectives and sufficient to allow for an appropriate evaluation\nof the request. This voluntary procedure must be petitioned by the property owner or their\nauthorized agent as a development proposal and not for securing early zoning for tentative\nuses which may not be undertaken for a long period of time.\n(b) Applications. Applications for conditional districts shall be on forms provided by the county\nplanning and development department. Only property owners or their authorized agents shall\napply for rezoning to an appropriate conditional district (amended 6-19-00). The applicant may\npropose additional limitations or restrictions that address: compatibility between the\ndevelopment and surrounding area; anticipated impacts; land use plan objectives; or other\nconcerns. Supporting documentation must clearly identify proposed restrictions or conditions\n93\nCELL (1, 1): \nGeneral Zoning Districts\nCELL (1, 2): \nConditional Districts\nCELL (2, 1): \nRS\nCELL (2, 2): \nRS (CD)\nCELL (3, 1): \nRR\nCELL (3, 2): \nRR (CD)\nCELL (4, 1): \nRA\nCELL (4, 2): \nRA (CD)\nCELL (5, 1): \nMHP\nCELL (5, 2): \nMHP (CD)\nCELL (6, 1): \nMFR\nCELL (6, 2): \nMFR (CD)\nCELL (7, 1): \nCBI\nCELL (7, 2): \nCBI (CD)\nCELL (8, 1): \n85-ED-1\nCELL (8, 2): \n85-ED-1 (CD)\nCELL (9, 1): \n85-ED-2\nCELL (9, 2): \n85-ED-2 (CD)\nCELL (10, 1): \n85-ED-3\nCELL (10, 2): \n85-ED-3 (CD)\nCELL (11, 1): \n85-ED-4\nCELL (11, 2): \n85-ED-4 (CD)\nCELL (12, 1): \nIND\nCELL (12, 2): \nIND (CD)\nCELL (13, 1): \nNB\nCELL (13, 2): \nNB (CD)\nCELL (14, 1): \nINST\nCELL (14, 2): \nINST (CD)\nCELL (15, 1): \nAl\nCELL (15, 2): \nAI (CD)\nCELL (16, 1): \nOverlay Zoning Districts\nCELL (16, 2): \nConditional Districts\nCELL (17, 1): \nWSO\nCELL (17, 2): \nWSO (CD)\n", "page_number": 91, "page_range": [91, 92, 93], "highlight": ["Adequate <em>off</em>-<em>street</em> <em>parking</em> shall be provided for all attendees.\ne.
