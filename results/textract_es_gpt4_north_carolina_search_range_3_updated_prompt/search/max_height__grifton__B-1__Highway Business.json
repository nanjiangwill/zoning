A planting area in any nonresidential district parallel to a public street designed\nto provide continuity of vegetation along the right-of-way and to soften the impact of the development\nby providing a pleasing view from the road.\nTREE, ORNAMENTAL.

These trees shall be generally equally distributed\nalong the street frontage, but they are not required to be at absolute equal intervals. This will allow for\nsome flexibility in design while discouraging long intervals without trees.\n(C) Shrubbery may be planted in clusters where trees are not practical.\n(D) Parking, merchandise display and off-street loading are prohibited in the street yard.\n(E) Any tree or shrub planted within the sight triangle, as defined in \u00a7 152.007.\n(F) No more than 20% of the street yard may be used for walkways or signs.\n(Ord. passed 1-11-2005, \u00a7 9-3)\n\nNEW PAGE 94\n\u00a7 152.238 STANDARDS FOR LANDSCAPING WITHIN PARKING LOTS.\n(A) All new or expanded (to add 12 or more spaces) parking lots with 12 or more spaces shall\ncomply with this section.\n(B) If an existing parking lot (paved or unpaved) is expanded or improved to add 12 or more\nspaces, it shall comply with the parking lot requirements of the landscape ordinance within the\nexpanded or improved portion.\n(C) If a parking lot is expanded or developed, then street yard and parking lot requirements shall\nbe applicable.\n(D) In parking lots with 12 or more spaces, trees shall be planted at a rate of one shade tree or two\nornamental trees for every 12 spaces or fraction thereof.\n(E) Required trees shall be located within or adjacent to parking lots as tree islands, medians, at\nthe end of parking bays, traffic delineators or between rows of parking spaces in a manner SO that no\nparking space is located more than 60 feet from a parking lot tree.\n(F) Trees required within the street yard cannot be credited toward the parking lot requirements.\n(G) Planting areas within parking lots shall provide a minimum of 81 square feet with a minimum\ninside dimension of nine feet and a minimum prepared depth of 18 inches.\n(Ord. passed 1-11-2005, \u00a7 9-4)\n\u00a7 152.239 LANDSCAPING (SCREENS/BUFFERS) BETWEEN LAND USES.\nExisting development shall not be required to comply with landscaping (buffer and screening)\nregulations.
