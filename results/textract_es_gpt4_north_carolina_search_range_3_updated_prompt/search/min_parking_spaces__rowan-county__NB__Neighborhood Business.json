Conditional districts.\n(a) Purpose. There are instances where a rezoning request to a general district would be\ninappropriate and could not effectively be managed by the district's general development\nstandards. As an alternative manner to evaluate such a request, a conditional district may\npropose specific development standards necessary to address anticipated impacts on\nsurrounding properties and the county, establish consistency with adopted plans, and / or\nprovide a clear understanding of the type and degree of future development allowed within the\ndistrict. This can often be achieved by the commitment to a specific use or uses permitted in\nthe conditional district, increased development standards, or site plan details, which are tailored\nto address the aforementioned objectives and sufficient to allow for an appropriate evaluation\nof the request. This voluntary procedure must be petitioned by the property owner or their\nauthorized agent as a development proposal and not for securing early zoning for tentative\nuses which may not be undertaken for a long period of time.\n(b) Applications. Applications for conditional districts shall be on forms provided by the county\nplanning and development department. Only property owners or their authorized agents shall\napply for rezoning to an appropriate conditional district (amended 6-19-00). The applicant may\npropose additional limitations or restrictions that address: compatibility between the\ndevelopment and surrounding area; anticipated impacts; land use plan objectives; or other\nconcerns.

Conditional districts.\n(a) Purpose. There are instances where a rezoning request to a general district would be\ninappropriate and could not effectively be managed by the district's general development\nstandards. As an alternative manner to evaluate such a request, a conditional district may\npropose specific development standards necessary to address anticipated impacts on\nsurrounding properties and the county, establish consistency with adopted plans, and / or\nprovide a clear understanding of the type and degree of future development allowed within the\ndistrict. This can often be achieved by the commitment to a specific use or uses permitted in\nthe conditional district, increased development standards, or site plan details, which are tailored\nto address the aforementioned objectives and sufficient to allow for an appropriate evaluation\nof the request. This voluntary procedure must be petitioned by the property owner or their\nauthorized agent as a development proposal and not for securing early zoning for tentative\nuses which may not be undertaken for a long period of time.\n(b) Applications. Applications for conditional districts shall be on forms provided by the county\nplanning and development department. Only property owners or their authorized agents shall\napply for rezoning to an appropriate conditional district (amended 6-19-00). The applicant may\npropose additional limitations or restrictions that address: compatibility between the\ndevelopment and surrounding area; anticipated impacts; land use plan objectives; or other\nconcerns.

While the applicant has discretion in the level of detail or conditions\noffered to govern the proposed conditional district, the application must contain sufficient\ncontent for a substantive evaluation by the board of commissioners. The applicant must\nconsider the potential degree of administrative change afforded to an approved district in\nsection 21-62(d) when submitting an application.\n(c) Permitted uses and development requirements. If approved as a conditional district, only\nthe use or uses identified in the conditional district are allowed subject to any associated\nconditions or limitations therein. All use requirements of the underlying general use district and\nsection 21-64, if applicable, shall apply as well as all other requirements of the ordinance. In\nno situation shall approval of a conditional district reduce required standards of this ordinance\nunless otherwise provided herein.\n(d) Review Procedures. Conditional district requests shall follow review procedures referenced\nin Sec. 21-362.\n(e) Conditional District Approval. The board of commissioners may approve a reclassification\nof a property to a conditional district only upon determining that the proposed use or uses will\nmeet all standards and regulations in this chapter that are applicable. Specific conditions\napplicable to the district may be proposed by the petitioner or the board of commissioners, but\nonly those conditions consented by the petitioner in writing consistent with G.S. 160D-703(b)\nmay be incorporated into the zoning regulations. Conditions and site-specific standards\nimposed in a conditional district shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the\ndevelopment and use of the site to applicable ordinances, officially adopted comprehensive\nplans, or impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site.\nThe approval of the district and any requested conditions shall be included on a certificate of\napproval form provided by the county.
