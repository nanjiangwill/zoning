in the Orange County 2030 Comprehensive Plan, adopted on November 18, 2008, and\namended from time to time. The previous Orange County Comprehensive Plan was adopted on\nSeptember 2, 1981, and amended from time to time.\nThe Land Use Element of the 2030 Comprehensive Plan identifies land use categories in which specific\ntypes of development are encouraged and a map depicting the geographic locations of the various land\nuse categories. The 2030 Comprehensive Plan contains a matrix identifying which zoning districts are\ncompatible with each land use category.\nSECTION 3.2:\nREQUIRED CONFORMANCE TO DISTRICT REGULATIONS\nAND PROJECTS APPROVED AS PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS OR CONDITIONAL\nUSE DISTRICTS\n3.2.1 Required Conformance to District Regulations\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, no structure or land shall hereafter be used or\noccupied, and no structure, or part thereof, shall be altered, moved, erected, or built except in\nconformity with the regulations herein specified for the Zoning District in which the structure or\nland is located.\n3.2.2\nProjects Approved as Planned Developments or Conditional Use Districts\n(A)\nProjects approved as one of the Planned Development (PD) zoning districts (zoning\ndistricts included in the former Zoning Ordinance but no longer used) or as a Conditional\nUse District may continue to function under the terms and conditions approved in the\nClass A Special Use Permit issued as part of the Planned Development or Conditional\nUse District approval.\n(B)\nPlanned Development (PD) and Conditional Use districts shall continue to be depicted on\nthe Zoning Atlas but in no case shall lands be rezoned to PD or CUD in the future.\nOrange County, North Carolina - Unified Development Ordinance\nPage 3-1\n\nNEW PAGE 136\nArticle 3: Base Zoning Districts\nSection 3.3: Residential Districts\nSECTION 3.3:\nRESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS\nRB DISTRICT SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\n1.\nUses shall be restricted to those indicated for the RB District in Section 5.2, unless a Conditional District is\napproved (see Section 3.8).\n2.\nDevelopment within the zoning district shall be subject to all applicable use standards detailed in Article 5\nand all applicable development standards detailed in Article 6 of this Ordinance.\n3.\nWhile the Minimum Lot Size may be 87,120 square feet, the density permitted on a given parcel is based on\nthe Watershed Protection Overlay District in which the property is located.
