This district is primarily designed to provide rural business\nopportunities typically in the form of small retail, service, office, and light manufacturing uses\nto serve the community's existing and future needs for goods, services, and employment\nopportunities. Standards within the district are intended to promote context sensitive\ndevelopment appropriately scaled and organized in a manner that would not be detrimental to\nthe surrounding area. Development within this district would contain impacts inherently more\nintensive than those associated with uses permitted with special requirements in the RA district\nbut significantly less than those in CBI zoned areas. The NB district is generally appropriate\nin areas identified by an adopted land use plan for rural businesses located on identified minor\nand major thoroughfares and within community nodes. However, additional consideration may\nbe necessary as some thoroughfare segments would not be conducive to NB designation due\nto surrounding land use and / or potential negative impacts such as traffic, noise, and visual\nimpacts. Generally, the NB district shall be two (2) acres or larger. However a lot of record,\nsmaller than two (2) acres may be considered for rezoning to NB if the owner of the lot does\nnot own adjacent property which may be included in the rezoning request.\n(i)\nInstitutional, INST. The purpose of the Institutional district is to recognize and permit the\ncreation of defined areas for the unified and orderly development of major cultural, educational,\nmedical, governmental, religious and other institutions in order to support and enhance their\nbenefits to the community in a manner which protects adjacent residential uses. Trade school\nfacilities teaching a trade, for example truck driving or welding, which have that activity on site,\nshall meet zoning requirements for that use.\n(j) Airport Industrial, Al. This district is established for airport-specific or related businesses that\nwill be located, designed, constructed and maintained in a manner compatible with aviation\noperations. Uses in the Al district tend to focus on manufacturing, transportation, services and\npublic administration with standards designed to promote safety and compatibility with the Mid-\nCarolina Regional Airport Layout Plan (ALP) adopted by the Rowan County Board of\nCommissioners. Any use(s) or proposed structure(s) located on Rowan County property is\nsubject to approval by the Rowan County Board of Commissioners and shall comply with Mid-\nCarolina Regional's minimum standards and applicable Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)\nrules and regulations including FAA 7460-1 Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration.\nProperties owned by Rowan County, NC that encompass and adjoin the Mid-Carolina Regional\nAirport will comprise the district.

Overlay districts.\nOverlay districts are zoning districts, which are applied only in conjunction with other zoning\ndistricts, and may grant additional use of development requirements upon the underlying zoning\ndistricts. The effect is to have both the overlay district and the underlying zoning controlling the\nuse and development of the lot. Overlay districts are applicable on an area wide basis to support\nspecific public policy objectives and as such should be consistent with adopted land use plans.\nOverlay districts may be applied to conventional and conditional zoning districts. An overlay district\nmay be initiated as an amendment by the board of commissioners, planning board, planning staff,\nor the property owner or their designated representative.\n42\n\nNEW PAGE 43\nAs of 01/17/23\n(1) Airport Zone Overlay, AZO.

Special\nrequirements shall be applied to these parks which shall specify improvements to the\npark to ensure the public health, safety and welfare of the park inhabitants as well as\nthe surrounding area. Designation of an area as being in the MHP district provides\ndesign and appearance criteria which are more appropriate for rental manufactured\nhousing and/or spaces, including vinyl or similar skirting, clustering of units and reduced\nroad construction standards. These standards are not applicable to manufactured\nhomes and/or lots located outside a MHP district. This district requires site plan review\nfor development of manufactured home parks by the board of commissioners. This\nreview is required because the use may have particular impacts on the surrounding area\nand the county as a whole. Approval of the site plan may include the addition of\nreasonable and appropriate standards to the site plan. No other uses allowed in the\nMHP district shall require site plan approval by the board of commissioner unless\nexpressly required by this chapter.\n(2)\nManufactured home parks, existing at the effective date of this chapter and registered\nas provided by the county mobile home park ordinance are zoned as conforming uses,\neven though they may not meet the development standards of this chapter. Expansions\nof the existing registered manufactured home parks or construction of new\nmanufactured home parks, approved under the county mobile home park ordinance may\nbe initiated or continue unless no work has begun within six (6) months of the date of\nissuance of a \"permit to develop\" under that ordinance, or work has ceased for a period\nof twelve (12) months.\n(3)\nOther manufactured home parks, which meet the intent of this section by having\nimprovements similar to the requirements of this chapter may also be zoned as\nconforming uses. However, all expansions of any manufactured home park, existing at\nthe effective date of this chapter shall meet all requirements of this chapter unless\nexpressly provided otherwise. Development standards for a manufactured home park\nare listed in article III.\n(f) Commercial, Business, Industrial, CBI. This zone allows for a wide range of commercial,\nbusiness and light to medium industrial activities which support both the local and / or regional\neconomies. The CBI district is generally appropriate in areas identified by an adopted land\nuse plan that recommend \"highway business\" along identified NC and US highways;\ncommunity / regional / potential development nodes; commercial corridors; and existing\ncommercial areas. Areas served by public water / sewer represent significant public\ninvestment to foster tax base growth and employment opportunities for the citizens, which\ncould be served through CBI designation. The CBI district may also exist or be created in an\narea other than listed in this subsection if the existing or proposed development is compatible\nwith the surrounding area and the overall public good is served.\n(g) Industrial, IND. This district is intended to provide for industrial activities involving extraction,\nmanufacturing, processing, assembling, storage, and distribution of products. The district is\nalso designed to accommodate other, more intense non-residential uses which generate\nadverse side effects such as noise, odor or dust. The IND district is generally appropriate in\nareas identified by an adopted land use plan for industrial corridors, potential development\nnodes, locations accessible to rail lines and utility infrastructure, and existing industrial areas.\nThese corridors represent significant public and private investment, which should be identified\nto foster tax base growth and employment opportunities for the citizens. The IND district may\n41\n\nNEW PAGE 42\nAs of 01/17/23\nalso exist or be created in an area other than listed in this subsection if the existing or proposed\ndevelopment is compatible with the surrounding area and the overall public good is served.\n(h) Neighborhood Business, NB. This district is primarily designed to provide rural business\nopportunities typically in the form of small retail, service, office, and light manufacturing uses\nto serve the community's existing and future needs for goods, services, and employment\nopportunities. Standards within the district are intended to promote context sensitive\ndevelopment appropriately scaled and organized in a manner that would not be detrimental to\nthe surrounding area. Development within this district would contain impacts inherently more\nintensive than those associated with uses permitted with special requirements in the RA district\nbut significantly less than those in CBI zoned areas. The NB district is generally appropriate\nin areas identified by an adopted land use plan for rural businesses located on identified minor\nand major thoroughfares and within community nodes. However, additional consideration may\nbe necessary as some thoroughfare segments would not be conducive to NB designation due\nto surrounding land use and / or potential negative impacts such as traffic, noise, and visual\nimpacts. Generally, the NB district shall be two (2) acres or larger. However a lot of record,\nsmaller than two (2) acres may be considered for rezoning to NB if the owner of the lot does\nnot own adjacent property which may be included in the rezoning request.\n(i)\nInstitutional, INST. The purpose of the Institutional district is to recognize and permit the\ncreation of defined areas for the unified and orderly development of major cultural, educational,\nmedical, governmental, religious and other institutions in order to support and enhance their\nbenefits to the community in a manner which protects adjacent residential uses. Trade school\nfacilities teaching a trade, for example truck driving or welding, which have that activity on site,\nshall meet zoning requirements for that use.\n(j) Airport Industrial, Al. This district is established for airport-specific or related businesses that\nwill be located, designed, constructed and maintained in a manner compatible with aviation\noperations. Uses in the Al district tend to focus on manufacturing, transportation, services and\npublic administration with standards designed to promote safety and compatibility with the Mid-\nCarolina Regional Airport Layout Plan (ALP) adopted by the Rowan County Board of\nCommissioners. Any use(s) or proposed structure(s) located on Rowan County property is\nsubject to approval by the Rowan County Board of Commissioners and shall comply with Mid-\nCarolina Regional's minimum standards and applicable Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)\nrules and regulations including FAA 7460-1 Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration.\nProperties owned by Rowan County, NC that encompass and adjoin the Mid-Carolina Regional\nAirport will comprise the district. District boundaries may be amended by addition of contiguous\nparcels via the map amendment process prescribed in Section 21-362.\n(Ord. of 1-19-98, \u00a7 III; Ord. of 2-1-99(1), \u00a7\u00a7 2, 9; Ord. of 6-17-02; Ord. of 4-21-03; Amend. of 4-\n21-14; Amend. of 9-3-19; Amend. of 6-21-21; Amend. of 9-19-22)\nSec. 21-33. Overlay districts.\nOverlay districts are zoning districts, which are applied only in conjunction with other zoning\ndistricts, and may grant additional use of development requirements upon the underlying zoning\ndistricts. The effect is to have both the overlay district and the underlying zoning controlling the\nuse and development of the lot. Overlay districts are applicable on an area wide basis to support\nspecific public policy objectives and as such should be consistent with adopted land use plans.\nOverlay districts may be applied to conventional and conditional zoning districts. An overlay district\nmay be initiated as an amendment by the board of commissioners, planning board, planning staff,\nor the property owner or their designated representative.\n42\n\nNEW PAGE 43\nAs of 01/17/23\n(1) Airport Zone Overlay, AZO. The zones and restrictions established in this subsection are\ndesigned to limit the height of structures surrounding the county airport's established\nelevation of seven hundred seventy-two and three tenths (772.3) feet above mean sea\nlevel (msl) in order to prevent hazards to the lives and property of the users of the airport\nand the occupants of land in the vicinity.\na. Uses allowed. The use requirements of the underlying district apply to the AZO district.\nHowever, all uses must be in conformance with the provisions of this section.\nb.\nEstablishment of zones. To carry out the provisions of this section, there are hereby\ncreated and established certain civil airport imaginary surfaces which consist of the land\nlying beneath the approach surface, including the non-precision and precision\napproach zone; transitional surface; horizontal surface; conical surface; and primary\nsurface. These civil airport imaginary surfaces are established with relation to the\nRowan County Airport runway and proposed extensions of thereof. Such imaginary\nsurfaces are defined in Section 21-4 and shown on the Official County Airport Zoning\nMap dated September 19, 2022, which is adopted and incorporated herein by\nreference. The size of each such imaginary surface is based on the category of each\nrunway according to the type of approach available or planned for that runway. The\nslope and dimensions of the approach surface, applied to each end of a runway, are\ndetermined by the most precise approach procedure existing or planned for the runway\nend.\nC. Height limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure shall be\nerected, altered or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow within the AZO\ndistrict extending or projecting into the lowest applicable imaginary surfaces defined\nherein.\n(2) Water Supply Watershed Overlays, WSO. The purpose of the watershed overlay is to\nprovide for the protection of public water supplies as required by the Water Supply\nWatershed Classification and Protection Act (G.S. 143-214.5) and regulations promulgated\ntherein. The watershed overlays may be an overlay in any conventional or conditional\nzoning district established in this chapter. The overlay districts supplement the uses or\ndevelopment requirements of the underlying zoning districts.\na. Uses allowed. The use requirements of the underlying districts apply to the WSO\ndistricts, unless otherwise provided in this section. However, all allowed uses must be\nin conformance with the provisions of this section.\nb. Expressly prohibited in critical areas. The following uses are expressly prohibited:\n1. Landfills;\n2. Sites for land application of sludge/residuals or petroleum contaminated soils.\nC.\nCalculating built-upon area. For the purpose of calculating built-upon area, total project\narea shall include total acreage in the lot on which the project is to be developed less\nacreage with any public road right of way. Built-upon area for a non-residential use\nexisting prior to January 1, 1994 (effective date of the initial WSO district designation\nand ordinance) as determined by planning staff will be subtracted from the overall lot\nacreage. All built-upon area proposed or existing after January 1, 1994 shall be subject\nto standards of this chapter. Home Occupations defined by section 21-4 shall be\nconsidered single family development. Built-upon area calculations for a Rural Home\nOccupation shall only include new built-upon area proposed and use of any existing\nstructure(s) for the operation but not existing residential structures.\n43\n", "page_number": 41, "page_range": [41, 42, 43], "highlight": ["The zones and restrictions established in this subsection are\ndesigned to limit the <em>height</em> of structures", "surrounding the county airport's established\nelevation of seven hundred seventy-two and three tenths (772.3) <em>feet</em>", "<em>Height</em> limitations.", "<em>Supply</em> <em>Watershed</em> Overlays, <em>WSO</em>.", "<em>Supply</em>\n<em>Watershed</em> Classification and Protection Act (G.S. 143-214.5) and regulations promulgated\ntherein"], "score": 15.746833, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Water Supply Watershed\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"WSO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"WSO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"WSO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 91\nAs of 01/17/23\nactivity is conducted extending outward five hundred (500) feet beyond the edge of\nthe activity.

Conditional districts.\n(a) Purpose. There are instances where a rezoning request to a general district would be\ninappropriate and could not effectively be managed by the district's general development\nstandards. As an alternative manner to evaluate such a request, a conditional district may\npropose specific development standards necessary to address anticipated impacts on\nsurrounding properties and the county, establish consistency with adopted plans, and / or\nprovide a clear understanding of the type and degree of future development allowed within the\ndistrict. This can often be achieved by the commitment to a specific use or uses permitted in\nthe conditional district, increased development standards, or site plan details, which are tailored\nto address the aforementioned objectives and sufficient to allow for an appropriate evaluation\nof the request. This voluntary procedure must be petitioned by the property owner or their\nauthorized agent as a development proposal and not for securing early zoning for tentative\nuses which may not be undertaken for a long period of time.\n(b) Applications. Applications for conditional districts shall be on forms provided by the county\nplanning and development department.

Conditional districts.\n(a) Purpose. There are instances where a rezoning request to a general district would be\ninappropriate and could not effectively be managed by the district's general development\nstandards. As an alternative manner to evaluate such a request, a conditional district may\npropose specific development standards necessary to address anticipated impacts on\nsurrounding properties and the county, establish consistency with adopted plans, and / or\nprovide a clear understanding of the type and degree of future development allowed within the\ndistrict. This can often be achieved by the commitment to a specific use or uses permitted in\nthe conditional district, increased development standards, or site plan details, which are tailored\nto address the aforementioned objectives and sufficient to allow for an appropriate evaluation\nof the request. This voluntary procedure must be petitioned by the property owner or their\nauthorized agent as a development proposal and not for securing early zoning for tentative\nuses which may not be undertaken for a long period of time.\n(b) Applications. Applications for conditional districts shall be on forms provided by the county\nplanning and development department. Only property owners or their authorized agents shall\napply for rezoning to an appropriate conditional district (amended 6-19-00). The applicant may\npropose additional limitations or restrictions that address: compatibility between the\ndevelopment and surrounding area; anticipated impacts; land use plan objectives; or other\nconcerns.

Only\nuses listed in section 21-113 as permitted by right or as a CD may be considered within a\nconditional district.\nApplications must include a site plan containing information from section 21-52 including the\ngeneral location and size of buildings, proposed streets, parking areas, and other operational\narea improvements. While the applicant has discretion in the level of detail or conditions\noffered to govern the proposed conditional district, the application must contain sufficient\ncontent for a substantive evaluation by the board of commissioners. The applicant must\nconsider the potential degree of administrative change afforded to an approved district in\nsection 21-62(d) when submitting an application.\n(c) Permitted uses and development requirements. If approved as a conditional district, only\nthe use or uses identified in the conditional district are allowed subject to any associated\nconditions or limitations therein. All use requirements of the underlying general use district and\nsection 21-64, if applicable, shall apply as well as all other requirements of the ordinance. In\nno situation shall approval of a conditional district reduce required standards of this ordinance\nunless otherwise provided herein.\n(d) Review Procedures. Conditional district requests shall follow review procedures referenced\nin Sec. 21-362.\n(e) Conditional District Approval. The board of commissioners may approve a reclassification\nof a property to a conditional district only upon determining that the proposed use or uses will\nmeet all standards and regulations in this chapter that are applicable. Specific conditions\napplicable to the district may be proposed by the petitioner or the board of commissioners, but\nonly those conditions consented by the petitioner in writing consistent with G.S. 160D-703(b)\nmay be incorporated into the zoning regulations. Conditions and site-specific standards\nimposed in a conditional district shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the\ndevelopment and use of the site to applicable ordinances, officially adopted comprehensive\nplans, or impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site.\nThe approval of the district and any requested conditions shall be included on a certificate of\napproval form provided by the county. If the approval and any attached conditions are\nacceptable to the petitioner, then this acceptance shall be indicated by the petitioner signing\nthe approval form.\n(Ord. of 1-19-98, \u00a7 IV; Ord. of 6-17-02; Amend. of 3-7-05; Amend. of 2-20-06(1); Amend. of 6-16-\n08; Amend. of 6-19-10; Amend. of 3-5-12; Amend. of 9-6-16; Amend. of 6-21-21; Amend. of 4-18-\n22; Amend. of 9-19-22; Amend. of 1-17-23)\nSec. 21-62.
