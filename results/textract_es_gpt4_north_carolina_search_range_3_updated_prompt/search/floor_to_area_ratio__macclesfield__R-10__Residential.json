Residential Districts: Permissible non-residential uses within residential district, where\nthere are parking spaces for more than eight (8) cars, are required to comply with the\nfollowing:\n1. The lot may be used only for parking and not for any type of loading, unloading,\nbusiness sales, dead storage, repair work, dismantling or servicing.\n2. All entrances, exits, barricades at sidewalks, and drainage plans shall be acceptable\nper the subdivision regulations of the Town.\n3. A strip five (5) feet wide shall be reserved as open space adjoining any street line of\nany lot zoned for residential use and shall be guarded with wheel bumpers and\nplanted grass and/or shrubs, according to the buffer yard requirements of this\nOrdinance.\nSection 50.04 Certification\nEach application for a zoning permit for a commercial, industrial, institutional, or multi-family\nresidential unit submitted to the Zoning Administrator shall identify the location and dimensions\nof off-street parking spaces and driveways in accordance with the requirements of this Division.\nSection 50.05 Combination of Required Parking Space\nA.

One-half of the parking spaces required for churches, theaters, or assembly halls, whose\npeak attendance will be at night or on Sundays, may arrange to use such spaces on\nadjacent property provided the use on said adjacent property will be closed at night and\non Sundays, whichever is applicable, with the permission of the adjacent property owner.\nSection 50.06 Remote Parking Space\nA. If off-street parking spaces required by this section cannot be reasonably provided on the\nsame lot on which the principal use is located, such spaces may be provided on any land\nwithin 400 feet of the main entrance to such principal use provided the land is in the same\nownership as the principal use or secured by a long term lease arrangement, which shall\nbe renewable for as long as the requirement for the off-street parking of the principal use\nexists.\nB. Land described in subsection (A) above shall be used for no other purpose.\nC. When adequate provisions for parking space (meeting the requirements of this Article)\nhave been made for the principal use on its lot, the requirements of subsections (A) and\n(B) above shall be inapplicable. (Note: In such cases, the applicant shall apply for a\ncertificate of compliance for the principal use.)\nD.\nIn cases of new construction, an applicant shall submit (with his application for a\nbuilding permit and zoning permit) a document, duly executed and acknowledged, which\nsubjects the off-site land to remote parking use in connection with the principal use for\n\nNEW PAGE 68\nwhich it is made available. (Note: The applicant shall deposit the appropriate filing fee\nand, upon the issuance of a zoning permit, the Zoning Administrator shall cause the\ndocument to be registered in the Office of the County Register of Deeds.)\nSection 50.07 Number of Parking Spaces Required\nA. The minimum number of required off-site parking and stacking spaces is indicated in\nTable 50.07.\nB.

For any use not specifically listed in Table 50.07, the parking and stacking requirements\nshall be those of the most similar listed use, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.\nD. All developments in all zoning districts shall provide a sufficient number of parking\nspaces, in accordance with provisions of this article to accommodate the number of\nvehicles that ordinarily are likely to be attracted to the development in question.\nE. The Board of Commissioners and Planning Board recognizes that, due to the\nparticularities of any given development, the inflexible application of the parking\nstandards set forth in Table 50.07 may result in a development either with inadequate\nparking spaces or parking spaces far in excess of its needs. Therefore, the permit issuing\nauthority may permit deviations from the requirements of Table 50.07 and may require\nmore parking or allow less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely\nto satisfy the general standard delineated in subsection (D). The permit issuing authority\nmay allow deviations, for example, when it finds that a residential development is\nirrevocably oriented toward the elderly, disabled or other population that demonstrates a\nlesser parking need or when it finds that a business or service is primarily oriented to\nwalk-in trade.
