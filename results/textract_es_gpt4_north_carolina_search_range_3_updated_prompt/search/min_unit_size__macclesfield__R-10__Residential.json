Unless otherwise provided, no principal and/or accessory building, structure, or use shall\nbe erected, expanded, enlarged, increased, or initiated on any lot that does not abut a\npublic street with a right-of-way in conformity with the Subdivision Ordinance.\nB. Single Family Exemption: A single-family dwelling may be constructed on a lot that does\nnot abut a public street, provided that such lot is at least two (2) acres in size and is\nprovided with direct access to a public street by an easement created for the exclusive use\nof such dwelling. Any easement created pursuant to this exemption shall be at least forty\n\nNEW PAGE 50\n(40) feet in width and shall not exceed three hundred (300) feet in length.

For\nexample, a swimming pool/tennis court complex is customarily associated with and\nintegrally related to a residential subdivision or multifamily development and would be\nregarded as accessory to such principal uses, even though such facilities, if developed\napart from a residential development, would require a zoning permit.\nB.
