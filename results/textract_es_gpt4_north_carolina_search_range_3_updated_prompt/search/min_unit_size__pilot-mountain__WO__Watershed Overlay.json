In order to maintain a predominantly undeveloped land use intensity\npattern, residential and non-residential uses shall be allowed at a maximum of one (1)\ndwelling unit per two (2) acres and six percent (6%) built-upon area respectively.\na. Limitations on Certain Permitted Uses\ni. Agriculture, provided that all agricultural activities will be encouraged to\nparticipate in the agricultural Cost Share Program and subject to the\nprovisions of the Food Security Act of 1985 and the Food, Agriculture,\nConservation and Trade Act of 1990. Agricultural activities conducted after\nJanuary 1, 1993 shall maintain a minimum ten-foot vegetative buffer, or\nequivalent control as determined by the Soil and Water Conservation\nCommission, along all perennial waters indicated on the most recent versions\nof U.S.G.S. 1:24,000 (7.5 minute) scale topographic maps or as determined\nby local governments studies.

In addition to the standards for Site Plans, the following\nshall be contained on applications for development in the Watershed Overlay:\ni. Total impervious area;\nii. Location of perennial streams;\niii. Septic tank drainage field; and\niv. Sedimentation and erosion controls.\nd. Minimum Lot Area. 87,120 square feet (or two (2) acres) minimum lot area per\ndwelling unit. Because of the high likelihood of a septic tank, a potential buyer should\nfirst check with the Surry County Health Department to determine adequacy of the lot,\nas a larger lot could be required.\n11. WSII-BW (O) WSII-Balance of Watershed (Overlay). The WSII-BW (O) is established as an\noverlay district to impose lower standards in the balance of the watershed area because the\nrisk of water quality degradation from pollution is less than in the critical area of the\nwatershed. The regulations of this district will allow residential uses at a maximum of one (1)\ndwelling unit per acre and non-residential development at twelve percent (12%) built-upon\narea. Projects must minimize built-upon surface area, direct storm water away from surface\nwaters and incorporate Best Management Practices to minimize water quality impacts. Non-\ndischarging landfills and sludge applications sites are allowed.\na. Limitations on Certain Permitted Uses\ni.

Purpose. The purpose of establishing supplementary requirements for development in\ndowntown Pilot Mountain is to protect and enhance the visual character of development and\nto preserve the unique streetscape of downtown by encouraging compatibility among\ndowntown structures. It is not the intent of this overlay district to eliminate architectural\nfreedom or discourage innovative design, but rather to complement the Town of Pilot\nMountain's Development Ordinance and development guidelines for Downtown.\n2.\nApplicability. Buildings within the Downtown Design Overlay (DDO) District exhibit design\nelements that contribute to the unique sense of character of downtown Pilot Mountain.\nSpecifically, buildings tend to have flat or low pitch roofs concealed by the front facade\nparapet, no front or side yard setback, large storefront windows on the street level floor and\nstrong horizontal separations between the first and any upper floors created by windows and/\nor changes in fa\u00e7ade materials.\nIn order to continue and, in some cases, recreate the historic development pattern of\ndowntown Pilot Mountain, the following standards shall apply to all new construction,\nadditions and substantial modifications to existing structures located within the Downtown\nDesign Overlay (DDO) District. For the purposes of this section substantial modification shall\nbe defined as any work which involves the alteration of the building's footprint, construction of\nadditional stories, changes in roof pitch, modification of building fenestration and entryways,\nmaterial changes to the building fa\u00e7ade, or painting.\n3. Exemptions. When in compliance with all other town ordinances, the following types of\nprojects are exempt from the standards of the Downtown Design Overlay (DDO) district:\na. Interior and exterior alterations of buildings that were originally designed and built for\nsingle-family residential use and continue to be used for single-family residential use.\nb. Underground construction which does not consist of any above ground components,\nincluding utility boxes, pipes, poles or similar appurtenant features;\nC. Conducting regular maintenance work on buildings, landscaping, or grounds,\n(including parking lots), which does not significantly alter the appearance or function\nof the building, landscaping or grounds;\nd. Interior remodeling work, which does not involve the alteration of any building\ncomponent that does not alter any exterior building component;\ne. Landscape maintenance and upkeep, excluding the replacement trees;\nf. Temporary uses and structures;\ng. Routine roof maintenance and repair, when using like materials; and\nh. Painting of murals on the side and/or rear fa\u00e7ade of buildings.\n4.
