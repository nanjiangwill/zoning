There are instances where a rezoning request to a general district would be\ninappropriate and could not effectively be managed by the district's general development\nstandards.

This can often be achieved by the commitment to a specific use or uses permitted in\nthe conditional district, increased development standards, or site plan details, which are tailored\nto address the aforementioned objectives and sufficient to allow for an appropriate evaluation\nof the request. This voluntary procedure must be petitioned by the property owner or their\nauthorized agent as a development proposal and not for securing early zoning for tentative\nuses which may not be undertaken for a long period of time.\n(b) Applications. Applications for conditional districts shall be on forms provided by the county\nplanning and development department. Only property owners or their authorized agents shall\napply for rezoning to an appropriate conditional district (amended 6-19-00).

Any nonconforming situation may be continued, maintained, or expanded\nin accordance with the terms of this section. It is also the intent of this section to provide relief\nmechanisms which may allow the use of nonconforming lots under certain conditions.\n(Ord. of 11-19-01(2))\n*Editor's note: An ordinance adopted Nov. 19, 2001, amended art. VI in its entirety, in effect repealing\nand reenacting said article to read as herein set out. The former art. VI, \u00a7\u00a7 21-131--21-139, pertained to\nsimilar subject matter and derived from \u00a7 VII of an ordinance adopted Jan. 19, 1998.\nSec. 21-132. General provisions.\n(a) A nonconforming situation occurs when, on the effective date of this article or subsequent\namendment, an existing lot or structure or use of an existing lot or structure does not conform\nto one (1) or more of the regulations applicable to the district in which the lot or structure is\nlocated. Among other possibilities, a nonconforming situation may arise because a lot does not\nmeet minimum acreage requirements, because structures exceed maximum height limitations,\nbecause the relationship between existing buildings and the land (in such matter as density\nand setback requirement) is not in conformity with this article, because signs do not meet the\nrequirements of this article, or because land or buildings are used for purposes made unlawful\nby this article.\n(b) Unless otherwise specifically provided for in this article and subject to the restrictions and\nqualifications set forth in the remaining sections of this article, nonconforming situations that\nwere otherwise lawful on the effective date of this article may be continued.

When an undeveloped lot has an area or width which does not conform to the\ndimensional requirements of the district where located, but such lot was approved and\nlot of record at the time of adoption of this article or any subsequent amendment which\nrenders such lot nonconforming, then such lot may be used for a use permitted in the\ndistrict where located, provided that the setback dimensions and other requirements,\nexcept area or width, are complied with. Notwithstanding the above standards,\nsetbacks for nonconforming lots of record may be reduced as provided by section 21-\n332 of this chapter.\nb.\nIn the RS, RR and RA residential zones, only a single-family dwelling or a manufactured\nhome shall be permitted on the nonconforming lot, if allowed as a permitted use in that\ndistrict.\n(2) Lots with contiguous frontage in one (1) ownership. When two (2) or more adjoining and\nvacant lots of record are in one (1) ownership and said lots individually have a lot area or lot\nwidth which does not conform to the dimensional requirements of the district where located,\nsuch lots shall be combined to create one (1) or more lots that meet the standards of the district\nwhere located prior to issuance of a zoning permit.\n(3) Other standards for lot sizes.

Conditions for continuance for a change in nonconforming situation.\nSuch nonconforming use of land shall be subject to the following conditions:\n(1) No nonconforming situation shall be changed to another nonconforming situation unless\nsuch use is determined to be of equal or less intensity through a special use permit process\nsubject to procedures established for quasi-judicial hearings. In determining whether a\nproposed nonconforming situation is of equal or less intensity, the board of commissioners\nshall consider the following and determine findings of fact relevant to their determination:\na. Probable traffic impacts of each use.\nb. Parking requirements of each use.\nC. Probable number of persons on the premises of each use at a time of peak demand.\nd.
