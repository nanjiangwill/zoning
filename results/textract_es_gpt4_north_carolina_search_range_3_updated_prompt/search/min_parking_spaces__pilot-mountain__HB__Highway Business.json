Minimum Lot Area. Each lot shall contain the minimum area for the zoning district, use of\nthe lot, and proposed density, if applicable, as established in Section 8.2.\n2. Measurement of Lot Area. The area of a lot is equal to the area contained within all\nestablished property lines. In no case shall portions of a platted lot that extend into a street\nright-of-way be included in the calculation of lot area.\n3. Minimum Dimensional Standards. Each lot shall meet the minimum dimensional standards\nfor width and depth as established in Section 8.2.\n4. Measurement of Lot Dimensions\na. Lot Depth. Lot depth is measured along an imaginary straight line drawn from the\nmidpoint of the front property line of the lot to the midpoint of the rear property line or\nto the most distant point on any other lot line where there is no rear lot line.\nb. Lot Width. Lot width is the horizontal distance between the side lot lines, measured\nat right angles to the lot depth at a point midway between the front and rear lot lines.\n5. Minimum Setbacks for Principal Structures. All principal structures shall observe the\nminimum street, side and rear setbacks as established in Section 8.2.\n6. Measurement of Setbacks. Setbacks shall be measured from the front, side and rear\nproperty lines to the point of the structure nearest to the applicable property line, with the\nexception of street setbacks in the CB district, which shall be measured from the back of the\ncurb as it exists at the time of construction of a new structure or the addition to or alteration of\nan existing structure in the district.\n7. Prevailing Street Setbacks. In the RM and RH districts, new residential structures shall\nobserve the prevailing street setback of existing residential structures on the same side of the\nblock where the new residential structure is proposed. Such setback shall be determined by\nmeasuring the street setback of the two (2) closest existing residential dwellings on the same\nside of the block as the dwelling to which the prevailing setback is being applied. The\nprevailing street setback shall be established as the average of the two measurements, and\nthe structure to which it is being applied shall have a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of its\nfront wall plane built within three (3') feet of the prevailing setback, provided that when the\n\nNEW PAGE 55\nprevailing setback is at least as deep as the minimum required street setback, no portion of\nthe structure may encroach into the street setback unless otherwise expressly permitted.\n8. Permitted Encroachments into Required Setbacks\na. Unenclosed Porches. An unenclosed porch, having three open sides and a roof,\nshall be permitted to encroach up to six (6') feet into a required street setback along\nup to thirty-five percent (35%) of the width of the wall of the structure from which it\nprojects.\nb. Roof Overhangs. A roof overhang of up to twenty-four (24\") inches is permitted into a\nrequired side setback.\nC. Residential Handicap Ramps. A residential handicap ramp shall be permitted to\nencroach into a required street and/or side setback up to fifty percent (50%).\n9. Height Limitations. Principal structures shall not exceed the maximum height limits\nestablished in Section 8.2, unless otherwise expressly permitted.\n10. Measurement of Height.
