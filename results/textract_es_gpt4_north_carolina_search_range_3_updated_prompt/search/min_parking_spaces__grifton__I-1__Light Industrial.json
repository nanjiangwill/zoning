This district is intended to accommodate a variety of low-density\nsingle-family residential and agriculture uses where public water and sewer is not available.\nCompatible uses such as churches and recreational facilities may be allowed. As the community grows\nand public sewer is extended, areas within the RA-20 District may be converted to more intense urban\ndevelopment.\n(C) RA-20 MH Residential District. This district, like the RA-20 District, is intended to\naccommodate low-residential development. However, the focus is on promoting high quality\nmanufactured home development.\n(D) R-14 Residential District. This district is intended to accommodate a limited variety of single-\nfamily dwellings at a density of at least 14,000 square feet where both public water and sewer is\navailable. Compatible uses such as churches and recreational uses may also be allowed. However, high\nimpact uses such as multi-family dwellings or manufactured home parks as defined in this chapter are\nspecifically excluded because they are inconsistent with the single-family residential character of this\ndistrict.\n(E) R-10 Residential District. This district is intended to accommodate a limited variety of single-\nfamily dwellings at a density of at least 10,000 square feet per dwelling where both public water and\nsewer is available. Compatible uses such as churches and recreational uses may also be allowed.\nHowever, high impact uses such as multi-family dwellings or manufactured home parks as defined in\nthis chapter are specifically excluded because they are inconsistent with the single-family residential\ncharacter of this district.\n(F) R-8 Residential District. This district is intended to accommodate a wide variety of housing\ntypes at a density of at least 8,000 square feet per dwelling where public water and sewer is available.\nCompatible uses such as churches and recreational facilities may also be allowed.\n(G) R-6 SF Residential District. In contrast to the R-6 Residential, where a wide variety of\nhousing types are accommodated, this district is intended to accommodate only single-family\ndwellings, at a density of at least 6,000 square feet per dwelling, where public water and sewer is\navailable. Compatible uses such as churches and recreational facilities may also be allowed.\n(H) R-6 Residential District. This district is intended to accommodate a wider variety of housing\ntypes (single-family dwellings as well as duplexes, multi-family dwellings and manufactured home\nparks) than in the R-6 SF District, at a density of at least 6,000 square feet, where public water and\nsewer is available.

The following business districts are hereby established: CBD, B-1.\n\nNEW PAGE 32\n(B) CBD - Central Business District.\n(1) This district is intended for areas within the town designated to accommodate the type of\ncommercial and governmental development that has characterized the central downtown area of the\ntown. Older structures are clustered together with common walls with only sidewalks separating them\nfrom the public street. Parking is provided directly on the street or to the rear of the building. Some of\nthe newer development has departed from older pattern. Individual units located on lots with setbacks\nand off-street parking. Future development here shall be consistent with the pattern that has already\noccurred in order to enhance the small town, pedestrian scale that characterizes the core area of the\ntown.\n(2) (a) Only low impact uses that are compatible with the goal of preserving the small town\ncharacter of the town will be allowed. Low impact activities are characterized as uses that:\n1. Are located in small structures, usually under 5,000 square feet on lots\ncontaining less than one acre;\n2. Operated with less than ten employees;\n3. Normally operate between the hours of 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.; and\n4.\nAre primarily conducted inside an enclosed structure with few negative external\nimpacts such as outdoor storage of equipment or products, high noise levels or offensive odors.\n(b) (These are not precise development criteria, but more illustrations of low impact\nuses.)\n(C) B-1 District (Highway Business).\n(1) This district is intended for areas within the town's planning jurisdiction established for\nhigher impact commercial uses than in the CBD District. The town wants to encourage this type of\ndevelopment along major highways in clusters at strategic locations rather than in continuous strips.\nHigh impact is defined as activities that:\n(a) Are located in large structures, often over 5,000 square feet in area on lots larger than\none acre;\n(b) Employ more than ten employees;\n(c) Can generate a large number of customers at any one time;\n(d) Operate during the daytime and evening hours; and\n(e) Conduct business inside and outside an enclosed structure with some negative\n\nNEW PAGE 33\nexternal impacts such as outdoor storage of materials (equipment, products or raw materials) that can\ngenerate high noise levels or offensive odors.\n(2) Uses in this area will be discouraged that undermine the integrity of businesses in the\ndowntown area. In addition the community wants to promote new development where signage is\nin\nscale with the structure and the site is appropriately landscaped. Each project needs to design its\ndriveways and parking areas SO they provide convenient and safe vehicular flow and minimize traffic\ndisruption. (These are not precise development criteria, but more illustrations of low impact uses.)\n(D) Neighborhood Commercial District. This district is intended for areas within the town's\nplanning jurisdiction established for low impact commercial activities along local streets that are\ncompatible with adjoining residential areas. The intent is to accommodate a limited number of uses that\nwill allow property owners to pursue economic opportunities while minimizing any disruptive\ncharacteristics such as high traffic volume on local streets.\n(E) Office/Institutional District. This district is intended for areas within the town's planning\njurisdiction that are established to promote the development of moderately intensive commercial and\ninstitutional uses that are characterized more as a service provider than selling a product. Generally,\nthese uses can provide a transition from a commercial (where a wide range of goods and services are\nsold) and residential districts (where only residential uses and a limited number of compatible uses are\npermitted.)\n(Ord. passed 1-11-2005, \u00a7 3-2)\n\u00a7 152.097 INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.\n(A) General.
