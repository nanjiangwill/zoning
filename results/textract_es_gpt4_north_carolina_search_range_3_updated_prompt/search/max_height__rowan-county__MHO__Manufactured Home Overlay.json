Waivers. New development activities in a WS-IV-PA subject to the\nrequirements of this subsection may request the Board of Commissioners\nconsider granting a waiver from the High Density standards and instead allow\nthe project to utilize the provisions of Section 21-33(2)(f)(2). In granting a\nwaiver, the Board of Commissioners shall affirm the project is not consistent\nwith the purpose and intent of this subsection; water quality impacts resulting\nfrom the development project will be minimized; and the waiver lends itself to a\nbetter project design.\n4. Density Averaging.\na. Purpose and Intent\n1. Purpose. Density Averaging provides non-residential developments in\nwatershed overlay districts the option to aggregate density between two\nnon-contiguous properties for the purpose of compliance with the water\nsupply watershed development standards of 21-33(2)(d). This process\ninvolves the allowable built upon area of a donating property being\ntransferred to a receiving property to comply with the built-upon limits for the\nrespective water supply watershed.\n2. Intent. Density Averaging is intended as an alternative method of\ncompliance for built-upon limits within the subject parcel boundary,\nstormwater control measures with High Density standards, or SNIA\napplications for non-residential development.\nb. Eligibility. An applicant may average development density between two non-\ncontiguous properties (i.e. one (1) Donating Property and one (1) Receiving\nProperty) for purposes of achieving compliance with the water supply watershed\ndevelopment standards if all of the following circumstances exist:\n1. The properties are within the same water supply watershed, located\nentirely within Rowan County's Zoning Jurisdiction. Properties located in the\ncritical area of the watershed are not eligible to be a Receiving Property but\nmay be used as the Donating Property for projects outside the critical area.\n2. Overall project density on the collective Receiving and donating Property\nmeets applicable built-upon area requirements (existing and proposed) as\nprescribed in section 21-33(2)(d). Built-upon area received from the critical\narea of the watershed is still subject to the requirements of the critical area.\nBuilt-upon area calculations from both properties including any remaining\nbalance of the Donating Property shall be provided.\n3. The Donating Property must be an existing or proposed tract of land\nhaving sufficient acreage or square footage to offset all, or requisite portion\nof the built-upon area on the Receiving Property. If the Donating Property will\nbe a new tract and it is not exempt under sec. 22-6, the new tract must meet\nall lot requirements except for road frontage. At a minimum, access shall be\nsufficient to provide vehicular access for tract maintenance.\n4. The Donating Property will remain in a perpetually undeveloped and\nvegetated or natural state and will be managed by one of the following\nmeans:\n48\n\nNEW PAGE 49\nAs of 01/17/23\na. Conveyed and accepted by a local government as a public park or\ngreenway;\nb. Placed under a conservation easement or farmland preservation\neasement; or\nC. Recorded plat and deed restriction;\nApplicants have the burden of demonstration to the Board of\nCommissioners their proposal will ensure perpetual compliance with this\nchapter.\n5. The following areas shall not be eligible for use as the Donating Property:\na. Any area within a floodway or non-encroachment area as identified\non the Rowan County Flood Insurance Rate Maps.\nb. Any dedicated or observed road easement or right of way.\nC. Any dedicated utility easement or right of way.\nd. Any railroad right of way\ne. Any area within a stream buffer as required by section 21-213(h).\nf. Any area identified as a wetland.\ng. Any septic drain fields identified by the Rowan County\nEnvironmental Health Department.\nh. Any area within an existing conservation easement.\n6. Properties that have received a SNIA permit, utilize the High-Density\nstandards from section 21-33(2), or have received a watershed variance are\nnot eligible for Density Averaging.\n7. The proposed development is a non-residential use.\n8. Both the Receiving Property and the Donating Property can be in joint or\nseparate ownership so long as all other requirements of this section are met.\n9. Development permitted under density averaging and meeting applicable\nlow-density requirements shall transport stormwater runoff by vegetated\nconveyances to the maximum extent practicable as certified by a North\nCarolina Professional Engineer.\n10. Built upon areas are designed and located to minimize stormwater runoff\nimpact to the receiving waters, minimize concentrated stormwater flow,\nmaximize the use of sheet flow through vegetated areas, and maximize the\nflow length through vegetated areas as certified by a North Carolina\nProfessional Engineer.\n11. Vegetated setbacks on both properties meet the minimum requirements\nof 21-213(h)\nC. Application. Projects that meet the eligibility requirements in subsection\n(2)(f)(4) may submit a Density Averaging permit application for consideration by\nthe Board of Commissioners subject to the process outlined in section 21-318\nof this chapter.\n(3) Agricultural Overlay, AO. The purpose of the Agricultural Overlay District is to provide\n49\n\nNEW PAGE 50\nAs of 01/17/23\nadditional requirements to encourage the maintenance of viable agricultural areas. This\ndistrict should be comprised primarily of open farm land used for extensive agricultural and\nlivestock production. The district will provide guidelines to promote the maintenance of the\ngeneral rural character of openness. Development in this district shall be subject to the\ncriteria below.\na. Uses allowed. The following agricultural and related uses are allowed:\nb. Development of property not part of a bona fide farm located in AO District. Within the\nAO district setback of fifty (50) feet shall be provided from land in agricultural use.\n(4) Manufactured Home Overlay, MHO.\na. Purpose and intent. The purpose of the Manufactured Home Overlay is to provide for\nthe development of Type II and Type III manufactured homes in established residential\nzoning districts while maintaining the overall residential, rural or agricultural character\nof those districts. Because of the potential impacts of the establishment of this district,\nit has prescribed conditions contained in this subsection to ensure compatibility with\nthe surrounding area.\nb. Permitted districts. The Manufactured Home Overlay supplements the range of uses\nand regulations in the underlying district. The overlay is allowed in the following districts\npermitting residential development; RA, RR, CBI and MFR. All other uses in the\nunderlying district shall continue to remain in effect and subject to the regulations and\nconditions of approval of the underlying district.\nC.\nProcedures for district designation. The following procedures are required for MHO\ndistrict designation:\n1. Designation as an MHO district shall require a rezoning as provided in article XIV\nof this chapter.\n2. Upon approval of an MHO district by the board of commissioners, the area so\ndesignated shall be labeled \"MHO\" on the zoning map.\nd. Review. The petitioner seeking to rezone property to this district must illustrate that the\nproposed development will comply with the evaluation criteria contained in section 21-\n59. A site plan is required as provided by section 21-52. In approving the district\nreasonable conditions may be included to protect the public health, safety and welfare\nand to meet the intent of this chapter.\ne. Development standards.
