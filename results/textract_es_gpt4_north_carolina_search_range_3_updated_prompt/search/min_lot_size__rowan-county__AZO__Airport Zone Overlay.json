Rear yard triangular lot.\nA triangular shaped lot where the side lot lines intersect at the rear of the lot, shall provide a\nrear yard as required for that district. The rear yard shall be determined by locating a point on each\nside lot line measured from the intersection of the side yards toward the front of the lot, and\nconnecting these two (2) lines.\n(Ord. of 1-19-98, \u00a7 V)\nSec. 21-84.

This district is primarily designed to provide rural business\nopportunities typically in the form of small retail, service, office, and light manufacturing uses\nto serve the community's existing and future needs for goods, services, and employment\nopportunities. Standards within the district are intended to promote context sensitive\ndevelopment appropriately scaled and organized in a manner that would not be detrimental to\nthe surrounding area. Development within this district would contain impacts inherently more\nintensive than those associated with uses permitted with special requirements in the RA district\nbut significantly less than those in CBI zoned areas. The NB district is generally appropriate\nin areas identified by an adopted land use plan for rural businesses located on identified minor\nand major thoroughfares and within community nodes. However, additional consideration may\nbe necessary as some thoroughfare segments would not be conducive to NB designation due\nto surrounding land use and / or potential negative impacts such as traffic, noise, and visual\nimpacts. Generally, the NB district shall be two (2) acres or larger. However a lot of record,\nsmaller than two (2) acres may be considered for rezoning to NB if the owner of the lot does\nnot own adjacent property which may be included in the rezoning request.\n(i)\nInstitutional, INST. The purpose of the Institutional district is to recognize and permit the\ncreation of defined areas for the unified and orderly development of major cultural, educational,\nmedical, governmental, religious and other institutions in order to support and enhance their\nbenefits to the community in a manner which protects adjacent residential uses. Trade school\nfacilities teaching a trade, for example truck driving or welding, which have that activity on site,\nshall meet zoning requirements for that use.\n(j) Airport Industrial, Al. This district is established for airport-specific or related businesses that\nwill be located, designed, constructed and maintained in a manner compatible with aviation\noperations. Uses in the Al district tend to focus on manufacturing, transportation, services and\npublic administration with standards designed to promote safety and compatibility with the Mid-\nCarolina Regional Airport Layout Plan (ALP) adopted by the Rowan County Board of\nCommissioners. Any use(s) or proposed structure(s) located on Rowan County property is\nsubject to approval by the Rowan County Board of Commissioners and shall comply with Mid-\nCarolina Regional's minimum standards and applicable Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)\nrules and regulations including FAA 7460-1 Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration.\nProperties owned by Rowan County, NC that encompass and adjoin the Mid-Carolina Regional\nAirport will comprise the district.

Overlay districts.\nOverlay districts are zoning districts, which are applied only in conjunction with other zoning\ndistricts, and may grant additional use of development requirements upon the underlying zoning\ndistricts. The effect is to have both the overlay district and the underlying zoning controlling the\nuse and development of the lot. Overlay districts are applicable on an area wide basis to support\nspecific public policy objectives and as such should be consistent with adopted land use plans.\nOverlay districts may be applied to conventional and conditional zoning districts. An overlay district\nmay be initiated as an amendment by the board of commissioners, planning board, planning staff,\nor the property owner or their designated representative.\n42\n\nNEW PAGE 43\nAs of 01/17/23\n(1) Airport Zone Overlay, AZO. The zones and restrictions established in this subsection are\ndesigned to limit the height of structures surrounding the county airport's established\nelevation of seven hundred seventy-two and three tenths (772.3) feet above mean sea\nlevel (msl) in order to prevent hazards to the lives and property of the users of the airport\nand the occupants of land in the vicinity.\na. Uses allowed. The use requirements of the underlying district apply to the AZO district.\nHowever, all uses must be in conformance with the provisions of this section.\nb.\nEstablishment of zones. To carry out the provisions of this section, there are hereby\ncreated and established certain civil airport imaginary surfaces which consist of the land\nlying beneath the approach surface, including the non-precision and precision\napproach zone; transitional surface; horizontal surface; conical surface; and primary\nsurface. These civil airport imaginary surfaces are established with relation to the\nRowan County Airport runway and proposed extensions of thereof. Such imaginary\nsurfaces are defined in Section 21-4 and shown on the Official County Airport Zoning\nMap dated September 19, 2022, which is adopted and incorporated herein by\nreference. The size of each such imaginary surface is based on the category of each\nrunway according to the type of approach available or planned for that runway. The\nslope and dimensions of the approach surface, applied to each end of a runway, are\ndetermined by the most precise approach procedure existing or planned for the runway\nend.\nC. Height limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure shall be\nerected, altered or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow within the AZO\ndistrict extending or projecting into the lowest applicable imaginary surfaces defined\nherein.\n(2) Water Supply Watershed Overlays, WSO. The purpose of the watershed overlay is to\nprovide for the protection of public water supplies as required by the Water Supply\nWatershed Classification and Protection Act (G.S. 143-214.5) and regulations promulgated\ntherein. The watershed overlays may be an overlay in any conventional or conditional\nzoning district established in this chapter.
