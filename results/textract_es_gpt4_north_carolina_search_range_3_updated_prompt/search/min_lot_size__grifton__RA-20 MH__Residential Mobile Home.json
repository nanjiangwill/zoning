The following residential districts are hereby established: RA-20, RA-20 MH, R-14,\n\nNEW PAGE 31\nR-10, R-8, R-6SF, R-6.\n(B) RA-20 Residential District. This district is intended to accommodate a variety of low-density\nsingle-family residential and agriculture uses where public water and sewer is not available.\nCompatible uses such as churches and recreational facilities may be allowed. As the community grows\nand public sewer is extended, areas within the RA-20 District may be converted to more intense urban\ndevelopment.\n(C) RA-20 MH Residential District. This district, like the RA-20 District, is intended to\naccommodate low-residential development. However, the focus is on promoting high quality\nmanufactured home development.\n(D) R-14 Residential District. This district is intended to accommodate a limited variety of single-\nfamily dwellings at a density of at least 14,000 square feet where both public water and sewer is\navailable. Compatible uses such as churches and recreational uses may also be allowed. However, high\nimpact uses such as multi-family dwellings or manufactured home parks as defined in this chapter are\nspecifically excluded because they are inconsistent with the single-family residential character of this\ndistrict.\n(E) R-10 Residential District. This district is intended to accommodate a limited variety of single-\nfamily dwellings at a density of at least 10,000 square feet per dwelling where both public water and\nsewer is available. Compatible uses such as churches and recreational uses may also be allowed.\nHowever, high impact uses such as multi-family dwellings or manufactured home parks as defined in\nthis chapter are specifically excluded because they are inconsistent with the single-family residential\ncharacter of this district.\n(F) R-8 Residential District. This district is intended to accommodate a wide variety of housing\ntypes at a density of at least 8,000 square feet per dwelling where public water and sewer is available.\nCompatible uses such as churches and recreational facilities may also be allowed.\n(G) R-6 SF Residential District. In contrast to the R-6 Residential, where a wide variety of\nhousing types are accommodated, this district is intended to accommodate only single-family\ndwellings, at a density of at least 6,000 square feet per dwelling, where public water and sewer is\navailable. Compatible uses such as churches and recreational facilities may also be allowed.\n(H) R-6 Residential District. This district is intended to accommodate a wider variety of housing\ntypes (single-family dwellings as well as duplexes, multi-family dwellings and manufactured home\nparks) than in the R-6 SF District, at a density of at least 6,000 square feet, where public water and\nsewer is available. Compatible uses such as churches and recreational facilities may also be allowed.\n(Ord. passed 1-11-2005, \u00a7 3-1)\n\u00a7 152.096 BUSINESS DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.\n(A) General.
