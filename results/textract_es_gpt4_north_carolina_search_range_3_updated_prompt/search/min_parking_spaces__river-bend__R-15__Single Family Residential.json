Notwithstanding division (D)(1 above, any structure used for single family residential\npurposes (other than manufactured homes) and maintained as a non-conforming use may\nbe enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so long as the enlargement\nor replacement does not create new non-conformities or increase the extent of existing\nnon-conformities.
