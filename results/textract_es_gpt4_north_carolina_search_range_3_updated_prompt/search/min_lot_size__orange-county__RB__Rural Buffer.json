character of the rural community that might otherwise be lost or\nmarginalized with a conventional development.\n(B)\nTo accomplish this goal, greater flexibility and creativity in the design of such\ndevelopments is encouraged and allowed. Specific objectives are as follows:\n(1)\nTo preserve areas of the county with productive soils for continued agricultural\nand forestry use by preserving blocks of land large enough to allow for efficient\noperations.\n(2)\nTo encourage the preservation and improvement of habitat for various forms of\nwildlife and to create new woodlands through natural succession and\nreforestation where appropriate.\n(3)\nTo minimize site disturbance and erosion by retaining existing vegetation and\navoiding development on steep slopes.\n(4)\nTo preserve open land, including those areas containing unique and sensitive\nfeatures such as natural areas and wildlife habitats, steep slopes, streams,\nwetlands, and floodplains.\n(5)\nTo preserve scenic views and elements of the county's rural character, and to\nminimize perceived density by minimizing views of new development from\nexisting roads.\n(6)\nTo preserve and maintain historic and archaeological sites and structures that\nserve as significant visible reminders of the county's social and architectural\nhistory.\n(7)\nTo provide for the active and low impact recreational needs of county residents,\nincluding implementation of the Master Recreation & Parks Plan.\n(8)\nTo provide greater efficiency in the siting of services and infrastructure by\nreducing road length, utility runs, and the amount of paving for development.\n(9)\nTo create compact neighborhoods accessible to Common Open Space amenities\nand with a strong identity.\n(10)\nTo strategically organize and preserve Common Open Space areas within
