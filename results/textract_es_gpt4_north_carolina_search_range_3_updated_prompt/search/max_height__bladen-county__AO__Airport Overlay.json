It is hereby found that an obstruction has a potential for endangering the lives and\nproperty of users of Bladen County Airports, and property or occupants of land in its vicinity;\nthat an obstruction may affect existing or future instrument approaches of Bladen County\nAirports; and that an obstruction may reduce the size of areas available for landing, take-off\nand maneuvering of aircrafts, thus tending to destroy or impair the unity of Bladen County\nAirports and the public investment therein.\nFurther, it is the intent and purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety, and general\nwelfare by regulating and restricting the development of structures for human occupancy within an area\nsurrounding airports within Bladen County to protect residents from harmful noise. Therefore, the\nAirport Overlay District is established, which includes Height restriction and Noise restriction zones\nwithin the overlay (see section 11 for definition of Overlay District).\n175 of 446\n3/9/24, 13:42\nCELL (1, 1): \nSide abutting a lot zone RA or R\nCELL (1, 2): \n250 ft.\nCELL (1, 3): \n250 ft.\nCELL (1, 4): \n250 ft.\nCELL (2, 1): \nSide abutting Street\nCELL (2, 2): \n75 ft.\nCELL (2, 3): \n75 ft.\nCELL (2, 4): \n75 ft.\nCELL (3, 1): \nRear\nCELL (3, 2): \n100 ft.\nCELL (3, 3): \n100 ft.\nCELL (3, 4): \n100 ft.\nCELL (4, 1): \nRear abutting a lot zones RA or R\nCELL (4, 2): \n150 ft.\nCELL (4, 3): \n150 ft.\nCELL (4, 4): \n150 ft.\nCELL (5, 1): \nMaximum Building Height\nCELL (5, 2): \n40 ft.\nCELL (5, 3): \n40 ft.\nCELL (5, 4): \n40 ft.\n\nNEW PAGE 176\nBladen County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(b) Permitted Principal Uses and Structures.\n(1) Shall be the same as those in the underlying zoning districts with the exception of the\nprovisions in Section 8.6(g). Noise Restrictions and the following:\nNo use may be made to land or water within any zone established by this section in such a\nmanner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication\nbetween the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights\nand others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of\nthe airport or otherwise in any way create a hazard or endanger the landing, takeoff, or\nmaneuvering of aircraft to use the airport.\n(c) Permitted Accessory Uses and Structures. Shall be the same as those in the underlying zoning\ndistricts with the exception of the provisions in Section 8.6(b) and 8.6(g).\n(d) Preexisting Uses (Also see Article 14, Nonconforming Situations).\n(1) Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this Section, the owner\nof any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the\ninstallation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be\ndeemed necessary by the Airport Commission, to indicate to the operators of aircraft in\nthe vicinity of the airport, the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights\nshall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the Airport Commission if\nthe requirement is in the vicinity of the airport.\n(e) Dimensional Requirements. Shall be the same as those in the underlying zoning districts with\nthe exception of the provisions of any part of this section.\n(f) Height Restriction Zones. In order to carry out the provisions of this section, certain zones,\nwhich include all of the land lying within the approach zones, transitional zones, horizontal\nzones, and conical zones as they apply to a particular airport are established and defined on\nthe Zoning Map. An area located in more than one (1) of the following zones is considered to\nbe only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. Nothing in this Section shall be\nconstrued as prohibiting the growth, construction, or maintenance of any tree or structure to\na height that is below the limitations set forth in this Section. The various zones are hereby\nestablished and defined as follows:\n(1) Approach zone a (precision instrument runway). The inner edge of this approach zone\ncoincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone\nexpands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet\nfrom the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.\na. Height Restricted Area. Slopes fifty (50) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at\nthe end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a\n176 of 446\n3/9/24, 13:42\n\nNEW PAGE 177\nBladen County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nhorizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline; thence slopes\nupward forty (40) feet horizontally for each foot vertically to an additional horizontal\ndistance of 40,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.\n(2) Approach zone b (runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum as low as 3/4 mile non-\nprecision instrument). The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of\nthe primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly\nto a width of 4,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its\ncenterline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.\na. Height Restricted Area. Slopes upward thirty-four (34) feet horizontally for each foot\nvertically beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and\nextending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway\ncenterline.\n(3) Transitional zones. These zones are hereby established as the area beneath the\ntransitional surfaces. These surfaces extend outward and upward beginning 500 feet each\nside of the runway centerline at a slope of 7:1 to the primary surface. The runway\ncenterline extended at a slope of seven (7) feet horizontally for each foot vertically from\nthe sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and\nconical surfaces. Transitional zones for those portions of the precision approach zones,\nwhich project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of\n5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach zones and at 90-degree\nangles to the extended runway centerline.\na. Height Restricted Area. Slopes seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning\nat the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach\nsurface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation. In addition\nto the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven (7) feet outward for\neach foot upward beginning at the sides of and the same elevation as the approach\nsurface, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Where the precision\ninstrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are\nestablished height limits sloping seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning\nat the sides of and the same elevation as the approach surface and extending a\nhorizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90 degree angles to the extended\nrunway centerline from the edge of the approach surface.\n(4) Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is hereby established by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet\nradii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway, and connecting\nthe adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not\ninclude the approach and transitional zones.\n177 of 446\n3/9/24, 13:42\n", "page_number": 175, "page_range": [175, 176, 177], "highlight": ["10 <em>feet</em> in building <em>height</em>.\n(2) Complete fencing with vegetative screening if the abutting land is in", "(f) General Provisions: (Refer to Article 10).\n8.7 - <em>AIRPORT</em> <em>OVERLAY</em> DISTRICT\n(a) Intent.", "Therefore, the\n<em>Airport</em> <em>Overlay</em> District is established, which includes <em>Height</em> restriction and Noise restriction", "CELL (4, 4): \n150 <em>ft</em>.\nCELL (5, 1): \n<em>Maximum</em> <em>Building</em> <em>Height</em>\nCELL (5, 2): \n40 <em>ft</em>.", "(e) <em>Dimensional</em> <em>Requirements</em>."], "score": 29.207592, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Airport Overlay\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"AO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"AO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"AO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 261\nBladen County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n11.00 p.m. and 8.00) a.m. on weekdays and Saturdays, or during the period from 11.00\np.m. Saturday until 8.00 a.m. Monday.\n(2) Screening and Buffering.
