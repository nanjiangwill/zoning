You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Stewarts Creek Watershed Protected Area\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"SCWS-PA\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage_pavement\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: coverage, impervious surface, lot coverage by impervious surfaces, lot coverage, max imperv. coverage, max impervious coverage. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. If Stewarts Creek Watershed Protected Area (SCWS-PA) is referring\nto a general residential district, we are only interested in the requirement of\nmax_lot_coverage_pavement for single-family homes. However, if it is referring to a specific district,\nlike Multi Family Residential (MFR), General Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested\nin the requirement of max_lot_coverage_pavement for Stewarts Creek Watershed Protected Area (SCWS-PA).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \"\\n\" and any type of special characters.\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // The value of max_lot_coverage_pavement extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage_pavement records the amount of land that may be covered by both buildings and other impervious surfaces, such as pavement. If the document specifies the maximum lot coverage by buildings only, DO NOT include it. If the document refers to maximum lot coverage generally, you can assume it includes both buildings and impervious surfaces and include it. If the document only specifies impervious surface coverage, it can be considered as building coverage and included in the answer.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage_pavement is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage_pavement and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 100\nAs of 01/17/23\nUses listed as SR in the SCWS-PA District in section 21-113, the table of uses, shall comply with the\nfollowing criteria, as applicable:\n(1) Site plan. A site plan shall be provided showing the existing lot and all existing and proposed\nbuildings. As well as all criteria required herein.\n(2) Lighting. The lighting shall be shielded to prevent light and glare spillover to adjacent\nresidentially developed properties.\n(3) Minimum zone lot size. The minimum zone lot size shall be two (2) acres.\n(4) Building size. The maximum building size per parcel shall not exceed ten (10) percent of the\nlot area up to ten thousand (10,000) square foot and five (5) percent of the lot acreage\nthereafter up to twenty-five thousand (25,000) sq.ft. Multiple buildings may be used in\ncalculating the maximum allowable building size.\n(5) Impervious surface. The maximum impervious surface shall not exceed sixty-five (65)\npercent of the lot.\n(6) Hours of operation. Hours of operation shall not exceed 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.\n(7) Parking. Parking shall be as prescribed in article VII, Parking, for that use.\n(8) Signage. Shall be as prescribed in article VIII, Signs, for the underlying district.\n(9) Noise. Noise shall not exceed the decibel levels during time periods prescribed in section 21-\n241 for construction, manufacturing, transportation, communications, electric, gas and\nsanitary services, wholesale, and service uses.\n(10) Outdoor storage. All outside storage areas including dumpsters shall be:\na. Sited to the rear of the building;\nb. Not within the required setbacks.\nC.\nNotwithstanding other requirements of this subsection, outdoor storage shall be\ncompletely screened from adjacent residentially zoned property\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\"The maximum impervious surface shall not exceed sixty-five (65)\\npercent of the lot.\"],\n    \"rationale\": \"The section state the max_lot_coverage_pavement for district SCWS-PA.\",\n    \"answer\": \"65\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 25\nARTICLE VI.\nGENERAL PROVISIONS AND SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS\nD.\nDimensional Requirements for Low Density Residential Districts\nSECTION 6.03.\nSCWS-PA LIMITED LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT\nC.\nSpecial Uses\nThe following uses are permitted subject to the requirements of this district, additional\nregulations and requirements imposed by the Board of Commissioners as provided in Article\nVIII.\n1.\nChurches and cemeteries.\n2.\nHome occupations under provisions of Section 7.07.\n3.\nDuplex apartments: lot minimum size 30,000 square feet.\n4.\nPublic utility facilities: subject to provision of a vegetated buffer strip at least ten (10)\nfeet in height.\n5.\nGroup developments under the provisions of Section 7.05 with a density of not more\nthan three (8) dwelling units per acre.
