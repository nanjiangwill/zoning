You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"General Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"GB\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If General Business\n(GB) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor General Business (GB).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\"). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 165\n165/167\nCELL (1, 1):\nRestaurants (with drive through service)\nCELL (1, 2):\nOne (1) space for each four (4) seating\naccommodations, plus one (1) space for each\ntwo (2) employees on the shift of largest\nemployment; and Three (3) stacking spaces\nfor each drive through window.\nCELL (2, 1):\nSchool, Elementary and Middle (both public\nand private):\nCELL (2, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each classroom and\nadministrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee and one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (3, 1):\nSchool, High School (both public and private)\nCELL (3, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each fifteen (15)\nstudents for which the building was designed,\nplus one (1) parking space for each classroom\nand administrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee, plus one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (4, 1):\nShopping Centers, large and small\nCELL (4, 2):\nOne (1) space for each three hundred (300)\nsquare feet of gross floor area.\nCELL (5, 1):\nSingle Family, Duplex, Condominiums,\nManufactured Homes, and similar residential\nCELL (5, 2):\nTwo (2) spaces per dwelling unit\nCELL (6, 1):\nTerminals, Bus\nCELL (6, 2):\nOne (1) space for each employee and one (1)\nspace for each bus loading ramp and track.\nCELL (7, 1):\nStadiums, Theaters, and similar uses\ninvolving the assembling of persons:\nCELL (7, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each four (4) seats\nin the largest assembly room.

Minimum Lot Area. Each lot shall contain the minimum area for the zoning district, use of\nthe lot, and proposed density, if applicable, as established in Section 8.2.\n2. Measurement of Lot Area. The area of a lot is equal to the area contained within all\nestablished property lines. In no case shall portions of a platted lot that extend into a street\nright-of-way be included in the calculation of lot area.\n3. Minimum Dimensional Standards. Each lot shall meet the minimum dimensional standards\nfor width and depth as established in Section 8.2.\n4. Measurement of Lot Dimensions\na. Lot Depth. Lot depth is measured along an imaginary straight line drawn from the\nmidpoint of the front property line of the lot to the midpoint of the rear property line or\nto the most distant point on any other lot line where there is no rear lot line.\nb. Lot Width. Lot width is the horizontal distance between the side lot lines, measured\nat right angles to the lot depth at a point midway between the front and rear lot lines.\n5. Minimum Setbacks for Principal Structures. All principal structures shall observe the\nminimum street, side and rear setbacks as established in Section 8.2.\n6. Measurement of Setbacks. Setbacks shall be measured from the front, side and rear\nproperty lines to the point of the structure nearest to the applicable property line, with the\nexception of street setbacks in the CB district, which shall be measured from the back of the\ncurb as it exists at the time of construction of a new structure or the addition to or alteration of\nan existing structure in the district.\n7. Prevailing Street Setbacks. In the RM and RH districts, new residential structures shall\nobserve the prevailing street setback of existing residential structures on the same side of the\nblock where the new residential structure is proposed. Such setback shall be determined by\nmeasuring the street setback of the two (2) closest existing residential dwellings on the same\nside of the block as the dwelling to which the prevailing setback is being applied. The\nprevailing street setback shall be established as the average of the two measurements, and\nthe structure to which it is being applied shall have a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of its\nfront wall plane built within three (3') feet of the prevailing setback, provided that when the\n\n\nNEW PAGE 55\nprevailing setback is at least as deep as the minimum required street setback, no portion of\nthe structure may encroach into the street setback unless otherwise expressly permitted.\n8. Permitted Encroachments into Required Setbacks\na. Unenclosed Porches. An unenclosed porch, having three open sides and a roof,\nshall be permitted to encroach up to six (6') feet into a required street setback along\nup to thirty-five percent (35%) of the width of the wall of the structure from which it\nprojects.\nb. Roof Overhangs. A roof overhang of up to twenty-four (24\") inches is permitted into a\nrequired side setback.\nC. Residential Handicap Ramps. A residential handicap ramp shall be permitted to\nencroach into a required street and/or side setback up to fifty percent (50%).\n9. Height Limitations. Principal structures shall not exceed the maximum height limits\nestablished in Section 8.2, unless otherwise expressly permitted.\n10. Measurement of Height. The height of a structure shall be measured from the finished\ngrade adjacent to the structure at its central point along the front building line to the highest\npoint of the coping of a flat roof or to the mean height level between the leaves and ridge of a\npitched roof.\n11. Exceptions to Height Limitations. Chimneys, steeples, communication antennas, spires,\nand similar unoccupied structures or architectural features may exceed the maximum height\nlimit for the district in which it is located by a maximum of twenty-five (25') feet, or as\notherwise explicitly allowed by the UDO.\n8.2 Dimensional And Density Standards By District\nThis Section establishes the minimum dimensional and density standards for each base zoning\ndistrict.\nCELL (1, 1): \nDistrict\nCELL (1, 2): \nMinimum Lot Size\nCELL (1, 3): \nMinimum Lot Size\nCELL (1, 4): \nMinimum Yard\nCELL (1, 5): \nSize\nCELL (1, 6): \nMinimum Yard\nCELL (1, 7): \nMaximum\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nSquare Feet per\nDwelling Unit\nCELL (2, 3): \nLot Width at\nBuilding Line\nCELL (2, 4): \nFro\nnt\nCELL (2, 5): \nSid\ne\nCELL (2, 6): \nRea\nr\nCELL (2, 7): \nHeight\nCELL (3, 1): \nRA, Residential - Agricultural\nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (3, 4): \nCELL (3, 5): \nCELL (3, 6): \nCELL (3, 7): \nCELL (4, 1): \nWithout either public\nwater or sewer\nCELL (4, 2): \n30,000\nCELL (4, 3): \n100\nCELL (4, 4): \n30\nCELL (4, 5): \n102\nCELL (4, 6): \n20\nCELL (4, 7): \n35\nCELL (5, 1): \nWith public water\nCELL (5, 2): \n20,000\nCELL (5, 3): \n100\nCELL (5, 4): \n30\nCELL (5, 5): \n102\nCELL (5, 6): \n20\nCELL (5, 7): \n35\nCELL (6, 1): \nWith public water and\nsewer\nCELL (6, 2): \n20,000\nCELL (6, 3): \n100\nCELL (6, 4): \n30\nCELL (6, 5): \n102\nCELL (6, 6): \n20\nCELL (6, 7): \n35\nCELL (7, 1): \nRL, Residential - Low Density\nCELL (7, 2): \nRL, Residential - Low Density\nCELL (7, 3): \nCELL (7, 4): \nCELL (7, 5): \nCELL (7, 6): \nCELL (7, 7): \nCELL (8, 1): \nWithout either public\nwater or sewer\nCELL (8, 2): \n30,000\nCELL (8, 3): \n80\nCELL (8, 4): \n30\nCELL (8, 5): \n102\nCELL (8, 6): \n20\nCELL (8, 7): \n35\nCELL (9, 1): \nWith public water\nCELL (9, 2): \n20,000\nCELL (9, 3): \n80\nCELL (9, 4): \n30\nCELL (9, 5): \n102\nCELL (9, 6): \n20\nCELL (9, 7): \n35\n\n\nNEW PAGE 56\nNOTES TO TABLE\n2 - Corner lot add ten additional feet on the side street, not to exceed minimum front setback.\n8.3 Accessory Structures\n1.
