You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Commercial, Business, Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CBI\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Commercial, Business, Industrial\n(CBI) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Commercial, Business, Industrial (CBI).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft).

This district is primarily designed to provide rural business\nopportunities typically in the form of small retail, service, office, and light manufacturing uses\nto serve the community's existing and future needs for goods, services, and employment\nopportunities. Standards within the district are intended to promote context sensitive\ndevelopment appropriately scaled and organized in a manner that would not be detrimental to\nthe surrounding area. Development within this district would contain impacts inherently more\nintensive than those associated with uses permitted with special requirements in the RA district\nbut significantly less than those in CBI zoned areas. The NB district is generally appropriate\nin areas identified by an adopted land use plan for rural businesses located on identified minor\nand major thoroughfares and within community nodes. However, additional consideration may\nbe necessary as some thoroughfare segments would not be conducive to NB designation due\nto surrounding land use and / or potential negative impacts such as traffic, noise, and visual\nimpacts. Generally, the NB district shall be two (2) acres or larger. However a lot of record,\nsmaller than two (2) acres may be considered for rezoning to NB if the owner of the lot does\nnot own adjacent property which may be included in the rezoning request.\n(i)\nInstitutional, INST. The purpose of the Institutional district is to recognize and permit the\ncreation of defined areas for the unified and orderly development of major cultural, educational,\nmedical, governmental, religious and other institutions in order to support and enhance their\nbenefits to the community in a manner which protects adjacent residential uses. Trade school\nfacilities teaching a trade, for example truck driving or welding, which have that activity on site,\nshall meet zoning requirements for that use.\n(j) Airport Industrial, Al. This district is established for airport-specific or related businesses that\nwill be located, designed, constructed and maintained in a manner compatible with aviation\noperations. Uses in the Al district tend to focus on manufacturing, transportation, services and\npublic administration with standards designed to promote safety and compatibility with the Mid-\nCarolina Regional Airport Layout Plan (ALP) adopted by the Rowan County Board of\nCommissioners. Any use(s) or proposed structure(s) located on Rowan County property is\nsubject to approval by the Rowan County Board of Commissioners and shall comply with Mid-\nCarolina Regional's minimum standards and applicable Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)\nrules and regulations including FAA 7460-1 Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration.\nProperties owned by Rowan County, NC that encompass and adjoin the Mid-Carolina Regional\nAirport will comprise the district. District boundaries may be amended by addition of contiguous\nparcels via the map amendment process prescribed in Section 21-362.\n(Ord. of 1-19-98, \u00a7 III; Ord. of 2-1-99(1), \u00a7\u00a7 2, 9; Ord. of 6-17-02; Ord. of 4-21-03; Amend. of 4-\n21-14; Amend. of 9-3-19; Amend. of 6-21-21; Amend. of 9-19-22)\nSec. 21-33. Overlay districts.\nOverlay districts are zoning districts, which are applied only in conjunction with other zoning\ndistricts, and may grant additional use of development requirements upon the underlying zoning\ndistricts. The effect is to have both the overlay district and the underlying zoning controlling the\nuse and development of the lot. Overlay districts are applicable on an area wide basis to support\nspecific public policy objectives and as such should be consistent with adopted land use plans.\nOverlay districts may be applied to conventional and conditional zoning districts. An overlay district\nmay be initiated as an amendment by the board of commissioners, planning board, planning staff,\nor the property owner or their designated representative.\n42\n\n\nNEW PAGE 43\nAs of 01/17/23\n(1) Airport Zone Overlay, AZO. The zones and restrictions established in this subsection are\ndesigned to limit the height of structures surrounding the county airport's established\nelevation of seven hundred seventy-two and three tenths (772.3) feet above mean sea\nlevel (msl) in order to prevent hazards to the lives and property of the users of the airport\nand the occupants of land in the vicinity.\na. Uses allowed. The use requirements of the underlying district apply to the AZO district.\nHowever, all uses must be in conformance with the provisions of this section.\nb.\nEstablishment of zones. To carry out the provisions of this section, there are hereby\ncreated and established certain civil airport imaginary surfaces which consist of the land\nlying beneath the approach surface, including the non-precision and precision\napproach zone; transitional surface; horizontal surface; conical surface; and primary\nsurface. These civil airport imaginary surfaces are established with relation to the\nRowan County Airport runway and proposed extensions of thereof. Such imaginary\nsurfaces are defined in Section 21-4 and shown on the Official County Airport Zoning\nMap dated September 19, 2022, which is adopted and incorporated herein by\nreference. The size of each such imaginary surface is based on the category of each\nrunway according to the type of approach available or planned for that runway. The\nslope and dimensions of the approach surface, applied to each end of a runway, are\ndetermined by the most precise approach procedure existing or planned for the runway\nend.\nC. Height limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure shall be\nerected, altered or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow within the AZO\ndistrict extending or projecting into the lowest applicable imaginary surfaces defined\nherein.\n(2) Water Supply Watershed Overlays, WSO. The purpose of the watershed overlay is to\nprovide for the protection of public water supplies as required by the Water Supply\nWatershed Classification and Protection Act (G.S. 143-214.5) and regulations promulgated\ntherein. The watershed overlays may be an overlay in any conventional or conditional\nzoning district established in this chapter. The overlay districts supplement the uses or\ndevelopment requirements of the underlying zoning districts.\na. Uses allowed. The use requirements of the underlying districts apply to the WSO\ndistricts, unless otherwise provided in this section. However, all allowed uses must be\nin conformance with the provisions of this section.\nb. Expressly prohibited in critical areas. The following uses are expressly prohibited:\n1. Landfills;\n2. Sites for land application of sludge/residuals or petroleum contaminated soils.\nC.\nCalculating built-upon area. For the purpose of calculating built-upon area, total project\narea shall include total acreage in the lot on which the project is to be developed less\nacreage with any public road right of way. Built-upon area for a non-residential use\nexisting prior to January 1, 1994 (effective date of the initial WSO district designation\nand ordinance) as determined by planning staff will be subtracted from the overall lot\nacreage. All built-upon area proposed or existing after January 1, 1994 shall be subject\nto standards of this chapter. Home Occupations defined by section 21-4 shall be\nconsidered single family development. Built-upon area calculations for a Rural Home\nOccupation shall only include new built-upon area proposed and use of any existing\nstructure(s) for the operation but not existing residential structures.\n43\n\n\nNEW PAGE 44\nAs of 01/17/23\nd. Density and built-upon limits. Maximum allowable density and built-upon limits on a\nproject by project basis is subject to one of the following options:\n1\nDensity Averaging requests that include donating property from the critical area must comply with the built-\nupon area allowance in the critical area.\n2\nHigh Density Development is only permissible subject to section 21-33(2)(f)(3)(a).\n3\nDevelopment activities which require an erosion / sedimentation control plan must meet these requirements.\ne. Nonpoint Source and Stormwater Pollution Control. The following measures shall apply\nto development in the WSO unless expressly provided otherwise:\n1. Vegetated Conveyances. Stormwater runoff from the project shall be released\nto vegetated areas as dispersed flow or transported by vegetated conveyances to\nthe maximum extent practicable. In determining whether this criteria has been met,\nRowan County shall take into account site-specific factors such as topography and\nsite layout as well as protection of water quality. Vegetated conveyances shall be\nmaintained in perpetuity to ensure continued function as designed. Vegetated\nconveyances that meet the following criteria shall be deemed to satisfy the\nrequirements of this Sub-Item:\ni. Side slopes shall be no steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to vertical) unless it is\ndemonstrated to Rowan County that soils and vegetation will remain stable\nin perpetuity based on engineering calculations and on-site soil investigation;\nand\n44\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nMaximum Allowable Built-upon Area % Non-residential/Multi-family)\nand Minimum Lot Size in sq.ft.
