You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-10\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. If Residential (R-10) is referring\nto a general residential district, we are only interested in the requirement of\nmin_unit_size for single-family homes. However, if it is referring to a specific district,\nlike Multi Family Residential (MFR), General Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested\nin the requirement of min_unit_size for Residential (R-10).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \"\\n\" and any type of special characters.\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // The value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 74\nArticle 4 Zoning Districts\n4.5 Commercial Zoning Districts\n4.5.4.\nSpecial Standards in the R-10 Zoning District\nD.\nOpen Space\nOpen space requirements for the residential portion of a multifamily or mixed commercial-residential\nproject shall be the same and conform to the requirements for multifamily developments in the MR-\n4-12\nCELL (1, 1):\nUse\nCELL (1, 2):\nDistrict\nCELL (1, 3):\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 4):\nMinimum\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 5):\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 6):\nMinimum\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 7):\nCELL (1, 8):\nYard\n(ft.)\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (2, 1):\nCELL (2, 2):\nCELL (2, 3):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 4):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 5):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 6):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 7):\nFront\nCELL (2, 8):\nRear\nCELL (2, 9):\nSide\nCELL (3, 1):\nAll residential, except\nCELL (3, 2):\nR-10\nCELL (3, 3):\n60\nCELL (3, 4):\n60\nCELL (3, 5):\n6,000\nCELL (3, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (3, 7):\n25\u00b3\nCELL (3, 8):\n63\nCELL (3, 9):\n51,2\nCELL (4, 1):\nmultifamily\nCELL (4, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (4, 3):\n75\nCELL (4, 4):\n75\nCELL (4, 5):\n7,500\nCELL (4, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (4, 7):\n253\nCELL (4, 8):\n253\nCELL (4, 9):\n102\nCELL (5, 1):\nMultifamily/ Mixed\nCELL (5, 2):\nR-10\nCELL (5, 3):\n100\nCELL (5, 4):\n150\nCELL (5, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (5, 6):\n15,000\nCELL (5, 7):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 8):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 9):\nCELL (6, 1):\ncommercial- residential\nCELL (6, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (6, 3):\n100\nCELL (6, 4):\n100\nCELL (6, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (6, 6):\n7,000\nCELL (6, 7):\nCELL (6, 8):\nCELL (6, 9):\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        \"CELL (2, 5):\\nWith\\nWater and\\nSewer\",\n        \"CELL (3, 5):\\n6,000\",\n        \"CELL (2, 6):\\nWithout\\nWater and\\nSewer\",\n        \"CELL (3, 6):\\n10,000\"\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"For district R-10, the section provides the information for min_unit_size.

No additional setback is required for building height greater\nthan 80 feet\n*^When the nonresidential lot/parcel abuts a residential district, then 50 feet setback is required\nfrom the property line.\nSection 35.03 Exception for New Building on Existing Developed Block\nIn the Residential Districts, where the average setback distance for existing buildings on all lots\nlocated wholly or partly within two hundred (200) feet of any lot, and within the same zoning\ndistrict and fronting on the same side of the same street as such lot, is less than the minimum\nsetback required, but not less than the existing average setback distance for all lots within the\ntwo hundred (200) feet, or a distance of ten (10) feet from the street right-of-way line, whichever\nis greater. When lots within the two hundred (200) feet are vacant, said vacant lots shall be\nconsidered as having the average setback for the purpose of computing an average setback\ndistance.\nSection 35.04 Measuring Setbacks\nA. Corner lot side yard and street setbacks represent the minimum distance required between\nthe nearest exterior finished wall of all structures and the adjacent street right-of-way\nline.\nB. Front, side, and rear setbacks represent the minimum distance required between the\nnearest exterior finished wall of all structures and the adjacent front, side, or rear property\nlines.\nC. Setbacks from the principal building represent the minimum distance required between\nthe nearest exterior finished wall of an accessory building and the nearest exterior\nfinished wall of the principal building structure on the lot.\nSection 35.05 Lot Frontage Requirements\nA. Unless otherwise provided, no principal and/or accessory building, structure, or use shall\nbe erected, expanded, enlarged, increased, or initiated on any lot that does not abut a\npublic street with a right-of-way in conformity with the Subdivision Ordinance.\nB. Single Family Exemption: A single-family dwelling may be constructed on a lot that does\nnot abut a public street, provided that such lot is at least two (2) acres in size and is\nprovided with direct access to a public street by an easement created for the exclusive use\nof such dwelling. Any easement created pursuant to this exemption shall be at least forty\n\n\nNEW PAGE 50\n(40) feet in width and shall not exceed three hundred (300) feet in length. Otherwise,\nstreets must meet the requirements of subsection \"A\" above.\nC. Planned Business Development Exemption: A permit for construction or use within any\nplanned business (unit) development may be allowed on a lot or tract that does not abut\ndirectly on a public street, provided such development is platted pursuant to the\nSubdivision Ordinance meeting private road standards, which are maintained by the\nproperty owner association. The original development tract or lot met the minimum lot\nfrontage requirement.\nD. All portions of each building erected in accordance with this section shall be located\nwithin five hundred (500) feet of an approved public or private street.\nSection 35.06 Residential Accessory Structure and Building Standards\nA. The Table of Permissible Uses classifies different principal uses according to their\ndifferent impacts. Whenever an activity (which may or may not be separately listed as a\nprincipal use in this table) is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the\nformer use constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that\ntakes place on a lot or is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally\nrelated to it, then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and\nmay be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use. For\nexample, a swimming pool/tennis court complex is customarily associated with and\nintegrally related to a residential subdivision or multifamily development and would be\nregarded as accessory to such principal uses, even though such facilities, if developed\napart from a residential development, would require a zoning permit.\nB. Residential detached accessory -\n1. May be located only in the rear yard, not in any side or front yard.\n2. Setbacks; rear and side yards\na. Not less than the principal setback for the district, except as provided under \"b\"\nbelow.\nb.\nStructures or buildings not exceeding fifteen (15) feet in height shall be setback\nnot less than five (5) feet. Minimum corner lot side yard setbacks for the district\nshall apply for all corner lots. Minimum front yard setbacks shall apply for all\ndouble frontage lots.\n3. Setbacks from principal building: Must be a minimum distance of eight (8) feet from\nthe principal structure.\n4. The height shall not exceed the height of the existing principal building or district\nmaximum height, whichever is less.\n5. The total building footprint area of all accessory buildings on the lot shall be no\ngreater than eighty (80) percent of the gross floor area of the principal building.\nC. Residential Attached Accessory:\n1. The location, setback, and height shall be in accordance with the district standards\nestablished for the principal building unless otherwise provided.\n\n\n Output:"}]}
