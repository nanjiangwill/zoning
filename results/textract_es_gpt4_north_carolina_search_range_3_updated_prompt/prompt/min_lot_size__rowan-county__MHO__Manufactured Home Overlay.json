You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Manufactured Home Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MHO\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Manufactured Home Overlay\n(MHO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Manufactured Home Overlay (MHO).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

General zoning districts defined; purpose and intent.\n(a) Rural Agricultural, RA. This district is developed to provide for a minimum level of land use\nregulations appropriate for outlying areas of the county. These outlying areas typically consist\nof rural single-family housing, larger tracts of land used for agricultural purposes, and instances\nof non-residential uses intermingled. Multifamily uses are discouraged in this district. This\ndistrict would provide for protection from the most intensive land uses while containing\nprovisions for a variety of home-based business opportunities and other non-residential uses\ndeemed appropriate through a special use permit process. It is the intent of this district to rely\nupon development standards to protect residences from potential adverse impacts of allowed\nnon-residential uses. The most intensive land uses would not be allowed in this district.\n(b) Rural Residential, RR. This zoning district is comprised of areas of the county in which\nmoderate levels of single-family housing has occurred or is occurring. In this district,\nagricultural uses have been replaced to a significant degree with single-family housing. The\nregulations in this district are intended to provide a land owner with an opportunity to engage\nin limited business or commercial activities. Multifamily uses are not allowed.\n(c) Residential Suburban, RS. The purpose of this zoning district is to protect existing residential\nneighborhoods and promote the creation of more residential neighborhoods. These areas are\ntypically near major thoroughfares and have or could be provided significant infrastructure.\nCommercial uses, business uses and multifamily uses are generally not allowed.\n(d) Multifamily Residential, MFR. This district is intended to allow for a wide range of residential\nuses and will be the primary location for multifamily development. This district will typically be\nlocated near arterials or collectors. The development of multifamily developments within this\ndistrict cannot be predetermined and cannot be adequately controlled by general district\nstandards. Therefore specific development proposals for multifamily developments in this\ndistrict shall be reviewed and approved by the board of commissioners. Approval of the site\nplan may include the addition of reasonable and appropriate standards to the site plan. No\nother uses allowed in the MFR district shall require site plan approval by the board of\ncommissioners unless expressly required by this chapter. Additional approval standards for\nmultifamily residential developments are listed in article III. The requirements of this district\nshall not apply to duplexes on individual lots but shall apply to multiple duplexes on an\n40\nCELL (1, 1): \na.\nRural Agricultural (RA)\nCELL (1, 2): \nh.\nCELL (1, 3): \n85-ED-1\nCELL (2, 1): \nb.\nRural Residential (RR)\nCELL (2, 2): \ni.\nCELL (2, 3): \n85-ED-2\nCELL (3, 1): \nC.\nResidential Suburban (RS)\nCELL (3, 2): \nj.\nCELL (3, 3): \n85-ED-3\nCELL (4, 1): \nd.\nMultifamily Residential (MFR)\nCELL (4, 2): \nk.\nCELL (4, 3): \n85-ED-4\nCELL (5, 1): \ne.\nManufactured Home Park District (MHP)\nCELL (5, 2): \nI.\nCELL (5, 3): \nIndustrial (IND)\nCELL (6, 1): \nf.\nNeighborhood Business (NB)\nCELL (6, 2): \nm.\nCELL (6, 3): \nInstitutional (INST)\nCELL (7, 1): \ng.\nCommercial, Business, Industrial (CBI)\nCELL (7, 2): \nn.\nCELL (7, 3): \nAirport Industrial (AI)\n\n\nNEW PAGE 41\nAs of 01/17/23\nindividual lot.\n(e) Manufactured Home Park, MHP.\n(1)\nThis district is established in order to provide for the proper location and planning of\nmanufactured home parks, excluding family manufactured home parks. Special\nrequirements shall be applied to these parks which shall specify improvements to the\npark to ensure the public health, safety and welfare of the park inhabitants as well as\nthe surrounding area. Designation of an area as being in the MHP district provides\ndesign and appearance criteria which are more appropriate for rental manufactured\nhousing and/or spaces, including vinyl or similar skirting, clustering of units and reduced\nroad construction standards. These standards are not applicable to manufactured\nhomes and/or lots located outside a MHP district. This district requires site plan review\nfor development of manufactured home parks by the board of commissioners. This\nreview is required because the use may have particular impacts on the surrounding area\nand the county as a whole. Approval of the site plan may include the addition of\nreasonable and appropriate standards to the site plan. No other uses allowed in the\nMHP district shall require site plan approval by the board of commissioner unless\nexpressly required by this chapter.\n(2)\nManufactured home parks, existing at the effective date of this chapter and registered\nas provided by the county mobile home park ordinance are zoned as conforming uses,\neven though they may not meet the development standards of this chapter. Expansions\nof the existing registered manufactured home parks or construction of new\nmanufactured home parks, approved under the county mobile home park ordinance may\nbe initiated or continue unless no work has begun within six (6) months of the date of\nissuance of a \"permit to develop\" under that ordinance, or work has ceased for a period\nof twelve (12) months.\n(3)\nOther manufactured home parks, which meet the intent of this section by having\nimprovements similar to the requirements of this chapter may also be zoned as\nconforming uses. However, all expansions of any manufactured home park, existing at\nthe effective date of this chapter shall meet all requirements of this chapter unless\nexpressly provided otherwise. Development standards for a manufactured home park\nare listed in article III.\n(f) Commercial, Business, Industrial, CBI. This zone allows for a wide range of commercial,\nbusiness and light to medium industrial activities which support both the local and / or regional\neconomies. The CBI district is generally appropriate in areas identified by an adopted land\nuse plan that recommend \"highway business\" along identified NC and US highways;\ncommunity / regional / potential development nodes; commercial corridors; and existing\ncommercial areas. Areas served by public water / sewer represent significant public\ninvestment to foster tax base growth and employment opportunities for the citizens, which\ncould be served through CBI designation. The CBI district may also exist or be created in an\narea other than listed in this subsection if the existing or proposed development is compatible\nwith the surrounding area and the overall public good is served.\n(g) Industrial, IND. This district is intended to provide for industrial activities involving extraction,\nmanufacturing, processing, assembling, storage, and distribution of products. The district is\nalso designed to accommodate other, more intense non-residential uses which generate\nadverse side effects such as noise, odor or dust. The IND district is generally appropriate in\nareas identified by an adopted land use plan for industrial corridors, potential development\nnodes, locations accessible to rail lines and utility infrastructure, and existing industrial areas.\nThese corridors represent significant public and private investment, which should be identified\nto foster tax base growth and employment opportunities for the citizens. The IND district may\n41\n\n\nNEW PAGE 42\nAs of 01/17/23\nalso exist or be created in an area other than listed in this subsection if the existing or proposed\ndevelopment is compatible with the surrounding area and the overall public good is served.\n(h) Neighborhood Business, NB. This district is primarily designed to provide rural business\nopportunities typically in the form of small retail, service, office, and light manufacturing uses\nto serve the community's existing and future needs for goods, services, and employment\nopportunities. Standards within the district are intended to promote context sensitive\ndevelopment appropriately scaled and organized in a manner that would not be detrimental to\nthe surrounding area. Development within this district would contain impacts inherently more\nintensive than those associated with uses permitted with special requirements in the RA district\nbut significantly less than those in CBI zoned areas. The NB district is generally appropriate\nin areas identified by an adopted land use plan for rural businesses located on identified minor\nand major thoroughfares and within community nodes. However, additional consideration may\nbe necessary as some thoroughfare segments would not be conducive to NB designation due\nto surrounding land use and / or potential negative impacts such as traffic, noise, and visual\nimpacts. Generally, the NB district shall be two (2) acres or larger. However a lot of record,\nsmaller than two (2) acres may be considered for rezoning to NB if the owner of the lot does\nnot own adjacent property which may be included in the rezoning request.\n(i)\nInstitutional, INST. The purpose of the Institutional district is to recognize and permit the\ncreation of defined areas for the unified and orderly development of major cultural, educational,\nmedical, governmental, religious and other institutions in order to support and enhance their\nbenefits to the community in a manner which protects adjacent residential uses. Trade school\nfacilities teaching a trade, for example truck driving or welding, which have that activity on site,\nshall meet zoning requirements for that use.\n(j) Airport Industrial, Al. This district is established for airport-specific or related businesses that\nwill be located, designed, constructed and maintained in a manner compatible with aviation\noperations. Uses in the Al district tend to focus on manufacturing, transportation, services and\npublic administration with standards designed to promote safety and compatibility with the Mid-\nCarolina Regional Airport Layout Plan (ALP) adopted by the Rowan County Board of\nCommissioners. Any use(s) or proposed structure(s) located on Rowan County property is\nsubject to approval by the Rowan County Board of Commissioners and shall comply with Mid-\nCarolina Regional's minimum standards and applicable Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)\nrules and regulations including FAA 7460-1 Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration.\nProperties owned by Rowan County, NC that encompass and adjoin the Mid-Carolina Regional\nAirport will comprise the district. District boundaries may be amended by addition of contiguous\nparcels via the map amendment process prescribed in Section 21-362.\n(Ord. of 1-19-98, \u00a7 III; Ord. of 2-1-99(1), \u00a7\u00a7 2, 9; Ord. of 6-17-02; Ord. of 4-21-03; Amend. of 4-\n21-14; Amend. of 9-3-19; Amend. of 6-21-21; Amend. of 9-19-22)\nSec. 21-33. Overlay districts.\nOverlay districts are zoning districts, which are applied only in conjunction with other zoning\ndistricts, and may grant additional use of development requirements upon the underlying zoning\ndistricts. The effect is to have both the overlay district and the underlying zoning controlling the\nuse and development of the lot. Overlay districts are applicable on an area wide basis to support\nspecific public policy objectives and as such should be consistent with adopted land use plans.\nOverlay districts may be applied to conventional and conditional zoning districts. An overlay district\nmay be initiated as an amendment by the board of commissioners, planning board, planning staff,\nor the property owner or their designated representative.\n42\n\nNEW PAGE 49\nAs of 01/17/23\na.

Projects that meet the eligibility requirements in subsection\n(2)(f)(4) may submit a Density Averaging permit application for consideration by\nthe Board of Commissioners subject to the process outlined in section 21-318\nof this chapter.\n(3) Agricultural Overlay, AO. The purpose of the Agricultural Overlay District is to provide\n49\n\n\nNEW PAGE 50\nAs of 01/17/23\nadditional requirements to encourage the maintenance of viable agricultural areas. This\ndistrict should be comprised primarily of open farm land used for extensive agricultural and\nlivestock production.

The purpose of the Manufactured Home Overlay is to provide for\nthe development of Type II and Type III manufactured homes in established residential\nzoning districts while maintaining the overall residential, rural or agricultural character\nof those districts. Because of the potential impacts of the establishment of this district,\nit has prescribed conditions contained in this subsection to ensure compatibility with\nthe surrounding area.\nb. Permitted districts. The Manufactured Home Overlay supplements the range of uses\nand regulations in the underlying district. The overlay is allowed in the following districts\npermitting residential development; RA, RR, CBI and MFR. All other uses in the\nunderlying district shall continue to remain in effect and subject to the regulations and\nconditions of approval of the underlying district.\nC.\nProcedures for district designation. The following procedures are required for MHO\ndistrict designation:\n1. Designation as an MHO district shall require a rezoning as provided in article XIV\nof this chapter.\n2. Upon approval of an MHO district by the board of commissioners, the area so\ndesignated shall be labeled \"MHO\" on the zoning map.\nd. Review. The petitioner seeking to rezone property to this district must illustrate that the\nproposed development will comply with the evaluation criteria contained in section 21-\n59.

Economic development districts established for I-85.\n(a) The following district are hereby established to preserve, encourage and enhance the\neconomic development opportunities in areas adjacent and near I-85 in accordance to plans\nadopted by the county board of commissioners. It is recognized that I-85 is uniquely important\nthe future of the county because of the great potential for development of all types that exist\nalong this corridor. Development within these districts shall be of types which maximize the\neconomic benefits to the county while minimizing the potential impacts.\n(b) The district are designed to accommodate, as appropriate, uses such as manufacturing,\ndistribution, retail, service industries, corporate parks. Certain individual uses may be allowed\nas uses by right in some districts, while other more intensive uses may require a higher level\nof review and approval by the county. The districts encourage and allow more creative design\nof land development than may be provided on other general zoning districts. This flexibility is\nprovided for planned unit developments.\n(c) The district are labeled as 85-ED 1 through 4. \"85\" represents the relationship to I-85. \"ED\"\nrepresents the economic development designation for the sites.\n(1) 85-ED-1. The purpose of the 85-ED-1 district is to encourage the location of \"high capital\ninvestment/high wage/low employment/clean\" industries.
