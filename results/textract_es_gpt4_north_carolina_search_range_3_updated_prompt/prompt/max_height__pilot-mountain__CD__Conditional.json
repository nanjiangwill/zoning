You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Conditional\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CD\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Conditional\n(CD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Conditional (CD).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 98\nARTICLE 7 - DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS\n7.2\nDimensional Standards for Lots and Principal Structures\nThe following tables establish the minimum dimensional standards for lots, including size,\nwidth, depth, setbacks, height and building coverage:\nTable 7-1 Minimum Lot Dimensions for Single Family Residential Zoning Districts\nTable 7-2 Project Area and Density Standards for the Multifamily Residential District\nTable 7-3 Minimum Lot Dimensions for Nonresidential Zoning Districts\nTable 7-4 Setbacks, Height and Building Coverage Requirements\nP Indicates that prevailing setbacks are required.\nVILLAGE OF LAKE PARK UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nDISTRICT\nCELL (1, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 3):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 4):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 5):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 6):\nCD\nCELL (1, 7):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 8):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 9):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 10):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 11):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 12):\n|\nCELL (6, 1):\nMaximum Height (feet)\nCELL (6, 2):\n35\nCELL (6, 3):\n35\nCELL (6, 4):\n35\nCELL (6, 5):\n35\nCELL (6, 6):\n35\nCELL (6, 7):\n35\nCELL (6, 8):\n35\nCELL (6, 9):\n35\nCELL (6, 10):\n35\nCELL (6, 11):\n35\nCELL (6, 12):\n35\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"CELL (6, 6):\\n35\", 98]],\n    \"rationale\": \"The section titled Maximum Height (feet) says the answer for district, CD, explicitly.\",\n    \"answer\": \"35 ft\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 66\n(B) Table: Permitted Uses by Zoning District.\nCELL (1, 1):\nSign\nDistrict\nCELL (1, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 3):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 4):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 5):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 6):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 7):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 8):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 9):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 10):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 11):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 12):\nXXXX\nCELL (1, 13):\nCD\nCELL (2, 1):\nOutdoor\nadvertising\nCELL (2, 2):\nNot\nPermitted\nCELL (2, 3):\nNot\nPermitted\nCELL (2, 4):\nNot\nPermitted\nCELL (2, 5):\nNot\nPermitted\nCELL (2, 6):\nNot\nPermitted d\nCELL (2, 7):\nNot\nPermitted\nCELL (2, 8):\nNot\nPermitted\nCELL (2, 9):\nNot\nPermitted\nCELL (2, 10):\nNot\nPermitted\nCELL (2, 11):\nNot\nPermitted\nCELL (2, 12):\nNot\nPermitted\nCELL (2, 13):\nNot\nPermitted\nCELL (3, 1):\nMarquees\nCELL (3, 2):\nNot\nPermitted\nCELL (3, 3):\nNot\nPermitted\nCELL (3, 4):\n6' max\nheight\nCELL (3, 5):\n6' max\nheight\nCELL (3, 6):\nNot\nPermitted d\nCELL (3, 7):\n6' max\nheight\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": null,\n    \"rationale\": \"The section is about the maximum height of flags in different zoning districts, not the maximum height of buildings.\",\n    \"answer\": null\n}\n\nInput:\nSection 5. - Conditional (CD).\n5.1.
