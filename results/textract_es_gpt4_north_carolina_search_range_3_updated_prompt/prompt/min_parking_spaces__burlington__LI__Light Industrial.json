You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Light Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"LI\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. If Light Industrial (LI) is referring\nto a general residential district, we are only interested in the requirement of\nmin_parking_spaces for single-family homes. However, if it is referring to a specific district,\nlike Multi Family Residential (MFR), General Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested\nin the requirement of min_parking_spaces for Light Industrial (LI).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \"\\n\" and any type of special characters.\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // The value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\"). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\n165/167\nCELL (1, 1):\nRestaurants (with drive through service)\nCELL (1, 2):\nOne (1) space for each four (4) seating\naccommodations, plus one (1) space for each\ntwo (2) employees on the shift of largest\nemployment; and Three (3) stacking spaces\nfor each drive through window.\nCELL (2, 1):\nSchool, Elementary and Middle (both public\nand private):\nCELL (2, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each classroom and\nadministrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee and one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (3, 1):\nSchool, High School (both public and private)\nCELL (3, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each fifteen (15)\nstudents for which the building was designed,\nplus one (1) parking space for each classroom\nand administrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee, plus one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (4, 1):\nShopping Centers, large and small\nCELL (4, 2):\nOne (1) space for each three hundred (300)\nsquare feet of gross floor area.\nCELL (5, 1):\nSingle Family, Duplex, Condominiums,\nManufactured Homes, and similar residential\nCELL (5, 2):\nTwo (2) spaces per dwelling unit\nCELL (6, 1):\nTerminals, Bus\nCELL (6, 2):\nOne (1) space for each employee and one (1)\nspace for each bus loading ramp and track.\nCELL (7, 1):\nStadiums, Theaters, and similar uses\ninvolving the assembling of persons:\nCELL (7, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each four (4) seats\nin the largest assembly room.

In such cases, existing undisturbed vegetation may be credited towards or may meet\nany perimeter buffer requirements.\n[5] Lot lines abutting public street rights-of-way shall be subject to the standards in Section 5.3.K,\nStreetscape Buffers.\n[6] A Type A buffer shall be provided along all lot lines bordering the City's jurisdiction.\n[7] A Type D buffer of at least 40 feet in width shall be provided along all lot lines bordering an interstate\nor limited access highway, including on- and off-ramps, and railroad lines.\n[8] Residential development in the MDR district consisting of buildings other than single-family detached\ndwellings shall provide a type B buffer along all lot lines shared with single-family detached dwellings in\nthe MDR district.\n7.

STREETSCAPE BUFFERS\n1. Purpose and Intent\nStreetscape buffers are proposed to soften the view of development from the City's street rights-of-\nway, and are intended to:\na. Enhance pedestrian orientation and encourage pedestrian travel;\nb. Address urban heat islands by providing shade for streets and sidewalks;\nC. Provide shade on sidewalks;\nd. Promote the City's \"sense of place\";\ne. Support property values by enhancing the aesthetic character of the City's streets; and\nf. Provide habitat for flora and fauna.\n2. Applicability\n(AMENDED 1.4.22 UDOTA-1-22)\na. The standards in this section shall apply to all lot lines bounded by the following features, whether\nexisting or identified in the City's adopted policy guidance.\ni. Local streets;\nii. Collector streets; and\niii. Arterial streets.\nb. In cases where a future street is planned but its approximate location is not indicated on an\nadopted or approved City map or plan, streetscape buffering shall not be required on lots abutting\nthe future street alignment.\nC.\nIn cases where the rear yard of a lot abuts a City street right-of-way, the rear yard shall include\na streetscape buffer configured in accordance with these standards.\n3. Exemption\na. Streetscape buffers are not required along lot lines abutting the following features:\ni.\nDriveways, private drives, or alleys;\nii.\nLot lines abutting platted street rights-of-way that are or have remained unopened for at least\n15 years; or\niii. Lot frontages where the entirety of the lot frontage is within a required sight distance triangle.\nb. Development subject to the standards in Section 5.3.L, Street Trees, is not required to provide\nstreetscape buffers.\n4. Required Plant Material\na. Generally\nStreetscape buffers shall be configured in one of the following three ways (see Figure 5.3.K:\nStreetscape Buffer Configuration):\ni.\nThree canopy trees for every 100 linear feet of lot frontage; or\nii. Two canopy trees and two understory trees for every 100 linear feet of lot frontage; or\niii. Four understory trees for every 100 linear feet, where overhead utilities are present.\nb. Rear Yard Streetscape Buffers\n(AMENDED 1.4.22 UDOTA-1-22)\nIn cases when a lot's rear yard abuts a City street right-of-way, the rear yard shall be configured\nwith a streetscape buffer meeting the requirements for a type C perimeter buffer (see Section\n5.3.J, Perimeter Buffers). In cases where a streetscape buffer is configured in accordance with a\ntype C perimeter buffer, trees shall maintain a uniform on-center spacing across the width of the\nbuffer and the distance from the right of way shall be in accordance with the perimeter buffering\nstandards instead of the placement standards in this section.\nCity of Burlington\n5-45\nUnified Development Ordinance\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\n\nNEW PAGE 338\nCHAPTER 5 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nSection 5.3 Landscaping\nFIGURE 5.3.K: STREETSCAPE BUFFER CONFIGURATION\n(AMENDED 3.17.20 UDOTA-02-20) (AMENDED 12.3.19 UDOTA-01-20)\n5. Placement\na. Vegetation required as part of a streetscape buffer shall be located outside the street right-of-\nway.\nb. Canopy trees shall be located within ten feet of the right-of-way edge.\nC. Understory trees shall be located within five feet of the right-of-way edge.\nd. An alternative location may be approved by the Planning Director in cases where underground\nutilities, drainage easements, topography, or other obstructions make placement of streetscape\nbuffer vegetation in accordance with these standards impractical.\n6. Prohibited Features\nOff-street parking, off-street loading, merchandise display, outdoor storage, or use of gravel,\ndecorative gravel, or cinders as a ground cover shall not take place within a required streetscape\nbuffer.\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\nL. STREET TREES\n(AMENDED 12.3.19 UDOTA-01-20)\nDevelopment within the CBD, PD, and PDD districts, as well as development within GCO districts subject\nto City-adopted or approved plans that call for the establishment of street trees shall provide street trees\nin accordance with the following standards:\n1.
