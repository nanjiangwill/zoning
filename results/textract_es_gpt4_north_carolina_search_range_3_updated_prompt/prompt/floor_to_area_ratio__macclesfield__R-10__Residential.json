You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-10\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"floor_to_area_ratio\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: f.a.r., far, floor area ratio, floor to area, floor-area ratio, floor-to-area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. If Residential (R-10) is referring\nto a general residential district, we are only interested in the requirement of\nfloor_to_area_ratio for single-family homes. However, if it is referring to a specific district,\nlike Multi Family Residential (MFR), General Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested\nin the requirement of floor_to_area_ratio for Residential (R-10).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \"\\n\" and any type of special characters.\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // The value of floor_to_area_ratio extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for floor_to_area_ratio is typically between 0.1 and 20 (10% to 2000%). Please focus on values within this range when searching for floor_to_area_ratio and provide the answer as a decimal value (e.g., 50% should be 0.5). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 90\nResidential (R-10)\n\nNEW PAGE 82\n(d) General Requirements.\n1. Along existing streets, new buildings shall create a transition in spacing,\nmass, scale, and street frontage relationship from existing buildings to\nbuildings in the Transit-Oriented Employment district.\na. New buildings are expected to exceed the scale and volume of\nexisting buildings, but shall demonstrate compatibility by varying\nthe massing of buildings to reduce perceived scale and volume.\nThe definition of massing in Article 12 illustrates the application\nof design techniques to reduce the visual perception of size and\nintegrate larger buildings with pre-existing smaller buildings.\nb. Subsection 3.2.14(d)(1) shall not apply to development on\nparcels where multifamily structures are an allowable use and\nthe development contains two or more affordable housing units\nfor families or individuals with incomes below eighty percent\n(80%) of the area median income.\n2. On new streets, allowable building and lot types will establish the\ndevelopment pattern.\n(e) Design Provisions.\n1. Every building shall share a frontage line with a street, or urban open\nPage 82\n\nNEW PAGE 83\nspace; lots fronting directly onto an urban open space (i.e., without\nintervening street) shall be provided rear alley access.\n2. New construction favors general office uses, with accessory retail,\npersonal services, restaurant, and similar uses located at street level and\nresidential uses permitted on third and higher floors.\n3. Notwithstanding the height restrictions of Article 4, Building and Lot\nTypes, new buildings in the Transit Oriented Employment district are\nlimited to seven stories or 80 feet in height, whichever is greater.\nMinimum building height is 26 feet, measured at the leave line.\n4.

In\naddition, the aspect of safety for both pedestrians and motorists is a primary consideration in the\napplication of this Division. Specific requirements for the provision of off-street parking and\nloading shall be provided under this Division.\nSection 50.02 Application of Regulations\nA. The requirements will be enforceable at the time of the erection of any building and/or at\nthe time any principal building is enlarged or increased in capacity (through the addition\nof dwelling units, guest rooms, seats, or floor area\nB. The requirements will be enforceable before the conversion from one type of use and/or\noccupancy to another use or occupancy. If a change in use causes an increase in the\nrequired number of off-street parking, stacking or loading spaces, such additional spaces\nshall be provided in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance; except that if\nthe change in use would require an increase of less than five percent (5%) in the required\nnumber of parking spaces, no additional off-street parking shall be required.\nC. All parking spaces required by this division shall be a minimum of 200 square feet in area\nwith a minimum width of ten (10) feet. Handicap spaces shall be provided according to\nthe requirements set forth in the North Carolina State Building Codes, Volume I-C.\nD. Parking spaces may be provided in a parking garage or a properly graded and surfaced\nopen space.\nE. No spaces that are rented, except as provided in 50.06, or are located on a public right-of-\nway may be counted toward compliance with this division.\nF. All parking, stacking and loading facilities shall be permanently maintained by the\nowners or occupants as long as the use they serve exists.\nG. All parking, stacking and loading facilities shall have vehicular access to a public street\nor approved private street.\nH. Land used to provide required parking, stacking, and loading shall not be used for any\nother purposes, except for temporary events. If such land is devoted to any other purpose,\nthe Certificate of Occupancy of the affected principal use shall immediately become void.\nI. The construction or modification to (i) open parking lots containing 1,500 or more spaces\nor (ii) parking decks and garages containing 750 or more spaces shall comply with the\nconcentrated air emissions standards of the NC Division of Environmental Management.\n\n\nNEW PAGE 67\nSection 50.03 Special Parking Requirements\nA. Residential Districts: Permissible non-residential uses within residential district, where\nthere are parking spaces for more than eight (8) cars, are required to comply with the\nfollowing:\n1. The lot may be used only for parking and not for any type of loading, unloading,\nbusiness sales, dead storage, repair work, dismantling or servicing.\n2. All entrances, exits, barricades at sidewalks, and drainage plans shall be acceptable\nper the subdivision regulations of the Town.\n3. A strip five (5) feet wide shall be reserved as open space adjoining any street line of\nany lot zoned for residential use and shall be guarded with wheel bumpers and\nplanted grass and/or shrubs, according to the buffer yard requirements of this\nOrdinance.\nSection 50.04 Certification\nEach application for a zoning permit for a commercial, industrial, institutional, or multi-family\nresidential unit submitted to the Zoning Administrator shall identify the location and dimensions\nof off-street parking spaces and driveways in accordance with the requirements of this Division.\nSection 50.05 Combination of Required Parking Space\nA. The required parking spaces for any number of separate uses may be combined in one lot,\nbut the required space assigned to one use may not be assigned to another use except as\nprovided in subsection (B) below.\nB. One-half of the parking spaces required for churches, theaters, or assembly halls, whose\npeak attendance will be at night or on Sundays, may arrange to use such spaces on\nadjacent property provided the use on said adjacent property will be closed at night and\non Sundays, whichever is applicable, with the permission of the adjacent property owner.\nSection 50.06 Remote Parking Space\nA. If off-street parking spaces required by this section cannot be reasonably provided on the\nsame lot on which the principal use is located, such spaces may be provided on any land\nwithin 400 feet of the main entrance to such principal use provided the land is in the same\nownership as the principal use or secured by a long term lease arrangement, which shall\nbe renewable for as long as the requirement for the off-street parking of the principal use\nexists.\nB. Land described in subsection (A) above shall be used for no other purpose.\nC. When adequate provisions for parking space (meeting the requirements of this Article)\nhave been made for the principal use on its lot, the requirements of subsections (A) and\n(B) above shall be inapplicable. (Note: In such cases, the applicant shall apply for a\ncertificate of compliance for the principal use.)\nD.\nIn cases of new construction, an applicant shall submit (with his application for a\nbuilding permit and zoning permit) a document, duly executed and acknowledged, which\nsubjects the off-site land to remote parking use in connection with the principal use for\n\n\nNEW PAGE 68\nwhich it is made available. (Note: The applicant shall deposit the appropriate filing fee\nand, upon the issuance of a zoning permit, the Zoning Administrator shall cause the\ndocument to be registered in the Office of the County Register of Deeds.)\nSection 50.07 Number of Parking Spaces Required\nA. The minimum number of required off-site parking and stacking spaces is indicated in\nTable 50.07.\nB. Whenever the number of parking spaces required by Table 50.07 results in a requirement\nof a fractional space, any fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded while a fraction\nin excess of one-half shall be counted as one parking space.\nC. For any use not specifically listed in Table 50.07, the parking and stacking requirements\nshall be those of the most similar listed use, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.\nD. All developments in all zoning districts shall provide a sufficient number of parking\nspaces, in accordance with provisions of this article to accommodate the number of\nvehicles that ordinarily are likely to be attracted to the development in question.\nE. The Board of Commissioners and Planning Board recognizes that, due to the\nparticularities of any given development, the inflexible application of the parking\nstandards set forth in Table 50.07 may result in a development either with inadequate\nparking spaces or parking spaces far in excess of its needs. Therefore, the permit issuing\nauthority may permit deviations from the requirements of Table 50.07 and may require\nmore parking or allow less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely\nto satisfy the general standard delineated in subsection (D). The permit issuing authority\nmay allow deviations, for example, when it finds that a residential development is\nirrevocably oriented toward the elderly, disabled or other population that demonstrates a\nlesser parking need or when it finds that a business or service is primarily oriented to\nwalk-in trade. Whenever the permit issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from\nthe requirements of Table 50.07, it shall enter on the face of the permit the parking\nrequirement that it imposes and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation.\n\n\nNEW PAGE 69\nCELL (1, 1): \nTable 50.07 Off-Street Parking and Stacking Requirements\nCELL (1, 2): \nTable 50.07 Off-Street Parking and Stacking Requirements\nCELL (2, 1): \nUses by Categories\nCELL (2, 2): \nSpaces Required\nCELL (3, 1): \nResidential Uses\nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (4, 1): \nBed & Breakfast\nCELL (4, 2): \n1 per bedroom plus 2 per 3 employees on the\nlargest shift\nCELL (5, 1): \nFamily Care Home\nCELL (5, 2): \n1 per 4 beds plus 1 per employee and visiting\nspecialist plus 1 per vehicle used in the operation\nCELL (6, 1): \nSingle-family Detached Dwelling and\nClass A Manufactured Homes on\nIndividual Lots\nCELL (6, 2): \n2 per dwelling unit on the same lot.\nCELL (7, 1): \nAccessory Uses\nCELL (7, 2): \nCELL (8, 1): \nAccessory Dwelling Unit\nCELL (8, 2): \n1 per attached unit, 2 per detached unit\nCELL (9, 1): \nHome & Rural Family Occupations\nCELL (9, 2): \n1 per each non-resident employee\nCELL (10, 1): \nRecreational Uses\nCELL (10, 2): \nCELL (11, 1): \nAmusement Parks;
