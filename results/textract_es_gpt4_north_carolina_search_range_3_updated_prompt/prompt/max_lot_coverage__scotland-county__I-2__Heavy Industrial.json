You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Heavy Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"I-2\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. If Heavy Industrial (I-2) is referring\nto a general residential district, we are only interested in the requirement of\nmax_lot_coverage for single-family homes. However, if it is referring to a specific district,\nlike Multi Family Residential (MFR), General Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested\nin the requirement of max_lot_coverage for Heavy Industrial (I-2).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \"\\n\" and any type of special characters.\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // The value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage refers solely to the maximum lot coverage of buildings for primary use and all accessory structures. Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.
