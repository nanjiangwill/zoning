You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-2\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"floor_to_area_ratio\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: f.a.r., far, floor area ratio, floor to area, floor-area ratio, floor-to-area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. If Residential (R-2) is referring\nto a general residential district, we are only interested in the requirement of\nfloor_to_area_ratio for single-family homes. However, if it is referring to a specific district,\nlike Multi Family Residential (MFR), General Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested\nin the requirement of floor_to_area_ratio for Residential (R-2).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \"\\n\" and any type of special characters.\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // The value of floor_to_area_ratio extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for floor_to_area_ratio is typically between 0.1 and 20 (10% to 2000%). Please focus on values within this range when searching for floor_to_area_ratio and provide the answer as a decimal value (e.g., 50% should be 0.5). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 90\nResidential (R-2)\n\nNEW PAGE 82\n(d) General Requirements.\n1. Along existing streets, new buildings shall create a transition in spacing,\nmass, scale, and street frontage relationship from existing buildings to\nbuildings in the Transit-Oriented Employment district.\na. New buildings are expected to exceed the scale and volume of\nexisting buildings, but shall demonstrate compatibility by varying\nthe massing of buildings to reduce perceived scale and volume.\nThe definition of massing in Article 12 illustrates the application\nof design techniques to reduce the visual perception of size and\nintegrate larger buildings with pre-existing smaller buildings.\nb. Subsection 3.2.14(d)(1) shall not apply to development on\nparcels where multifamily structures are an allowable use and\nthe development contains two or more affordable housing units\nfor families or individuals with incomes below eighty percent\n(80%) of the area median income.\n2. On new streets, allowable building and lot types will establish the\ndevelopment pattern.\n(e) Design Provisions.\n1. Every building shall share a frontage line with a street, or urban open\nPage 82\n\nNEW PAGE 83\nspace; lots fronting directly onto an urban open space (i.e., without\nintervening street) shall be provided rear alley access.\n2. New construction favors general office uses, with accessory retail,\npersonal services, restaurant, and similar uses located at street level and\nresidential uses permitted on third and higher floors.\n3. Notwithstanding the height restrictions of Article 4, Building and Lot\nTypes, new buildings in the Transit Oriented Employment district are\nlimited to seven stories or 80 feet in height, whichever is greater.\nMinimum building height is 26 feet, measured at the leave line.\n4.

It is further intended that the\nestablishment of intensity regulations reflect the protection of critical environmental areas and the suitability of land for a particular level of development intensity, in accord with the goals and objectives of\nthe comprehensive plan.\nThe setback and height regulations established in the dimensional matrix are intended to ensure adequate solar access, privacy, and ventilation; access to and around buildings, off-street parking areas,\nloading space, and service areas; space for landscaping; and spacing between buildings and portions of buildings to reduce potential adverse effects of noise, odor, glare, or fire. Adequate solar access is\ndeemed to consist of varying levels of access ranging from rooftop solar access in high-intensity zoning districts to south wall solar access in low-intensity zoning districts.\n3.8.1 Establishment and General Applicability of Dimensional Regulations.\nExcept as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, regulations governing the dimensions of lots and buildings are hereby established as described in section 3.8.2 and shown in Table 3.8-1.\n(a) No land or structure shall be used or occupied, and no structure, or part thereof, shall be constructed, erected, altered, or moved except in compliance with the dimensional regulations herein\nspecified for each zoning district.\n(b)\nNo portion of land used in connection with an existing or proposed structure or use of land and necessary for compliance with the dimensional regulations of this article shall also be used,\nthrough sale or otherwise, as part of the land required in connection with any other development.\n(c) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, dimensional regulations applicable to OI-3 and OI-4 zoning districts and planned development zoning lots shall be applied to the district or lot as a\nwhole and not to individual parts thereof.\n3.8.2 Dimensional Regulations.\nAbout the Building Envelope. Sections (f)-(j) define the three-dimensional building envelope. All structures, or portions thereof, must be placed within the building envelope and may not encroach the\nbuilding envelope unless specifically exempted by this Appendix.\nDivisions (f) and (g) regulate the setback height and core height, respectively, which together define the vertical extent of the building envelope.\nDivisions (h)-(j) regulate the street, interior, and north setback lines, respectively, which together define the perimeter setback line and horizontal extent of the building envelope.\nDefinitions. Refer to Appendix A for definitions of applicable terms.\n(a) Zoning District. Column (A) refers to the applicable Zoning District. The requirements set forth in sections (b)-(i) below, relate to the zoning district specified in the row under Column (A),\n(b) Minimum Lot Size. Column (B) is expressed in square feet of gross land area.\nNotes:\n(1) Where a zoning lot is located in more than one zoning district, the minimum gross land area required of such zoning lot shall be the sum of the areas derived by multiplying the minimum\ngross land area required for each represented district by the proportion of the zoning lot located within that district.\n(2) For all uses that consist of three (3) or more dwelling units, the minimum lot size is two (2) times the figure shown in Column (B).\n(c) Minimum Frontage. Column (C) is the minimum width of the lot measured along the street.\nNotes:\n(1) Where a zoning lot fronts on two (2) or more streets, minimum street frontage width requirements shall be considered met if the frontage along any one of such streets meets the minimum\nstreet frontage width requirements.\n(2) Where a zoning lot fronts on a turning circle of a cul-de-sac or at a point of a street where the radius of the curvature of the right-of-way is less than ninety (90) feet, the minimum street\nfrontage width requirement shall be thirty-five (35) feet.\n(d) Minimum Lot Width. Column (D) is the minimum width of the lot, expressed in feet, measured at least twenty-five (25) feet interior from the minimum street setback. No portion of a lot, created\nas part of a subdivision, between a street setback and the opposite interior (rear) setback, shall be less than twenty (20) feet in width.\nException:\n(1) Authorized flag lots, created as part of a subdivision and subject to the lot layout standards in section 5.2, may contain areas between a street setback and the opposite interior (rear) setback\nthat are less than twenty (20) feet in width. Authorized flag lots shall reach the minimum lot width at a point not to exceed two hundred (200) feet from the street right-of-way.\nNotes:\n(2) Where a zoning lot fronts on two (2) or more streets, minimum lot width requirements shall be considered met if the lot width at the street setback from any one of such streets meets the\nminimum lot width requirement.\n(3)\nWhere a zoning lot fronts on a turning circle of a cul-de-sac or at a point of a street where the radius of the curvature of the right-of-way is less than ninety (90) feet, the minimum lot width\nshall be reached at a distance derived by the following formula: D = 50 (W)(35) 50, where W = minimum required lot width, and D = maximum distance from street right-of-way to where the\nlot width equals the minimum required width for that district.\n(e) Maximum Setback Height: Column (E) is the maximum allowable height at the perimeter setback line of a zoning lot, as defined by the minimum street, interior, and solar setbacks.\n(1)\nHeight shall be measured from mean finished grade, along the street fa\u00e7ade of the building. Where a structure fronts more than one (1) street, height shall be measured from the lower, more\nrestrictive mean finished grade.\n(2)\n42 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\n\nNEW PAGE 43\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nTo determine mean finished grade, take the spot elevations from the highest and lowest points of the foundation. The average of these two (2) spots elevations is the mean finished grade and the elevation\nfrom which height measurements are made.\n(3) The entire structure, and all portions thereof, is subject to the maximum setback height.\nExceptions:\nA. The structure or part thereof is below the allowable core height, as described in division (g) below.\nB. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted in section 3.8.3 Exceptions to Setback and Height Requirements, below.\nC. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted as provided elsewhere in this Appendix.\n(4) For purposes of applying setback and height regulations to development within an OI-3 or OI-4 zoning district or within a townhouse development or a planned development, all contiguous\nland within the district, townhouse development, or planned development shall be considered as a single zoning lot.\n(f) Maximum Core Height: Column (F) is the maximum allowable height in the interior or core area of a lot. The core height provides additional allowable height on the interior of a zoning lot based\non the horizontal distance measured away from the perimeter setback line of the lot. The allowable core height increases with the distance interior to the lot, measured from the perimeter\nsetback line at a rate described below.\n(1) In all Zoning Districts, except those explicitly named in subdivision (2), the allowable core height increases at a rate of one (1) foot in height for every two (2) feet of distance interior to the lot,\nmeasured away from the perimeter setbacks. This is equivalent to a slope of 1/2 (rise/run) or 1:2.\n(2) In the Town Center 1 to 3, Office/Institutional 3 to 4 zoning districts the allowable core height increases at the following rates:\nA. Street and interior setbacks: one (1) feet in height for every one (1) feet of distance interior to the lot, measured away from the street and interior setbacks. This is equivalent to a slope of\n1/1 (rise/run) or 1:1.\nB. Solar setbacks: one (1) feet in height for every one (1) foot and seven-tenths of a foot (1.7 feet) of distance interior to the lot, measured away from the street and interior setbacks. This is\nequivalent to a slope of 1/1.7 (rise/run) or 1:1.7.\n(3) No structure, or part thereof, shall project beyond the allowable core height of a structure or part thereof.\nExceptions:\nA. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted in section 3.8.3 Exceptions to Setback and Height Requirements, below.\nB. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted as provided elsewhere in this Appendix.\n(4) If a structure is located in the vicinity of an airport, the height limitations set forth in Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 77, or successor regulations, shall apply where such limitations are\nstricter than those established in this appendix.\n(g) Minimum Street Setback. Column (G) establishes a minimum setback from the street right-of-way line. Where a zoning lot fronts on a street with a right-of-way width not meeting the standards of\nthis appendix, street setback shall be measured from a line running parallel to the centerline of the street at a distance from such centerline equal to one-half (1/2) the standard right-of-way width\nof the street.\nException:\n(1) The town manager or town council may exempt lots from this requirement upon making one (1) of the following findings:\nA. Where a building line has already been established by existing structures along the block which are situated on lots comprising at least twenty-five (25) percent of the street frontage, the\nbuilding may be constructed at the established building line; or\nB. The existing right-of-way is adequate to encompass any anticipated need for widening of the street or other improvements and widening of the right-of-way to town standards would\ncreate nonconforming street setbacks for other structures on the street.\n(h) Minimum Interior Setback. Column (H) establishes a minimum setback measured from the interior lot lines.\nException:\n(1) The interior setback requirements may be reduced to zero (0) under certain conditions (see section 5.2.8.).\nNote:\n(2) Side setbacks are set at zero (0) in many non-residential districts in order to encourage the formation of a street wall, as is found in traditional commercial centers such as the TC district along\nFranklin Street.\n(i) Minimum Solar Setback. Column (I) establishes a minimum setback measured from north lot lines. Where a solar setback and either a street or interior setback both apply to the same portion of a\nlot line, the required minimum setback shall be the greater of the two (2).\nExceptions:\n(1) The solar setback may be reduced to zero (0) under certain conditions (see section 5.2.8).\n(2) Minimum solar setback requirements shall not apply to any structure, or part thereof, when the proposed height of the structure is ninety (90) percent, or less, of the maximum allowed\nsetback height. In such cases, the lesser interior setback may be used instead.\n(j)\nMaximum Impervious Surface Ratio. Column (J) establishes the maximum ratio of impervious surface on a lot. The maximum amount of impervious surface area is divided by multiplying the gross\nland area of the lot by the ratio established in Column (K) and as described below:\n(1) Single-family and two-family residential development: (.50)\n(2) Multifamily developments, fraternities and sororities, non-residential, or mixed-use development: (.70).\nException:\n(3) Impervious surface restrictions shall not apply to town center zoning districts.\n(k) Maximum Floor Area Ratio. Maximum floor area allowed shall be the number of square feet derived by multiplying gross land area by the applicable floor area ratio (FAR) as shown in Table 3.8.1.\nExceptions:\n(1) A maximum floor area ratio shall not apply to:\nA. Dwelling Units, Single-Family\nB. Dwelling Units, Single-Family with Accessory Apartment\nC. Dwelling Units, Single-Family with Cottage\nD. Public Cultural Facilities\n(2) For two-family dwellings on a single zoning lot, the floor area shall be .40 in all zones and overlay zones, except where the overlay zone establishes a more restrictive floor area ratio for\nduplexes.\n(3)\nFor public elementary and secondary schools, the maximum floor area ratio shall be 0.174 unless a higher floor area ratio is established in Column (L).\n43 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 44\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(4) Where a lot is partially within the resource conservation district, the maximum allowable floor area of the portion of the lot outside of the resource conservation district shall be calculated\nthe sum of:\nas\nA. The product of, and\n(i) The floor area ratio of the portion of the zoning lot outside the resource conservation district, and\n(ii) The area, in square feet, of the portion of the zoning lot outside the resource conservation district.\nB. The product of\n(i) The floor area ratio applicable to a permitted use in the resource conservation district, and\n(ii) The area, in square feet, of the portion of the zoning lot within the resource conservation district.\n( Ord.

The town encourages cluster developments as defined in Appendix A [Definitions]. Cluster developments, as defined in Appendix A [Definitions], require modification of lot size\nstandards; individual lots may be somewhat smaller but the sum of reductions in lot area becomes common recreation area for the benefit of all residents of the cluster development. The\nrecreation area is increased and the intensity of development is controlled. Cluster developments also allow the developer greater design flexibility and will permit reasonable use of land with\ndifficult topography.\n(b) Approval requirements. The town council may approve a cluster development in any residential district, or the HR-L or HR-M Special Districts, if it finds that:\n(1) The tract proposed for cluster development is at least two (2) acres in size.\n(2) Public, separate, water supply and sewerage connections are available for every subdivided lot.\n(3)\nThe total number of lots proposed for the tract, excluding parcels of reserved recreation area, is not greater than the number determined by multiplying the total gross land area by the\nmaximum density established in section 3.8 for that zoning district.\n(4) The recreation area reserved within the tract shall conform to the recreation area standards of section 5.5.\n(5) The minimum amount of land reserved as recreation area shall be the sum of all reductions in minimum gross land area as a result of the cluster form of development, combined with the\nminimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5. Only the minimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5 may be dedicated outside the boundaries of the land being\nsubdivided as specified in section 5.5.2.\n(c)\nReductions in lot and setback requirements. For lots created as part of a cluster development, minimum gross land area, minimum lot width, and minimum setback requirements may be reduced\nas follows:\n(1) Minimum lot size requirements specified in section 3.8 may be reduced to five thousand, five hundred (5,500) square feet gross land area.\n(2) Minimum lot width requirements specified in section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to fifty (50) feet.\n(3) Minimum street setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the street lot line forms an exterior boundary of the cluster development.\n(4)\nMinimum interior setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to eight (8) feet except where the interior lot line\nforms a boundary of the cluster development.\n(5) Minimum solar setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the north lot line forms\na\nboundary of the cluster development.\n(d) Floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations. For lots created as part of a cluster development, floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations, as shown in Table 3.8-1, shall be\ncalculated using the gross land area of the lot or the minimum lot size for the zoning district, whichever is greater.\n(Ord.

This section promotes the public health, safety and welfare of the town by promoting housing of high quality located in neighborhoods throughout the community for households of\na\nvariety of income levels, ages and sizes in order to meet the town's goal of preserving and promoting a culturally and economically diverse population in our community.\nBased upon the review and consideration of reports and analyses of the housing supply in the town, the town finds and determines that the diversity of its housing stock has declined for many reasons\nincluding increasing property values and construction costs. The town recognizes the need to provide affordable housing to households of a broad range of income levels in order to maintain a diverse\npopulation and to provide housing for those who live or work in the town. Without intervention, the trend toward rising housing prices will result in an increasingly inadequate supply of affordable housing\nfor town residents and local employees, which will have a negative impact upon the ability of local employers to maintain an adequate local work force and will otherwise be detrimental to the public health,\nsafety and welfare of the town and its residents. Since the remaining land appropriate for new residential development within the town is limited, it is essential that a reasonable proportion of such land be\ndeveloped into housing units affordable to low- and moderate-income households and working families. The town finds and determines that additional market rate development would displace and\neliminate opportunities for additional affordable housing in the town unless the restrictions on use established by this section are included. This displacement would create the following threats to the\nhealth, safety, or the general welfare of the community:\nIncreases in travel time and distances for persons who provide services or are employed in the town, but who cannot find decent, affordable shelter, which in turn increases traffic congestion,\nreduces air and water quality, and has an adverse impact on public health resulting from excessive commuting; and\nAn imbalance in population diversity; and\nInconsistency with the vision for future development and the specific policies of the town's comprehensive plan.\nThe regulations set forth in this section further a key goal of the town's comprehensive plan: to create and preserve affordable housing opportunities. The regulations also support other goals of the\ntown including the reduction of traffic congestion and associated air pollution; and the prevention of sprawl through the maintenance of the urban services boundary. Documentation exists demonstrating\nthat the construction of residential dwelling units in Chapel Hill generates need for affordable housing for workers and families. These regulations are intended to provide a structure for cooperative\nparticipation by the public and private sectors in the production of affordable housing.\n3.10.1 Applicability and Minimum Project Size.\n(a) Single-family and two-family units. This section applies to all development that includes:\n(1) At least five (5) single-family dwelling units or two-family dwelling units; or\n(2) At least five (5) single-family lots; or\n(3) Two-family lots in which six (6) or more residential units are allowed by the Chapel Hill Land Use Management Ordinance, either individually or as part of the same subdivision.\n(b) Multifamily units. This section applies to all development that includes:\n(1) New development that creates at least five (5) multifamily dwelling units; or\n(2) Any vertical mixed use building that creates at least five (5) multifamily dwelling units; or\n(3) Renovation or reconstruction of an existing building that contains multifamily dwelling units, and that increases the number of dwelling units from the number of dwelling units in the original\nstructure by at least five (5); or\n(4) Any change in use of all or part of an existing building from a nonresidential use to a residential use that has at least five (5) dwelling units.\n3.10.2 Affordable Dwelling Units or Lots Required.\n(a) General requirement.
