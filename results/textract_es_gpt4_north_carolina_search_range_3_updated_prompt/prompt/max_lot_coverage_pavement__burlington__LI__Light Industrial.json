You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Light Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"LI\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage_pavement\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: coverage, impervious surface, lot coverage by impervious surfaces, lot coverage, max imperv. coverage, max impervious coverage. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. If Light Industrial (LI) is referring\nto a general residential district, we are only interested in the requirement of\nmax_lot_coverage_pavement for single-family homes. However, if it is referring to a specific district,\nlike Multi Family Residential (MFR), General Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested\nin the requirement of max_lot_coverage_pavement for Light Industrial (LI).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \"\\n\" and any type of special characters.\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // The value of max_lot_coverage_pavement extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage_pavement records the amount of land that may be covered by both buildings and other impervious surfaces, such as pavement. If the document specifies the maximum lot coverage by buildings only, DO NOT include it. If the document refers to maximum lot coverage generally, you can assume it includes both buildings and impervious surfaces and include it. If the document only specifies impervious surface coverage, it can be considered as building coverage and included in the answer.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage_pavement is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage_pavement and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 100\nAs of 01/17/23\nUses listed as SR in the LI District in section 21-113, the table of uses, shall comply with the\nfollowing criteria, as applicable:\n(1) Site plan.

Multiple buildings may be used in\ncalculating the maximum allowable building size.\n(5) Impervious surface.

HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (HDR) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe High Density Residential (HDR) district is established to accommodate a wide\nrange of residential and institutional use types at high densities. The district allows\na wide range of housing types, including duplexes, triplexes, quadraplexes, upper-\nstory residential, single-family attached, and single-family detached dwellings. The\ndistrict also allows pocket neighborhoods and bungalow courts. As a means of\ncreating compact, functional neighborhoods, the district also allows a wide variety\nof\ninstitutional uses, including community centers, day care, schools, assisted living,\nreligious institutions, parks, and utilities. Mixed use development is also allowed in\nlocations where negative impacts can be minimized. Proximity and access to transit\nfacilities and alternative forms of transportation are vital in this district. Low density\ndevelopment comprised of uniform building types or styles is discouraged.\nB.

Activities take place almost\nentirely indoors and result in minimal exterior movement of\nvehicles, materials, and goods in areas around the district.\nBuildings are situated so as to have minimal visual impacts, and\nare well-screened from adjacent lower intensity uses. Heavy\nindustrial uses and uses with significant adverse impacts on\nadjoining lands, single-family detached homes, and other low-\nintensity uses are prohibited.\nNOTES:\n[1] Development within the WPO is subject to the built-upon limits in Section 3.20.F, Water Supply Watershed Protection\nOverlay (WPO) District.\n[2] The required amount of open space set aside shall be configured with passive open space features in accordance with\nSection 7.1, Open Space Set-Aside.\n[3] On corner lots of record, the street setback may be reduced by 50 percent on the long side of the lot.\n[4] When the lot abuts a residential or OI zoning district, the setback shall be at least 15 feet.\n[5] Same as minimum side setback.\n[6] Applied in lieu of side or rear setbacks in multi-building developments.\n[7] In accordance with the North Carolina Building Code.\n[8] Development in the AHO is subject to the maximum building heights in Section 3.20.B, Airport Height Overlay (AHO)\nDistrict.\n[9] Maximum building height of 36 feet for buildings located within 500 feet of a single-family detached residential dwelling.\nCity of Burlington\n3-22\nUnified Development Ordinance\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\nCELL (1, 1): \nB.

Use of the conservation subdivision\nconfiguration is optional for residential subdivisions of five lots\nor more. While the district allows single-family detached\nhomes, manufactured homes in park-style developments or on\nindividual lots are prohibited. The district accommodates\nequestrian uses, utilities, as well as various neighborhood-\nsupporting institutional uses such as parks, schools, and public\nsafety facilities. District regulations discourage uses that\ninterfere with the development of residential neighborhoods or\nthat are detrimental to the suburban nature of the district.\nConservation subdivisions have reduced dimensional\nrequirements but must retain at least 50 percent of the\ndevelopment area as open space set-aside.\nB.
