You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Watershed Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"WO\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Watershed Overlay\n(WO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Watershed Overlay (WO).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Purpose. The purpose of establishing supplementary requirements for development in\ndowntown Pilot Mountain is to protect and enhance the visual character of development and\nto preserve the unique streetscape of downtown by encouraging compatibility among\ndowntown structures. It is not the intent of this overlay district to eliminate architectural\nfreedom or discourage innovative design, but rather to complement the Town of Pilot\nMountain's Development Ordinance and development guidelines for Downtown.\n2.\nApplicability. Buildings within the Downtown Design Overlay (DDO) District exhibit design\nelements that contribute to the unique sense of character of downtown Pilot Mountain.\nSpecifically, buildings tend to have flat or low pitch roofs concealed by the front facade\nparapet, no front or side yard setback, large storefront windows on the street level floor and\nstrong horizontal separations between the first and any upper floors created by windows and/\nor changes in fa\u00e7ade materials.\nIn order to continue and, in some cases, recreate the historic development pattern of\ndowntown Pilot Mountain, the following standards shall apply to all new construction,\nadditions and substantial modifications to existing structures located within the Downtown\nDesign Overlay (DDO) District. For the purposes of this section substantial modification shall\nbe defined as any work which involves the alteration of the building's footprint, construction of\nadditional stories, changes in roof pitch, modification of building fenestration and entryways,\nmaterial changes to the building fa\u00e7ade, or painting.\n3.

Building mounted floodlights are prohibited.\nii. Building mounted lighting fixtures shall be architecturally compatible with the\nbuilding.\niii. The framing of windows or other architectural features with neon or similar\ntypes of tube lighting is prohibited.\niv. Bulbs and lenses installed on building mounted lights may only produce white\nlight.\n5. Procedures. Prior to initiating any activity which is not specifically exempted by Subsection 3\nof the DDO regulations, the person proposing to undertake such activity shall submit an\napplication for the review and approval of the proposed construction, modification, alteration,\nor other activity in accordance with Section 3.8 (Architectural Design Plans).\n9.2 Watershed Overlay District (WO)\n1. Jurisdiction. The provisions of this section shall apply within the corporate limits of the town\nand within the territory beyond the corporate limits as prescribed by N.C.G.S. 160D, as now\nor hereafter fixed, for a distance of one mile in all directions.\n2. Exceptions to Applicability. Existing development, as defined in this section is not subject\nto the requirements of this section. Expansions to structures classified as existing\n\n\nNEW PAGE 87\ndevelopment must meet the requirements of this section; however, the built-upon area of the\nexisting development is not required to be included in the density calculations.\nA pre-existing lot owned by an individual prior to the effective date of this section, regardless\nof whether or not a vested right has been established, may be developed for single-family\nresidential purposes without being subject to the restrictions of this section. However, this\nexemption is not applicable to multiple contiguous lots under single ownership.\n3. Cluster Development. Minimum lot sizes are not applicable to single-family cluster\ndevelopments projects; however, the total number of lots shall not exceed the number of lots\nallowed for single-family detached developments. The overall residential density or\nnonresidential built-upon area shall not exceed that allowed for the critical area or the\nbalance of the watershed, whichever is applicable.\n4. Buffer Zone Required\na. A buffer zone for the purposes of this requirement is defined as an area of natural\nor\nplanted vegetation through which storm water runoff flows in a diffuse manner so that\nthe runoff does not become channelized and which provides for infiltration of the\nrunoff and filtering of pollutants. The buffer zone is measured from the normal pool\nelevation of impounded structures and from the bank of each side of streams and\nrivers.\nb. No new development is allowed in the buffer zone, except for water dependent\nstructures and public projects such as road crossings and green ways where no\npractical alternative exists.\nC. These activities should minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff away from the\nsurface waters and maximize the utilization of storm water best management\npractices.\nd. A minimum thirty (30') foot vegetative buffer zone for development activities is\nrequired along all perennial waters indicated on the most recent versions of U.S.G.S.\n1:24,000 (7.5 minute) scale topographic maps or as determined by local government\nstudies, unless a high density option is chosen and then a one-hundred (100') foot\nbuffer zone is required. Desirable artificial stream bank or shoreline stabilization\nis\npermitted.\n5. Ordinance Administrator's Duties. It shall be the duty of Ordinance Administrator to\nadminister and enforce the provisions of this section as follows:\na. The Ordinance Administrator shall keep records of all amendments to these overlay\nprovisions and shall provide copies of all amendments upon adoption to the N.C.\nDivision of Environmental Quality and the N.C. Division of Community Assistance.\nb.\nThe Ordinance Administrator shall keep a record of minor and major watershed\nvariances to these overlay provisions. The record of all minor watershed variances\nshall be submitted to the Environmental Management Commission on an annual\nbasis and shall provide a description of each project receiving a variance and the\nreasons for granting the variance.\n6. Definitions. For the purpose of this subsection, the following definitions shall apply unless\nthe context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.\nAGRICULTURAL USE.
