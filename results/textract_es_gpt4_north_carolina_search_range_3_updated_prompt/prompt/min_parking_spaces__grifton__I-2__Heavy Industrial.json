You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Heavy Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"I-2\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Heavy Industrial\n(I-2) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Heavy Industrial (I-2).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\"). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 165\n165/167\nCELL (1, 1):\nRestaurants (with drive through service)\nCELL (1, 2):\nOne (1) space for each four (4) seating\naccommodations, plus one (1) space for each\ntwo (2) employees on the shift of largest\nemployment; and Three (3) stacking spaces\nfor each drive through window.\nCELL (2, 1):\nSchool, Elementary and Middle (both public\nand private):\nCELL (2, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each classroom and\nadministrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee and one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (3, 1):\nSchool, High School (both public and private)\nCELL (3, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each fifteen (15)\nstudents for which the building was designed,\nplus one (1) parking space for each classroom\nand administrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee, plus one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (4, 1):\nShopping Centers, large and small\nCELL (4, 2):\nOne (1) space for each three hundred (300)\nsquare feet of gross floor area.\nCELL (5, 1):\nSingle Family, Duplex, Condominiums,\nManufactured Homes, and similar residential\nCELL (5, 2):\nTwo (2) spaces per dwelling unit\nCELL (6, 1):\nTerminals, Bus\nCELL (6, 2):\nOne (1) space for each employee and one (1)\nspace for each bus loading ramp and track.\nCELL (7, 1):\nStadiums, Theaters, and similar uses\ninvolving the assembling of persons:\nCELL (7, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each four (4) seats\nin the largest assembly room.

This district is intended to accommodate a variety of low-density\nsingle-family residential and agriculture uses where public water and sewer is not available.\nCompatible uses such as churches and recreational facilities may be allowed. As the community grows\nand public sewer is extended, areas within the RA-20 District may be converted to more intense urban\ndevelopment.\n(C) RA-20 MH Residential District. This district, like the RA-20 District, is intended to\naccommodate low-residential development. However, the focus is on promoting high quality\nmanufactured home development.\n(D) R-14 Residential District. This district is intended to accommodate a limited variety of single-\nfamily dwellings at a density of at least 14,000 square feet where both public water and sewer is\navailable. Compatible uses such as churches and recreational uses may also be allowed. However, high\nimpact uses such as multi-family dwellings or manufactured home parks as defined in this chapter are\nspecifically excluded because they are inconsistent with the single-family residential character of this\ndistrict.\n(E) R-10 Residential District. This district is intended to accommodate a limited variety of single-\nfamily dwellings at a density of at least 10,000 square feet per dwelling where both public water and\nsewer is available. Compatible uses such as churches and recreational uses may also be allowed.\nHowever, high impact uses such as multi-family dwellings or manufactured home parks as defined in\nthis chapter are specifically excluded because they are inconsistent with the single-family residential\ncharacter of this district.\n(F) R-8 Residential District. This district is intended to accommodate a wide variety of housing\ntypes at a density of at least 8,000 square feet per dwelling where public water and sewer is available.\nCompatible uses such as churches and recreational facilities may also be allowed.\n(G) R-6 SF Residential District. In contrast to the R-6 Residential, where a wide variety of\nhousing types are accommodated, this district is intended to accommodate only single-family\ndwellings, at a density of at least 6,000 square feet per dwelling, where public water and sewer is\navailable. Compatible uses such as churches and recreational facilities may also be allowed.\n(H) R-6 Residential District. This district is intended to accommodate a wider variety of housing\ntypes (single-family dwellings as well as duplexes, multi-family dwellings and manufactured home\nparks) than in the R-6 SF District, at a density of at least 6,000 square feet, where public water and\nsewer is available.

The following business districts are hereby established: CBD, B-1.\n\n\nNEW PAGE 32\n(B) CBD - Central Business District.\n(1) This district is intended for areas within the town designated to accommodate the type of\ncommercial and governmental development that has characterized the central downtown area of the\ntown. Older structures are clustered together with common walls with only sidewalks separating them\nfrom the public street. Parking is provided directly on the street or to the rear of the building. Some of\nthe newer development has departed from older pattern. Individual units located on lots with setbacks\nand off-street parking. Future development here shall be consistent with the pattern that has already\noccurred in order to enhance the small town, pedestrian scale that characterizes the core area of the\ntown.\n(2) (a) Only low impact uses that are compatible with the goal of preserving the small town\ncharacter of the town will be allowed. Low impact activities are characterized as uses that:\n1. Are located in small structures, usually under 5,000 square feet on lots\ncontaining less than one acre;\n2. Operated with less than ten employees;\n3. Normally operate between the hours of 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.; and\n4.\nAre primarily conducted inside an enclosed structure with few negative external\nimpacts such as outdoor storage of equipment or products, high noise levels or offensive odors.\n(b) (These are not precise development criteria, but more illustrations of low impact\nuses.)\n(C) B-1 District (Highway Business).\n(1) This district is intended for areas within the town's planning jurisdiction established for\nhigher impact commercial uses than in the CBD District. The town wants to encourage this type of\ndevelopment along major highways in clusters at strategic locations rather than in continuous strips.\nHigh impact is defined as activities that:\n(a) Are located in large structures, often over 5,000 square feet in area on lots larger than\none acre;\n(b) Employ more than ten employees;\n(c) Can generate a large number of customers at any one time;\n(d) Operate during the daytime and evening hours; and\n(e) Conduct business inside and outside an enclosed structure with some negative\n\n\nNEW PAGE 33\nexternal impacts such as outdoor storage of materials (equipment, products or raw materials) that can\ngenerate high noise levels or offensive odors.\n(2) Uses in this area will be discouraged that undermine the integrity of businesses in the\ndowntown area. In addition the community wants to promote new development where signage is\nin\nscale with the structure and the site is appropriately landscaped. Each project needs to design its\ndriveways and parking areas SO they provide convenient and safe vehicular flow and minimize traffic\ndisruption. (These are not precise development criteria, but more illustrations of low impact uses.)\n(D) Neighborhood Commercial District. This district is intended for areas within the town's\nplanning jurisdiction established for low impact commercial activities along local streets that are\ncompatible with adjoining residential areas. The intent is to accommodate a limited number of uses that\nwill allow property owners to pursue economic opportunities while minimizing any disruptive\ncharacteristics such as high traffic volume on local streets.\n(E) Office/Institutional District. This district is intended for areas within the town's planning\njurisdiction that are established to promote the development of moderately intensive commercial and\ninstitutional uses that are characterized more as a service provider than selling a product. Generally,\nthese uses can provide a transition from a commercial (where a wide range of goods and services are\nsold) and residential districts (where only residential uses and a limited number of compatible uses are\npermitted.)\n(Ord. passed 1-11-2005, \u00a7 3-2)\n\u00a7 152.097 INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.\n(A) General. The following manufacturing districts are hereby established: I-1, I-2.\n(B) I-1 Light Industrial District.\n(1) This district is intended for areas established to accommodate a limited number of\nindustrial, wholesale, warehouse and related commercial uses/services, which in their normal\noperation, have little or no adverse effect upon adjoining properties. Low impact is defined here to\ninclude activities that are:\n(a) In structures containing less than 50,000 square feet on small lots (five acres or less);\n(b) Employ less than 100 people on any single shift; and\n(c) Conduct most of their operation inside the principle structures on the property with\nfew negative external impacts such as outdoor storage of equipment or products, high noise levels or\noffensive odors.\n(2) Conversely, uses that have a detrimental impact on adjoining uses shall be prohibited.\nThese activities need to be located in areas better suited to accommodate heavy industrial uses in other\n\nNEW PAGE 34\nparts of the planning area. (These are not precise development criteria, but more illustrations of light\nmanufacturing uses.)\n(C) I-2 Heavy Industrial District.\n(1) This district is intended for areas established to accommodate a wider range of industrial,\nwholesale and related business uses/services than permitted in the I-1 District. Uses here may in their\nnormal operations, have a high impact on the community, particularly adjoining properties. High\nimpact is defined generally to include activities that:\n(a) Are in structures containing more than 50,000 square feet on large lots (five acres or\nmore);\n(b) Employ more than 100 people on any single shift; and\n(c) Conduct some of their operation outside the principal structures on the property with\nnegative external impacts such as outdoor storage of equipment or products, high volume of truck or\nrail traffic, high noise levels or offensive odors or smoke.\n(2) Because of the potential negative impacts, these types of uses generally need to be located\nnear major highways or railroad lines on relatively large tracts of land, away from commercial or\nresidential areas. (These are not precise development criteria, but more illustrations of heavy\nmanufacturing uses.)\n(Ord. passed 1-11-2005, \u00a7 3-3)\n\u00a7 152.098 GREENWAY-RECREATIONAL DISTRICT.\nThis district is intended to accommodate a limited range of uses adjacent to Contentnea Creek that\nare consistent with best management practices (BMPs) within floodplains.\n(Ord. passed 1-11-2005, \u00a7 3-4)\n\u00a7 152.099 FLOODPLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT.\nThe floodplain district is established to promote appropriate development in the 100-year\nfloodplain that will protect humans and minimize damage to property. As an overlay district it shall\nsupplement, not replace, the underlying zoning regulations. Pitt County administers the Flood Hazard\nOrdinance within the planning jurisdiction of the town.
