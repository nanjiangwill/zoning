You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-10\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. If Residential (R-10) is referring\nto a general residential district, we are only interested in the requirement of\nmax_height for single-family homes. However, if it is referring to a specific district,\nlike Multi Family Residential (MFR), General Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested\nin the requirement of max_height for Residential (R-10).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \"\\n\" and any type of special characters.\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // The value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Fences: Within or abutting residential districts, no wall or fence shall exceed four (4) feet\nin height within a front yard or exceed eight (8) feet in height in the rear and side yard;\nand in all other non-residential districts, no fence shall exceed eight (8) feet in height.\nThe setback requirements of these regulations shall not prohibit any necessary retaining\nwall or prohibit any wall or fence. Vision clearance at intersections as defined in Section\n15.05 shall be maintained.\nWithin abutting residential districts, all man-made fences or walls shall have at least a\nfinished side facing out (no adjoining property) and no fence or wall shall contain barbed\n(except enclosing livestock) or razor wire or any other dangerous features. Must create a\ncomplete visual screen. Acceptable materials are masonry, cedar, redwood, and pressure\ntreated lumber resistant to rot. Fence installation should be consistent with acceptable\nbuilding practices.\nB. Berms:\nMinimum Height - 5 feet\nMaximum Slope - 2 feet horizontal for each 1 foot vertical (2:1)\nMinimum Crown Width - 2 feet\nC. Minimum Plant Size:\nUnless otherwise indicated elsewhere in this Section, all plant material shall meet the\nfollowing minimum size standards at the time of planting:\nD. Spacing in Buffer yards C, D, E, and F:\nBuffer yards C, D, E, and F are intended to create a complete visual screening year-\nround. Therefore, proposed and existing vegetation should be spaced to accomplish this\npurpose. No more than two (2) continuous feet of horizontal plane, as measured and\nviewed perpendicular from the property line, may be void of vegetation at least six (6)\nfeet in height within ten (10) years of planting.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nBuffer Yard F\nCELL (1, 3): \nBuffer Yard F\nCELL (2, 1): \nLot Size\nCELL (2, 2): \nBuffer Yard\nWidth Required\nCELL (2, 3): \nNumber of Plant Units Per\n100 Linear Feet of Buffer Yard\nCELL (3, 1): \nAll sizes\nCELL (3, 2): \n50\nCELL (3, 3): \n6 large trees, 9 small trees,\n45 Evergreen shrubs\nCELL (1, 1): \nPlanting Material Type\nCELL (1, 2): \nMinimum Planting Size\nCELL (2, 1): \nLarge Tree\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (3, 1): \nSingle-Stem\nCELL (3, 2): \n1 1/2 inch caliper\nCELL (4, 1): \nMulti-Stem\nCELL (4, 2): \n6 feet in height\nCELL (5, 1): \nSmall Tree\nCELL (5, 2): \n4 feet in height\nCELL (6, 1): \nEvergreen Shrubs\nCELL (6, 2): \n1 foot in height\n\n\n Output:"}]}
