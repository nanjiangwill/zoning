You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Water Supply Watershed Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"WSW\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"floor_to_area_ratio\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: f.a.r., far, floor area ratio, floor to area, floor-area ratio, floor-to-area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Water Supply Watershed Overlay\n(WSW) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of floor_to_area_ratio for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of floor_to_area_ratio\nfor Water Supply Watershed Overlay (WSW).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of floor_to_area_ratio extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for floor_to_area_ratio is typically between 0.1 and 20 (10% to 2000%). Please focus on values within this range when searching for floor_to_area_ratio and provide the answer as a decimal value (e.g., 50% should be 0.5). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 90\nWater Supply Watershed Overlay (WSW)\n\nNEW PAGE 82\n(d) General Requirements.\n1. Along existing streets, new buildings shall create a transition in spacing,\nmass, scale, and street frontage relationship from existing buildings to\nbuildings in the Transit-Oriented Employment district.\na. New buildings are expected to exceed the scale and volume of\nexisting buildings, but shall demonstrate compatibility by varying\nthe massing of buildings to reduce perceived scale and volume.\nThe definition of massing in Article 12 illustrates the application\nof design techniques to reduce the visual perception of size and\nintegrate larger buildings with pre-existing smaller buildings.\nb. Subsection 3.2.14(d)(1) shall not apply to development on\nparcels where multifamily structures are an allowable use and\nthe development contains two or more affordable housing units\nfor families or individuals with incomes below eighty percent\n(80%) of the area median income.\n2. On new streets, allowable building and lot types will establish the\ndevelopment pattern.\n(e) Design Provisions.\n1. Every building shall share a frontage line with a street, or urban open\nPage 82\n\nNEW PAGE 83\nspace; lots fronting directly onto an urban open space (i.e., without\nintervening street) shall be provided rear alley access.\n2. New construction favors general office uses, with accessory retail,\npersonal services, restaurant, and similar uses located at street level and\nresidential uses permitted on third and higher floors.\n3. Notwithstanding the height restrictions of Article 4, Building and Lot\nTypes, new buildings in the Transit Oriented Employment district are\nlimited to seven stories or 80 feet in height, whichever is greater.\nMinimum building height is 26 feet, measured at the leave line.\n4. Minimum permitted Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is .35; preferred FAR will\nrange from .5 to 1.5.\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"4.
