You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Public Interest\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"PID\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage_pavement\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: coverage, impervious surface, lot coverage by impervious surfaces, lot coverage, max imperv. coverage, max impervious coverage. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. If Public Interest (PID) is referring\nto a general residential district, we are only interested in the requirement of\nmax_lot_coverage_pavement for single-family homes. However, if it is referring to a specific district,\nlike Multi Family Residential (MFR), General Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested\nin the requirement of max_lot_coverage_pavement for Public Interest (PID).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \"\\n\" and any type of special characters.\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // The value of max_lot_coverage_pavement extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage_pavement records the amount of land that may be covered by both buildings and other impervious surfaces, such as pavement. If the document specifies the maximum lot coverage by buildings only, DO NOT include it. If the document refers to maximum lot coverage generally, you can assume it includes both buildings and impervious surfaces and include it. If the document only specifies impervious surface coverage, it can be considered as building coverage and included in the answer.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage_pavement is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage_pavement and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 100\nAs of 01/17/23\nUses listed as SR in the PID District in section 21-113, the table of uses, shall comply with the\nfollowing criteria, as applicable:\n(1) Site plan.

Multiple buildings may be used in\ncalculating the maximum allowable building size.\n(5) Impervious surface. The maximum impervious surface shall not exceed sixty-five (65)\npercent of the lot.\n(6) Hours of operation. Hours of operation shall not exceed 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.\n(7) Parking. Parking shall be as prescribed in article VII, Parking, for that use.\n(8) Signage. Shall be as prescribed in article VIII, Signs, for the underlying district.\n(9) Noise. Noise shall not exceed the decibel levels during time periods prescribed in section 21-\n241 for construction, manufacturing, transportation, communications, electric, gas and\nsanitary services, wholesale, and service uses.\n(10) Outdoor storage.
