You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Historic District Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"HD\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. If Historic District Overlay (HD) is referring\nto a general residential district, we are only interested in the requirement of\nmax_lot_coverage for single-family homes. However, if it is referring to a specific district,\nlike Multi Family Residential (MFR), General Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested\nin the requirement of max_lot_coverage for Historic District Overlay (HD).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \"\\n\" and any type of special characters.\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // The value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage refers solely to the maximum lot coverage of buildings for primary use and all accessory structures. Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

Purpose and Applicability\nThe purpose of this article is to ensure that the physical characteristics of proposed development are compatible when considered within the context of the\nsurrounding area. Guidelines should be read in conjunction with the general development regulations and zone-specific standards. This section does not apply to\nthe CB, CBP, HD, LI or HI zoning districts.\nB. General Compatibility Requirement\nAll development subject to this article shall be compatible with the established architectural character of the city by using a design that is complementary to\npredominant architectural styles, designs, and forms. Compatibility shall be achieved through techniques such as the repetition of roof lines, the use of similar\nproportions in building mass and outdoor spaces, similar relationships to the street, similar window and door patterns, and the use of building materials that\nhave color, shades, and textures similar to those existing in the immediate area of the proposed development.\nC. General Principals Site\nThe environmental/architectural inventory shall be the foundation on which all site design decisions are based. Minor variations to these regulations may occur\nbased on environmental/architectural conditions at the site. The Planning Director shall approve all site design decisions based on the inventory.\nD. Building Relocation to Surrounding Properties\nabout:blank\n201/285\n\n\nNEW PAGE 202\n6/26/23, 6:20 AM\nStatesville, NC Code of Ordinances\nBuildings shall not significantly overshadow secluded private open spaces or main public area windows into adjacent buildings, ensure no significant loss of\namenity to adjacent dwellings, open space or streetscape. Buildings shall not significantly block scenic vistas from public view. Active recreation and service areas\nshall be located away from secluded private open spaces on adjacent buildings.\nE. Building Aesthetics, Purpose\nBuilding aesthetics establish a base criteria related to the appearance of specific structures. These regulations strike a balance between creativity and\ninnovation on one hand, while avoiding obtrusive, incongruous structures on the other. The City strongly discourages architectural styles that do not build upon\nand promote the existing character of the City. The City supports the view that inspiring, well-maintained, and harmonious development is in the best economic\ndevelopment interests of all residents and businesses.\nF. Building Design\n1. Emphasize Human Scale\nBuilding design shall emphasize a human scale at ground level, at entryways and along street frontages through the creative use of windows, doors,\ncolumns, canopies, and awnings.\n2. Major Building Design Features Proportional\nMajor building design features, such as windows, doors, leaves, and parapets shall be designed to be in proportion to one another.\n3. Structural Lines Retained at Storefront Level\nThe structural lines of a building and its materials shall be retained at the storefront level. For instance, brick piers and columns shall be carried\ndown to street level.\n4. Awnings and Canopies\nAwnings and canopies shall complement the color and material of the building to which they are fixed.\n5. Massing\nA single, large, dominant building mass shall be avoided. Where large structures are required, mass should be broken up through the use of\nsetbacks, projecting and recessed elements, and similar design techniques. Roofline offsets shall be provided to lend an architectural interest and\nvariety to the massing of a building and to relieve the effect of a single long roof.\nG. Avoiding Monotony in Design\nMonotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided by varying detail, form, and siting to the maximum extent practicable, within the\nstandards set forth in this article, to provide visual interest.\nH. Harmony of Design\n1. Purpose\nThe purpose of this section is to achieve good design, not a certain stylistic result. It will also establish a consistent framework for assessing\nproposed development, to protect the visual pattern of the community, and to promote harmony in the visual relationships and transitions\nbetween new and older buildings. New buildings shall respect the scale, form, and proportion of existing development. This can be done by\nrepeating building lines and surface treatments and by requiring some uniformity of detail, scale, proportion, texture, materials, color, and building\nform.\n2. Building Materials\nBuilding materials shall either be similar to the materials already being used in the neighborhood or, if dissimilar materials are being proposed,\nother characteristics such as scale and proportions, form, architectural detailing, color, and texture, shall be utilized to ensure that enough\nsimilarity exists for the building to be compatible, despite the differences in materials. All sides of the building shall use materials consistent with\nthose on the front if visible from public streets, public parking and/or drive-thru areas, and should be carefully designed with similar detailing,\ncompatible quality, and compatible materials. Materials used only on one (1) face of a structure which gives the impression of thinness and\nartificiality are prohibited.\n3. Similar Size and Height for Infill Development\nNew Infill development shall either be similar in size and height or, if larger, be articulated and subdivided into massing that is proportional to the\nmass and scale of other structures on the same block, or if no buildings exist thereon, then on adjoining blocks.\n4. Unify Individual Storefronts\nIf several storefronts are located in one (1) building, the individual storefronts shall be unified in all exterior design elements, such as mass, window\nand door placement, color, materials, and signage. The unified design should represent a theme, rhythm and/or design flow.\n5. Additions and Renovations\nabout:blank\n202/285\n\n\n Output:"}]}
