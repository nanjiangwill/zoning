You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Heavy Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"I-2\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. If Heavy Industrial (I-2) is referring\nto a general residential district, we are only interested in the requirement of\nmax_height for single-family homes. However, if it is referring to a specific district,\nlike Multi Family Residential (MFR), General Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested\nin the requirement of max_height for Heavy Industrial (I-2).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted.

Make sure to include \"\\n\" and any type of special characters.\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // The value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR SOLAR FARMS AS A SPECIAL USE IN THE R-A, I-1 AND I-2 DISTRICTS\na)\nSolar farms and their appurtenant components shall conform to the principal building\nsetbacks of the underlying zoning district which they are located.\nb) Individual modules/panels shall be a maximum of 25 feet in height as measured from the\n13-1\nArticle 13, Scotland County Zoning Ordinance\nAdopted 4/4/2022\n\n\nNEW PAGE 350\nArticle 13 - Solar Farms\ngrade at the base of the structure to the apex of the structure.\nc) A site plan, drawn and stamped by a North Carolina licensed surveyor or engineer, shall be\nsubmitted showing the following:\n(1) The location and dimensions of all proposed areas for the placement\nof solar panels, screening/fencing and related improvements;\n(2) Any pre-existing structures on the same lot, and principal structures on other\nproperties that would affect the placement of solar panels;\n(3) Parking and access areas;\n(4) Location of any proposed solar access easements;\n(5) Any proposed new structures.\nd) Solar farms shall be fully screened from adjoining properties and adjacent roads by an\nevergreen buffer capable of reaching a height of 10 feet within 3 years of planting.\ne) Solar panels shall be mounted onto a pole, rack, or suitable foundation in accordance with\nmanufacturer's specifications, in order to ensure the safe operation and stability of the\nsystem.\nf) Multiple mounting structures shall be spaced apart at the distance recommended by the\nmanufacturer to ensure safety and maximum efficiency.\ng) It is the responsibility of the owner to remove all obsolete or unused systems within 12\nmonths of cessation of operation.\nh) The farm and components shall meet all requirements of the North Carolina State Building\nCode.\ni)\nThe solar array shall be fenced in and access controlled. The site must be accessible 24/7\nfor emergency service.\n13.5. MODIFICATION TO EXISTING SOLAR FARMS\nModifications to an existing SES that increases the SES area by more than 5% of the original footprint or\nchanges the solar panel type (e.g., photovoltaic to solar thermal) shall be subjected to this section.\n13.6. AVIATION NOTIFICATION\na) A map analysis showing a radius of five (5) nautical miles from the center of the SES with any\nairport operations within this area highlighted shall be submitted with permit application.\n1) For consideration of potential impacts to low altitude military flight paths, notification of\n13-2\nArticle 13, Scotland County Zoning Ordinance\nAdopted 4/4/2022\n\n\nNEW PAGE 351\nArticle 13 - Solar Farms\nintent to construct the SES shall be sent to the NC Commanders Council at least 45 days\nprior to permit application submission. Proof of delivery of notification and date of\ndelivery shall\nbe submitted with permit application. Mail to: Commanding General MCIEAST; Attn:\nMr. Bill Meier (NC Commanders Council) or successor; Marine Corps Installations East\nG-7 (MCIEAST); PSC Box 20005; Camp Lejeune, NC 28542. Email: Subject: NC\nCommanders' Council Notification of Solar Development Project in \"County or County\nName\" Address: Meier CIV William A [William.meier@mcw.usmc.mil], Ayers CIV Bryan\nC [bryan.ayers@usmc.mil]. Notification shall include:\ni.\nLocation of SES (i.e., map, coordinates, address, or parcel ID).\nii.\nSolar technology (i.e., polycrystalline PV, monocrystalline PV, Cadmium\nTelluride PV, evacuated tube solar thermal, flat plate solar thermal, etc.).\niii.\nApproximate number of solar modules/panels.\niv.\nSystem mounting (i.e., fixed-tilt on flat roof, fixed-tilt ground-mount, 1-axis\ntracking ground-mount, etc.).\nV.\nThe maximum height of the array from the ground or roof surface.\nvi.\nThe maximum height of any new utility poles.\nvii.\nPower capacity of the system, in both DC and AC Watts where applicable.\nviii.\nAcreage of array and acreage of total project.\nix.\nHow will the project connect? (i.e., net meter, to existing distribution line, to\nnew distribution line, to transmission line).\nX.\nWill a substation be constructed? If so, provide location and size.\nxi.\nIs the site within five nautical miles of aviation operations? If so, provide the\nrequired SGHAT analysis results.\n(1) The latest version of the Solar Glare Hazard Analysis Tool (SGHAT) shall be\nused to evaluate the solar glare aviation hazard. The full report for each flight\npath and observation point, as well as the contact information for the Zoning\nAdministrator, shall be sent to the authority indicated below at least forty-\nfive (45) days prior to permit application submission. Proof of delivery of\nnotification and date of delivery shall be submitted with permit application.\n(2) Airport operations at airports in the National Plan of Integrated Airport\nSystems (NPIAS)2 within 5 nautical miles of the center of SES: provide\nrequired information to the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Airport\nDistrict Office (ADO) with oversight of North Carolina.\n13-3\nArticle 13, Scotland County Zoning Ordinance\nAdopted 4/4/2022\n\n\n Output:"}]}
