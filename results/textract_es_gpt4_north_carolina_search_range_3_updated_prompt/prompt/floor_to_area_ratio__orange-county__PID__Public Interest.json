You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Public Interest\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"PID\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"floor_to_area_ratio\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: f.a.r., far, floor area ratio, floor to area, floor-area ratio, floor-to-area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. If Public Interest (PID) is referring\nto a general residential district, we are only interested in the requirement of\nfloor_to_area_ratio for single-family homes. However, if it is referring to a specific district,\nlike Multi Family Residential (MFR), General Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested\nin the requirement of floor_to_area_ratio for Public Interest (PID).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \"\\n\" and any type of special characters.\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // The value of floor_to_area_ratio extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for floor_to_area_ratio is typically between 0.1 and 20 (10% to 2000%). Please focus on values within this range when searching for floor_to_area_ratio and provide the answer as a decimal value (e.g., 50% should be 0.5). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 90\nPublic Interest (PID)\n\nNEW PAGE 82\n(d) General Requirements.\n1. Along existing streets, new buildings shall create a transition in spacing,\nmass, scale, and street frontage relationship from existing buildings to\nbuildings in the Transit-Oriented Employment district.\na. New buildings are expected to exceed the scale and volume of\nexisting buildings, but shall demonstrate compatibility by varying\nthe massing of buildings to reduce perceived scale and volume.\nThe definition of massing in Article 12 illustrates the application\nof design techniques to reduce the visual perception of size and\nintegrate larger buildings with pre-existing smaller buildings.\nb. Subsection 3.2.14(d)(1) shall not apply to development on\nparcels where multifamily structures are an allowable use and\nthe development contains two or more affordable housing units\nfor families or individuals with incomes below eighty percent\n(80%) of the area median income.\n2. On new streets, allowable building and lot types will establish the\ndevelopment pattern.\n(e) Design Provisions.\n1. Every building shall share a frontage line with a street, or urban open\nPage 82\n\nNEW PAGE 83\nspace; lots fronting directly onto an urban open space (i.e., without\nintervening street) shall be provided rear alley access.\n2. New construction favors general office uses, with accessory retail,\npersonal services, restaurant, and similar uses located at street level and\nresidential uses permitted on third and higher floors.\n3. Notwithstanding the height restrictions of Article 4, Building and Lot\nTypes, new buildings in the Transit Oriented Employment district are\nlimited to seven stories or 80 feet in height, whichever is greater.\nMinimum building height is 26 feet, measured at the leave line.\n4.
