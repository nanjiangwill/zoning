You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Rural Buffer\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"RB\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. If Rural Buffer (RB) is referring\nto a general residential district, we are only interested in the requirement of\nmin_unit_size for single-family homes. However, if it is referring to a specific district,\nlike Multi Family Residential (MFR), General Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested\nin the requirement of min_unit_size for Rural Buffer (RB).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \"\\n\" and any type of special characters.\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // The value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 74\nArticle 4 Zoning Districts\n4.5 Commercial Zoning Districts\n4.5.4.\nSpecial Standards in the RB Zoning District\nD.\nOpen Space\nOpen space requirements for the residential portion of a multifamily or mixed commercial-residential\nproject shall be the same and conform to the requirements for multifamily developments in the MR-\n4-12\nCELL (1, 1):\nUse\nCELL (1, 2):\nDistrict\nCELL (1, 3):\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 4):\nMinimum\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 5):\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 6):\nMinimum\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 7):\nCELL (1, 8):\nYard\n(ft.)\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (2, 1):\nCELL (2, 2):\nCELL (2, 3):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 4):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 5):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 6):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 7):\nFront\nCELL (2, 8):\nRear\nCELL (2, 9):\nSide\nCELL (3, 1):\nAll residential, except\nCELL (3, 2):\nRB\nCELL (3, 3):\n60\nCELL (3, 4):\n60\nCELL (3, 5):\n6,000\nCELL (3, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (3, 7):\n25\u00b3\nCELL (3, 8):\n63\nCELL (3, 9):\n51,2\nCELL (4, 1):\nmultifamily\nCELL (4, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (4, 3):\n75\nCELL (4, 4):\n75\nCELL (4, 5):\n7,500\nCELL (4, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (4, 7):\n253\nCELL (4, 8):\n253\nCELL (4, 9):\n102\nCELL (5, 1):\nMultifamily/ Mixed\nCELL (5, 2):\nRB\nCELL (5, 3):\n100\nCELL (5, 4):\n150\nCELL (5, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (5, 6):\n15,000\nCELL (5, 7):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 8):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 9):\nCELL (6, 1):\ncommercial- residential\nCELL (6, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (6, 3):\n100\nCELL (6, 4):\n100\nCELL (6, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (6, 6):\n7,000\nCELL (6, 7):\nCELL (6, 8):\nCELL (6, 9):\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        \"CELL (2, 5):\\nWith\\nWater and\\nSewer\",\n        \"CELL (3, 5):\\n6,000\",\n        \"CELL (2, 6):\\nWithout\\nWater and\\nSewer\",\n        \"CELL (3, 6):\\n10,000\"\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"For district RB, the section provides the information for min_unit_size.

Refer to Section 4.2.4 for a breakdown\nof the allowable density (i.e., the number of individual dwellings that can be developed on a parcel of property).\n4.\nAllowable impervious surface area is based on the Watershed Protection Overlay District in which the property\nis located. Refer to Section 4.2.5 for a breakdown of the allowable impervious surface area.\n5.\nFor lots outside of a Watershed Protection Overlay District (see Section 4.2), the minimum usable lot area for\nlots that utilize ground absorption wastewater systems shall be 30,000 square feet for parcels between 40,000\nsquare feet and 1.99 acres in size; zoning lots two acres and greater in size shall have a minimum usable lot\narea of at least 40,000 square feet. For Subdivisions utilizing the Flexible Development Option, the required\nwastewater system area may be contained either within the residential lot or within dedicated easement and/or\nseptic lot that is recorded and maintained within allowed open space areas, and as further defined in NC DHHS\nDPH Innovative Waste Water System Approval IWWS 2016-01. Under the Flexible Development Option\nrequired minimum lot size shall be based on proposed wastewater disposal and percentage of open space.\nPlease refer to Section 7.12 for more information.\n6.\nWith the exception of Orange County government development projects, wastewater treatment facilities with a\ndesign capacity of 3,000 gallons per day or more and package treatment plants for sanitary sewage disposal\nare prohibited in the AR zoning district unless approved through a Conditional District.\n7.\nProposed subdivisions are subject to all applicable subdivision standards detailed in Article 7.

Refer to Section\n7.8.4 for additional requirements. Refer to Section 7.8.5 for private road standards.\n9.\nThe storage of junked or wrecked motor vehicles is prohibited except if the vehicle is stored in an enclosed\nbuilding that conforms to applicable building code and zoning regulations or if such building is a legal non-\nconforming use.\nOrange County, North Carolina - Unified Development Ordinance\nPage 3-5\n\n\nNEW PAGE 140\nArticle 3: Base Zoning Districts\nSection 3.3: Residential Districts\nR-1\nRURAL RESIDENTIAL\nPURPOSE\nThe purpose of the Rural Residential (R-1) District is to\nprovide locations for rural non-farm residential\ndevelopment, at very low intensities, in areas where the\nshort and long-term solutions to domestic water supply\nand sewage disposal shall be individual wells and ground\nabsorption system.\nAPPLICABILITY\nThis district will usually be applied where the following\nconditions exist:\n1.
