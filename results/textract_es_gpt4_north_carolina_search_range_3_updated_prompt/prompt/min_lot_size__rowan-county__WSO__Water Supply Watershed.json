You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Water Supply Watershed\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"WSO\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Water Supply Watershed\n(WSO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Water Supply Watershed (WSO).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_lot_size is typically between 1,000 and 2,000,000 sq ft or 0.02 and 50 acres. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 11\n\nWSO Zone\n\nCELL (2, 1):\nField\nCELL (2, 2):\nValue\nCELL (3, 1):\nmin_lot_size\nCELL (3, 2):\n123456 sq ft\nCELL (4, 1):\nApartment Area\nCELL (4, 2):\n10,000\n\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"CELL (3, 2):\\n123456 sq ft\", 11]],\n    \"rationale\": \"The cell that corresponds to the value for min_lot_size in this table has this answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"123456 sq ft\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 32\n\nSection 6.3 Industrial Area & Dimensional Requirements\n1 Public Sewer or Public Water\n2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\n3 For proposed warehouse/manufacturing uses 35%, for all other uses 25%, subject to\nCommission's authority to permit greater coverage based on landscape, architectural design\nand site development elements that exceed minimum standard of the Regulation\n4\nShall be in addition to requirements of 8.1.2 Landscaping and Buffers\n6-4\n\nCELL (1, 1):\nCELL (1, 2):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 3):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 4):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 5):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 6):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 7):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 8):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (1, 10):\nCELL (2, 1):\nZone\nCELL (2, 2):\nMin\nArea\nCELL (2, 3):\nMin\nWidth\nCELL (2, 4):\nMin\nDepth\nCELL (2, 5):\nMax\nStories\nCELL (2, 6):\nMax\nHeight\nCELL (2, 7):\nMax % Lot\nCoverage\nCELL (2, 8):\nMin\nFront\nYard\nCELL (2, 9):\nMin\nSide\nYard\nCELL (2, 10):\nMin\nRear\nYard\nCELL (3, 1):\nI\nCELL (3, 2):\n20,000\nsq. ft.\nCELL (3, 3):\n100'\nCELL (3, 4):\n100'\nCELL (3, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (3, 6):\n50'\nCELL (3, 7):\nN/A\nCELL (3, 8):\n25'\nCELL (3, 9):\n20'\nCELL (3, 10):\n20'\nCELL (4, 1):\nWSO\nCELL (4, 2):\n40,000\nsq. ft. 1\nCELL (4, 3):\n150'\nCELL (4, 4):\n150'\nCELL (4, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (4, 6):\n50'\nCELL (4, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (4, 8):\n50'\nCELL (4, 9):\n20'\nCELL (4, 10):\n20'\nCELL (5, 1):\nWSO\nCELL (5, 2):\n60,000\nsq. ft. 2\nCELL (5, 3):\n200'\nCELL (5, 4):\n200'\nCELL (5, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (5, 6):\n50'\nCELL (5, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (5, 8):\n50'\nCELL (5, 9):\n20'\nCELL (5, 10):\n20'4\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"1 Public Sewer or Public Water\", 32],\n        [\"2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\", 32],\n        [\"CELL (4, 2): \\n40,000\\nsq. ft.\", 32],\n        [\"CELL (5, 2): \\n60,000\\nsq. ft.\", 32]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"From this page we can infer that the value is conditional on the presence of a public sewer or water system, and there are two different values for the current zone, depending on that.\",\n    \"answer\": \"40,000 sq ft (if public water or sewer); 60,000 sq ft (otherwise)\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 66\n\nWSO Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 123 sq ft, side length is 10 ft\n\nNEW PAGE 67\n\nWSO Zone - Senior Active Overlay\n\nmin_lot_size is 1523 sq ft\n\nDKEWKWKDS Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 20,000 sq ft\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"min_lot_size is 123 sq ft\", 66]],\n    \"rationale\": \"The section titled WSO says the answer explicitly.

This district is primarily designed to provide rural business\nopportunities typically in the form of small retail, service, office, and light manufacturing uses\nto serve the community's existing and future needs for goods, services, and employment\nopportunities. Standards within the district are intended to promote context sensitive\ndevelopment appropriately scaled and organized in a manner that would not be detrimental to\nthe surrounding area. Development within this district would contain impacts inherently more\nintensive than those associated with uses permitted with special requirements in the RA district\nbut significantly less than those in CBI zoned areas. The NB district is generally appropriate\nin areas identified by an adopted land use plan for rural businesses located on identified minor\nand major thoroughfares and within community nodes. However, additional consideration may\nbe necessary as some thoroughfare segments would not be conducive to NB designation due\nto surrounding land use and / or potential negative impacts such as traffic, noise, and visual\nimpacts. Generally, the NB district shall be two (2) acres or larger. However a lot of record,\nsmaller than two (2) acres may be considered for rezoning to NB if the owner of the lot does\nnot own adjacent property which may be included in the rezoning request.\n(i)\nInstitutional, INST. The purpose of the Institutional district is to recognize and permit the\ncreation of defined areas for the unified and orderly development of major cultural, educational,\nmedical, governmental, religious and other institutions in order to support and enhance their\nbenefits to the community in a manner which protects adjacent residential uses. Trade school\nfacilities teaching a trade, for example truck driving or welding, which have that activity on site,\nshall meet zoning requirements for that use.\n(j) Airport Industrial, Al. This district is established for airport-specific or related businesses that\nwill be located, designed, constructed and maintained in a manner compatible with aviation\noperations. Uses in the Al district tend to focus on manufacturing, transportation, services and\npublic administration with standards designed to promote safety and compatibility with the Mid-\nCarolina Regional Airport Layout Plan (ALP) adopted by the Rowan County Board of\nCommissioners. Any use(s) or proposed structure(s) located on Rowan County property is\nsubject to approval by the Rowan County Board of Commissioners and shall comply with Mid-\nCarolina Regional's minimum standards and applicable Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)\nrules and regulations including FAA 7460-1 Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration.\nProperties owned by Rowan County, NC that encompass and adjoin the Mid-Carolina Regional\nAirport will comprise the district. District boundaries may be amended by addition of contiguous\nparcels via the map amendment process prescribed in Section 21-362.\n(Ord. of 1-19-98, \u00a7 III; Ord. of 2-1-99(1), \u00a7\u00a7 2, 9; Ord. of 6-17-02; Ord. of 4-21-03; Amend. of 4-\n21-14; Amend. of 9-3-19; Amend. of 6-21-21; Amend. of 9-19-22)\nSec. 21-33. Overlay districts.\nOverlay districts are zoning districts, which are applied only in conjunction with other zoning\ndistricts, and may grant additional use of development requirements upon the underlying zoning\ndistricts. The effect is to have both the overlay district and the underlying zoning controlling the\nuse and development of the lot. Overlay districts are applicable on an area wide basis to support\nspecific public policy objectives and as such should be consistent with adopted land use plans.\nOverlay districts may be applied to conventional and conditional zoning districts. An overlay district\nmay be initiated as an amendment by the board of commissioners, planning board, planning staff,\nor the property owner or their designated representative.\n42\n\n\nNEW PAGE 43\nAs of 01/17/23\n(1) Airport Zone Overlay, AZO. The zones and restrictions established in this subsection are\ndesigned to limit the height of structures surrounding the county airport's established\nelevation of seven hundred seventy-two and three tenths (772.3) feet above mean sea\nlevel (msl) in order to prevent hazards to the lives and property of the users of the airport\nand the occupants of land in the vicinity.\na. Uses allowed. The use requirements of the underlying district apply to the AZO district.\nHowever, all uses must be in conformance with the provisions of this section.\nb.\nEstablishment of zones. To carry out the provisions of this section, there are hereby\ncreated and established certain civil airport imaginary surfaces which consist of the land\nlying beneath the approach surface, including the non-precision and precision\napproach zone; transitional surface; horizontal surface; conical surface; and primary\nsurface. These civil airport imaginary surfaces are established with relation to the\nRowan County Airport runway and proposed extensions of thereof. Such imaginary\nsurfaces are defined in Section 21-4 and shown on the Official County Airport Zoning\nMap dated September 19, 2022, which is adopted and incorporated herein by\nreference. The size of each such imaginary surface is based on the category of each\nrunway according to the type of approach available or planned for that runway. The\nslope and dimensions of the approach surface, applied to each end of a runway, are\ndetermined by the most precise approach procedure existing or planned for the runway\nend.\nC. Height limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure shall be\nerected, altered or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow within the AZO\ndistrict extending or projecting into the lowest applicable imaginary surfaces defined\nherein.\n(2) Water Supply Watershed Overlays, WSO. The purpose of the watershed overlay is to\nprovide for the protection of public water supplies as required by the Water Supply\nWatershed Classification and Protection Act (G.S. 143-214.5) and regulations promulgated\ntherein. The watershed overlays may be an overlay in any conventional or conditional\nzoning district established in this chapter. The overlay districts supplement the uses or\ndevelopment requirements of the underlying zoning districts.\na. Uses allowed. The use requirements of the underlying districts apply to the WSO\ndistricts, unless otherwise provided in this section. However, all allowed uses must be\nin conformance with the provisions of this section.\nb. Expressly prohibited in critical areas. The following uses are expressly prohibited:\n1. Landfills;\n2. Sites for land application of sludge/residuals or petroleum contaminated soils.\nC.\nCalculating built-upon area. For the purpose of calculating built-upon area, total project\narea shall include total acreage in the lot on which the project is to be developed less\nacreage with any public road right of way. Built-upon area for a non-residential use\nexisting prior to January 1, 1994 (effective date of the initial WSO district designation\nand ordinance) as determined by planning staff will be subtracted from the overall lot\nacreage. All built-upon area proposed or existing after January 1, 1994 shall be subject\nto standards of this chapter. Home Occupations defined by section 21-4 shall be\nconsidered single family development. Built-upon area calculations for a Rural Home\nOccupation shall only include new built-upon area proposed and use of any existing\nstructure(s) for the operation but not existing residential structures.\n43\n\n\nNEW PAGE 44\nAs of 01/17/23\nd. Density and built-upon limits. Maximum allowable density and built-upon limits on a\nproject by project basis is subject to one of the following options:\n1\nDensity Averaging requests that include donating property from the critical area must comply with the built-\nupon area allowance in the critical area.\n2\nHigh Density Development is only permissible subject to section 21-33(2)(f)(3)(a).\n3\nDevelopment activities which require an erosion / sedimentation control plan must meet these requirements.\ne. Nonpoint Source and Stormwater Pollution Control. The following measures shall apply\nto development in the WSO unless expressly provided otherwise:\n1. Vegetated Conveyances. Stormwater runoff from the project shall be released\nto vegetated areas as dispersed flow or transported by vegetated conveyances to\nthe maximum extent practicable. In determining whether this criteria has been met,\nRowan County shall take into account site-specific factors such as topography and\nsite layout as well as protection of water quality. Vegetated conveyances shall be\nmaintained in perpetuity to ensure continued function as designed. Vegetated\nconveyances that meet the following criteria shall be deemed to satisfy the\nrequirements of this Sub-Item:\ni. Side slopes shall be no steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to vertical) unless it is\ndemonstrated to Rowan County that soils and vegetation will remain stable\nin perpetuity based on engineering calculations and on-site soil investigation;\nand\n44\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nMaximum Allowable Built-upon Area % Non-residential/Multi-family)\nand Minimum Lot Size in sq.ft.

In lieu of vegetated conveyances, low density projects\nshall have the option to use curb and gutter with outlets to convey stormwater to\ngrassed swales or vegetated areas. Requirements for these curb outlet systems\nshall be as follows:\ni. The curb outlets shall be located such that the swale or vegetated area\ncan carry the peak flow from the 10-year storm and at a non-erosive velocity;\nii. The longitudinal slope of the swale or vegetated area shall not exceed five\npercent except where not practical due to physical constraints. In these\ncases, devices to slow the rate of runoff and encourage infiltration to reduce\npollutant delivery shall be provided;\niii. The swale's cross section shall be trapezoidal with a minimum bottom\nwidth of two feet;\niv. The side slopes of the swale or vegetated area shall be no steeper than\n3:1 (horizontal to vertical);\nV. The minimum length of the swale or vegetated area shall be 100 feet; and\nvi. Low density projects may use treatment swales designed in accordance\nwith 15A NCAC 02H 1061 in lieu of the requirements specified in Sub-Items\ni. through V. of this Sub-Item.\nf.\nOptions in Density Compliance. Proposed development within a WSO is subject to\nsubmission of a site plan to illustrate proposed compliance with this chapter based on\none of the following four (4) application types in accordance with the density standards\nnoted in subsection 21-33(2)(d) and based on the review process identified as follows:\nCD Conditional District\nP Permitted by Right\nS Special Use\nSR - Permitted with Special Requirements\n* Refer to section 21-111 for a description of field entries.\nTo verify a completed project conformed to the proposed plan, planning staff may\nrequire a site plan from a professional land surveyor verifying the built-upon area limits\nand calculations in conformity with this chapter.\n1. Low Density. Proposed development meeting the low density standards with\nbuilt-upon area completely contained within the subject parcel's boundary shall be\nsubject to review by planning staff to ensure compliance with this chapter. For the\npurposes of section 21-33(2)(f), residential clustering consisting of a planned\ndevelopment where the collective project acreage complies with the low density\nstandards is considered low density subject to a special use permit reviewed in\naccordance with section 21-60(15).\n45\nCELL (1, 1): \nDensity Type\nCELL (1, 2): \nLow Density\nCELL (1, 3): \nDensity Averaging\nCELL (1, 4): \nHigh Density\nCELL (1, 5): \nSNIA\nCELL (2, 1): \nReview Process *\nCELL (2, 2): \nP\nCELL (2, 3): \nS\nCELL (2, 4): \nSR\nCELL (2, 5): \nCD\n\nNEW PAGE 46\nAs of 01/17/23\n2. Special Non-residential Intensity Allocation (SNIA).\na. Purpose. SNIA designation is a method for case by case allocation of up\nto ten (10) percent of the land area within the balance or protected area\nportion of a water supply watershed located in the county's planning and\nzoning jurisdiction to be developed with a built-upon surface area up to\nseventy (70) percent. Regardless of the options to achieve compliance with\nbuilt-upon area standards in section 21-33(2)(f), the county recognizes a\nneed to create an equitable approach to preserve SNIA designations for\ndevelopments less conducive to the other three (3) application types. SNIA\ndesignations should advance the public interest through applications that will\nenhance tax base / employment opportunities; serve a public or semi-public\nuse; or provide other benefits as determined by the Board of Commissioners.\nTo effectively evaluate a request given the limited acreage available for\nallocation, review standards from section 21-33(d)(f)(2), and land use plan\nguidance, applications must be reviewed as a conditional district to the WSO\ndistrict.\nb. Eligibility. Non-residential uses subject to compliance with section 21-113\nand located outside the critical area are eligible unless otherwise indicated\nin this chapter. New development located within both a WSIV-PA and\ndevelopment node or corridor within an adopted Rowan County Land Use\nPlan, which propose three (3) acres or more in built-upon area, must seek\napproval under the High Density option. An applicant may request the Board\nof Commissioners consider granting a waiver to the three (3) acre maximum\neligibility provision and allow the request to be considered subject to section\n21-33(2)(f)(2). In granting a waiver, the Board of Commissioners shall affirm\nthe project is not consistent with the purpose of this subsection; water quality\nimpacts resulting from the development project will be minimized; and the\nwaiver lends itself to a better project design.\nC.\nApplication and review procedures. Applications for the initial\ndevelopment under the SNIA option shall be reviewed and approved as a\nconditional district in the WSO consistent with sections 21-33(2)(f)(2), 21-61,\nand 21-62 except that in lieu of section 21-62 (d), a minor change to an\napproved SNIA request is subject to section 21-33(2)(f)(2)(f). Applications\nfor SNIA may be submitted concurrent with a general or conditional zoning\ndistrict or special use permit request.\nd. Buffers. Development shall adhere to buffer requirements of section 21-\n213(h).\ne. Previously approved SNIA requests. SNIA requests approved by the\nBoard of Commissioners prior to January 17, 2023 that either were or will be\ndeveloped consistent with the approved plan, are not subject to additional\nconsideration as a conditional district to retain development rights.\nSubsequent development on property consistent with this subsection may be\nreviewed and approved by planning staff subject to compliance with the\ngeneral district standards and built-upon limits prescribed by section 21-\n33(2)(d).\nf. Minor change to SNIA approved after January 17, 2023. Minor change to\na WSO-CD may be reviewed and approved by planning staff that propose\neither:\n46\n\n\nNEW PAGE 47\nAs of 01/17/23\n1) Subsequent development consistent with the original approved site\nplan, which propose additional built-upon area consistent with all other\nstandards of this chapter or\n2) Reduction in building size that does not exceed the greater of 5,000\nsq.ft. or 25%.\nAll other changes shall be considered a new request submitted per section\n21-33(2)(f)(2).\ng. Expiration. SNIA designations are subject to expiration referenced in\nsection 21-62(e).\n3. High Density standard and built-upon limits.\na. Purpose. New development activities within a Watershed IV Critical Area\n(WS-IV-CA) or a Watershed IV Protected Area (WS-IV-PA) that require a soil\nerosion and sedimentation control plan pursuant to G.S. 113A Article 4 or\nChapter 18 of the Rowan County Code of Ordinances and exceed the low\ndensity standards of subsection 2(d) of this Chapter must seek approval under\nthe High Density standards when affected by any of the following:\ni. Proposing a major subdivision as defined in Section 22-56 of the Rowan\nCounty Subdivision Ordinance; or,\nii. Proposing a Planned Development Subdivision (PDS) as defined in\nSection 22-58 of the Rowan County Subdivision Ordinance; or,\niii. Located in a development node or corridor in an adopted Rowan County\nLand Use Plan and proposes three (3) acres or more in built-upon area.\nb. Intent. High Density standards will allow for creation of denser development\nprojects while ensuring impacts to water quality within the watershed are\nminimized by utilizing Best Management Practices to control stormwater runoff\nand resulting pollution. Furthermore, the application of High Density standards\nto projects referenced in 21-33(2)(f)(3)(a) will preserve the SNIA provision for\ndevelopment activities within the watershed that are of a scale and scope that\ndo not warrant high density standards.\nC. Standards and built-upon limits. The Board of Commissioners may approve\na project application(s) for use of High Density development standards based\non the following:\ni. WS-IV-CA. Where new development exceeds the low density standards\nof Section 21-33(2)(d), engineered stormwater controls shall be used to\ncontrol runoff from the first inch of rainfall and development shall not exceed\nfifty percent (50%) built-upon area.\nii. WS-IV-PA. Where new development exceeds the low density standards\nof Section 21-33(2)(d), engineered stormwater controls shall be used to\ncontrol runoff from the first inch of rainfall and development shall not exceed\nseventy percent (70%) built-upon area.\niii. Qualifying areas of the stormwater control structure may be considered\npervious when computing total built-upon area.\nd. Application. Projects subject to the conditions of subsection 2(f)(3)(a) of this\nChapter shall submit an application for consideration by the Board of\n47\n\n\nNEW PAGE 48\nAs of 01/17/23\nCommissioners subject to the process outlined in Section 21-317 of this\nChapter.\ne. Waivers. New development activities in a WS-IV-PA subject to the\nrequirements of this subsection may request the Board of Commissioners\nconsider granting a waiver from the High Density standards and instead allow\nthe project to utilize the provisions of Section 21-33(2)(f)(2). In granting a\nwaiver, the Board of Commissioners shall affirm the project is not consistent\nwith the purpose and intent of this subsection; water quality impacts resulting\nfrom the development project will be minimized; and the waiver lends itself to a\nbetter project design.\n4. Density Averaging.\na. Purpose and Intent\n1. Purpose. Density Averaging provides non-residential developments in\nwatershed overlay districts the option to aggregate density between two\nnon-contiguous properties for the purpose of compliance with the water\nsupply watershed development standards of 21-33(2)(d). This process\ninvolves the allowable built upon area of a donating property being\ntransferred to a receiving property to comply with the built-upon limits for the\nrespective water supply watershed.\n2. Intent. Density Averaging is intended as an alternative method of\ncompliance for built-upon limits within the subject parcel boundary,\nstormwater control measures with High Density standards, or SNIA\napplications for non-residential development.\nb. Eligibility. An applicant may average development density between two non-\ncontiguous properties (i.e. one (1) Donating Property and one (1) Receiving\nProperty) for purposes of achieving compliance with the water supply watershed\ndevelopment standards if all of the following circumstances exist:\n1. The properties are within the same water supply watershed, located\nentirely within Rowan County's Zoning Jurisdiction. Properties located in the\ncritical area of the watershed are not eligible to be a Receiving Property but\nmay be used as the Donating Property for projects outside the critical area.\n2. Overall project density on the collective Receiving and donating Property\nmeets applicable built-upon area requirements (existing and proposed) as\nprescribed in section 21-33(2)(d). Built-upon area received from the critical\narea of the watershed is still subject to the requirements of the critical area.\nBuilt-upon area calculations from both properties including any remaining\nbalance of the Donating Property shall be provided.\n3. The Donating Property must be an existing or proposed tract of land\nhaving sufficient acreage or square footage to offset all, or requisite portion\nof the built-upon area on the Receiving Property. If the Donating Property will\nbe a new tract and it is not exempt under sec. 22-6, the new tract must meet\nall lot requirements except for road frontage. At a minimum, access shall be\nsufficient to provide vehicular access for tract maintenance.\n4. The Donating Property will remain in a perpetually undeveloped and\nvegetated or natural state and will be managed by one of the following\nmeans:\n48\n\nNEW PAGE 91\nAs of 01/17/23\nactivity is conducted extending outward five hundred (500) feet beyond the edge of\nthe activity. The building shall be within six hundred sixty (660) feet of nearest edge\nof right-of-way.\n2. Said activity shall have been on the site three (3) months or more.\n3. Site shall have all required local state and federal privilege licenses as required by\nlaw.\n4. The activity shall be serviced by approved utilities.\n5. The activity shall have direct or indirect vehicular access and be a generation of\ntraffic volume.\n6. Employees shall be on site during usual normal and customary hours for that\nactivity.\n7. The activity shall be visible and recognizable as commercial or industrial.\nC. For the purpose of this section none of the following activities shall be commercial or\nindustrial:\n1. Outdoor advertising structures or activity or any other business or industrial activity\ncarried on in connection with an outdoor advertising activity.\n2. Agricultural uses.\n3. Transient or temporary activities including seasonal activities.\n4. Activities conducted in a building principally used as a residence.\n5. Railroad tracks or sidings.\n6.\nSign face area per side shall not exceed four hundred fifty (450) square feet on I-\n85 or three hundred (300) feet on all other roads. \"Double-decker\" signs are\nprohibited as are tandem signs.\n7. Height shall not exceed fifty (50) feet over roadway.\n8. The signs shall have a one thousand-foot separation from residences to limit\ndetrimental effects on the residential property.\n(14)\nReserved\n(15)\nResidential clustering.\na. Purpose. The purpose is to encourage innovative development by allowing variations\nfrom normal regulations pertaining to dimensional criteria provided in article IV. In\naddition to the requirements of this subsection, approval of cluster subdivisions shall\nrequire approval as required by the subdivision ordinance.\nb.\nDevelopment standards. Proposed residential clustering shall contain a minimum of\nfour (4) dwelling units on a total area of two (2) or more acres.\nC.

Conditional districts.\n(a) Purpose. There are instances where a rezoning request to a general district would be\ninappropriate and could not effectively be managed by the district's general development\nstandards. As an alternative manner to evaluate such a request, a conditional district may\npropose specific development standards necessary to address anticipated impacts on\nsurrounding properties and the county, establish consistency with adopted plans, and / or\nprovide a clear understanding of the type and degree of future development allowed within the\ndistrict. This can often be achieved by the commitment to a specific use or uses permitted in\nthe conditional district, increased development standards, or site plan details, which are tailored\nto address the aforementioned objectives and sufficient to allow for an appropriate evaluation\nof the request. This voluntary procedure must be petitioned by the property owner or their\nauthorized agent as a development proposal and not for securing early zoning for tentative\nuses which may not be undertaken for a long period of time.\n(b) Applications. Applications for conditional districts shall be on forms provided by the county\nplanning and development department. Only property owners or their authorized agents shall\napply for rezoning to an appropriate conditional district (amended 6-19-00). The applicant may\npropose additional limitations or restrictions that address: compatibility between the\ndevelopment and surrounding area; anticipated impacts; land use plan objectives; or other\nconcerns. Supporting documentation must clearly identify proposed restrictions or conditions\n93\nCELL (1, 1): \nGeneral Zoning Districts\nCELL (1, 2): \nConditional Districts\nCELL (2, 1): \nRS\nCELL (2, 2): \nRS (CD)\nCELL (3, 1): \nRR\nCELL (3, 2): \nRR (CD)\nCELL (4, 1): \nRA\nCELL (4, 2): \nRA (CD)\nCELL (5, 1): \nMHP\nCELL (5, 2): \nMHP (CD)\nCELL (6, 1): \nMFR\nCELL (6, 2): \nMFR (CD)\nCELL (7, 1): \nCBI\nCELL (7, 2): \nCBI (CD)\nCELL (8, 1): \n85-ED-1\nCELL (8, 2): \n85-ED-1 (CD)\nCELL (9, 1): \n85-ED-2\nCELL (9, 2): \n85-ED-2 (CD)\nCELL (10, 1): \n85-ED-3\nCELL (10, 2): \n85-ED-3 (CD)\nCELL (11, 1): \n85-ED-4\nCELL (11, 2): \n85-ED-4 (CD)\nCELL (12, 1): \nIND\nCELL (12, 2): \nIND (CD)\nCELL (13, 1): \nNB\nCELL (13, 2): \nNB (CD)\nCELL (14, 1): \nINST\nCELL (14, 2): \nINST (CD)\nCELL (15, 1): \nAl\nCELL (15, 2): \nAI (CD)\nCELL (16, 1): \nOverlay Zoning Districts\nCELL (16, 2): \nConditional Districts\nCELL (17, 1): \nWSO\nCELL (17, 2): \nWSO (CD)\n\n\n Output:"}]}
