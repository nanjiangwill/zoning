You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-10\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. If Residential (R-10) is referring\nto a general residential district, we are only interested in the requirement of\nmin_lot_size for single-family homes. However, if it is referring to a specific district,\nlike Multi Family Residential (MFR), General Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested\nin the requirement of min_lot_size for Residential (R-10).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \"\\n\" and any type of special characters.\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // The value of min_lot_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_lot_size is typically between 1,000 and 2,000,000 sq ft or 0.02 and 50 acres. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 11\n\nR-10 Zone\n\nCELL (2, 1):\nField\nCELL (2, 2):\nValue\nCELL (3, 1):\nmin_lot_size\nCELL (3, 2):\n123456 sq ft\nCELL (4, 1):\nApartment Area\nCELL (4, 2):\n10,000\n\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\"CELL (3, 2):\\n123456 sq ft\"],\n    \"rationale\": \"The cell that corresponds to the value for min_lot_size in this table has this answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"123456 sq ft\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 32\n\nSection 6.3 Industrial Area & Dimensional Requirements\n1 Public Sewer or Public Water\n2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\n3 For proposed warehouse/manufacturing uses 35%, for all other uses 25%, subject to\nCommission's authority to permit greater coverage based on landscape, architectural design\nand site development elements that exceed minimum standard of the Regulation\n4\nShall be in addition to requirements of 8.1.2 Landscaping and Buffers\n6-4\n\nCELL (1, 1):\nCELL (1, 2):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 3):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 4):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 5):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 6):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 7):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 8):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (1, 10):\nCELL (2, 1):\nZone\nCELL (2, 2):\nMin\nArea\nCELL (2, 3):\nMin\nWidth\nCELL (2, 4):\nMin\nDepth\nCELL (2, 5):\nMax\nStories\nCELL (2, 6):\nMax\nHeight\nCELL (2, 7):\nMax % Lot\nCoverage\nCELL (2, 8):\nMin\nFront\nYard\nCELL (2, 9):\nMin\nSide\nYard\nCELL (2, 10):\nMin\nRear\nYard\nCELL (3, 1):\nI\nCELL (3, 2):\n20,000\nsq. ft.\nCELL (3, 3):\n100'\nCELL (3, 4):\n100'\nCELL (3, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (3, 6):\n50'\nCELL (3, 7):\nN/A\nCELL (3, 8):\n25'\nCELL (3, 9):\n20'\nCELL (3, 10):\n20'\nCELL (4, 1):\nR-10\nCELL (4, 2):\n40,000\nsq. ft. 1\nCELL (4, 3):\n150'\nCELL (4, 4):\n150'\nCELL (4, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (4, 6):\n50'\nCELL (4, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (4, 8):\n50'\nCELL (4, 9):\n20'\nCELL (4, 10):\n20'\nCELL (5, 1):\nR-10\nCELL (5, 2):\n60,000\nsq. ft. 2\nCELL (5, 3):\n200'\nCELL (5, 4):\n200'\nCELL (5, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (5, 6):\n50'\nCELL (5, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (5, 8):\n50'\nCELL (5, 9):\n20'\nCELL (5, 10):\n20'4\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        \"1 Public Sewer or Public Water\",\n        \"2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\",\n        \"CELL (4, 2): \\n40,000\\nsq. ft.\",\n        \"CELL (5, 2): \\n60,000\\nsq. ft.\"\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"From this page we can infer that the value is conditional on the presence of a public sewer or water system, and there are two different values for the current zone, depending on that.\",\n    \"answer\": \"40,000 sq ft (if public water or sewer); 60,000 sq ft (otherwise)\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 66\n\nR-10 Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 123 sq ft, side length is 10 ft\n\nNEW PAGE 67\n\nR-10 Zone - Senior Active Overlay\n\nmin_lot_size is 1523 sq ft\n\nDKEWKWKDS Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 20,000 sq ft\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\"min_lot_size is 123 sq ft\"],\n    \"rationale\": \"The section titled R-10 says the answer explicitly.

For\nexample, a swimming pool/tennis court complex is customarily associated with and\nintegrally related to a residential subdivision or multifamily development and would be\nregarded as accessory to such principal uses, even though such facilities, if developed\napart from a residential development, would require a zoning permit.\nB.

Fences: Within or abutting residential districts, no wall or fence shall exceed four (4) feet\nin height within a front yard or exceed eight (8) feet in height in the rear and side yard;\nand in all other non-residential districts, no fence shall exceed eight (8) feet in height.\nThe setback requirements of these regulations shall not prohibit any necessary retaining\nwall or prohibit any wall or fence. Vision clearance at intersections as defined in Section\n15.05 shall be maintained.\nWithin abutting residential districts, all man-made fences or walls shall have at least a\nfinished side facing out (no adjoining property) and no fence or wall shall contain barbed\n(except enclosing livestock) or razor wire or any other dangerous features. Must create a\ncomplete visual screen. Acceptable materials are masonry, cedar, redwood, and pressure\ntreated lumber resistant to rot. Fence installation should be consistent with acceptable\nbuilding practices.\nB. Berms:\nMinimum Height - 5 feet\nMaximum Slope - 2 feet horizontal for each 1 foot vertical (2:1)\nMinimum Crown Width - 2 feet\nC. Minimum Plant Size:\nUnless otherwise indicated elsewhere in this Section, all plant material shall meet the\nfollowing minimum size standards at the time of planting:\nD. Spacing in Buffer yards C, D, E, and F:\nBuffer yards C, D, E, and F are intended to create a complete visual screening year-\nround. Therefore, proposed and existing vegetation should be spaced to accomplish this\npurpose. No more than two (2) continuous feet of horizontal plane, as measured and\nviewed perpendicular from the property line, may be void of vegetation at least six (6)\nfeet in height within ten (10) years of planting.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nBuffer Yard F\nCELL (1, 3): \nBuffer Yard F\nCELL (2, 1): \nLot Size\nCELL (2, 2): \nBuffer Yard\nWidth Required\nCELL (2, 3): \nNumber of Plant Units Per\n100 Linear Feet of Buffer Yard\nCELL (3, 1): \nAll sizes\nCELL (3, 2): \n50\nCELL (3, 3): \n6 large trees, 9 small trees,\n45 Evergreen shrubs\nCELL (1, 1): \nPlanting Material Type\nCELL (1, 2): \nMinimum Planting Size\nCELL (2, 1): \nLarge Tree\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (3, 1): \nSingle-Stem\nCELL (3, 2): \n1 1/2 inch caliper\nCELL (4, 1): \nMulti-Stem\nCELL (4, 2): \n6 feet in height\nCELL (5, 1): \nSmall Tree\nCELL (5, 2): \n4 feet in height\nCELL (6, 1): \nEvergreen Shrubs\nCELL (6, 2): \n1 foot in height\n\n\n Output:"}]}
