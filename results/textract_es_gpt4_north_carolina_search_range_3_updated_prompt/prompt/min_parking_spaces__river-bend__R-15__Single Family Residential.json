You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Single Family Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-15\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. If Single Family Residential (R-15) is referring\nto a general residential district, we are only interested in the requirement of\nmin_parking_spaces for single-family homes. However, if it is referring to a specific district,\nlike Multi Family Residential (MFR), General Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested\nin the requirement of min_parking_spaces for Single Family Residential (R-15).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \"\\n\" and any type of special characters.\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // The value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\"). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\n165/167\nCELL (1, 1):\nRestaurants (with drive through service)\nCELL (1, 2):\nOne (1) space for each four (4) seating\naccommodations, plus one (1) space for each\ntwo (2) employees on the shift of largest\nemployment; and Three (3) stacking spaces\nfor each drive through window.\nCELL (2, 1):\nSchool, Elementary and Middle (both public\nand private):\nCELL (2, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each classroom and\nadministrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee and one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (3, 1):\nSchool, High School (both public and private)\nCELL (3, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each fifteen (15)\nstudents for which the building was designed,\nplus one (1) parking space for each classroom\nand administrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee, plus one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (4, 1):\nShopping Centers, large and small\nCELL (4, 2):\nOne (1) space for each three hundred (300)\nsquare feet of gross floor area.\nCELL (5, 1):\nSingle Family, Duplex, Condominiums,\nManufactured Homes, and similar residential\nCELL (5, 2):\nTwo (2) spaces per dwelling unit\nCELL (6, 1):\nTerminals, Bus\nCELL (6, 2):\nOne (1) space for each employee and one (1)\nspace for each bus loading ramp and track.\nCELL (7, 1):\nStadiums, Theaters, and similar uses\ninvolving the assembling of persons:\nCELL (7, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each four (4) seats\nin the largest assembly room.

Customary occupations and offices of a professional person such as a physician, dentist,\narchitect, lawyer, engineer, artist, musician, real estate, insurance agent, accountant and the\nlike, are permitted, provided the use is clearly incidental and subordinate to the residential use\nof a dwelling unit, and not more than 25% of the floor area is used in the conduct of home\noccupations.\nB. There shall be no change in the outside appearance of the building, no display shall be allowed\nupon the premises, and no person not a resident on the premises shall be employed specifically\nin connection with the home occupation. No process shall be used which may create noise,\nvibration, fumes or other nuisance.\nC. Parking generated by the conduct of home occupation shall be met by providing the space\nbehind the front line of the dwelling.\nD. No signs are permitted in conjunction with home occupations.\nPenalty, see \u00a7 1.01.999\n\u00a7 15.02.068 NON-CONFORMING SITUATIONS.\nA. Generally.\n1. A non-conforming situation occurs when, on the effective date of this chapter, an existing\nlot or structure or use of an existing lot or structure does not conform to 1 or more of the\nTown of River Bend Zoning Chapter and regulations applicable to the zoned area in which\nthe lot or structure is located.\n2. Among other possibilities, a non-conforming situation may arise because:\na) A lot does not meet minimum square footage requirements;\nb) Structures exceed maximum height limitations;\nc) The relationship between existing buildings and the land (in such matters as density and\nsetback requirements) is not in conformity with this chapter; or\nd) The land or buildings are used for purposes not permitted by this chapter.\nB. Continuation of non-conforming situations and completion of non-conforming projects.\n1. Non-conforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this chapter\nmay be continued, subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in the divisions\nbelow.\n2. Non-conforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of\ndivision (H) below.\nC. Non-conforming lots.\n1. When a non-conforming lot, existing prior to the adoption of this chapter, can be used in\nconformity with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use, except that the lot is\nsmaller than the required minimum set forth in the town's Zoning Chapter, the lot may be\nused as proposed just as if it were conforming. However, no use, (e.g., a duplex) that\nrequires a greater lot size for a particular zone is permissible on a non-conforming lot.\n\n\nNEW PAGE 32\n68 River Bend Land Usage\n2. When the use proposed for a non-conforming lot is 1 that is conforming in all other respects\nbut the applicable setback requirements (see Town of River Bend Zoning Chapter \u00a7\n15.02.047) cannot be complied with, then the Board of Adjustment, authorized by this\nchapter may issue a permit for the proposed use, in accordance with Town of River Bend\nZoning Chapter \u00a7 15.02.175, variance if it finds that:\na) The property cannot be developed for the use proposed without these deviations; or\nb) The property can be developed as proposed without any adverse impact on surrounding\nproperties or the public health or safety.\n3. This section applies only to undeveloped non-conforming lots. A lot is undeveloped if it has\nno structures upon it.\n4. If, on the date this division becomes effective, an undeveloped non-conforming lot adjoins\nand has continuous frontage with 1 or more other undeveloped lots under the same\nownership, then neither the owner of the non-conforming lot nor his successors in interest\nmay take advantage of the provisions of this section. This division shall not apply to a non-\nconforming lot if a majority of the developed lots located on either side of the street where\nthe lot is located and within 500 feet of the lot are also non-conforming. The intent of this\ndivision is to require non-conforming lots to be combined with other undeveloped lots to\ncreate conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein, but not to require the\ncombination when that would be out of character with the way the neighborhood has\npreviously been developed.\nD. Extension or enlargement of non-conforming situations.\n1. Except as specifically provided in this section, no person may engage in any activity that\ncauses an increase in the extent of non-conformity of a non-conforming situation. In\nparticular, physical alterations of structures or the placement of new structures on open\nland is unlawful if the activity results in:\na) An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a non-conforming use; or\nb) Greater non-conformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback\nrequirements, height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as\nparking requirements.\n2. Notwithstanding division (D)(1 above, any structure used for single family residential\npurposes (other than manufactured homes) and maintained as a non-conforming use may\nbe enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so long as the enlargement\nor replacement does not create new non-conformities or increase the extent of existing\nnon-conformities. Manufactured homes used for single family residential purposes may be\nenlarged or replaced in accordance with this division; provided, however, the enlargement\nor expansion in the case of those manufactured homes that have remained vacant beyond\nthe 180 day discontinuance period shall be prohibited by this chapter. This division is subject\nto the limitations stated in division (G).\nE. Repair, maintenance and reconstruction.\n1. Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where non-conforming situations\nexist are permitted and encouraged. Renovation work estimated to cost more than 25% of\n\n\nNEW PAGE 33\n69 River Bend Land Usage\nthe appraised valuation of the structure prior to damage and/or renovation, may be done\nonly in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this section.\n2. For purposes of division (E)(1 above:\na) The cost of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the fair market value of the\nmaterials and services necessary to accomplish the renovation, repair, or replacement.\nb)\nThe cost of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all the\nintended work, and no person may seek to avoid the intent of division (E)(1) by doing\nthe work incrementally.\nc)\n(1) The appraised valuation shall mean either the appraised valuation for property tax\npurposes, updated as necessary by the increase in the consumer price index since\nthe date of the last valuation or the valuation determined by a professionally\nrecognized property appraiser.\n(2) It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to supply the town with the\nappraised valuation of the property. The valuation shall include the necessary\ndocumentation to support the valuation.\n(3) The Zoning Administrator may issue a permit authorized by this section if he finds\nthat, in completing the renovation, repair or replacement work:\n(a) No violation of division (D) above will occur; and\n(b) The permittee will comply to the extent possible with all provisions of this\nchapter applicable to the existing use except that the permittee shall not lose\nhis right to continue a non-conforming use, except for those reasons outlined in\ndivision (G) below with a requirement of this division is not possible if\ncompliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where\nthe non-conforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure\nthat is on a permanent foundation.\nF. Change in use of property where a non-conforming situation exists.\n1.\na) A change in use of property that is sufficiently substantial to require a new zoning\npermit (\u00a7 15.02.166) or special use permit (\u00a7\u00a7 15.02.120 et seq.) may not be made\nexcept in accordance with divisions (F)(2) and (3) below.\nb) However, this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed.\n2. If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the\nproperty is located, and all of the other requirements of this ordinance applicable to that\nuse can be complied with, permission to make the change must be obtained in the same\nmanner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot. Once conformity with this\nchapter is achieved, the property may not revert to its non-conforming status.\n3. If the intended change in use is to a principle use that is permissible in the district where the\nproperty is located, but all of the requirements of this chapter applicable to that use cannot\nbe complied with, then the Zoning Administrator may issue a permit authorizing the change.\n\n\nNEW PAGE 34\n70 River Bend - Land Usage\nIf the Zoning Administrator finds, in addition to any other findings that may be required by\nthis chapter, that:\na) The intended change will not result in a violation of division (D) above; and\nb) All of the applicable requirements of this chapter that can be complied with will be\ncomplied with. Compliance with a requirement of this chapter is not possible if\ncompliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the non-\nconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a\npermanent foundation. And in no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant\nto this division to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional non-\nconformities would thereby be created.\n4. A change in use to another principal use that is also non-conforming is not permissible.\nG. Abandonment and discontinuance of non-conforming situations.\n1. When a non-conforming use is discontinued for a continuous period of 180 days, the\nproperty involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes.\n2. If a non-conforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance\nof a non-conforming use for the required 180 day period shall terminate the right to\nmaintain it thereafter.\n3.\nWhen a structure or operation made non-conforming by this chapter is vacant or\ndiscontinued at the effective date of this chapter, the 180-day period for purposes of this\ndivision begins to run at the effective date of this chapter.\nH. Completion of non-conforming projects.\n1. All non-conforming projects on which construction was begun at least 180 days before the\neffective date of this chapter as well as all non-conforming projects that are at least 25%\ncompleted in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date of this\nchapter may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits, so long as these\npermits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired. If a development is\ndesigned to be completed in stages, this division shall apply only to the particular phase\nunder construction.\n2. Except as provided in division (H)(1) above, all work on any non-conforming project shall\ncease on the effective date of this chapter, and all permits previously issued for work on\nnon-conforming projects shall be revoked as of that date. Thereafter, work on non-\nconforming projects may begin or may be continued only pursuant to a zoning, special use\nor sign permit issued in accordance with this section by the individual or Board authorized\nby this chapter to issue permits for the type of development proposed. The Zoning\nAdministrator may issue a permit if he finds that the applicant has in good faith made\nsubstantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changed\nhis position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the land use law as it existed\nbefore the effective date of this chapter and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced\nif\nnot allowed to complete his project as proposed. In considering whether these findings may\nbe made, the Zoning Administrator shall be guided by the following, as well as other\nrelevant considerations.\n\n\n Output:"}]}
