You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Neighborhood Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"NB\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Neighborhood Business\n(NB) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Neighborhood Business (NB).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\"). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 165\n165/167\nCELL (1, 1):\nRestaurants (with drive through service)\nCELL (1, 2):\nOne (1) space for each four (4) seating\naccommodations, plus one (1) space for each\ntwo (2) employees on the shift of largest\nemployment; and Three (3) stacking spaces\nfor each drive through window.\nCELL (2, 1):\nSchool, Elementary and Middle (both public\nand private):\nCELL (2, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each classroom and\nadministrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee and one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (3, 1):\nSchool, High School (both public and private)\nCELL (3, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each fifteen (15)\nstudents for which the building was designed,\nplus one (1) parking space for each classroom\nand administrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee, plus one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (4, 1):\nShopping Centers, large and small\nCELL (4, 2):\nOne (1) space for each three hundred (300)\nsquare feet of gross floor area.\nCELL (5, 1):\nSingle Family, Duplex, Condominiums,\nManufactured Homes, and similar residential\nCELL (5, 2):\nTwo (2) spaces per dwelling unit\nCELL (6, 1):\nTerminals, Bus\nCELL (6, 2):\nOne (1) space for each employee and one (1)\nspace for each bus loading ramp and track.\nCELL (7, 1):\nStadiums, Theaters, and similar uses\ninvolving the assembling of persons:\nCELL (7, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each four (4) seats\nin the largest assembly room.

Site plan approval by the zoning administrator shall be required unless\nexpressly provided otherwise prior to issuance of a zoning permit and such approval shall be given\nif all requirements herein are met. The plan shall become part of the building permit.\n(1) Rural Home Occupations [RHO].\na.\nPurpose and Intent. Rowan County recognizes the important role RHOs offer residents\nand the community in creating business opportunities to fulfill or supplement the resident's\nemployment needs. Standards are established herein to protect adjoining properties from\npotential adverse impacts associated with these uses.\nb.\nDevelopment Standards. All proposed operations are subject to general standards\nidentified in sections 21-55, applicable specific standards in section 21-56, and other\npertinent requirements of this chapter.\nC.\nCombination Use. In addition to the principal residential use, development of a RHO may\nconstitute a second principal use whose occupancy classification is subject to the North\nCarolina Building Code for non-residential use as determined by the Rowan County\nInspections Department.\nd. Change in Operation. RHOs permitted to comply with the provisions of section 21-55(2)\nshall be classified as non-conforming if a change in association between the residence and\nbusiness operator occurs. As such, applicants should consider potential investment in the\ndevelopment of land and / or structures for RHOs and the inherent future limitations should\nthe use become non-conforming. Many RHO locations would not adhere to the purpose\nand intent or land use recommendations for rezoning to a non-residential district.\n(2) Specific criteria for uses listed as SR. The SR standards required in Section 21-55 do not\napply to uses in the residential group from 21-113; Common Sand Mining (SIC 1442); Dead\nstorage of manufactured homes (SIC 42); Co-location of wireless facilities, eligible facilities\nrequests, alternative tower structures, public safety tower and utility wireless support structures\n(SIC 48 (pt)); and uses listed as SR in non-residential districts.\n61\n\n\nNEW PAGE 62\nAs of 01/17/23\n(Ord. of 1-19-98, \u00a7 IV; Amend. of 12-2-13; Amend. of 4-21-14; Amend. of 10-15-18; Amend. of 9-\n3-19; Amend. of 6-21-21; Amend. of 11-15-21; Amend. of 6-20-22)\nSec. 21-54.

Conditional districts.\n(a) Purpose. There are instances where a rezoning request to a general district would be\ninappropriate and could not effectively be managed by the district's general development\nstandards. As an alternative manner to evaluate such a request, a conditional district may\npropose specific development standards necessary to address anticipated impacts on\nsurrounding properties and the county, establish consistency with adopted plans, and / or\nprovide a clear understanding of the type and degree of future development allowed within the\ndistrict. This can often be achieved by the commitment to a specific use or uses permitted in\nthe conditional district, increased development standards, or site plan details, which are tailored\nto address the aforementioned objectives and sufficient to allow for an appropriate evaluation\nof the request. This voluntary procedure must be petitioned by the property owner or their\nauthorized agent as a development proposal and not for securing early zoning for tentative\nuses which may not be undertaken for a long period of time.\n(b) Applications. Applications for conditional districts shall be on forms provided by the county\nplanning and development department. Only property owners or their authorized agents shall\napply for rezoning to an appropriate conditional district (amended 6-19-00). The applicant may\npropose additional limitations or restrictions that address: compatibility between the\ndevelopment and surrounding area; anticipated impacts; land use plan objectives; or other\nconcerns. Supporting documentation must clearly identify proposed restrictions or conditions\n93\nCELL (1, 1): \nGeneral Zoning Districts\nCELL (1, 2): \nConditional Districts\nCELL (2, 1): \nRS\nCELL (2, 2): \nRS (CD)\nCELL (3, 1): \nRR\nCELL (3, 2): \nRR (CD)\nCELL (4, 1): \nRA\nCELL (4, 2): \nRA (CD)\nCELL (5, 1): \nMHP\nCELL (5, 2): \nMHP (CD)\nCELL (6, 1): \nMFR\nCELL (6, 2): \nMFR (CD)\nCELL (7, 1): \nCBI\nCELL (7, 2): \nCBI (CD)\nCELL (8, 1): \n85-ED-1\nCELL (8, 2): \n85-ED-1 (CD)\nCELL (9, 1): \n85-ED-2\nCELL (9, 2): \n85-ED-2 (CD)\nCELL (10, 1): \n85-ED-3\nCELL (10, 2): \n85-ED-3 (CD)\nCELL (11, 1): \n85-ED-4\nCELL (11, 2): \n85-ED-4 (CD)\nCELL (12, 1): \nIND\nCELL (12, 2): \nIND (CD)\nCELL (13, 1): \nNB\nCELL (13, 2): \nNB (CD)\nCELL (14, 1): \nINST\nCELL (14, 2): \nINST (CD)\nCELL (15, 1): \nAl\nCELL (15, 2): \nAI (CD)\nCELL (16, 1): \nOverlay Zoning Districts\nCELL (16, 2): \nConditional Districts\nCELL (17, 1): \nWSO\nCELL (17, 2): \nWSO (CD)\n\n\nNEW PAGE 94\nAs of 01/17/23\nthat exceed general district standards and govern future development within the district. Only\nuses listed in section 21-113 as permitted by right or as a CD may be considered within a\nconditional district.\nApplications must include a site plan containing information from section 21-52 including the\ngeneral location and size of buildings, proposed streets, parking areas, and other operational\narea improvements. While the applicant has discretion in the level of detail or conditions\noffered to govern the proposed conditional district, the application must contain sufficient\ncontent for a substantive evaluation by the board of commissioners. The applicant must\nconsider the potential degree of administrative change afforded to an approved district in\nsection 21-62(d) when submitting an application.\n(c) Permitted uses and development requirements. If approved as a conditional district, only\nthe use or uses identified in the conditional district are allowed subject to any associated\nconditions or limitations therein. All use requirements of the underlying general use district and\nsection 21-64, if applicable, shall apply as well as all other requirements of the ordinance. In\nno situation shall approval of a conditional district reduce required standards of this ordinance\nunless otherwise provided herein.\n(d) Review Procedures. Conditional district requests shall follow review procedures referenced\nin Sec. 21-362.\n(e) Conditional District Approval. The board of commissioners may approve a reclassification\nof a property to a conditional district only upon determining that the proposed use or uses will\nmeet all standards and regulations in this chapter that are applicable. Specific conditions\napplicable to the district may be proposed by the petitioner or the board of commissioners, but\nonly those conditions consented by the petitioner in writing consistent with G.S. 160D-703(b)\nmay be incorporated into the zoning regulations. Conditions and site-specific standards\nimposed in a conditional district shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the\ndevelopment and use of the site to applicable ordinances, officially adopted comprehensive\nplans, or impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site.\nThe approval of the district and any requested conditions shall be included on a certificate of\napproval form provided by the county. If the approval and any attached conditions are\nacceptable to the petitioner, then this acceptance shall be indicated by the petitioner signing\nthe approval form.\n(Ord. of 1-19-98, \u00a7 IV; Ord. of 6-17-02; Amend. of 3-7-05; Amend. of 2-20-06(1); Amend. of 6-16-\n08; Amend. of 6-19-10; Amend. of 3-5-12; Amend. of 9-6-16; Amend. of 6-21-21; Amend. of 4-18-\n22; Amend. of 9-19-22; Amend. of 1-17-23)\nSec. 21-62.
