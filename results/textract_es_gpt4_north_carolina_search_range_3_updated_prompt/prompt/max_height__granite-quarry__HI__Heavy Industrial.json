You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Heavy Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"HI\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. If Heavy Industrial (HI) is referring\nto a general residential district, we are only interested in the requirement of\nmax_height for single-family homes. However, if it is referring to a specific district,\nlike Multi Family Residential (MFR), General Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested\nin the requirement of max_height for Heavy Industrial (HI).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted.

Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Conditional zoning districts are created to correspond to each of the base zoning districts\ncreated in Section 3.2. Conditional Districts allow specific uses to be established in accordance\nwith prescribed conditions pertaining to an individual project. The uses in these districts are\nsuch that may have significant impact on the surrounding area, which cannot be predetermined\nand controlled by general district standards.\nB. The purpose is to provide a voluntary alternative procedure for the rezoning of a property for a\nspecific use. A broad range of uses are permitted in the conventional district. However, there\nare instances where a general zoning district designation is clearly inappropriate for a property,\nbut a specific use permitted under this district and subject to development requirements would\nbe consistent with the spirit and intent of this ordinance. Conditional districts, herein\nestablished, are intended to accommodate such situations. This voluntary procedure is\nintended for firm development proposals, and is neither intended nor suited for securing early\nzoning for tentative uses which may not be undertaken for a long period of time.\nC. Just as there are 11 base zoning districts, there are 11 corresponding Conditional Districts. PUD\ndistricts will only be considered as Conditional Districts.\nCD RR Conditional Residential Rural District.\nCD RL Conditional Residential Low Density District.\nCD RM Conditional Residential Medium Density District.\nCD RH Conditional Residential High Density District.\nCD OI Conditional Office and Institutional District.\nCD NB Conditional Neighborhood Business District.\nCD CB Conditional Central Business District.\nCD HB Conditional Highway Business District.\nCD LI Conditional Light Industrial District.\nCD HI Conditional Heavy Industrial District.\nCD PUD Conditional Planned Unit Development District.\n3.5.2 Applicability.\nA. Property may be placed in a Conditional District only in response to a petition by the owners of\nall the property to be included. Specific conditions applicable to these districts may be proposed\nby the petitioner or the Town or its agencies, but only those conditions mutually approved by\nthe Town and the petitioner may be incorporated into the zoning regulations or permit\nrequirements. Conditions and site-specific standards imposed in a Conditional District shall be\nlimited to those that address the conformance of the development and use of the site to the\nabout:blank\n27/281\n\n\nNEW PAGE 28\n6/26/23, 8:05 AM\nGranite Quarry, NC Code of Ordinances\nTown's ordinances and to any officially adopted comprehensive or other plan and those that address the\nimpacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site. Conditional District\nzoning allows specific standards for a particular use after review and comment from the public. A petition\nto\nrezone a property to a Conditional District shall be accompanied by a site-specific plan.\nB. Within a CD, only those uses authorized as either permitted or conditional uses in the zoning\ndistrict with which the CD corresponds shall be permitted, and all other requirements of the\ncorresponding district shall be met as minimum standards. Such district may further specify the\nlocation on the property of the proposed use or uses, the number of dwelling units, the location\nand extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways and access streets, the\nlocation and extent of buffer areas, and other special purpose areas, the timing of\ndevelopment, the location and extent of right-of-way and other areas to be dedicated for public\nuse, and other such matters as the applicant may propose as conditions upon the request, but\nnot to include conditions not generally a part of land development controls. In approving a\nConditional District, the Board of Aldermen may impose such additional reasonable and\nappropriate safeguards upon such permit as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose\nand intent of this Ordinance are served, public welfare secured, and substantial justice done.\nC. If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these regulations is found to be illegal or\ninvalid or if the applicant should fail to accept any condition, it is the intent of this Ordinance\nthat the authorization of such Conditional District shall be null and void and of no effect, and\nthat proceedings shall be instituted to rezone the property to its previous zoning classification.\nD. See Chapter 14 for the Conditional District Rezoning process.\n3.5.3 PUD Conditional District.\n3.5.3.1 Purpose.\nThe purpose of a Planned Unit Development (PUD) is to plan and promote neighborhoods that\nembody variety, innovation, and flexibility in development by allowing a variety of uses, lot sizes,\ndwelling unit types, and design requirements. PUD districts shall only be considered as Conditional\nDistricts. The intent of a PUD is to:\nPermit a creative approach to the development of land;\nProvide for an efficient use of land;\nEnhance the appearance of neighborhoods through preservation of natural features;\nProvide for recreational areas and open space where appropriate.\n3.5.3.2 Applicability.\nThe provisions of this section are shall be applied:\nWhenever a tract of land of at least 25 acres is within the zoning limits of the Town of\nGranite Quarry.\nabout:blank\n28/281\n\n\nNEW PAGE 29\n6/26/23, 8:05 AM\nGranite Quarry, NC Code of Ordinances\nThe provisions of this section shall apply only to proposed new developments and shall not\napply to any PUD plan which is now fully or partially developed, nor to any such\ndevelopment for which a final authorization has been granted pursuant to the previous\nOrdinance.\n3.5.3.3 Uses.\nA. Any single use or combination of uses as seen in the Permitted Uses Table, with the\nexception of the LI and HI districts, are allowable within a PUD, provided that the proposed\nPUD does not conflict with the Town's Comprehensive Plan or Unified Development\nOrdinance.\nB. The majority of the total development acreage shall be single-family, detached with a\ndensity not to exceed an average of four (4) units per acre. Common open space shall\ncomprise at least 15 percent of the total development acreage. The remaining acreage may\nconsist of additional single-family (not to exceed an average of four (4) units per acre), multi-\nfamily (not to exceed an average of 15 units per acre), commercial, or civic uses.\nC. Developers shall have a pre-application meeting with the Zoning Administrator to discuss\npermissible uses and development layouts before presenting to the Planning Board.\nD. A mix of uses is encouraged, provided that:\n1. Non-residential uses within the PUD shall be designed to serve residents of the PUD and\nnearby areas only. Large scale establishments and developments intended to serve the\nentire community are not encouraged in a PUD.\n2. Large scale establishments will be reviewed and appropriateness will be determined\nbased on the overall size of the proposed PUD.\n3. Non-residential uses that are contained in the PUD shall be limited to those contained in\nthe OI, NB, CB, and HB commercial districts.\n4. Hours of operation of any non-residential use shall be reviewed and appropriateness\nwill be determined based on the overall size of the proposed PUD.\n3.5.3.4 Dimensional Requirements.\nDimensional requirements within a PUD are as follows:\nabout:blank\n29/281\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nMinimum Lot Size\nCELL (1, 3): \nMinimum Lot Size\nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nMinimum Setbacks\nCELL (1, 6): \nMinimum Setbacks\nCELL (1, 7): \nCELL (1, 8): \nMaximum\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nMin.
