You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Neighborhood Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"NB\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage_pavement\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: coverage, impervious surface, lot coverage by impervious surfaces, lot coverage, max imperv. coverage, max impervious coverage. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Neighborhood Business\n(NB) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage_pavement for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage_pavement\nfor Neighborhood Business (NB).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage_pavement extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage_pavement records the amount of land that may be covered by both buildings and other impervious surfaces, such as pavement. If the document specifies the maximum lot coverage by buildings only, DO NOT include it. If the document refers to maximum lot coverage generally, you can assume it includes both buildings and impervious surfaces and include it. If the document only specifies impervious surface coverage, it can be considered as building coverage and included in the answer.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage_pavement is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage_pavement and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 100\nAs of 01/17/23\nUses listed as SR in the NB District in section 21-113, the table of uses, shall comply with the\nfollowing criteria, as applicable:\n(1) Site plan.

For those systems having a panel area greater than six thousand\n(6,000) square feet, the applicant shall provide documentation from a registered North\nCarolina Professional Engineer qualified to perform electrical design services\nsubstantiating the solar energy system is primarily designed to provide or off-set\npower for on-site use and does not exceed one megawatt (1 MW).\n3. Roof Mounted system. Solar collectors may not be attached to any structure located\nin the conical or horizontal surface of the Mid-Carolinas Regional Airport.\nd. Co-location of Wireless and Eligible Facilities Requests (SIC 48 (pt)). Co-location of\nwireless and eligible facilities requests are recognized as an efficient method for providing\nwireless facilities and are encouraged due to their minimization of adverse visual impacts\nand the opportunity for an expedited and effective administrative review.\n66\n\n\nNEW PAGE 67\nAs of 01/17/23\n1. Applications for co-location of wireless facilities shall include two (2) copies of a site\nplan prepared by a registered professional engineer or a professional land surveyor\nas provided in Section 21-52 including items in Section 21-56 (6)(e)5 and Section 21-\n60(4)a.1.i,\n2. Consideration of eligible facilities requests pursuant to this subsection shall comply\nwith all standards prescribed below, otherwise the request may be deemed a\nsubstantial modification and subject to the provisions of Section 21-60 (4)(a):\ni. Not increase the existing vertical height of the structure by the greater of (a) more\nthan ten percent (10%) or (b) the height of one additional antenna array with\nseparation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed twenty feet (20')\nregardless of height limitations prescribed in Section 21-60(4)b.\nii.

A statutory exception (ref. G.S. 160D-931(19)(b to this\nstandard allows for sheltering the antenna from inclement weather or to connect the\nantenna to the tower via cable.\niii. Not increase the square footage of the existing equipment compound by more than\n2,500 square feet.\niv. Provide information from Section 21-56(6)(e) 4, and 5; and Section 21-60(4) (a) 1.i.\nand 21-60(4) (c)\ne. Use of alternative tower structures (SIC 48 (pt)). The county acknowledges the merits of\nalternative tower structures for their innovative use as a means to provide current and\nfuture wireless telecommunications coverage and are encouraged as a secondary option\nto\nco-location and eligible facilities requests. Wireless\nfacilities\napplications\nfor\nplacement on or within alternative tower structures may be evaluated in all zoning districts\nand approved administratively, provided the following SR are met:\n1. The addition of an antenna shall not add more than twenty (20) feet in height.\n2.

The deployment of wireless infrastructure for use by local, state\nand federal government agencies is critical to ensuring the public safety and general\nwelfare of the County's citizens at all times. The provision of reliable and uniform radio\nand telecommunications coverage by these agencies can only be secured through\nconstruction, operation and maintenance of its own infrastructure. Applications for a\n67\n\n\nNEW PAGE 68\nAs of 01/17/23\npublic safety tower shall include:\n1.
