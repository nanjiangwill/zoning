You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Neighborhood Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"NB\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Neighborhood Business\n(NB) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Neighborhood Business (NB).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage refers solely to the maximum lot coverage of buildings for primary use and all accessory structures. Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

The building area coverage shall be the dimensional standards of the applicable zoning District (i.e., R-7500, C-LD, etc.). However, the\ndeveloped area may be increased as a result of utilizing exceptional design and/or best management practices as provided in Section 6.1,\nDesign Flexibility.

Co-location of Wireless and Eligible Facilities Requests (SIC 48 (pt)). Co-location of\nwireless and eligible facilities requests are recognized as an efficient method for providing\nwireless facilities and are encouraged due to their minimization of adverse visual impacts\nand the opportunity for an expedited and effective administrative review.\n66\n\n\nNEW PAGE 67\nAs of 01/17/23\n1. Applications for co-location of wireless facilities shall include two (2) copies of a site\nplan prepared by a registered professional engineer or a professional land surveyor\nas provided in Section 21-52 including items in Section 21-56 (6)(e)5 and Section 21-\n60(4)a.1.i,\n2. Consideration of eligible facilities requests pursuant to this subsection shall comply\nwith all standards prescribed below, otherwise the request may be deemed a\nsubstantial modification and subject to the provisions of Section 21-60 (4)(a):\ni. Not increase the existing vertical height of the structure by the greater of (a) more\nthan ten percent (10%) or (b) the height of one additional antenna array with\nseparation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed twenty feet (20')\nregardless of height limitations prescribed in Section 21-60(4)b.\nii. Not add an appurtenance to the body of a wireless support structure that protrudes\nhorizontally from the edge of the wireless support structure the greater of (a) more\nthan 20 feet or (b) more than the width of the wireless support structure at the level\nof the appurtenance. A statutory exception (ref. G.S. 160D-931(19)(b to this\nstandard allows for sheltering the antenna from inclement weather or to connect the\nantenna to the tower via cable.\niii. Not increase the square footage of the existing equipment compound by more than\n2,500 square feet.\niv. Provide information from Section 21-56(6)(e) 4, and 5; and Section 21-60(4) (a) 1.i.\nand 21-60(4) (c)\ne. Use of alternative tower structures (SIC 48 (pt)). The county acknowledges the merits of\nalternative tower structures for their innovative use as a means to provide current and\nfuture wireless telecommunications coverage and are encouraged as a secondary option\nto\nco-location and eligible facilities requests. Wireless\nfacilities\napplications\nfor\nplacement on or within alternative tower structures may be evaluated in all zoning districts\nand approved administratively, provided the following SR are met:\n1. The addition of an antenna shall not add more than twenty (20) feet in height.\n2. The associated wireless facilities shall comply with the setbacks for the underlying\nzoning district, screened according to section 21-215(1)b.1.-3. and be constructed of\nsimilar materials/color as the host structure.\n3. The existing host structure may not be externally altered, except to accommodate the\naddition of the antenna.\n4. Two (2) copies of a site plan as provided in section 21-52 and photograph\ndocumentation as required in Section 21-60(4)a. 4 and 5.\n5. Certification from a North Carolina registered professional engineer that any and all\nstructures have sufficient structural integrity to accommodate the addition of an\nantenna with a design minimum of TIA/EIA-222F (as amended).\n6. Failure to comply with any of the criteria in items 1. through 5. shall require the\napplication to be reviewed as a new wireless support structure.\nf.\nPublic Safety Tower.
