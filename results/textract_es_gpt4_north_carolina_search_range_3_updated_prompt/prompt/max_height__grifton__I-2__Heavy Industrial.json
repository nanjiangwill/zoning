You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Heavy Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"I-2\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Heavy Industrial\n(I-2) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Heavy Industrial (I-2).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Any new telecommunication tower, including\ntower co-locations, shall base subject to the issuance of a conditional use permit, (co-locations defined:\nwhere two or more providers use the same tower). Where possible or required by the town the\nproviders shall attempt to produce in good faith \"stealth\" antenna locations. This includes antennas in\na structure or building disguised to look like something else (i.e., steeple, bell tower and the like).\n(C) The maximum allowable height of a tower shall be 199.9 feet. Telecommunication towers that\nare shorter than the maximum height shall be encouraged where possible. A higher tower height may\nbe approved by the Board of Commissioners if the applicant can prove the 199.9 foot height will not\nallow for the provision of adequate service levels (i.e., cannot meet reasonable service coverage area)\nor if the increased height is related to co-location.\n(D) It is the intent of the town for providers to co-locate facilities to reduce the number of\ntelecommunication towers in the town's planning jurisdiction. The town may require providers to\nnegotiate in good faith with other providers' space at a reasonable lease cost, and to publicize the fact\nthat space is available on a lease basis as part of the conditional use process. No tower may be located\nwithin 1,500 linear feet of an existing tower unless the applicant can prove, (written documentation)\n\n\nNEW PAGE 78\nthat co-location is not a viable option.\n(E) Where a telecommunication tower is located on a lot with an existing principal use, the tower\nshall be located in the rear yard only. In addition, an access road at least 12 feet wide shall be\nmaintained from a public street to the tower for use by service and emergency vehicles.\n(F) A tower cannot be prohibited nor can a conditional use permit be denied on the basis of\nenvironmental or health concerns relating to radio emissions if the tower complies with the Federal\nRadio Frequency Emission Standards. However, the applicant must provide documentation proving to\nthe town that the proposed tower does comply with all applicable Federal Radio Frequency Emission\nStandards.\n(G) All accessory structures on the ground which contain switching equipment or other related\nequipment must be designed to substantially resemble the neighborhood's basic architecture, or the\narchitecture and style of any principal use on the property.\n(H) An opaque screen of vegetation shall be required along all sides of the perimeter of the\ntelecommunication tower site. In addition, a minimum eight foot high fence is required immediately\naround the tower and any equipment building(s) with the screening to be located on the outside of the\nfenced area. It will be the responsibility of the provider to keep all landscaping material free from\ndisease and properly maintained in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was established. The owners\nof the property and any tenant on the property where screening is required, shall be jointly and\nseverally responsible for the maintenance of all screen materials. The maintenance shall include all\nactions necessary to keep the screened area free of litter and debris, to keep plantings healthy and to\nkeep planting areas neat in appearance. Any vegetation that constitutes part of the screening shall be\nreplaced in the event it dies.\n(I) The Board of Commissioners reserves the right to deny a conditional use permit for a\ntelecommunication tower on the basis of negative influence on property values, or on aesthetic\nconcerns provided that there is competent and material evidence to prove the impact on adjacent\nproperty owners will be significant. The Board of Commissioners must clearly state its reasons in\nwriting, with the relevant evidence of the impact on adjacent property values or aesthetics if the request\nis denied on this basis.\n(J) A minimum setback requirement, on all sides of the property, shall be the length of the tower\nplus 20%, (i.e., a 100-foot tower would require a 120-foot setback, all setbacks will be rounded up to\nthe nearest foot). No above ground or in ground utilities will be allowed within the required setback\narea, unless written permission is given by the utility owner/provider.\n(K) Towers having a height of 199.9 feet or less shall not contain lights or light fixtures at a height\nexceeding 15 feet. Furthermore, lighting of all towers in any district shall be directed toward the tower\nand/or accessory uses to reduce the effect of glare.\n(L) Towers and related faculties must be removed if abandoned (no longer actually used for\ntelecommunication purposes) for a period greater than 90 consecutive days. An extension may be\n\nNEW PAGE 79\ngranted at the pleasure of the Board. The town may request a surety bond from the owner to ensure the\nfinancing is available to remove the tower.\n(M) Any replacement or enlargement to an existing telecommunication tower, including if the\ntower is blown over or considered inoperable, requires the provider to apply for a new conditional use\npermit. Normal maintenance and repair of the structure can be completed without the issuance of a new\nconditional use permit.\n(N) The provider must show proof of adequate insurance coverage for any potential damage\ncaused by or to the tower prior to the issuance of a conditional use permit or zoning permit.\n(O) Outdoor storage of equipment or other related items is prohibited at the tower site.\n(P) The town encourages the placement of telecommunication towers on existing water towers or\nelectric transmission towers whenever feasible. No freestanding tower may be located within 3,000\nlinear feet (as measured using the shortest straight line distance between each tower) of a water tower\nor electric transmission tower unless the applicant can prove that locating on the water tower or electric\ntransmission tower is not feasible.\n(Q) All applications for a conditional use permit for a telecommunication tower must include the\nfollowing information in addition to any other applicable information required on the application:\n(1) Identification of intended provider(s);\n(2) Certification by a registered engineer that the tower has sufficient structural integrity to\naccommodate more than one user, if applicable;\n(3) An affidavit from the owner indicating intent to allow shared use of the tower and how\nothers will be accommodated, if applicable;\n(4) Documentation that the telecommunication tower complies with the federal radio\nfrequency emission standards;\n(5) Documentation that towers over 199.9 feet are necessary for a minimal level of service;\nand\n(6) Screening, if applicable, must be shown on the site plan detailing the type, amount of\nplantings and location.\n(Ord. passed 1-11-2005, \u00a7 6-15)\nSIGNS\n\nNEW PAGE 84\n(C) Location: the signs shall be at least 15 feet inside the public right-of-way.\n(D) Maximum size: any one sign shall not exceed 16 square feet in area. If matching entrance\npillars are constructed at the entrance of a subdivision, neighborhood, school or similar use, the total\nsign area shall not exceed 18 square feet.\n(E) Lighting: the signs may be internally or externally illuminated.\n(F) Height: the signs shall not exceed six feet in height.\n(Ord. passed 1-11-2005, \u00a7 7-10)\n\u00a7 152.197\nON-SITE SIGNS PERMITTED IN COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL\nDISTRICTS.\n(A) Total sign area per lot. For each lot one square foot of sign area is permitted for each two\nlinear foot of frontage on a public right-of-way may be permitted. (For example, a business with 500\nfeet of frontage on a public right-of-way may have a total of 250 square feet of signage.) However, the\ntotal sign area for a single lot may not exceed 500 square feet. The standards for various types of signs\nshall be specified in divisions (B) through (F) below.\n(B) Wall signs (attached).\n(1) Zoning districts where permitted: all Commercial and Industrial Districts.\n(2) Number of signs: none specified.\n(3) Location: wall signs shall be located on the front of the building.
