You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Conservation\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CON\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage_pavement\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: coverage, impervious surface, lot coverage by impervious surfaces, lot coverage, max imperv. coverage, max impervious coverage. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Conservation\n(CON) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage_pavement for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage_pavement\nfor Conservation (CON).\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage_pavement extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage_pavement records the amount of land that may be covered by both buildings and other impervious surfaces, such as pavement. If the document specifies the maximum lot coverage by buildings only, DO NOT include it. If the document refers to maximum lot coverage generally, you can assume it includes both buildings and impervious surfaces and include it. If the document only specifies impervious surface coverage, it can be considered as building coverage and included in the answer.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage_pavement is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage_pavement and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 100\nAs of 01/17/23\nUses listed as SR in the CON District in section 21-113, the table of uses, shall comply with the\nfollowing criteria, as applicable:\n(1) Site plan.

Multiple buildings may be used in\ncalculating the maximum allowable building size.\n(5) Impervious surface.
