Regulations applicable to all districts.\nThe following regulations shall apply in all zoning districts:\nA. Buildings, uses and lots.\n(1) Lot for every building. Every building hereafter erected shall be located on a lot as defined\nherein, and except for Neighborhood Shopping Center Districts, there shall be no more than\none principal building and its accessory structures located on any one lot.\n(2) Subdivision of a lot. Where a lot is formed hereafter from part of a lot already occupied by a\nbuilding or structure, such separation shall be effected in such manner as not to impair\nconformity with any of the requirements of these regulations.\n(3) Lot width required. No part of any dwelling or other structure housing a principal use shall be\nerected on any part of a lot which is less width than the minimum required.\n(4)\nParts of lot not counted toward minimum area requirements. No part of any lot reserved for or\nused as a road, right-of-way or accessway shall be counted as part of the required minimum\nlot area. Land subject to easements for aboveground utilities which forbid buildings or\nstructures within the area of the easement shall not be included as part of minimum lot area,\nnor shall any easement which grants exclusive surface use of the property to other than the\nowner, except drainage easements.

For purposes of this regulation, land is not\ncontiguous if a public or private road, a major watercourse, a public or private easement\nrestricting development, or a right-of-way divides it. This contiguity requirement applies even if\nthe public or private road, major watercourse, public or private easement restricting\ndevelopment, or right-of-way and the parcel or tracts of land are in the same ownership.\nConstruction on a lot that is subject to this section of the minimum area requirement\nregulation must take place on that section of the lot that contains the two contiguous acres of\nproperty.

An accessway otherwise in compliance with these regulations shall not be a\nviolation of this subsection. For example, a lot which narrows to 50 feet at a given point must\nbecome a closed geometric figure within 150 feet of such point. (See Illustration No. 1.) A lot\nwhich narrows to 30 feet at a given point must become a closed geometric figure within 90\nfeet of such point.
