A Petition for Change to a Heritage Gateway District (HG) will only be\naccepted for properties within the heritage gateway area. The purpose of the HG District is\nto create a design district with a flexible framework for the development of properties that have\nunique or unusual characteristics and do not fit into the\nconventional zoning pattern, such as village centers, heritage industrial areas\nand open spaces that would otherwise require unusual environmentally and aesthetically sensitive\ndevelopment. The design of each HG District will appropriately reflect and protect the character of\nthe site with due consideration\nfor the historic, environmentally sensitive or aesthetic role of the site in the heritage and\nlandscape of the Town of Essex.\n81B.\nPETITION FOR CHANGE TO AN HG DISTRICT.\n81B.1. PETITION FOR CHANGE. Within the heritage gateway area, any owner of\nproperty may petition the commission requesting a change in these regulations or the\nboundaries of the districts in accordance with the provisions of Section 123 Amendments\nof Regulations and District Boundaries of the Regulations, except that the petitioner will\nprepare the map at a scale appropriate to depict the boundaries of the proposed change in\ndistrict boundaries.\n81B.2. PRE-PETITION CONFERENCE. Any potential petitioner may submit and the\ncommission may consider a preliminary Concept Plan and Standards to the zoning\ncommission or the planning commission for informal review and consideration prior to\nsubmittal of a formal Petition for Change.
