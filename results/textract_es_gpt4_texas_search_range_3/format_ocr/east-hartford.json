On a future date, the proposed zone will be placed on the ground at the request of the\naffected landowner(s) or Developer. It is felt that the proposed floating zone technique rather than conventional\nrigid zoning will result in more planning of land uses within these areas. Accordingly, to achieve this goal, it\nshall be the intent of these regulations to permit the development of multiple buildings owned by multiple owners\non a single lot or on multiple lots.\n603.2 Purpose\nThe purpose of this section is to establish special detailed use floating zones of undetermined location for large\nscale development sites. This regulation is intended to provide increased flexibility of land development while\nrequiring greater administrative standards and procedures and long range planning.\n603.3 Districts\nThere shall be two Design Development Districts as follows:\nDesign Development District I - 20 Acre Minimum\nDesign Development District II - Age Restricted Residential Development\n603.4\nDesign Development District I (DDDI) - 20 Acre Minimum\n603.4.1 Definitions\nIn addition to the definitions contained in Article II General Provisions Section 200 Definitions, the following\nwords and phrases shall, for the purposes of this regulation, be defined as follows:\nUNDERLYING ZONE DDDI: The Industrial 3 (I-3), Industrial 2 (I-2), Business 4 (B-4), and/or Business IA\n(B-1A) Zone which existed prior to the establishment of the Design Development District Zone.

Open space shall be\nincorporated into the proposed Master Plan as a design feature, to buffer the proposed development from\nexisting development, to serve as a transition between uses within the development, and/or as a principal use\nin its own right. In recognition of these varied open space uses and the variety of uses which may be proposed\nfor a particular Design Development District I or Development Area, open space may include any natural\nareas, landscaped and/or formal planted gardens, important wetland systems or other significant natural areas,\nactive and passive recreation areas and/or other unimproved land areas.

Open space shall be provided in an adjacent Design Development District or Development Area, or in\nother adjacent land of the applicant, sufficient to meet the open space requirements hereof for the\ncombined parcels; or\n2.\nThe applicant can provide open space (\"Alternative Open Space\") at an alternative location outside the\nDesign Development District parcel, which need not be contiguous to or in the immediate vicinity of the\nDesign Development District parcel.

Types of Open Space\nThe location and extent of all open space shall be identified on the Master Plan and designated as major or\nurban design. Subsequent changes in use of open space from that designated on the approved Master Plan\nmay be permitted by the Commission by Special Permit.
