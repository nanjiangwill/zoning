Recognizing that the Town of Clinton contains both\nestablished restaurants and a seasonal influx of individuals who may be looking for more\ncasual or recreational options, this Section attempts to balance the competing needs of all\nstakeholders.\nThe Regulations are divided into four categories: Transient Vendors, Stationary Vendors,\nEvent Vendors, and Seasonal Outdoor Use to recognize the differing needs of these types of\nuses. A vendor permit may be granted for either Transient or Stationary Vendors. The two\nuses are mutually exclusive. The holder of a Transient or Stationary Vendor may also apply\nfor an Event Vendor permit. Legal property owners or tenants may apply for Seasonal\nOutdoor Use permits.\nThe Commission has determined that the interests of health, safety and welfare are best\nserved by requiring vendors to obtain zoning permits.
