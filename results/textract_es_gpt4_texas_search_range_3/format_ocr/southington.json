The approved design of the project's exterior streetscape will vary\naccording to the unique attributes of the project parcel, the setting, current and anticipated\nabutting uses, nature and extent of existing suitable plant material, site topography, and\nother factors. In general, the exterior streetscape treatment shall be an integral and\nimportant element of the overall project design. Design themes shall respect and, where\nappropriate, attempt to enhance the existing character of the streetscape, ranging from the\npreservation or enhancement of existing wooded areas to selective removal of existing\nwooded overgrowth or invasive species areas, planting of new trees and shrubs within\ncleared areas, and adding public sidewalks, lighting, benches, decorative fences, stone\nwalls or other amenities.\nE. Streetscape (Interior)\na. In order to promote a healthy and active living environment, enhance\nopportunities for social interaction and sustain project value, the interior\nstreetscape shall be an important design element throughout the project. All\ninterior streets shall be privately owned and maintained as a condition of ARCHZ\napproval. In exchange, maximum design flexibility will be allowed, subject only\nto reasonable engineering standards for horizontal and vertical geometry,\nstormwater treatment, public safety and other typical considerations. Interior\nprivate project drives are not required to comply with the applicable subdivision\nregulation standards for public streets.\nb. All interior streets shall be provided with native deciduous street trees, located no\nmore than 50 feet on center and a minimum of eight feet high and 2 1/2 inches in\ncaliper at planting. Where possible, existing trees shall also be retained and\nincorporated into the project design. Interior streets shall also be provided with a\ngraded and grassed snow shelf along the edge of pavement or curb line a\nminimum of six feet wide.\nF. Abutting Properties. Depending upon the existing and/or anticipated abutting uses, the\nCommission may require planted buffers to abutting property, including, where\nappropriate, the retention of existing mature natural vegetation or any combination of\nretention and new planting. If appropriate, in the Commission's sole discretion,\ndecorative fences, screen walls or other methods may be selectively allowed, if they help\nachieve ARCHZ objectives.\nG. Screening. Where appropriate, landscape shall also be used to screen refuse collection\nareas, utility cabinets, recreational trails and other miscellaneous items. Use of generic\nscreening shall be avoided, and screening designs shall reflect the same quality and\nvariety provided in other areas of the project.\n3-09.16\nLighting\nSection 3\nPage 32 of 38\n"}, {"page": "59", "text": "A.

In order to permit these widths, sufficient surface parking shall be provided off\nstreet for all uses, in separate parking areas, unit garages, or in some combination of both.\n3-09.18\nCommunity Facilities\nEach project may provide some form of community facility for the purposes of community association\nmeetings, recreation, or for similar purposes.

In determining the degree of compatibility the building or\nalterations will be assessed in relation to adjacent common characteristics including the\nfollowing:\n1. Height - Buildings should be built to a height compatible with existing adjacent buildings,\nand should be built with the same number of stories. The Commission may approve\nvariations in height of buildings if it finds the variation can still meet the design review and\ngeneral criteria.\n2. Scale and Proportion of Facades - The relationship of the building's width to its height\nshould be similar to and compatible with adjacent buildings as seen from the public street\nand publicly accessible areas. Structures designed SO that their apparent horizontal and\nvertical scale reflects the scale of principal structures on the same block and on the block face\nacross the street are preferred. The scale of a structure is (1) the apparent size and bulk of the\nstructure and its components compared to the size of adjacent buildings and to the human\nscale and (2) the apparent size and bulk of the structure compared to the components of the\nfacade. Discretion in scale is permitted with appropriate building massing.\n3. Complexity of Building Form - Architectural style is not restricted, but the building or\naddition should be similar in form, complexity and ornamental detail to adjacent buildings.\nThis assessment will be made against the dominant characteristics of adjacent buildings.\nHarmony in texture, lines and masses is encouraged; monotony should be avoided.\n4. Roof Shapes and Materials - The roofs of new buildings or additions which are visible from\nthe public street and public areas should relate in pitch, shape and material to the roofs of\nexisting adjacent buildings, and buildings along the street within 250 feet.\n5. Rhythms of Entrances and Projections - Entrances, porches, porticos, and other projections to\nbe incorporated into new buildings should relate to the pattern of existing adjacent buildings\nand the street in such a manner as to reinforce the prevailing form.\n6.\nDirectional Expression of Facades - Directional expression of facades should be compatible\nwith that of existing adjacent buildings and buildings along the street within at least 250 feet.\nThe dominant directional expression, either horizontal or vertical, is determined by the\nstructural form of the building, the shapes of the openings (windows and doors) and\narchitectural detailing and ornament.\n7.\nProportion of Openings in the Facade - The ratio of the width to the height of the buildings,\nwindows and doors should relate to and be compatible with existing adjacent buildings where\nthese features are visible from the street or public areas. Likewise, the relationship between\nthe walls (e.g., solids) and voids (e.g., windows) should be compatible with adjacent\nbuildings and buildings along the street within 250 feet in either direction from the site.\nB)\nRhythm of Buildings and Spaces\nSection 8\nPage 6 of 9\n"}, {"page": "147", "text": "Page 7 of 9\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nThe buildings should reinforce the existing rhythm of buildings and the spaces between those\nbuildings adjacent to the site and along the street within at least 250 feet of the site.\nCELL (2, 1): \nC)\nCELL (2, 2): \nSetback and Site Location\nThe building or addition should be located on the site and be set back from the street to reinforce\nprevailing setbacks of the adjacent buildings and buildings along the street within at least 250\nfeet of the site.\nCELL (3, 1): \nD)\nCELL (3, 2): \nBuilding Materials\nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \n1.

All new utility services and those service modifications necessitated by exterior alterations\nshould be installed underground unless the utility company deems this not to be feasible.\n2.

Landscape features should\ncomplement building architecture, provide shade and visual relief and interest, and encourage\npedestrian circulation.\n3.\nPlant material should be selected for interest in its structure, texture, and color and for its\nultimate growth.

Every sign should have scale and proportion in its design and in its visual relationship to\nbuildings and surroundings.\n2. Signs designed as an integral architectural element of the building and site to which it\nprincipally relates are preferred. As an architectural element, the sign should reflect the\nperiod of architecture and be in harmony with the building's character and use.\n3.

All lighting intended to\nilluminate the building or yards should be arranged SO that the lights will not shine into the\neyes of any person external to the premises, or cause a nuisance from excessive glare.\n2.
