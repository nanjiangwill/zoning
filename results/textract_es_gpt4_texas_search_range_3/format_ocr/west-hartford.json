The predominant character of the Town as it exists and as planned is one-family\nresidential, but it is the intent that there be a variety of types of residential\nenvironments to meet the variety of needs and desires of the Town's residents and\nalso to recognize the prevailing character of certain existing residential areas which\nfit into the Comprehensive Zoning Plan. The variety of residential characters\nis\nintended to be accomplished through a range of one-family district densities and\nstandards, as well as by a limited amount of area set aside for multifamily\nresidential structures.\n(1) One-family residence districts.\n(a) The purpose of the following types of one-family residence districts is to\nprovide areas for those residents who desire individual dwelling\nstructures surrounded by open space which can be landscaped and\ndeveloped with facilities for outdoor family living and where there is\ngenerally less traffic and relatively greater quiet. In keeping with these\npurposes, it is intended that nonresidential uses in such districts be limited\nto those which are primarily necessary or desirable to serve the residents\nof these districts and are compatible with residential uses when located in\ntheir midst. Only those nonresidential uses listed as permitted in each\ndistrict are considered to be compatible.\n(b) The types of one-family residence districts, which vary only in the\nminimum requirements for lot area, dimensions and other spatial\nstandards, are as follows:\n(2) Multifamily residence districts.\n(a) The purpose of the multifamily residence districts is to provide areas for\n177:19\nCELL (1, 1): \nDistrict\nCELL (1, 2): \nSquare Feet of Lot Area Per Dwelling Unit\nCELL (2, 1): \nR-80\nCELL (2, 2): \n80,000 (may be developed only as open space\ndevelopment as set forth in \u00a7 \u00a7 177-13 and 177-14)\nCELL (3, 1): \nR-40\nCELL (3, 2): \n40,000\nCELL (4, 1): \nR-20\nCELL (4, 2): \n20,000\nCELL (5, 1): \nR-13\nCELL (5, 2): \n12,750\nCELL (6, 1): \nR-10\nCELL (6, 2): \n10,500\nCELL (7, 1): \nR-6\nCELL (7, 2): \n6,000\n"}, {"page": "20", "text": "\u00a7 177-3\nWEST HARTFORD CODE\n\u00a7 177-3\nthose residents who cannot or do not wish to have personal responsibility\nfor the maintenance of residential property or who cannot assume\nfinancial obligations of owning or maintaining individual residential\ndwellings or who, for other reasons, prefer the more urbanized\nenvironmental character associated with multifamily residential areas.

Business districts. The business districts contained in this chapter are established in\norder to provide for a variety of areas to serve the diverse needs of the Town's\npopulation and business community. Only such uses are permitted in the business\ndistricts which are mutually compatible and which serve best the specific functions\nwhich the various districts are intended to fulfill.\n(1) Office District (BO). The purpose of this district is to permit office\ndevelopment generally on the periphery of larger business centers and thereby\nto create a gradual transition from the activities of the business center to the\nrelative quiet of the surrounding residential areas. Since this district will\ngenerally be established in what have been residential areas adjacent to\nbusiness districts, residential uses are permitted. Parking of motor vehicles is\nalso permitted as a principal use in proper locations for parking facilities\nserving an adjacent business center.\n(2) Office-Laboratory District (BOL). The purpose of this district is to permit the\ndevelopment of selected office and laboratory uses on large tracts, generally\nnot available in the other business districts. Whereas such tracts are usually\nfound in the vicinity of residential neighborhoods, particularly high standards\nare required in this district to assure the harmonious integration of this type of\ndevelopment into the surrounding neighborhoods.

The purpose of these districts is to provide convenience goods\nand services for the neighboring residential areas. Accordingly, the\ncommercial uses permitted are intended to be those which provide for the daily\nneeds of neighboring residents and which do not depend on market areas\nsubstantially larger than the neighborhood the district is intended to service.\nResidential uses are also permitted, recognizing the existing development in\nthese districts. The area of each Neighborhood District is intended to be\nlimited to fulfill this function of local service.\n(4) Shopping Center District (BS). The purpose of this district is to encourage the\nconcentration of a wide variety of stores, services and activities serving the\nentire Town as major shopping and community centers. This district is\nintended to be properly related to the major road system and, if possible,\nserved by public transit. Residential uses are permitted only as far as they are\ncompatible with the activities of this district. Shopping Center Districts are\nsubject to higher standards than the Retail Business Districts because they are\nusually new developments on larger, single-owner tracts where the application\nof such higher standards is practical and desirable to achieve a high quality of\ndevelopment.\n(5) General Business District (BG). The purpose of this district is to provide areas\nfor the development of such commercial uses which are considered necessary\nto serve the residents and businesses of the Town but incompatible with the\nfunctions of the other business districts. Wholesaling, storage and other uses\nwhich do not normally attract the general public and automobile sales and\nservices are the characteristic uses of this district. Recognizing historical\ndevelopment patterns and the desire to promote mixed uses which will bring\nvitality to business districts after the end of the traditional work day, the\npermitted uses of the Central Business Districts are also permitted in the\nGeneral Business Districts. Additionally, while ground floors are to be\nreserved for permitted commercial uses, dwelling units are permitted on upper\nfloors.\n(6) Central Business District (BC) and Central Business District-High Intensive\n(CBDH). The purpose of these districts is to encourage the concentration of a\nwide variety of stores, services and activities, including large stores offering\ncomparison shopper's goods, specialty stores, business services, banks,\noffices, theaters, hotels and government buildings. This area serves all areas of\nWest Hartford as well as surrounding communities. The use of land is\nintensive, and this intensity of use is one of the main determinants of the\nvitality of the Central Business District. Pedestrian-oriented uses are\nencouraged on the street level to ensure this intensity of use. Residences,\nprofessional offices and other uses compatible with the retail nature of the\nCentral Business District are permitted, although it is recommended that these\nuses occur on upper floors of buildings. The Central Business District-High\nIntensive designation is to be applied to areas adjoining the Central Business\n177:21\n"}, {"page": "22", "text": "\u00a7 177-3\nWEST HARTFORD CODE\n\u00a7 177-3\nDistrict where more dense development can take place than in the BC Zone.\nFactors relevant to the designation of the CBDH Zone are the nature of the\nland uses surrounding the proposed zone, the presence of infrastructure to\nsupport a more intensive use, especially parking facilities and traffic control\ncapabilities, and the Plan of Development's determination that the scale of\nWest Hartford Center itself not be changed.\nC. Industrial districts. The industrial districts contained in this chapter are established\nin order to encourage the best possible use of the limited amount of industrial land\nin the Town, in order to increase the opportunity for employment and to broaden\nthe tax base and in order to achieve a logical and orderly separation of land uses.\n(1)\nIndustrial Park District (IP) and Exclusive Industrial District (IE). The purpose\nof these districts is to reserve for industrial development areas which have\npredominantly been developed industrially, SO that modern industrial\ndevelopment will not be impaired by the presence of nonindustrial uses. The\ndistrict regulations provide for minimum lot area requirements in order to\npreserve the generally large tracts, which are typically found in these districts\nand which are considered essential for modern industrial development. Higher\nstandards apply for the Industrial Park District because this district is largely\nadjacent to existing residential areas.\n(2) General Industrial District (IG) and Restricted Industrial District (IR). These\ndistricts recognize development patterns prevailing in several sections of the\nTown's older industrial areas. Mixed residential, commercial and industrial\nland uses are characteristic for these areas, as well as the relatively small size\nof a majority of the properties. The purpose of these districts is to provide for\nthe continued coexistence of the residential, commercial and industrial uses\nwhile continuing to emphasize that these districts are primarily commercial\nand industrial in nature. The residential and commercial uses are considered\nessential to support and serve the industrial uses in these districts as well as in\nthe Industrial Park and Exclusive Industrial Districts, where no residential or\ncommercial uses are permitted. To further these objectives, residential uses are\npermitted only as a component in development projects which contain a mix\nof residential and nonresidential uses. Higher standards apply to the Restricted\nIndustrial District for the purpose of protecting the numerous dwellings found\nin this district.\nD.\nOther districts.\n(1) Residence Parking District (RP). The purpose of this district is for the\ndevelopment of parking facilities adjacent to business and industrial districts,\nwhere the extension of other business activities would be detrimental to\nadjacent residential areas. A high degree of control over the parking layout is\nnecessary because of the proximity of parking and residential uses.\n(2)\nResidence-Office District (RO). This district is established in recognition of\nareas where residential, institutional and office uses coexist. These areas are\ntypically in a stage of transition from one-family dwellings to a use of higher\nintensity and density. The standards established by the regulations of this\ndistrict are intended to make the various uses mutually compatible.\n177:22\n"}, {"page": "23", "text": "\u00a7 177-3\nZONING\n\u00a7 177-5\n(3) Residence-Institutional District (RI). This district is established in recognition\nof the areas where residential and institutional uses may coexist. The purpose\nof this district is to provide a transitional area of relative quiet and light traffic\nwhich would be advantageous to institutions, such as convalescent homes,\nhomes for the aged and public, private or parochial schools or colleges.\n(4)\nResidential/Multifamily-Office District (RM/O). This district is designed for\nland where residential structures in close proximity to major business zones\nhave been converted to mixed office/residential uses and along and near major\ntraffic arteries in primarily residential areas. In order to maintain the primarily\nresidential character and uses of these areas in spite of these factors, certain\ntypes of professional offices may be established with a special use permit as\nset forth in \u00a7 177-16.3 of this chapter. Maintaining the residential character\nalso requires owners to limit the changes to buildings and to keep signs muted\nin tone.\n(5)\nResidential Character-Office District (RCO). This district is established in\nrecognition of areas where residential structures coexist with institutional,\noffice and business uses. These areas are typically in a stage of transition from\none-family dwellings to a use of higher intensity and density. The standards\nestablished by the regulations of this district are intended to make the various\nuses mutually compatible. To further enhance compatibility, professional\noffices may be established subject to the provisions of \u00a7 177-16.3 of this\nchapter requiring the preservation of the residential character of the building.\n(6) Elizabeth Park Zone (EP). This district is established in recognition of the\nunique recreational opportunities which may be afforded to the public in\nElizabeth Park. It is appropriate to permit food service and public or private\nmeetings, including the provision of outdoor dining opportunities and walk-up\nwindow service within Elizabeth Park. If these uses are established within the\nzone, they shall be held to higher standards and subjected to stricter review\nthan would be applied to similar uses in commercial zones. Food service and\npublic/private meeting facilities together with accessory outdoor dining and\nwalk-up window food service shall, therefore, be permitted in the EP Zone\nonly upon approval of a special development district plan pursuant to\n177-44. The standards applicable within the EP Zone shall be those set forth\nin \u00a7 177-6D with respect to property located within the R-10 Zoning District.\n\u00a7 177-4.

Central to this benefit is the open-air nature of the\ndining areas, which must be both visible from, and physically proximate to, public\npedestrian areas.

Food truck parks. [Added 3-28-2017\nFood truck parks can provide a unique setting for the service of food in areas that\nhave historically not been serviced by a concentration of traditional restaurants. Food\ntruck parks can serve as vibrant public spaces where a variety of activities take place,\nbut where the primary function is the sale and consumption of food from a diverse\narray of vendors. While the operation of food truck parks should contribute to the\nliveliness and vibrancy of the community, they must not be allowed to create a nuisance,\neither by loud music, unruly customers, or disorderly premises. Where food truck\nparks will further these goals without unduly impacting upon adjoining businesses or\nresidential neighborhoods, they may be permitted as a main use subject to the following\nrequirements:\nA. Space definition and location.\n(1) The area of the food truck park must be clearly defined and separated from the\npatron parking area through the installation of a fence or other enclosure which\nmaintains an open appearance and is a maximum of five feet in height.\n(2) The parking area for the food trucks must be either a paved or gravel surface.\n(3) Food truck park operators are encouraged to provide for an aesthetically\npleasing environment which includes shade and seating elements in addition\nto pervious groundcover.\n(4) Food truck parks may have a pavilion or other permanent structure in order to\nprovide shelter for patrons and operators, provided said structure meets the\nsetback requirements for the underlying zone. All temporary structures, such\nas tents, shall be prohibited.\nB. Operations.\n(1) All food truck parks must be handicap accessible.\n(2) All food trucks planned to be on site on any given day shall be parked and\nfully set up prior to the park opening to the public. At the close of business, all\nsuch vehicles shall be removed from the park. If a commissary is provided on\nsite and the food truck is approved to use the site's commissary, then the food\ntruck will not have to be removed from the site each day.\n10.
