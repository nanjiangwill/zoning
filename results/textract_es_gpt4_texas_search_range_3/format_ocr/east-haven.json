For the most part, East Haven is a relatively built\nout community to its urban fringes (Map 1) with some vacant land for development in the North end\nof town. East Haven boarders four (4) other municipalities (New Haven, North Haven, North\nBranford, and Branford). There are 11,898 housing units currently in East Haven and the median\nprice for a single family home in the town is just over 200 thousand dollars on average.\n22\nHamden\nNorth\n17\nNorth Branfo\n80\n(100)\nHaven\nXLT\nBranford\n1\nRegional Build-Out Analysis\nCOG\nTourn of East Haven\nVacard Land\nLegend\nVacant Land\nNUMBER\nLong Island Sound\nMAP 1: South Central Regional Council of Governments, SCRCOG, Regional Built Out Analysis,\n2010\nThe map above (Map 1) shows just how built out East Haven has become over the years, with 2,369\npeople per square mile, which makes East Haven by definition an urban community . The northern\narea of town has by far the lesser population density throughout the town, whereas the center and\nbeach areas are where most of East Haven's density is concentrated. Route 80, which is one the top\nten (10) busiest roads in the state , and one of East Haven's main commerce areas, separates the\n"}, {"page": "180", "text": "Page | 37-2\nnorth and south areas of East Haven. North of Route 80 towards North Haven and North Branford\nare where the rural parts of the town are located.\nThe north end of town is where most of the vacant buildable land is located and in an attempt to\ncontrol urban sprawl the town's future planning and the Planning and Zoning Commission must be\ncareful about future residential development. Urban sprawl is haphazard growth or outward\nextension from a core city, in this case New Haven which ends up resulting in uncontrolled and\npoorly managed automobile dependent development. Sprawling development, which the North end\nof town is ripe for is what the Planning Department and Commission want to be able have complete\nland use control of SO that the mistakes of the past are not repeated.\nThe rural area (North end) of East Haven is all zoned R3, R4 or R5, which call for larger lot sizes\nand the reason those areas are zoned that way was to control density and sprawl. Population density\nisn't always a bad idea, depending on the location and circumstance. If the current zoning warrants\nlarger lots then rezoning an area to squeeze in single family housing that is nonconforming to the\ngeneral area is always going to be controversial with the surrounding neighborhoods and in theory\nand practice, creating urban sprawl is just poor land use planning practices.\nIn order to control density, the Planning & Zoning Commission needs to weigh many factors in their\ndecision making in the North area of town. Some of those factors are the effects and impact that the\nEast Haven School system will have to absorb in additional students and additional funding. Traffic\nis another impact that always needs to be considered. Even though a street such as Strong Street for\nexample would be considered a collector street or even a local street by definition, there would still\nbe an impact on the volume of traffic. Another factor that must always be considered is the\nenvironmental impact on any high density housing project. Environmental issues are SO crucial to\ndevelopment, especially when the community is built out to its fringes. Urban sprawl has already\ntaken up much of the buildable land in East Haven and the northern area of East Haven is where\nmost of the open space in town is left. (See Map 2)\nEast Haven is in the same situation as many other communities, in that con- trolling urban sprawl is\na continuous problem. Sprawling development threatens the state's and East Haven's natural\nresources and farmland, for instance the amount of land in urban and suburban uses increased more\nthan eight (8) times faster than the population did between 1970 and 1990. That increase percentage\nis something that East Haven would like to avoid, especially in the northern area of town where the\nland there is zoned for larger lots. Any new development in the northern area must conform with\ntoday's zoning regulations and already built environment that currently exists there. Also any new\ndevelopment in the northern area of town must conform with the Town's Plan of Conservation and\nDevelopment which does promote affordable housing, however when looking at Map 2 (next page)\none will see that most of the open space left in town is in the North.\nFor any community attempting to curb urban sprawl it is a challenge, however it is a challenge that\nmost, if not all municipalities in Connecticut have to face. This plan is two fold in nature, first is the\nbeginning of East Haven's attempt to curb urban sprawl and ensure that future generations have\nopen space to enjoy and keep the character of East Haven's neighborhoods in conformity with our\ncurrent POCD. Second, and most importantly this plan is going to put land use controls on any and\n"}, {"page": "181", "text": "Page I 37-3\nall affordable housing proposals that are brought before the commission.\nOn page 41 of East Haven's POCD it states as an Open Space Goal, that the town, \"Preserve the\nremaining significant open space resources of East Haven in order to maintain the quality of life of\nthe community, preserve residential neighborhoods, protect the natural environment, prevent\nenvironmentally detrimental development, and to preserve the natural resources of the Town.\"\nEAST HAVEN\nOPEN SPACE PLAN\nU\n142\nOpen Space Plan\nOpen Space Plan\nAreas Planned for Potential Open Space Park\nRegional Water Authority\nSchools\nTown Parks (Existing)\nOther Publicly Owned Land (Existing)\nLand Trust Property\nProposed Greenway\nEastern Land Use Analysis\nCERC\nCheshire, CT\nSolutions\nMap 2: East Haven Plan of Conservation & Development, 2007, page 45\nMISSION STATEMENT\nThe Town of East Haven's Affordable Housing Plan is a document that intends to develop a course\nof action that calls for logical, reasonable strategy to create affordable housing in East Haven.

Other\ncommunities such as Cheshire or Woodbridge greatly discourage affordable housing due to their\ndemographic populations. The State of Connecticut's Conservation & Development Policies, which\nwas recently adopted, has six growth management principles and number two addresses housing,\nand it states that, \"Demographic trends indicate that Connecticut's population, along with most of\nthe nation is aging.

The prices on homes in East Haven are affordable and will continue to be\naffordable. With an average price for a home under or around 200 thousand dollars and today's low\ninterest rates, East Haven is by far the best buy for one's dollar in all of New Haven County.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\nAllow for affordable housing proposals in appropriate areas of town as long as they meet\nthe Affordable Housing's Plan\nPreserve the integrity and character of our neighborhoods\nUse the Block Grant and other funding sources to fix up existing neighborhoods\nThe zoning regulations should reflect the current pattern of development in town\nRecognize and encourage affordable housing for families and individuals who can't\ncurrently afford market rate housing\n"}, {"page": "189", "text": "Page I 37-11\nMaintain existing units in a safe, sanitary, and sound structural conditions\nEncourage and protect stable residential development of long term quality and a\nfavorable range of housing values.\nEncourage the clustering of new housing units, in appropriate locations and quantity, to\npreserve and create valuable open space, in a manner that would enhance the\nneighborhood.\nHousing development that revitalizes and strengthens the neighborhood fabric of the\ntown should be encouraged\nHigh density housing should be located in favorable locations such as town centers, along\ntransit arteries, and in proximity to services and town centers\nHigh density housing should not be built in locations not conducive to sound residential\nneighborhoods\nConclusion\nEast Haven should preserve the north area of town and not allow for high density development.\nAffordable housing, which although encouraged by the town should be proposed in areas where it\nfits in with the current zoning and neighborhoods. Allowing high density housing projects in zones\nsuch as R4 or R5 simply doesn't make sense and doesn't conform to the Town's POCD.\nAs previously stated the commission needs to protect our open space and ensure that the town\ndoesn't become an example of urban sprawl.
