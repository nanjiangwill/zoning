Purpose\nThis district encompasses the historical business center of the town. Many business\nestablishments within the district have been in operation prior to the enactment of the\nRegulations, and physical conditions exist which limit their compliance with regulatory\nrequirements and/or good planning principles. It is considered in the best economic interest\nof the Town to foster business development of both new and existing establishments in a\nplanned, integrated, and orderly manner and in such a way as to complement the historic\ncharacter and traditions of the district.\nIn the future, the Four Corners will become a center of activity in Brookfield and a\ndestination. It will be a \"downtown\" for Brookfield that is well defined visually and\naesthetically, providing a positive experience for residents and visitors, with a distinctive\nidentity that is well known throughout Brookfield and the region. Development will have\ncomplementary scale, character, and density that will contribute to a sense of both history\nand vitality. It will offer places to live, work, shop, eat, and find entertainment and cultural\nenrichment. The area will provide a diversity of services that enhance the quality of life for\nresidents and invite travelers to stop. This will be complemented by access to the Still River as\na scenic resource in the Four Corners. It will have complementary civic spaces in the form of\noutdoor parks and plazas and public community facilities. Most new development will result\nfrom infill and from reuse or redevelopment of existing sites. No new strip or large-scale\nsingle-use developments will be built.\nThe area will be easy to access and navigate by car, bicycle, transit, and on foot. There will\nbe a variety of opportunities to travel by all these means along all roads within the Four\nCorners area including walking, biking, rail, and bus along with key connections among\nthose means. Streets in the Four Corners will offer a balance among motor vehicle and\npedestrian and bicycle traffic, with an enhanced streetscape that is pedestrian friendly and\ncomplementary to the character of the area. This will be accomplished through\nimprovements such as landscaped sidewalks, aesthetic lighting, and areas to pause and\nrelax such as plazas with benches near public art and other public spaces. Traffic on Route 7\nwill flow at reasonable speeds through the area as a result of measures designed to\nencourage drivers to slow down, improve safety, and minimize any degradation of the\ncharacter of this special place.\nB. Plan of Conservation and Development\nThe Commission shall use the Plan of Conservation and Development as amended to include\nthe Four Corners Revitalization Plan, approved by the Planning Commission, Town of\nBrookfield, as a guide in reviewing all applications for design review approval within the\ndistrict. In particular, the Commission shall consider and be guided by the various aspects of\n91\nCommercial/\nSpecial\nAdministration/\nIntroduction\nDefinitions\nResidential\nStandards\nMiscellaneous\nProcedures\nIndustrial\nDistricts\nEnforcement\n"}, {"page": "93", "text": "2020-April-27\nArticle 5 - Special Districts\nthe Plan, which may identify historic sites, irreplaceable site features, wetlands, utility\nconcepts, bridges and walkways, service areas, common areas and open space, potential\nhousing sites, access drives, vehicle and pedestrian circulation patterns, and common\nparking areas in addition to other elements.\nC.

Background\nCandlewood Lake, the state's largest lake and one of its most important inland\nwater resources, has experienced a gradual deterioration of water quality since\nabout 1950. Studies of the lake shoreline development area have recommended\nplanning to avoid the need to install a public sewer system.\nBrookfield is one of five Connecticut towns that border the lake shore. The lake's\nwatershed area is 26,461 acres, and Brookfield's portion is 1,177 acres or 4 percent\nof the total. However, the watershed in Brookfield, especially the lake shore area,\nis\ngenerally intensively developed and a primary source of stormwater runoff that\ncan carry nutrients and pollutants that contribute to the eutrophication of the lake\nand deterioration of lake and groundwater quality.\nThese regulations are designed to minimize, and where possible reduce, the\nnegative impact of stormwater runoff affecting Candlewood Lake and the\nwatershed area, thereby reducing the rate of lake eutrophication and avoiding\nthe need for a public sewer system.\n2. Purpose\nThe purpose of the Candlewood Lake Watershed District is to prevent nutrient\nenrichment or contamination of Candlewood Lake and its watershed and to\navoid the need for sewers in this densely developed area of Brookfield.\nSpecifically, the purposes are:\na. To minimize the impervious surfaces and maximize infiltration of\nstormwater runoff\n115\nCommercial/\nIntroduction\nDefinitions\nSpecial\nAdministration/\nResidential\nStandards\nMiscellaneous\nProcedures\nIndustrial\nDistricts\nEnforcement\n"}, {"page": "117", "text": "2020-April-27\nArticle 5 - Special Districts\nb. To reduce peak stormwater flow and minimize the likelihood of soil\nerosion, stream channel instability, flooding, and habitat destruction\nC. To preserve and/or create vegetative buffers of native plantings to\ncontrol and filter stormwater runoff\nd. To minimize disturbance of natural grades and vegetation and utilize\nexisting topography for natural drainage systems\ne. To contain stormwater runoff on the site wherever possible to reduce\nthe volume of stormwater runoff before it reaches the groundwater or\nsurface water bodies\nf. To prevent and minimize potential groundwater pollution from improper\nwaste disposal, release of hazardous materials, and other sources\n3. Land to which these regulations apply\nThese regulations apply to all land within the boundaries of the Candlewood Lake\nwatershed as delineated on a map on file in the offices of the Commission entitled\n\"Candlewood Watershed District, Town of Brookfield.\"\n4. Compliance\nWithin Town boundaries, the Candlewood Watershed District shall be\nsuperimposed on existing zoning districts. The provisions of these regulations shall\nbe in addition to all other requirements of applicable statutes, codes, regulations,\nor ordinances. In the event of conflict between the provisions of this Regulation\nand any other Town regulation, the more restrictive requirement shall apply.\n5. Permitted Uses\nPermitted uses are all uses permitted in the underlying districts except those cited\nin Section 5.4D(2).\n6. Required Stormwater Management Plan and Data\nAll new building construction, or an addition, alteration, or enlargement that results\nin an increase in the amount of impervious surface (paved drives, walks, patios,\netc.) on a lot where the total impervious surface is ten percent or greater, shall\nrequire a Stormwater Management Plan. In addition to the data required\nelsewhere in these Regulations, the following data shall be required:\na.

Preserving existing vegetation, planting of new materials, and use of\nplanters and similar landscape devices that enhance the environmental\nquality and visual appearance of sites, buildings, and parking\nb. Providing buffers between land uses that enhance privacy and\nminimize the intrusion of light, dust, and noise\nC. Preventing the erosion of soil\nd. Improving water quality through the reduction of sedimentation and\npromotion of runoff infiltration\ne. Improving the environmental quality and aesthetic quality of the Town\nof Brookfield\n2. Applicability: These regulations shall apply to any proposed use or\ndevelopment activity that requires Site Plan or Special Permit approval.\nAdditionally, the requirements contained in Section 6.3(B) shall apply to any\napplication requiring subdivision approval. The Commission may approve\nalternate landscape treatments consistent with the purpose and intent of these\nstandards.\n3. Design Principles: to the greatest extent practicable, landscape design and\nspecific treatments shall:\na. Preserve the existing landscape in its natural state with respect to trees\nand vegetation, grade changes, and existing landscape features such as\nstone walls.\nb. Use natural, planted slopes rather than retaining walls.\nC. Retain existing healthy, mature trees and provide protection during\nconstruction.\nd. Use native species or cultivars of native species for the majority of the\nplanted area that can survive on the natural rainfall cycle and require\nminimal or no fertilizers, herbicides, or pesticides.\ne. Incorporate stormwater management systems into the overall\nlandscape plan for the site, including rain gardens, depressed planting\nislands, permeable pavers, and ponds.\n140\nCELL (1, 1): \nIntroduction\nCELL (1, 2): \nDefinitions\nCELL (1, 3): \nResidential\nCELL (1, 4): \nCommercial/\nIndustrial\nCELL (1, 5): \nSpecial\nDistricts\nCELL (1, 6): \nStandards\nCELL (1, 7): \nMiscellaneous\nCELL (1, 8): \nProcedures\nCELL (1, 9): \nAdministration/\nEnforcement\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (2, 5): \nCELL (2, 6): \nCELL (2, 7): \nCELL (2, 8): \nCELL (2, 9): \n"}, {"page": "142", "text": "2020-April-27\nArticle 6 - General Standards\n4.

Existing mature vegetation shall be maintained insofar as practical\nand may be credited toward meeting landscape requirements with the\napproval of the Board or Commission.\n2. Where existing large trees have been removed prior to the submission of an\napplication, the installation of additional landscape materials to preplace the\nremoved trees may be required. The number, size, quality of the vegetation,\namount of lost shade, and similar factors shall be considered when determining\nthe amount of additional landscape materials to be installed.\n3. Steep Slopes\na. Any slope in excess of 20 percent (1:5) shall be considered a steep\nslope.\nb. Steep slopes and other areas subject to erosion shall require\nimprovements and appropriate landscape treatments to ensure the\nstability of soils and viability of planted materials. Steep slopes shall be\nplanted with shrubbery or ground cover. Riprap and other nonvegetative\nmaterial may be allowed at the Commission's discretion.\nC. No slope extending over 100 feet in length measured in any direction\nacross the contours of a lot may be created with a grade that exceeds 33\npercent on average. All site plans shall identify any existing slopes that\nexceed this criteria.\n4. A variety of plant species shall be integrated into a landscaping plan, and the\nuse of monocultures shall be avoided.\n5. The use of invasive plant species, as identified by the Connecticut Invasive\nPlant Council, is prohibited (see https://cipwg.uconn.edu).\n6.

Purpose and Intent\nIt is the purpose of this section to provide general guidelines on the design of\nbuildings and structures with the objective of promoting development projects\nthat preserve and improve the appearance, beauty and character of the\ncommunity.\nIt is the goal of the Commission to foster economic development by\nencouraging the harmonization of design and appearance across Brookfield's\ncommercial districts and to create welcoming and attractive gateways to the\nTown Center District.\nIt is also the goal of the Commission to minimize the impacts of the Town's\ncommercial uses on adjoining residential areas; thereby protecting the property\nvalues of both adjoining commercial properties as well as adjoining residential\nzones.\nB. Background\nDuring the preparation of the Plan of Conservation and Development in 2000,\nsurveys and considerable public comment indicated a high degree of\ndissatisfaction with the physical appearance of many structures within the Town's\nCommercial and Industrial zoning districts. The public consensus was that\nbuilding design should follow traditional New England architectural design and\nstyle concepts, and that modern, monolithic structures were not compatible with\nthe desire for more historic architectural themes. This consensus was reaffirmed\nin subsequent plans, studies, including the Four Corners Revitalization Plan\nprepared in 2012, the establishment of the Brookfield Design Review Team in\n2013, and the 2015 update of the Plan of Conservation and Development. This\nconsensus is consistent with the stated zoning purpose of protecting and\nconserving the character of the town.\nC. Applicability and Procedure\nAny Site Plan or Special Permit application for a non-residential or mixed-use\nstructure proposed in any zoning district shall conform to the architectural\nguidelines set forth in Section 6.11 (D - F) below, except if such use is proposed\nwithin the Town Center District. Uses or structures proposed in the Town Center\nDistrict shall instead conform to the standards, guidelines, and procedures of the\nTCD Design Guideline, presented in Appendix 2 of these Regulations.\n1.
