The intent of the AVC Zone regulations is to\nencourage cohesive mixed use developments with a balance of uses designed in a\nwalkable, village center style. As such, any AVC Zone should be developed in a\nbalanced manner throughout its development phasing cycle.\nThe phasing plan for any MUDP must take into account the need for a balanced approach\nfor the development of individual uses. It is the Town's intention and desire that any MUDP\nmust be composed of a mix of land uses during all phases of its development, not just as\nan end product. Therefore, the following sequence of requirements for pro rating the\ndevelopment of specific uses shall apply to all MUDPs:\nZoning certification for up to but not exceeding 25 percent of the residential units\nproposed in a MUDP may be issued only if 20 percent of the total non-residential\ngross floor area proposed in the MUDP has also received zoning certification.\nZoning certification for up to but not exceeding 50 percent of the residential units\nproposed in a MUDP may be issued only if 40 percent of the total non-residential\ngross floor area proposed in the MUDP has also received zoning certification.\nZoning certification for up to but not exceeding 50 percent of the residential units\nproposed in a MUDP may be issued only if all of the parks, recreation and open\nspace elements proposed in the MUDP also have been constructed and, when\nrequired, conveyed to the Town of Avon.\nZoning certification for the full number of residential units proposed in an MUDP\nmay be issued only if 60 percent of the total nonresidential gross floor area\nproposed in the MUDP has also received zoning certification.\nThe Commission, in its discretion, may modify these percentage requirements by up to ten\npercentage points if the applicant can demonstrated, and the Commission determines, that\ndoing so would still enable the proposed development to meet the purpose and intent of\nthe AVC Zone and would result in a development that is generally consistent with the Town\nof Avon's Plan of Conservation and Development. It shall be the responsibility of the\napplicant to notify any future purchasers of property within the MUDP of these conditions.\n4)\nDevelopment phasing-Infrastructure Given the intended unified nature of\ndevelopment within an MUDP, the construction phasing for infrastructure components\nthat effectively link individual ACDDs together to form a complete MUDP is a critical\nelement in the MUDP development process. Therefore, all MUDP applications must\ninclude a descriptive narrative and associated graphic illustration of the proposed\nphasing of infrastructure components. The Commission shall have the ability to modify\nthe proposed infrastructure phasing plan, in its sole discretion, as a condition of\napproval of the MUDP.\n5)\nParking-Modified standards. In general, the standards for the required number of\nparking spaces for each land use as established under Section VII.B. of these Zoning\nRegulations shall apply in the Avon Village Center Zone. However, it is recognized that\nthe Avon Village Center Zone encompasses a unique area of the Town that is\nenvisioned as mixed use development, many of which uses may have shared and\ncomplementary off-street parking needs. Therefore, in cases where the required\nnumber of parking spaces for a particular land use under Section VII.B. is greater than\nan applicable standard for the number of parking spaces required for such use\naccording to data from the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) or the Urban Land\nInstitute (ULI), the Commission in its sole discretion may allow the use of the lesser\nparking space requirement standard. The applicant must provide sufficient evidence\n"}, {"page": "64", "text": "indicating that such parking reduction will neither create a shortage of parking spaces\nnor create ancillary negative traffic circulation impacts.\n6)\nAggregate development. Total aggregate development within the AVC Zone shall\nadhere generally to the following guidelines:\na.\nThe total residential development component within the AVC shall be composed\nof approximately 400 to 500 dwelling units for the entire mixed use development,\nof which no less than ten percent shall be situated in mixed use structures. All\ndwelling units generally shall have two bedrooms or fewer.\nb.\nThe total nonresidential development component within the AVC shall be\ncomposed of approximately 500,000 to 600,000 square feet of gross floor area.\n7)\nCul-de-sacs and dead end streets. Streets shall be laid out in a manner that promotes\nsafe and logical traffic circulation. Unless specifically approved by the Commission, the\nuse of cul-de-sacs and other types of dead end streets should be avoided in all ACDDs\nthat have any nonresidential land uses. Within ACDDs consisting entirely of residential\nuses, cul-de-sacs and other types of dead end streets may be permitted at the\nCommission's discretion.\n8)\nEarth removal and filling. In general, all earth removal, grading and filling activities shall\nbe conducted in a manner such that these activities will result in no net change in the\namount of earth material brought into or removed from within the MUDP. Within each\nindividual ACDD, the applicant shall demonstrate a balance of cuts and fills, unless\nwaived by the Commission. At the Commission's discretion, removal of earth material\nfrom the MUDP may be permitted if it can be demonstrated by the applicant that doing\nso would produce a better overall development design.\n9)\nUtilities. All utility lines serving new construction shall be buried underground in any\nMUDP.\nj.\nDesign guidelines.\n1)\nIntroduction. The AVC Zone is intended to implement the policies, goals and urban\ndesign principles articulated in official Town documents, calling for preservation and\ndevelopment of a mixed use and pedestrian-friendly \"Main Street\" character for the\nAvon Village Center, including the development of new structures and uses with\nappropriate architectural designs and the conservation and enhancement of the\ncharacter of existing buildings, sites, streetscapes and pedestrian environments. This\nis accomplished through compliance with the following design and use standards that\napply to new and existing architectural facades, sites and buildings, applied under the\nreview procedures of this district. These design guidelines are intended to preserve,\nrestore and enhance resources, improve property values, promote and support a\nvibrant business and residential environment, and enhance the architectural character\nand attractiveness of the village center.\nThese design guidelines are intended to be implemented through the Avon Village\nCenter Zone regulations. They are intended to be used during review of projects\nproposed within the approved redevelopment areas. These guidelines were created to\nassist both the Commission and the project proponents with direction to maintain the\nquality of character in Avon's village center.\n2)\nContext. The Avon Village Center Zone is a subset of the larger Town Center of Avon,\nwhich includes architecture representative of a mix of periods and design styles. This\nvariation contributes to the unique character of Avon's Village Center. These design\nguidelines seek to emulate the many positive elements of Avon's existing town center\narchitectural landscape.\nNotable village center buildings from historic periods are the complex of buildings\nassociated with Ensign Bickford and the stores and offices situated on the north side\n"}, {"page": "65", "text": "of West Main Street between Ensign Drive and Woodford Avenue. While these\nbuildings may not be assumed as models for improvements in village center buildings\nand properties, the unique design and construction of these buildings could be used\nas a comparison for new construction.\nNotable contemporary buildings are also present in the Village Center area. While\nthese buildings do not conform to older historic character, they define some of the\nmore recent periods of architecture, and must be considered as to what contributions\nthey may provide to the overall uniqueness and character of the Avon Village Center.\nHowever, changes in the buildings have not all contributed to the aesthetics of the\narchitecture or the character of Avon's Village Center. Many of the single-story\ncommercial buildings in the surrounding area are examples of contemporary\ncommercial buildings which are effectively only distinguishable by their tenant\nsignage.\n3)\nPrinciples of Village Center design. These design guidelines are meant to apply to the\n\"public realm;\" those building facades and spaces that are subject to public view from\npublic areas and in public use. Interior spaces and building code compliance are not\nthe subject of these guidelines but may be considerations under these design\nstandards.\nOverall principles include:\nSupport the village center redevelopment with projects that support multiple modes\nof accessibility and transit.\nSupport village center vitality with uses and spaces that contribute to the\ncommercial and entertainment aspects of the village center and promote\nattractiveness for visitors and patrons of the area.\nReinforce the village center as a civic place with spaces for small public gatherings\nand discourse.\nUse examples of existing architecture and design in the AVC as models for\nrenovation and new design.\nk.\nMUDP dimensional requirements.\n1)\nMinimum lot size for each ACDD: Five acres, unless waived by the Commission. In\norder for an applicant to receive a waiver of this requirement, the applicant must\ndemonstrate, and the Commission must make a determination, that there are unique\ncharacteristics of the subject area (such as physical characteristics of the land, unique\nrelationship to the balance of the MUDP, or other special circumstances) that warrant\na waiver of the minimum lot size requirements and that providing a waiver would\nproduce a better overall development design.\n2) Maximum building height: To be determine by the Commission, but in no case higher\nthan 40 feet as measured according to the definition of \"building height\" in Section Il of\nthese regulations.\n3)\nMaximum overall MUDP impervious surface coverage: 50 percent\n4)\nMaximum overall MUDP building coverage: 30 percent\n5)\nMinimum overall MUDP usable open space: 15 percent\n6)\nSetbacks for MUDP perimeter>\nGeneral setback requirement: Minimum of 20 feet, maximum of 40 feet, unless\nwaived by the Commission.\n"}, {"page": "66", "text": "Setback for MUDP boundaries adjacent to or across a public right-of-way from a\nresidential use or residential zone: Minimum of 35 feet, maximum of 60 feet and\nlandscaped and design in accordance with the \"B Bufferyard\" standards under\nSection VII.A. of these regulations.\nI.\nPerformance standards.\nCELL (1, 1): \n1)\nCELL (1, 2): \nUsable open space.

Additionally, the\nCommission may regulate the location, and require the relocation, of proposed buildings to\nreduce visual impact. Whenever possible, development and clear-cutting within 75 feet of\nany ridgeline, as defined in these Ridgeline Protection Overlay Zone Regulations, shall be\navoided. The Commission may also require the installation of flags, balloons, or other on-\nsite markers prior to a decision on any application in order to allow evaluation of visual\nimpacts as seen from various vantage points.\nb.\nThat the viability of the area as a wildlife resource (habitat, breeding ground, foraging area,\nmigratory pathway, etc.) is protected. Steps to protect these areas may include but are not\nlimited to restricting the size of lawn areas or other clearings; restricting clear-cutting to\ncertain seasons of the year or to certain areas, patterns, methods of removal; or applying\nother restrictions that it deems necessary to minimize the impact on wildlife and wildlife\nhabitats. The Commission may require an analysis of the potential impacts of the proposed\nactivity on wildlife, such analysis to be prepared by a qualified biologist.\nC.\nThat the groundwater quality and recharge potential of the area is preserved. The\nCommission may require an analysis of the possible impacts of the proposed activity on\ngroundwater quality and recharge. In order to minimize such impacts, the Commission may\nrequire restrictions on the size or location of septic systems; the use of biofilters, detention\nponds, retention ponds, and other methods of stormwater management that protect surface\nand subsurface waters; the regulation of the storage, handling or usage of hazardous\nmaterials or waste, including but not limited to fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides; and any\nother restrictions or limitations which the Commission may reasonably deem appropriate.\nd.\nThat areas of archaeological and historic importance have been identified and adequate\nsteps have been taken to preserve and/or record these areas.\ne.\nThat the stability of the ridgeline is protected and that erosion potential is kept to a minimum\nby minimizing changes to the existing topography, preserving existing vegetation, requiring\nthe revegetation of disturbed areas, and requiring the installation and maintenance of\nsedimentation and erosion control structures as needed. Steps to protect the stability of the\nridgeline may include but are not limited to requiring retaining walls or other methods to\nminimize the cutting and filling of slopes; requiring reforestation or landscaping of quarries\nupon reaching finished grade or of other areas disturbed by development or clear-cutting;\nand requiring that driveways, roads, and other improvements requiring grading shall be\napproximately parallel to existing contours.\n6.\nSite plan requirements.

The purpose of this section is to establish a regulation to enable the transfer of\ndevelopment rights in areas identified by the Commission as having a high priority for preservation\n(sending areas) to areas identified by the Commission as being appropriate for multi-family\ndevelopment (receiving areas). These areas are identified on the official Zoning Map and shall\nconstitute overlay zones. The goal of this regulation is to preserve valuable natural resources and\nopen spaces while directing development to the appropriate locations.\n2.\nTransfer of Development Rights. Land owners in the receiving overlay zone may purchase\ndevelopment rights from land owners in the sending overlay zone. These development rights may\nthen be transferred to the receiving area such that housing density may be increased. An\napplicant must accurately define the sending area by preparing a survey drawing meeting the\nrequirements of a Class A-2 survey. A special exception application shall be filed with the\nCommission. An applicant must demonstrate that all special exception criteria contained\nin\nSection VIII of these regulations, as well as those contained in Item #5 of this section have been\n"}, {"page": "108", "text": "satisfied.
