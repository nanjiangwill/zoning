The appearance of a\nsingle property also has a cumulative effect which can enhance or diminish the beauty of the entire\nTown, and consequently the values of property elsewhere within the Town.\nORGANIZATION\nThis\nset of Regulations has been organized around four main thematic elements. Understanding this\norganization will help the user quickly locate the regulatory provisions they seek.\nPHILOSOPHY\nThese Regulations are intended to be a dynamic document, not a static document. It is anticipated that\nthese Regulations will be regularly reviewed and updated, as necessary, to anticipate and reflect the ever\nchanging needs of the community and to guide land use activities in Bethel in ways that will continue to\nmaintain and enhance community character and protect the public health, safety, and welfare.\ni\nCELL (1, 1): \nTheme\nCELL (1, 2): \nArticles\nCELL (1, 3): \nDescription\nCELL (2, 1): \nRegulatory\nBasics\nCELL (2, 2): \nIntroduction\nDefinitions\nCELL (2, 3): \nBackground information and how the\nregulations will be used and interpreted\nCELL (3, 1): \nZones and\nUses\nCELL (3, 2): \nResidential Zones\nBusiness / Industry Zones\nSpecial Zones\nCELL (3, 3): \nInformation about the various zoning districts\nand the standards that apply within them\nCELL (4, 1): \nStandards\nCELL (4, 2): \nBasic Standards\nSpecial Provisions\nCELL (4, 3): \nRequirements for landscaping, signage,\nparking, and other activities\nCELL (5, 1): \nAdministration\nCELL (5, 2): \nProcedures\nAdministration\nCELL (5, 3): \nHow applications will be processed and the\nregulations will be administered\n"}, {"page": "3", "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\nii\nCELL (1, 1): \nARTICLE 1\nCELL (1, 2): \nINTRODUCTION\n1\nCELL (2, 1): \nSection 1.1.\nCELL (2, 2): \nAuthority\n1\nCELL (3, 1): \nSection 1.2.\nCELL (3, 2): \nPurposes\n1\nCELL (4, 1): \nSection 1.3.\nCELL (4, 2): \nZoning Districts\n2\nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nA.

Finding of Fact\nThe flood hazard areas of Bethel are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and\nproperty, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary\npublic expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which\nadversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.\nThese flood loses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the floodplains causing\nincreases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood areas by uses vulnerable to\nfloods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise\nunprotected from flood damage. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains can adversely\naffect the community.\nThe Town of Bethel has voluntarily participated in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) since\nApril 23, 1984. The NFIP is founded on a mutual agreement between the federal government and\neach participating community. Local, state and federal governments must share roles and\nresponsibilities to meet the goals and objectives of the NFIP. The community's role is of paramount\nimportance. Property owners are able to receive federally subsidized insurance only of the community\nenacts and enforces the minimum floodplain regulations for participation in the NFIP.\nD. Objectives\nIn order to accomplish its purposes, this regulation includes methods and provisions for:\n1. Restricting or prohibiting which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or\nerosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.\n2. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be\nprotected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.\n3. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective\nbarriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters.\n4. Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage.\n5. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert\nfloodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other areas.\nE.

Purpose and Intent\n1.\nThe intent of this section is to regulate uses which, because of their very nature, are recognized\nas having potentially serious objectionable characteristics, particularly when several of them are\nconcentrated and thus have deleterious effect upon adjacent areas. Special regulation of adult-\norientated businesses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not result in the\nblighting or downgrading of the neighborhood.\n2. Statistics and studies performed by a substantial number of cities and Towns in the United States\nindicate that:\na. Large numbers of persons, primarily male, frequent such adult-orientated establishments,\nespecially those which provide closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms for the private\nviewing of so-called adult motion pictures and/or video tapes and/or live entertainment; and\nb.\nPersons under the age of 18 may be attracted to adult-orientated establishments and seek to\nenter or loiter about them without the knowledge or permission of their parents and\nguardians; and\nC.
