The original New England villages were usually clustered around\na village green. Today, these 17th and 18th century village homes are highly sought after not\nonly for their antiquity; but also of the amenities that their location affords. The common\nopen space is still the hub of recreational activity, local markets and service stores are usually\nwithin walking distance, and there is generally access to public transportation and/or main\narterials. In more recent decades, communities have experienced suburban and urban sprawl,\nperpetuated primarily by the cookie cutter approach to subdivision development and the\npersonal mobility which the automobile affords. Sprawl has proven to be costly to the\ncommunity, the land developer, and the prospective home buyer.
