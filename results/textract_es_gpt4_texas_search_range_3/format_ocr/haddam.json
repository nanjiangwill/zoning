Purpose\nThe Commission finds that certain parcels of land, because of their unique\nphysical characteristics, may benefit from additional flexibility in the design\nof subdivisions. Such benefits may include: improved living and working\nenvironments; more economical subdivision layouts; greater ingenuity and\noriginality in total subdivision and individual site design; and, especially, the\npreservation of valuable open space to serve recreational, scenic, and other\npublic purposes. The Commission also finds that, in order to achieve these\nbenefits, it will sometimes be necessary to permit modifications of the\nminimum lot area, frontage, width, and yards, and the maximum building\nheight and percentage of allowable land coverage. These Conservation\nSubdivision Regulations are therefore intended to provide a mechanism to\npermit such modifications, while, at the same time, assuring (1) adequate\nmaintenance and restricted use of open space areas for maximum public\nbenefit; (2) adequate protection of the neighborhood; and (3) the conservation\nof natural resources and of Haddam's rural character.\n4A.2.
