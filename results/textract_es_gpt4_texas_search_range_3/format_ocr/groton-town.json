Considerations for Approval of Special Permit and Site/Grading Plan. All applications for a\nspecial permit to fill or remove earth products shall be accompanied by a grading plan. In reviewing\nall plans, the PZC will take into consideration the Special Permit Criteria of Section 9.4, and the\nfollowing specific considerations. The PZC will consider the location, intensity, and type of operation\ncontemplated and may impose conditions with regard to safety of operations and damage to adjacent\nlands or improvements, including the application of the following appropriate performance standards:\na. Filling with and/or removing earth products is restricted to areas which have access to roads of\nsufficient width and capacity to carry maximum projected loads.\nb. The grading and site plan must demonstrate compliance with Section 7.1 for Erosion Control and\nSection 7.3 for Stormwater.\nC. Locations should be avoided where it is anticipated that the activity may cause slides, sinking,\ncollapse of supporting soil, erosion, water pollution, or undue alteration of the water table of\nadjoining properties. Specifically, no bank must exceed a slope of one foot of vertical rise in two\nfeet of horizontal distance, except in ledge rock. No removal must take place within 25 feet of\na property line, except that where the grade from a property line raises towards the lot where\nremoval is to take place, material lying above the grade at the property line may be removed.\nd.\nProper measures must be taken to minimize the nuisance of noise, flying dust or rock, and unsightly\nor dangerous conditions. Such measures may include, when considered necessary, limitations on\nthe time of operation and upon the practice of stockpiling excavated materials or fill upon the site.\nThe PZC may impose additional buffering requirements beyond what is required in Section 8.1 to\naddress compatibility issues with adjacent properties.\ne.\nFilling and/or removing activities will also be reviewed with concern for the condition in which the\nsite will be left after completion of the operation and the relationship of that site to existing and\npermitted development in the general area in which the site is located. As part of the grading plan,\nthe applicant must submit a restoration plan to the PZC showing final grading and landscaping and\nwhatever other information is necessary to indicate how the site will be restored to permit future\ndevelopment of the site.\nf.\nIn reviewing the grading plan, the PZC will evaluate the extent to which the site can and reliably\nwill be restored to a condition that will facilitate, and not impede, the appropriate development\nof its general area. For this purpose, the PZC may specify such topographic and landscaping and\nother conditions and require surety bonds as in its judgment are warranted by the circumstances\nof each case.\ng. The PZC may condition the Special Permit for the period of time during the year when the specific\nactivities on the site can take place and may limit the special permit to a certain amount of total\ntime for the filling and removal activity on a site.\n5-12\nTown of GROTON, CT Zoning Regulations\n"}, {"page": "119", "text": "5.1-2.F\nKennel, Commercial/Animal Day Care and Riding or Boarding\nStable\nConditions and Special Permit apply in the following zoning districts: RU, IM, IG\nCommercial kennels/animal daycare, riding stables, and boarding stables are permitted uses subject to\napproval of a special permit and the following conditions:\n1.

These special regulations are designed to: a) prevent or minimize\nloss of life, injuries, property damage, and other losses, both private and public; b) promote the health, public\nsafety and general welfare of the people; and c) help control and minimize the extent of floods and reduce the\ndepth and violence of flooding. The provisions of this section shall apply in any zoning district which is located\nwithin a flood hazard area, floodway, or coastal high hazard zone. Permitted uses are allowed, provided they\nmeet the following additional requirements, and/or those of the Connecticut State Building Code dealing with\nconstruction in floodplains and coastal high hazard areas, whichever is more restrictive.\nThis regulation is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed\nrestrictions. However, where this regulation and another ordinance, regulation, easement, covenant or deed\nrestriction conflict or overlap, the more stringent shall prevail.\nThe degree of flood protection required by this regulation is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory\npurposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration and research. Larger floods can and will\noccur on rare occasion. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This regulation does\nnot imply or guarantee that land outside the special flood hazard area or uses permitted in such areas will be\nfree from flooding or flood damages. This regulation shall not create liability on the part of the Town of Groton\nor by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this regulation or\nany administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

The SFHA includes any area shown on the FIRM as Zones A, AE, AO, AH, Coastal AE and VE, including\nareas designated as a floodway on a FIRM. Zones VE and Coastal AE are also identified as a coastal high hazard\narea. Areas of special flood hazard are determined utilizing the base flood elevations (BFE) provided on the\nflood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for a community.

These impacts are largely a function of\naltering the natural hydrology at a site and increasing exposure to poten-\ntial pollutants. Common stormwater impacts related to land development\nNo single stormwater treat-\ninclude degraded water quality, increased peak flow rates, increased runoff\nvolume, stream channel erosion, and reduced groundwater recharge.\nment practice is appropriate\nAs discussed in Chapter Seven, stormwater treatment practices can\nfor every site and condition.\nachieve one or more of the following management objectives:\nThe applicability of individual\npractices varies depending\nPollutant reduction\nupon relatively simple\nGroundwater recharge and runoff volume reduction\nphysical constraints, as well\nStream channel protection and peak flow control\nas more complicated siting\nand treatment issues. This\nTable 8-1 summarizes the relative effectiveness of each stormwater treat-\nchapter addresses criteria\nment practice in providing these management capabilities. The\nto consider when selecting\neffectiveness ratings provided in the table should only be used to compare\nstormwater treatment\nthe relative management capabilities of different treatment practices. The\npractices for a particular site.\nratings should not be used in an absolute sense to quantitatively predict\nactual field performance.\nAs described in Chapter Six, there is currently a lack of reliable per-\nformance data for stormwater treatment practices in the State of\nConnecticut. Additionally, the available performance data from past moni-\ntoring studies conducted throughout the United States are limited by\ndifferences in design, performance goals, site parameters, storm events,\nflow and pollutant loadings, seasonal variations, monitoring methods, and\nefficiency calculation methods or simply by the lack of, or inadequate,\ninformation. The reliability of pollutant removal efficiencies, which are\noften cited in guidance documents, is typically poor due to the large\ndegree of uncertainty in the data. Additional performance monitoring using\nstandardized methods and quality control procedures is recommended for\nnew and existing stormwater treatment practices (see Chapter Six) in\nConnecticut to provide a more useful set of data on the effectiveness of\nindividual stormwater treatment practices, and to better understand the\nrelationship between treatment practice design and performance.\nAs shown in Table 8-1, most of these primary treatment practices are\nsimilarly effective at removing sediment, nutrients, and metals. Removal\nefficiencies are generally highest for sediment, while nutrient and metals\nremoval efficiencies are typically lower. Infiltration systems are generally\nthe most effective practices for removal of bacteria. Designs that incorpo-\nrate floatable controls or pretreatment are most effective for removal of\nhydrocarbons. Treatment practices that incorporate biological removal\nmechanisms, such as constructed wetlands, are also more effective in\nremoving pollutants than systems that strictly rely on gravity or physical\nseparation of particles.\nMany of these practices also have limited effectiveness in terms of\npeak flow control and groundwater recharge. Open bottom basins and dry\nswales provide some groundwater recharge, but only practices specifically\ndesigned as infiltration structures will provide significant levels of ground-\nwater recharge. Many of these practices either have an impermeable\nbottom or are designed to intercept groundwater and thereby provide lit-\ntle infiltration. Similarly, attenuation of peak flows requires significant\navailable storage capacity to temporarily store runoff as the peak flow is\nbeing throttled. Many stormwater treatment practices provide limited stor-\nage capacity or detention time and are inadequate as stand-alone flood\n8-2\n2004 Connecticut Stormwater Quality Manual\n"}, {"page": "307", "text": "Source: Adapted from Winer, 2000; EPA 1993; and ASCE and Wright Water Engineers, Inc., 2001.\ncontrol facilities.

The purpose\nof these guidelines is to describe design principles that, when applied, help contribute to the quality of the\npublic realm, creating the \"sense of place\" that is the difference between communities that thrive and those\nthat do not.\nThese guidelines are supplementary to design standards provided in the Town's Zoning Regulations, which\napply to the Mixed Use Town Center (MTC). Where the design standards included in the body of the Zoning\nRegulations are firm and require compliance, the guidelines herein are meant to be more instructive. The\nguidelines communicate the intent of what the Town calls for in its Plan of Conservation and Development\n(POCD) and other more targeted plans that examined individual village areas. Images are used to help clarify\nthe design language and overall vision for each village and, in some cases, clarify how different choices\nare appropriate for different village areas. These guidelines will help developers and the Town discuss the\ncharacter of each village and how existing conditions do or do not inform applications for development.\nOverarching principles related to village development in Groton include:\n1.\nA Vibrant Public Realm - \"Public realm\" is a term of art in urban/village planning that is used to\ndiscuss any area where people have the opportunity to mingle, gather, and visually experience their\nsurroundings. The term often refers to the street right-of-way, park areas, sidewalks, bike paths, plazas,\nand similar features. Any of these areas may be publicly or privately owned. In Groton's mixed use\nareas, great care will be taken to provide a public realm that works as a connected system of accessible\nand attractive spaces that will foster positive interaction between residents, visitors, and businesses.\nAll projects will contain a vibrant public realm or create ways to connect and be a part of a larger public\nrealm.\n2. Environmental Best Practices - The days when urban development was incompatible with achieving\nenvironmental objectives are in the past. The Town of Groton envisions town center mixed use at various\nscales that incorporates state-of-the-art \"best practices\" in the areas of construction management,\nstormwater management, waste management, and landscaping.\n3. A Mix of Uses and Densities - The Town recognizes that market demand will play an important role\nin determining the types of uses and densities that are built in mixed use districts. The Town also\nacknowledges that the most economically resilient mixed use centers are those that foster a diverse mix\nof commercial uses that can respond to market trends and innovations over time. Similarly, housing shall\nbe provided within mixed use districts and should provide options for individuals and households at all\nlevels of abilities, incomes, and preferences.\n4.\nPedestrians First - The Town understands that accommodations for automobiles within mixed use\nareas are essential to their success. However, the Town also recognizes that the most successful and\nmemorable mixed use centers are those where pedestrians feel safe and welcome. Circulation along\nRoute 1 as well as within newly developed or redeveloped mixed use areas in Groton shall be designed\nwith the highest priority placed on developing a safe, attractive, accessible, and intuitive pedestrian\nnetwork. The use of bicycles as an alternative form of transportation shall be incorporated into all\ndevelopment proposals.\n5.\nQuality Architecture - Buildings and signs will be designed in a manner that conveys high quality design\nand a thoughtful approach to developing a sense of place within mixed use areas. Traditional building\nforms, high quality building materials, and attention to detail will be apparent and integral to the design\nprocess.\nMixed-Use Town Center\nPage 3\n"}, {"page": "336", "text": "DESIGN GUIDELINES FORMAT\nThe majority of the design guidelines follow the general format illustrated below:\nDesign Element\nBeing Addressed\nImportance of\nConsidering\nLIGHTING\nParticular Design\nSTREET LIGHTING IS A KEY\nElement\nCOMPONENT TO THE MAKING\nOF A PLACE\nStreet lighting has a strong effect\non the character of a place.

The purpose\nof these guidelines is to describe design principles that, when applied, help contribute to the quality of the\npublic realm, creating the \"sense of place\" that is the difference between communities that thrive and those\nthat do not.\nThese guidelines are supplementary to design standards provided in the Town's Zoning Regulations, which\napply to the Mixed Use Village Center (MVC). Where the design standards included in the body of the Zoning\nRegulations are firm and require compliance, the guidelines herein are meant to be more instructive. The\nguidelines communicate the intent of what the Town calls for in its Plan of Conservation and Development\n(POCD) and other more targeted plans that examined individual village areas. Images are used to help clarify\nthe design language and overall vision for each village and, in some cases, clarify how different choices\nare appropriate for different village areas. These guidelines will help developers and the Town discuss the\ncharacter of each village and how existing conditions do or do not inform applications for development.\nOverarching principles related to village development in Groton include:\n1. A Vibrant Public Realm - \"Public realm\" is a term of art in urban/village planning that is used to\ndiscuss any area where people have the opportunity to mingle, gather, and visually experience their\nsurroundings. The term often refers to the street right-of-way, park areas, sidewalks, bike paths, plazas,\nand similar features. Any of these areas may be publicly or privately owned. In Groton's mixed use\nareas, great care will be taken to provide a public realm that works as a connected system of accessible\nand attractive spaces that will foster positive interaction between residents, visitors, and businesses.\nAll projects will contain a vibrant public realm or create ways to connect and be a part of a larger public\nrealm.\n2.\nEnvironmental Best Practices - The days when urban development was incompatible with achieving\nenvironmental objectives are in the past. The Town of Groton envisions village mixed use at various\nscales that incorporates state-of-the-art \"best practices\" in the areas of construction management,\nstormwater management, waste management, and landscaping.\n3. A Mix of Uses and Densities - The Town recognizes that market demand will play an important role\nin determining the types of uses and densities that are built in mixed use districts. The Town also\nacknowledges that the most economically resilient mixed use centers are those that foster a diverse mix\nof commercial uses that can respond to market trends and innovations over time. Similarly, housing shall\nbe provided within mixed use districts and should provide options for individuals and households at all\nlevels of abilities, incomes, and preferences.\n4. Pedestrians First - The Town understands that accommodations for automobiles within mixed use\nareas are essential to their success. However, the Town also recognizes that the most successful and\nmemorable mixed use centers are those where pedestrians feel safe and welcome. Circulation within\nnewly developed or redeveloped mixed use areas in Groton shall be designed with the highest priority\nplaced on developing a safe, attractive, accessible, and intuitive pedestrian network. The use of bicycles\nas an alternative form of transportation shall be incorporated into all development proposals.\n5. Quality Architecture - Buildings and signs will be designed in a manner that conveys high quality design\nand a thoughtful approach to developing a sense of place within mixed use areas. Traditional building\nforms, high quality building materials, and attention to detail will be apparent and integral to the design\nprocess.\nDesign Guidelines for the Mixed-Use Village Center\nPage 3\n"}, {"page": "363", "text": "VILLAGE AREA\nPage 4\nDesign Guidelines for the Mixed-Use Village Center\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \nThe\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (4, 1): \nPoquonnock Road\nCELL (4, 2): \n"}, {"page": "364", "text": "VILLAGE AREA\nThis diagram is intended to highlight those areas for which these design guidelines will apply.

General:\nAll exterior lights and sign illumination should be designed, located, installed, and directed in such a manner\nas to:\n1. Prevent direct glare or light trespass on adjacent property;\n2. Employ soft, transitional light levels which are consistent from area to area;\n3. Minimize contrast between light sources on the site, lit areas, and dark surroundings; and\n4. Be confined within the target area.\n2. Light Poles:\nFoundations for light poles should not exceed twelve inches above the average surrounding grade and should\nbe located and designed to avoid potential contact with vehicles.\n3. Mounting/Tilting of Lights:\nThe effectiveness of full cut-off or fully shielded/recessed lighting should not be defeated by mounting or\ntilting the bottom of the luminaires at an angle above the horizontal plane.\n4. Flag Pole Lighting:\nLighting designed to highlight flagpoles should be targeted directly at the flag.\n5. Non-Essential Lighting:\nAll non-essential lighting (such as display, aesthetic, parking, and sign lighting) should be configured for\n\"photocell on - time clock off\" operation and turned off generally after business hours, leaving only the\nlighting or reduced lighting levels necessary for site security. Where necessary, lighting for site security may\nbe configured for motion or infrared sensor operation.\n6. Horizontal Illuminance:\nTo provide uniform site lighting in vehicle and pedestrian areas that improves visibility and safety and\nmaintain minimum levels of light and appropriate average levels of light in these areas the site should be\ndesigned to \"maintain horizontal illuminance recommendations\" set by IESNA in accordance with Table\n1. The Zoning Official can make the determination of a lighting zone for a site or an adjacent site where\nit cannot be clearly determined. The lighting zone of an adjacent vacant site should be designated in\naccordance with the likeliest use in the underlying land use zone given the current or proposed use of the\nsite being developed or modified.\nThe horizontal illuminance recommendations in Table 1 are measured in footcandles on the ground. These\nare guidelines and it is noted that light levels can be affected by many variables on the site and moderate\ndeviations from the table in a photometric plan is expected, while wholesale deviations in orders of\nmagnitude should not be proposed.\nTown of GROTON, CT Zoning Regulations\nU\n114\n"}, {"page": "396", "text": "Table 1: Horizontal Illuminance\nSource: Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA)\nAve.: Footcandles over the illuminated surface\nMin.: Minimum footcandles anywhere within the illuminated surface\nU-Ratio: Uniformity ratio or the ratio of average footcandles to minimum footcandles\n115\nTown of GROTON, CT Zoning Regulations\nCELL (1, 1): \nLevels of Activity (Examples)\nCELL (1, 2): \nMaintained Horizontal Illuminance (footcandles)\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nMaintained Horizontal Illuminance (footcandles)\nCELL (1, 5): \nMaintained Horizontal Illuminance (footcandles)\nCELL (1, 6): \nMaintained Horizontal Illuminance (footcandles)\nCELL (1, 7): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nGeneral Parking and/or\nPedestrian Use Areas\nCELL (2, 3): \nGeneral Parking and/or\nPedestrian Use Areas\nCELL (2, 4): \nGeneral Parking and/or\nPedestrian Use Areas\nCELL (2, 5): \nVehicle Use Area Only\nCELL (2, 6): \nVehicle Use Area Only\nCELL (2, 7): \nVehicle Use Area Only\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nAve.\nCELL (3, 3): \nMin.\nCELL (3, 4): \nU-Ratio\nCELL (3, 5): \nAve.\nCELL (3, 6): \nMin.\nCELL (3, 7): \nU-Ratio\nCELL (4, 1): \nLighting Zone 4\nMajor Cultural, Civic, or Sports Facility\nRegional Shopping Center\nFast Food Restaurant\nCELL (4, 2): \n3.6\nCELL (4, 3): \n0.9\nCELL (4, 4): \n4:1\nCELL (4, 5): \n2.0\nCELL (4, 6): \n0.67\nCELL (4, 7): \n3:1\nCELL (5, 1): \nLighting Zone 3\nVillage Commercial Center\nCommunity Shopping Center\nCultural, Civic or Recreational Event\nOffice Park\nTransportation Parking (commuter\nlots, etc.)\nCELL (5, 2): \n2.4\nCELL (5, 3): \n0.6\nCELL (5, 4): \n4:1\nCELL (5, 5): \n1.0\nCELL (5, 6): \n0.33\nCELL (5, 7): \n3:1\nCELL (6, 1): \nLighting Zone 2\nNeighborhood Shopping Center\nIndustrial Employee Parking\nEducational Facility\nReligious Institution\nMulti-Unit Dwelling Neighborhood\nCELL (6, 2): \n0.8\nCELL (6, 3): \n0.2\nCELL (6, 4): \n4:1\nCELL (6, 5): \n0.5\nCELL (6, 6): \n0.13\nCELL (6, 7): \n4:1\nCELL (7, 1): \nLighting Zone 1\nSingle-Unit Dwelling Neighborhood\nCELL (7, 2): \nNA\nCELL (7, 3): \nNA\nCELL (7, 4): \nNA\nCELL (7, 5): \nNA\nCELL (7, 6): \nNA\nCELL (7, 7): \nNA\nCELL (8, 1): \nLighting Zone 0\nRural Housing\nFarmland\nCELL (8, 2): \nNA\nCELL (8, 3): \nNA\nCELL (8, 4): \nNA\nCELL (8, 5): \nNA\nCELL (8, 6): \nNA\nCELL (8, 7): \nNA\nCELL (9, 1): \nOpen Space\nCELL (9, 2): \nCELL (9, 3): \nCELL (9, 4): \nCELL (9, 5): \nCELL (9, 6): \nCELL (9, 7): \n"}, {"page": "397", "text": "7.
