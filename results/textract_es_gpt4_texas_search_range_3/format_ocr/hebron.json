Zoning Regulations identify what is permitted within the different zoning districts.\n3.\nThe uses and activities permitted in the different zoning districts and other commonly sought information may\nbe found by determining what zone a specific property is in (see the maps in the Appendix of these\nRegulations) andthen referringto the provisions forthespecific district (Sections 2 - 4 of the Regulations).\n4.\nSome activities will be subject to the Standards sections in the Regulations and these requirements or\nlimitations may be found there (Sections 5 - 6).\n5.\nIf a permit or approval is required, the application requirements can be found in the Procedures section of the\nRegulations (Section 7).\n6.\nRegulatory language and definitions of terms used in the Regulations are located

public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general\nwelfare of the community.\n2. The Regulations are constructed so that, if something is not clearly permitted, it is prohibited.\n3. The Regulations generally establish minimum requirements although they can also establish maximum\nlimitations.\n4. If there is any question about whether something is permitted, the Director of Planning can provide guidance.\nIf necessary, an informal discussion with the Planning and Zoning Commission as provided in Section 7.B may\nbe requested through the Director of Planning.\nFrom the Zoning Map, identify the zoning district for the\nproperty you are interested in.\nThen, go the section of the Zoning Regulations related\nto that district to learn about applicable provisions.\nMaps showing the location of different zoning districts\nare contained in the Appendix.

The differentiation among the residential districts is intended to provide for variety in the size and density of\nresidential neighborhoods and a diversity of housing opportunities after consideration of soil types, terrain,\nand infrastructure capacity.\n3.\nThe residential districts may allow for certain non-residential uses when it can be demonstrated that they will\nbe appropriate for the location proposed in accordance with the standards contained in these Regulations.\n4. In addition, the Amston Lake district contains special requirements intended to manage development in the\ndrainage basin in order to protect Amston Lake from environmental and ecological deterioration.

The flood hazard areas of the Town of\nHebron are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,\ndisruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and\nrelief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.\n4.A.2\nNATURE OF DISTRICT\n1. As a \"restrictive\" overlay district, the requirements of the Flood Hazard Overlay District apply in addition to the\nrequirements of the underlying zoning district.\n2. The degree of flood protection required by this Regulation is considered the minimum reasonable\nfor\nregulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration and research.
