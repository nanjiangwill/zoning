These BPD provisions are designed to create a zoning classification which\nwould afford a reasonable and desirable linear, visual transition between established commercial areas. Frame\nresidential structures in commercial areas along arterial streets tend to be replaced by larger more modern\nstructures. The historical character of such areas is more residential in architectural design and building scale\nthan more recently developed areas in the General Business District. Consequently, a limited business type\nzone is required to conserve the value of property while preserving the character of such areas and existing\nbuildings therein from the standpoint of compatible land uses, architectural design, building scale and physical\nappearance. The BPD provides for such preservation and development.\n28-2 Permitted Uses\nIn a Business Preservation District, no land, building, or structure shall be used, and no building shall be\nhereafter erected, altered, or added to, unless otherwise provided in these regulations, except for one (1) or\nmore of the following uses:\n28-2.1 Principal Uses\n28-2.1.1\nAny use permitted in the Residence AAA District, subject to the same approvals and conditions as in 11-2,\nherein.\n28-2.1.2\nThe following uses are permitted only in a principal building existing on the premises at the time the BPD\nboundary is established and subject to Site Plan approval in accordance with 43, herein.
