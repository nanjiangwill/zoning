It is a major objective of these Regulations to maintain the low density of\ndevelopment in this area and to preserve its rural, wooded, agricultural character, and to\nprevent the overcrowding of its land.

Walkway\nlighting usually works better when it is mounted close to the ground rather than at eye\nlevel of pedestrians. Empty parking lots do not need to be illuminated at night.
