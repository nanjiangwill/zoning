From a private viewpoint, it increases square footage of\nstores in a manner, which maximizes exposure of their products. Because many buildings along\nmajor thoroughfares are of historic or architectural significance, extension of facades may not be\nappropriate. However, many opportunities do exist in which facade extensions would be\ndesirable.\nThe extensions could exist in a variety of physical forms but must adhere to the following\ngeneral criteria:\nCBD-1\n1)\nGranting of a right of encroachment by the City Council.\nZONING REGULATIONS OF THE CITY OF NEW LONDON\nAMENDED TO OCTOBER 24, 2018\nPAGE V-30\n"}, {"page": "114", "text": "Several types of extensions are possible and are enumerated below to serve as guidelines for\nproperty owners, the Planning and Zoning Commission and Zoning Official:\n1)\nDisplay Windows: Ground floor extensions into the right-of-way for purposes of\ndisplay of goods.

Extending certain building fronts into the right-of-way\nis desirable from a design viewpoint as it enhances the pedestrian environment by injecting\ninterest and animation to the streetscape. From a private viewpoint, it increases square footage of\nstores in a manner, which maximizes exposure of their products. Because many buildings along\nmajor thoroughfares are of historic or architectural significance, extension of facades may not be\nappropriate. However, many opportunities do exist in which facade extensions would be\ndesirable.\nThe extensions could exist in a variety of physical forms but must adhere to the following\ngeneral criteria:\nSeveral types of extensions are possible and are enumerated below to serve as guidelines for\nproperty owners, the Planning and Zoning Commission and Zoning Official:\n1)\nDisplay Windows: Ground floor extensions into the right-of-way for purposes of\ndisplay of goods.

The extension must be carefully scaled to the facade of the\nbuilding from which it originates. The extension could be cantilevered from its\nhost building or supported by columns and terminated below any cornice work or,\nif none exists, that of adjacent buildings.
