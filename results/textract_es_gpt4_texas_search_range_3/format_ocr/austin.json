No. 20160505-051, Pt. 5-16-16\nSUBCHAPTER E: - DESIGN STANDARDS AND MIXED USE.\nEditor's note:\nBackground: On February 26, 2004, the Austin City Council directed the City Manager by resolution to prepare recommendations for citywide design standards\nfor commercial and retail development. These recommended citywide design standards shall constitute the best practices of the standards adopted by communities\naround the nation and shall require design standards that reflect Austin's unique historic, landscape and architectural character...\"\nIn order to implement the Council's direction, a specially appointed Task Force met over several months to consider research and input from the public, various\nstakeholder groups, and individuals. The Task Force sought to understand the preferences of Austin citizens and the design regulations of other cities prior to\ndeveloping a recommendation.\nThe Task Force produced, and in May 2005 the City Council adopted, a policy report entitled \"Raising the Design Standards in Austin, Texas.\" The Task Force\nreport identified a number of areas where regulatory improvements are necessary in order to raise the bar of development quality in Austin. The general intent was\nto develop regulations that will foster a built environment of aesthetic and sustainable value, enhance economic development efforts, promote Austin's unique\ncharacter and natural environment, and ensure an efficient development review process.\nThe proposals for new standards were intended to raise the level of quality for all non-residential and mixed-use development, but within a regulatory structure\noffering options and flexibility, not strict requirements. New development would be subject to a set of minimum site and building design standards, recognizing that\nall new development, regardless of size, should be subject to minimum standards. The following topics were addressed in the Task Force report: Development\norientation; Parking; Land use; Signs; Stormwater management; Connectivity; Exterior lighting; Screening and compatibility; and Building design.\nIn each of these topic areas, the Task Force report discussed the key issue generally and proposed regulatory language to address the issue. In a few areas,\nspecific ordinance language was proposed, but in most areas the proposed language recommended general approaches rather than actual ordinance language. In\nsome areas, the proposed new standards would be new for Austin, while in other areas the proposed standards would require amendments to the Austin Code.\nThis Subchapter is intended to implement the Task Force report by establishing a clear, user-friendly, and legally enforceable ordinance that will result in\nimproved development quality in Austin. This Subchapter is officially known as Subchapter E of Chapter 25-2 of the City Code. This Subchapter was adopted on\nAugust 31, 2006, and will become effective on January 13, 2007. The Task Force recommends reviewing this Subchapter once it has been in place for one year.\nHow to use this Subchapter:\nApplicability is Based on Adjacent Roadway and Type of Development: This Subchapter recognizes that development should reflect and respond to its location\nwithin the city. For example, a commercial development in a suburban location can (and often should) look and function differently than a commercial development\nin downtown Austin. Because roadways provide both access to a site and define the urban design framework of the city, roadway types have been used as an\norganizing tool to establish many of the new development standards in this Subchapter. This approach is intended to help ensure a cohesive development pattern\nalong Austin's streets and remove some of the inconsistency that arises from having a variety of zoning districts fronting a single roadway.\nabout:blank\n193/263\n"}, {"page": "194", "text": "5/3/23, 2:30 PM\nAustin, TX Code of Ordinances\nBecause many of the standards in this Subchapter are defined based on roadway type(s) near the property, an important first step in the development process is\nto determine the roadway types that are adjacent to a site. The size of the site and the type of development (residential, commercial, mixed use, etc.) also need to be\nconsidered, since different standards may apply. The applicability chart in Article 1 summarizes the applicability of all the standards in this Subchapter, based on\ntype of adjacent roadways and development activity.\nThe following different types of roadways are identified in this Subchapter:\nCore Transit Corridors include roadways that have or will have a sufficient population density, mix of uses, and transit facilities to encourage and support transit\nuse. Existing Core Transit Corridors have been designated and are defined in Article 5 and shown on Figure 1. Examples include South Congress Avenue (north of\nStassney Lane) and Anderson Lane (between Burnet Road and Mopac). Additional Core Transit Corridors may be designated in the future through neighborhood\nplanning processes.\nHill Country Roadways are those roadways identified in Section 25-2-1103, such as RM 2222 and Southwest Parkway. Standards in this Subchapter that reference\nthe Hill County Roadway designation apply to all properties within 1000 feet of these roadways.\nHighways include all freeways, parkways, expressways, and frontage roads identified in the Austin Area Metropolitan Transportation Plan, except for Core Transit\nCorridors.\nInternal Circulation Routes are public streets or private drives edged by a curb within a development.\nSuburban Roadways are roads outside the Urban Roadway Boundary, defined below and shown on Figure 2, that are not Core Transit, Hill Country, or Highway\nRoadways.\nUrban Roadways are roads other than those designated as Core Transit Corridors and Highways located within the following boundaries, as shown on Figure 2:\n183 from Burnet to Hwy 71\nHwy 71 from 183 to Loop 1\nLoop 1 from Hwy 71 to Lake Austin\nLake Austin from Loop 1 to Exposition\nExposition from Lake Austin to 35th\n35th from Exposition to Loop 1\nLoop 1 from 38th to RM 2222\nRM 2222 from Loop 1 to Mesa\nMesa from RM 2222 to Spicewood Springs Road\nSpicewood Springs Road from Mesa to 360\n360 from Spicewood Springs Road to Great Hills Trail\nGreat Hills Trail from 360 to 183\n183 from Great Hills Trail to Braker\nBraker from 183 to Burnet\nBurnet from Braker to 183\nabout:blank\n194/263\n"}, {"page": "195", "text": "5/3/23, 2:30 PM\nAustin, TX Code of Ordinances\nFigure 1: Core Transit Corridors (CTC) and Future Core Transit Corridors Map (May 10, 2010)\nabout:blank\n195/263\n"}, {"page": "196", "text": "5/3/23, 2:30 PM\nAustin, TX Code of Ordinances\nFigure 2: Urban/Suburban Roadways Map\nHow this Subchapter is organized:\nThis Subchapter is divided into five Articles.\nArticle 1 includes General Provisions that should be reviewed for all development and redevelopment projects. Most importantly, a chart summarizes the\napplicability of the various standards based on roadway types and development types.\nTo allow flexibility in administering this Subchapter, this Article includes a \"minor modification\" provision that allows for City staff to approve small deviations\nfrom otherwise applicable standards in order to protect natural or historic features or to address unique site conditions.\nThe Article also encourages creativity and innovative design by allowing an applicant to propose an alternative approach to meeting the standards of the\nSubchapter through the \"alternative equivalent compliance\" provision.\nArticle 2 includes Site Development Standards intended to ensure that buildings relate appropriately to surrounding developments and streets, promote efficient\npedestrian and vehicle circulation, and provide adequate parking in safe and appropriate locations, while creating a unique and identifiable image for development\nin Austin. In particular, standards in this Article address the following:\nRelationship of buildings to streets and walkways (based on roadway type);\nConnectivity (based on roadway type);\nParking reductions;\nExterior lighting;\nScreening of equipment and utilities; and\nPrivate common open space and pedestrian amenities.\nArticle 3 includes Building Design Standards intended to address the physical appearance of buildings subject to this Subchapter.

MINOR MODIFICATIONS.\n1.4.1. Purpose and Scope.\n\"Minor modifications\" are small deviations from otherwise applicable standards of this Subchapter that may be approved by the Director in order to protect natural\nor historic features or to address unusual site conditions. Minor modifications are to be used when the limited nature of the modification requested, and the\nunlikelihood of any adverse effects on nearby properties or the neighborhood, make it unnecessary to complete a formal variance process.\n1.4.2. Applicability.\nThe Director may approve minor modifications of any numeric development standard in this Subchapter up to a maximum of ten percent (or up to a maximum of 20\npercent to protect an existing natural site feature), provided that the applicable criteria in Section 1.4.4 (Approval Criteria) are met.\nFor a Heritage Tree, the Director may approve modification of any numeric development standard in this Subchapter to the minimum extent\nrequired to preserve the Heritage Tree.\nA modified development standard is calculated by applying the percentage of modification allowed by the Director to the numeric requirement\nthat would otherwise apply if the development standard was not modified. For example, if a building facade is required to have 40% glazing, which\nwould equal 400 square feet glazing on a 1000-square foot facade, then a 10% minor modification would decrease the amount of required glazing\nby 40 square feet for a total of 360 square feet of required glazing. The minor modification process may be used only to authorize a less restrictive\nstandard and may not be used to impose a standard on the subject property than is higher than otherwise provided in this Subchapter. In no\ncircumstance shall the Director approve a minor modification that results in:\nA. An increase in overall project intensity, density, or impervious cover;\nB. A change in permitted uses or mix of uses;\nC. A change in the requirements of any of the following provisions:\n1. Subchapter C, Article 3 (Additional Requirements for Certain Districts);\n2. Subchapter C, Article 4 (Additional Requirements for Certain Uses);\n3. Subchapter C, Article 10 (Compatibility Standards); or\nD.

The procedure is not a general waiver of regulations. Alternative equivalent compliance shall not be\nused when the desired departure from the standards of this Subchapter could be achieved using the minor modification process in Section 1.4.\n1.5.2. Applicability.\nThe alternative equivalent compliance procedure shall be available only for the following sections of this Subchapter:\nA. Section 2.2, Relationship of Buildings to Streets and Walkways;\nB. Section 2.3, Connectivity Between Sites;\nC. Section 2.5, Exterior Lighting;\nD. Section 2.7, Private Common Open Space and Pedestrian Amenities;\nE. Section 2.8, Shade and Shelter; and\nF. Article 3, Building Design Standards.\n1.5.3. Procedure.\nThe applicant may select at his or her discretion whether to seek an informal recommendation or a formal approval on a proposal for alternative compliance.\nA. Option One: Informal Recommendation.\n1.\nPre-Application Conference Required. If an applicant desires only an informal response and recommendation as to a proposal for alternative\ncompliance, he or she shall request and attend a pre-application conference prior to submitting the site plan and/or building permit application\nfor the development. At the conference, the applicant shall provide a written summary of the project and the proposed alternative compliance,\nand the Director shall offer an informal, non-binding response and recommendation regarding the appropriateness of the proposed alternative.\nBased on that response, the applicant may prepare a site plan and/or building permit application that proposes alternative compliance, and such\napplication shall include sufficient explanation and justification, in both written and graphic form, for the alternative compliance requested.\n2.\nDecision-Making Responsibility. Final approval of any alternative compliance proposed under this section shall be the responsibility of the\ndecision-making body responsible for deciding upon the application. The final decision-making body for site plans is either the Director or the\nappropriate Land Use Commission, as specified in Chapter 25-5, and the building official for building permits.\n3.\nDecision by Director. If an Alternative Equivalent Compliance proposal is submitted under this subsection the Director shall review the concept\nplan for compliance with the criteria in Section 1.5.4. and shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the concept plan in writing.\nB. Option Two: Formal Decision.\n1. Pre-Application Conference. If an applicant desires formal approval of a proposal for alternative compliance, he or she shall request and attend a\npre-application conference prior to submitting the site plan and/or building permit application for the development.\n2. Alternative Compliance Concept Plan Required. At least ten days prior to the pre-application conference, the applicant shall submit an\nalternative compliance concept plan application to the Director, which shall include:\na. A written description of and justification for the proposed alternative method of compliance, specifically addressing the criteria in Section\n1.5.4.; and\nb.\nabout:blank\n202/263\n"}, {"page": "203", "text": "5/3/23, 2:30 PM\nAustin, TX Code of Ordinances\nA concept plan that describes and illustrates, in written and graphic format, the intended locations and quantities of proposed buildings on the site, the layout of\nproposed vehicle and pedestrian access and circulation systems, and areas designated to meet requirements for open space, parking, on-site amenities, utilities,\nand landscape. The concept plan shall describe the site's topography and shall provide a general description of environmental characteristics to assist in\ndetermining compliance with this Subchapter. If alternative compliance is requested from the standards of Article 3, Building Design, the concept plan also shall\ninclude descriptions and illustrations of the proposed building design elements that would not comply with the standards of this Subchapter.\n3. Decision by Director. If an Alternative Equivalent Compliance proposal is submitted under this subsection the Director shall review the concept\nplan for compliance with the criteria in Section 1.5.4. and shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the concept plan in writing.\n4. Expiration of Alternative Compliance Concept Plans.\na. An approved alternative compliance concept plan shall expire if three years pass following its approval and no building permit that\nimplements the concept plan has been issued.\nb. One, one-year extension may be issued by the Director provided that a written request has been received prior to the expiration of the\nconcept plan, and the Director has determined that no major changes in the city's development standards, or changes in the development\npattern of the surrounding properties, have occurred.\n5. Effect of Approval. Written approval of an alternative compliance concept plan does not authorize any development activity, but rather authorizes\nthe applicant to prepare a site plan and/or building permit application that incorporates the approved alternative compliance, and authorizes the\ndecision-making body (either the Land Use Commission or the Director for site plans, and the building official for building permits) to review the\nsite plan and/or building permit application for compliance with the alternative compliance concept plan, in addition to all other applicable\nrequirements. The site plan and/or building permit application shall include a copy of the approved alternative compliance concept plan.\n6. Amendments to Alternative Compliance Concept Plans.\na. Minor amendments to any approved alternative compliance concept plan may be approved, approved with conditions, or denied\nadministratively by the Director. For purposes of this provision, minor amendments are those that do not result in:\n(i) An increase of 10 percent or more in the amount of square footage of a land use or structure;\n(ii) A change in the types of uses in the project;\n(iii) An increase or decrease of 20 percent or more in the number of dwelling units in the project;\nor\n(iv)\nA change that would bring the project out of compliance with any requirement or regulation set forth in the City Code outside this\nSubchapter unless a variance to or waiver from such requirement or regulation is obtained.\nb.

Overview of Roadway Types.\nA. Purpose. In this Subchapter, roadway types are used as an organizing tool for certain development standards. In this Section 2.2., sidewalk, building\nplacement, and streetscape standards and building entryway location are determined by the roadway type that is adjacent to the site. The following\nfive roadway types are listed from highest to lowest priority for purposes of this Subchapter (See Figures 3 5 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord.\n20130606-088):\n1. Core Transit Corridor;\n2. Internal Circulation Route;\n3. Urban Roadway;\n4. Suburban Roadway; and\n5. Highway or Hill Country Roadway.\nabout:blank\n204/263\n"}, {"page": "205", "text": "5/3/23, 2:30 PM\nAustin, TX Code of Ordinances\nB. Applicability. The roadway with the highest level of priority adjacent to the lot or site is considered the \"principal street\" for purposes of this\nSubchapter. For a lot or site that is adjacent to more than one roadway of equal priority, the development shall be subject to the standards associated\nwith the roadway with the highest level of transit service, as determined by the Director, or if the roadways do not have transit service or the level of\ntransit service is equal, the roadway designated by the lot owner.\nFor large sites subject to Section 2.2.5. or for sites abutting more than one roadway type, the Sidewalk and Supplemental Zone requirements (but not\nthe Building Placement and Parking requirements) shall apply along all abutting streets or Internal Circulation Route frontages, with the applicable\nrequirements determined by the roadway type.\n2.2.2.\nCore Transit Corridors: Sidewalks and Building Placement.\nA. Applicability. The following table summarizes the applicability of this section:\n(See Figure 3 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of a Core Transit Corridor (South Congress)\n(See Figure 4 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of an Internal Circulation Route (Midtown Commons)\n(See Figure 5 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of Highway (1-35)\nB. Sidewalks. In order to create an environment that is supportive of pedestrian and transit mobility, public sidewalks shall be located along both sides\nof all Core Transit Corridors in accordance with the requirements of this section. Compliance with this section is required for all sites with frontage\nalong a Core Transit Corridor regardless of principal street designation or building placement requirements, but a development located on one side of\na street or right-of-way is not required to provide sidewalks on the opposite side of the street or right-of-way. A development that complies with the\nGreat Streets standards adopted by Resolution No. 040205-14, as now or hereafter amended, is exempt from the requirements of this section and\nmay seek any reimbursements available under the Great Streets Development program.\nFor development that is subject to the requirements of this section, no sidewalk shall be less than 15 feet in width, unless otherwise approved as part\nof the Alternative Equivalent Compliance process. The 15-foot minimum requirement shall apply regardless of the available right-of-way. Where\nrequired, the sidewalk shall extend onto private property to fulfill the 15-foot minimum requirement, with a sidewalk easement provided.\nSidewalks shall consist of two zones: a planting zone located adjacent to the curb, and a clear zone. (See Figures 6 9.) The following standards shall\napply to these zones:\n(See Figure 6 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor sidewalk requirements. Street trees are required along core transit\ncorridors with an average spacing not greater than 30 feet on center.)\n(See Figure 7 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor with underground utilities)\n(See Figure 8 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor with overhead utility zone)\n(See Figure 9 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor with overhead utility zone at curb)\n1. Planting Zone.\na. The planting zone shall have a minimum width of eight feet (from face of curb) and shall be continuous and located adjacent to the curb.\nb. The zone shall be planted with street trees at an average spacing not greater than 30 feet on center. The director shall adopt a list of\nacceptable street trees for purposes of this section. The list shall emphasize shade trees; however, alternative trees may only be approved\n(pursuant to Section 2.2.2.B.3. below) where conflicts may arise because of overhead utility lines.\nC. In addition, the zone is intended for the placement of street furniture including seating, street lights, waste receptacles, fire hydrants, traffic\nsigns, newspaper vending boxes, bus shelters, bicycle racks, public utility equipment such as electric transformers and water meters, and\nsimilar elements in a manner that does not obstruct pedestrian access or motorist visibility.\n2.\nClear Zone. The clear zone shall be a minimum width of seven feet, shall be hardscaped, shall be located adjacent to the planting zone, and shall\ncomply with ADA and Texas Accessibility Standards. The clear zone shall be unobstructed by any permanent or nonpermanent element for a\nminimum width of seven feet and a minimum height of eight feet.\n3.

All utility lines shall be underground from the building to the property line. Utility lines within the right-of-way shall be placed underground or\nrelocated to the rear of the site to the maximum extent practicable.\nb.\nWhere electric utilities remain overhead and are located behind the curb, an overhead utility zone shall be provided so that no portion of the\nbuilding is located within a 10-foot radius of the energized conductor. This overhead utility zone shall be in addition to the minimum planting\nzone, clear zone, and supplemental zone (if provided). Options for street tree planting and sidewalk placement in combination with overhead\nutilities are illustrated in Figures 8 and 9.\n(See Figures 8 and 9 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088)\nC. On lots with a depth of 120 feet or less and where electric utilities remain overhead and are located behind the curb, alternative trees from the\nlist identified in Section 2.2.2.B.1.b. above may be used so that the trees can be located beneath, rather than offset from, the overhead electric\nutilities.\n4.\nAlternative Requirements For Shallow Lots. On lots with a depth of 150 feet or less, the total sidewalk may be reduced to 12 feet, consisting of a\nseven-foot minimum planting zone and a five-foot clear zone.\nC.\nSupplemental Zone (Optional). A supplemental zone may be provided at the option of the applicant between the street-facing facade line and the\nrequired clear zone. (See Figures 10 11.) The following standards apply to supplemental zones:\n(See Figures 10 and 11 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Optional supplemental zone may be expanded to 30 feet for a maximum\nof 30 percent of the frontage.)\n1. If a supplemental zone is provided, up to 30 percent of the linear frontage of the supplemental zone may be a maximum of 30 feet wide, and the\nremainder of the supplemental zone shall be a maximum of 20 feet wide. (See Figures 10 11.)\n2. Elements that support active public uses can and should be located Within the supplemental zone, including one or more of the following:\na. Accessory outdoor dining, provided that the dining area may be separated from the sidewalk only with planters, shrubs, or fencing with a\nmaximum height of 42 inches (See Figure 12.);\n(See Figure 12 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of supplemental zone with outdoor dining.)\nb. Balconies, pedestrian walkways, porches, handicap ramps, and stoops; provided, however, that no such feature shall extend beyond the\nsupplemental zone without a license agreement;\nC. Terraces, provided that they have a maximum finished floor height of 24 inches above the sidewalk elevation and shall be surrounded by a\nguardrail that meets city specifications;\nd. Landscape and water features;\ne. Plazas; and\nf. Incidental display and sales.\n3. Other improvements that support active uses as approved by the Director.\n4. Any features in the supplemental zone must not obstruct the open pedestrian connection between the building's primary entrance and the clear\nzone.\n5. A Transit Plaza adjacent to a Capital Metro, MetroRapid Station.\nD. Building Placement.\n1. General Building Placement Standard. Notwithstanding the minimum setback requirements of the base zoning districts, at least 75 percent of the\nnet frontage length of the property along the Core Transit Corridor must consist of continuous building facade built up to the clear zone, or the\nsupplemental zone if one is provided. (See Figure 13.) For purposes of this Subchapter, \"net frontage length\" is defined in Article 5. This minimum\nnet frontage length requirement shall not apply if the site qualifies for one of the exceptions in this subsection.\n(See Figure 13 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Examples of permitted building placement along Core Transit Corridors.\nParking is not permitted in the hatched area between the street-facing facade and the sidewalk.)\n2.\nException: Civic Buildings. In order to provide greater flexibility to create a distinctive architectural statement, civic buildings, as defined in Article\n5, do not have to be built up to the clear zone (or supplemental zone if one is provided), so long as parking is not located between the building\nfrontage facing the principal street and the street. (See Figure 14.)\n(See Figure 14 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; The Austin City Hall is set back from the street in some areas, while other non\ncivic buildings meet the street. This is a traditional urban design technique intended to emphasize the importance of civic uses.)\n3. Exception: Pad-site Building with Drive-In or Drive-Through. A lot or site containing a drive-in or drive-through building may include a circulation\nlane of up to 20 feet in width between the building and the curb if the site has only one point of access to a public roadway. The drive-in or drive-\nthrough building located behind the circulation lane need not be built up to the clear zone, but the circulation lane may not have parking and must\ncontain an accessible and clearly marked walkway that crosses the circulation aisle and connects the clear zone to the building's principal\nentrance.

INTENT.\nThis Article 4 is intended to provide for and encourage development and redevelopment that contains a compatible mix of residential, commercial, and\ninstitutional uses within close proximity to each other, rather than separating uses. The mixed use provisions define the uses of land and the siting and character of\nthe improvements and structures allowed on the land in a manner that encourages a balanced and sustainable mix of uses. They promote an efficient pedestrian-\naccess network that connects the nonresidential and residential uses and transit facilities. Redevelopment of underutilized parcels and infill development of vacant\nparcels should foster pedestrian-oriented residential and mixed use development. (See Figure 45.)\n(See Figure 45 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Examples of vertical mixed use)\nCOMMENTARY: MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT IN AUSTIN GENERALLY\nThe City of Austin allows and encourages the development of mixed use projects. Mixed use development integrates two or more land uses,\nsuch as residential and commercial, with a strong pedestrian orientation. Requirements and standards for mixed use development appear in\nvarious places throughout the Austin City Code.\nZoning Districts in which Mixed Use is Allowed and Encouraged\nThe following districts are intended primarily for mixed use development and are described more fully in Section 4.2 below:\nMixed Use Combining District (Section 4.2.1.).\nVertical Mixed Use Overlay District (Section 4.2.2.).\nabout:blank\n222/263\n"}, {"page": "223", "text": "5/3/23, 2:30 PM\nAustin, TX Code of Ordinances\nMixed use development also is allowed in other Austin zoning districts.
