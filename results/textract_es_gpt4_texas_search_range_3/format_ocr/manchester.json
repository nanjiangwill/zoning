The transparency requirement on ground story facades is\nmeasured between 0 and 10 feet above the adjacent\nsidewalk.\n2. The transparency requirement on upper story facades is\nmeasured from the top of the finished floor to the top of the\nfinished floor above. When there is no floor above, upper\nstory transparency is measured from the top of the finished\nfloor to the top of the wall plate.\nArt. II Sec. 8 pg. 5\n"}, {"page": "108", "text": "Art.

Mixed Use District - The FBZ is intended to be a higher density mixed-use district with a\nfocus on commercial, entertainment, and residential uses. Commercial uses are varied and\ninclude retail stores, entertainment facilities, restaurants, offices and lodging uses as\nspecified in Table 26.04. Residential dwellings are generally in the form of multi-\nresidence structures, part of multiple-use structures, or attached single-family dwellings\nsuch as townhouses. Public open space is a significant element in the FBZ, including a\npossible future multi-use trail and linear park along Bigelow Brook.\nB. Frontage Zones - The area along existing or new Primary and Secondary Streets from the\nedge of the public right-of-way to a depth of 40 feet is considered the Frontage Zone in\nthe FBZ. Frontage Zones are intended to create a cohesive aesthetic for the district and\npromote walkability, visitor interest, and community well-being. Permitted uses on the\nground floor level within the Frontage Zone are managed according to Table 26.04 SO as\nto provide a variety of easily accessible services to the surrounding community.\nArt.

Some of the dimensional requirements\nfrom Table 26.03 are shown on each diagram. Character examples are provided for\neach lot type for illustrative purposes only; the dimensions in Table 26.03 control for\nregulatory purposes.

No parking is allowed in the street yard or any Frontage Zone.\nSite plans shall demonstrate that the setback area accomplishes these objectives and creates\nan inviting environment for pedestrians. Where rear yard setbacks are required, site plans\nwill demonstrate that appropriate screening is provided (i.e. trees, shrubbery and fencing as\nneeded).\nB. Outdoor Activity Zones: Outdoor activities shall be allowed and are encouraged where\napplicable as accessory uses to adjacent restaurant and entertainment uses. Outdoor Activity\nZones are allowed within street yard and side yard areas on private lots. Outdoor dining\nareas shall be attractively designed and furnished to enhance the pedestrian environment.\nOutdoor dining areas may be extended onto public sidewalk with a Special Exception from\nthe Planning and Zoning Commission (PZC) where a minimum of six (6) feet of\nunobstructed passage remains for pedestrian use, as shown in Figure 26.4.\nFigure 26.4 - Outdoor Activity Zones\n6'\nC.\nOutdoor Display: Outdoor display of products actively available for sale is permitted in\nassociation with any permitted nonresidential principal ground floor use in accordance with\nthe following provisions:\n1) Outdoor display shall occupy no more than 30% of the horizontal length of the\nbuilding facade.\n2) Outdoor display shall only be located within the street setback area.\n3) Outdoor display shall be removed and placed inside a fully-enclosed building at the\nend of each business day.\n4) Outdoor display shall not impair the ability of pedestrians to use the sidewalk or the\nsightline for vehicular access from adjacent streets or alleys.\nArt.
