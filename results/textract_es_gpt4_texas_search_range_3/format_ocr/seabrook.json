Purpose:\nThe purpose of the standards for high-rise development, that is buildings more than 40 feet in height, is to provide guidelines for development\nalong the waterfront areas in certain zoning districts to make proposals for high-intensity commercial, mixed use, or residential high-rise projects in\nthese areas and to provide guidance as to what quality of development for such projects will be required for approval. In the marine oriented mixed\nuse (MMU) district and the waterfront activity district (WAD), a conditional use permit for the proposed development shall be required. High-rise\ndevelopments of any nature shall not be permitted in any other zoning district.\nBecause the market for this intensive development is driven by water views or waterfront locations, it is vital to the character of the community\nthat such projects do not seal the rest of the community from the value and enjoyment of the waterfront. The standards of this district are intended\nto protect neighbors from adverse impacts, encourage good design, and create areas that are assets to the community.\n4.08.02. General standards:\nA. For purposes of this chapter [section], the term \"site\" shall be defined as the entire land acreage and any areas located in the water\nwhere improvements are proposed. A site plan, showing all land and water, and proposed improvements, shall be required of each\nproposed high-rise development, in accordance with 4.08.09.\nB.\nThe minimum standards in table 1, dimensional standards, shall be met by all development. However, there are specific requirements\naddressed in each development application that may reduce the maximum allowances in height and floor area ratio below, or which\nmay impose more than the minimum standards for the other categories listed below. These additional requirements are outlined in\n4.08.03, Height performance standards.\nTABLE -DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS\nabout:blank\n64/153\nCELL (1, 1): \nDimensional Standard\nCELL (1, 2): \nMMU and WAD\nCELL (2, 1): \nMinimum landscaped surface ratio\nCELL (2, 2): \n0.25\nCELL (3, 1): \nMinimum bufferyard opacity (residential uses)\nCELL (3, 2): \n0.5\nCELL (4, 1): \nMinimum bufferyard opacity (all other uses)\nCELL (4, 2): \n0.2\nCELL (5, 1): \nMinimum street setback\nCELL (5, 2): \nRefer to 4.08.04\nCELL (6, 1): \nMinimum side setback\nCELL (6, 2): \n10 feet 1\nCELL (7, 1): \nMinimum rear setback (along water)\nCELL (7, 2): \n25 feet 2\nCELL (8, 1): \nMinimum rear setback (nonwater)\nCELL (8, 2): \n10 feet\n"}, {"page": "65", "text": "5/29/23, 10:30 PM\nSeabrook, TX Code of Ordinances\nNotes:\n1 As required by building and fire code.\n2 From the water's edge or the property line, whichever is closest to the building.\n4.08.03. Height performance standards: This chapter (section) does not impose an overall maximum height on high-rise developments in the MMU\nand WAD districts. Height will be determined by the site size and location and the other standards provided herein. To ensure compatibility and scale\nwith adjacent development, to ensure adequate light and air between structures and to ensure maximum public safety of residents, occupants and\nthe general public, the following height standards shall apply along property lines. Height may increase with the following standards.\nA. Setback from land zoned R-1 and R-2: The maximum allowable height permitted shall be no greater than 40 feet at the required\nsetback line.\nB. Setback from land zoned MMU or WAD: The maximum allowable height permitted at the required setback line shall be equal to or less\nthan 40 feet after which, the height may be increased by two feet for every one-tenth (0.1) foot of additional setback. Such\nrequirements apply to land contiguous to the property subject to the development application.\nC. Setback from street: The maximum allowable height permitted at the required setback line shall be 40 feet after which, the height may\nbe increased by two feet for every one-tenth (0.1) foot of additional setback. This setback shall apply where the property is located on a\nstreet that is parallel to the water.\n4.08.04. Street setbacks: In the MMU and WAD districts, the required setback from a public or private street or right-of-way, shall be a minimum of\n30 feet, which distance shall include a sidewalk and parkway area with a minimum width of 12 feet, and including utility easements. The setback\nwidth may be reduced by an amount equal to the width of utility easements if such utilities are located within an existing improved road.\n4.08.05. Street trees: All street frontages shall be planted with three canopy trees per 100 feet of street frontage. Where the setbacks are 30 feet\nor more, the canopy trees shall be planted in a grassed parkway.

Description:\nA planned unit development (PUD) is a land use design incorporating the concepts of density transfer and common open space. The PUD\ndesignation serves as an \"overlay zone.\" In this capacity, the designation applies a new and different set of developmental guidelines to the base\nzoning district in which the parcel or property is located.\nWhen a parcel of land receives the PUD designation it continues to retain its standard zoning district classification. However, the added PUD\ndesignation enables the developer of the tract to modify the yard and setback requirements in concert with a documented plan that meets the\nregulations prescribed herein and which has been reviewed and approved by the planning and zoning commission.\nIn many instances the creative use of the PUD concept facilitates urban design which is more efficient, safe, environmentally sensitive, interesting,\nvisually pleasing, and socially integrated than the standard lot design. Within the City of Seabrook, and in conformance with the goals, objectives, and\npolicies of Comprehensive Master Plan 2030, the PUD designation is aimed at the following purposes:\nA. To encourage a more efficient use of land;\nB. To reflect changes in the technology of land development so that resulting economies may inure to the benefit of those who need\nshelter;\nC. To lessen the burden of traffic on streets and highways;\nD. To provide common open space for the utilization of neighborhood residents;\nE. To encourage urban design that results in smaller networks of utilities and streets;\nF.\nTo provide for a procedure that can relate the type, design, and layout of urban development to the respective site and the particular\ndemand for land uses in a manner consistent with the preservation of property values within established parts of the City of Seabrook;\nG. To provide for a more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict application of other sections of this ordinance.\n4.10.02. PUD location: PUD designation may be applied to property located within any zoning district within the City of Seabrook. PUD designation\nshall be subject to the regulations contained in this section of the ordinance, and the approval of the city council.\n4.10.03. Mixed use projects permitted: Mixed use projects involving both residential and commercial land use activities shall be permitted in any\nzoning district, subject to the regulations contained in this section of the ordinance, and the approval of the city council.\n4.10.04. PUD projects may cross zoning districts: PUD projects may cross two or more zoning districts. The arrangement and the mixture of land\nuse activities shall be subject to the regulations contained in this section of the ordinance, and the approval of the city council.\nabout:blank\n69/153\n"}, {"page": "70", "text": "5/29/23, 10:30 PM\nSeabrook, TX Code of Ordinances\n4.10.05.

Application procedures: An application for a conditional use permit for a tower or antenna must be made to the director of\nadministration. An application will not be considered until it is complete. A complete application must contain the following:\nA. An inventory of the applicant's existing towers that are either within the city or within one mile of the corporate limits, specifying the\nlocation, height, and design of each tower. The director may share the information with other applicants for a conditional use permit\nunder this article.\nB. Site plans to scale specifying the location of tower(s), transmission building and other accessory uses, street access, parking, fences,\nlandscaped areas, and adjacent land uses.\nC.\nA report from a professional structural engineer licensed by the State of Texas documenting the following:\n1. Tower height and design, showing a cross-section of the tower structure.\n2. Total anticipated capacity of the tower structure, including the number and types of antennas which can be accommodated.\nD. A letter of intent to lease excess space on the tower and to lease additional excess land on the tower site when the shared use\nabout:blank\n92/153\n"}, {"page": "93", "text": "5/29/23, 10:30 PM\nSeabrook, TX Code of Ordinances\npotential of the tower is absorbed, if structurally and technically possible.\nE. Each applicant must make a good faith effort to substantially demonstrate that no existing towers could accommodate the applicant's\nproposed antenna by doing the following:\n1. The applicant must contact the owners of all existing towers of a height roughly equal to or greater than the height of the tower\nproposed by the applicant. A list must be provided of all owners contacted, the date of the contact, and the form and content of\nthe contact. Where an existing tower is known to have capacity for additional antennas of the sort proposed, that application for a\nnew tower is not complete until the owner of the existing tower responds, unless the applicant submits sufficient information for\nthe director of administration to determine that all reasonable efforts to obtain a response have been made and further efforts\nwould be futile.\n2. The applicant must request the following information from each tower owner contacted:\na. Identification of the site by location, existing uses, and tower height.\nb. Whether each tower could structurally accommodate the antenna proposed by the applicant without requiring structural\nchanges be made to the tower. To enable the owner to respond, the applicant must provide each owner with the height, length,\nweight, and other relevant data about the proposed antenna.\nC. Whether each tower could structurally accommodate the proposed antenna if structural changes were made, not including\ntotally rebuilding the tower. If so, the owner must specify in general terms what structural changes would be required.\nd.\nIf structurally able, would shared use by the existing tower be precluded for reasons related to RF interference. If so, the owner\nmust describe in general terms what changes in either the existing or proposed antenna would be required to accommodate\nthe proposed tower, if at all.\n3. The director of administration must maintain and provide, on request, records of responses from each owner. Once an owner\ndemonstrates an antenna of the sort proposed by the applicant cannot be accommodated on the owner's tower as described\nbelow, the owner need not be contacted by future applicants for antennas of the sort proposed.\n4. Shared use is not precluded simply because a reasonable fee for shared use is charged, or because of reasonable costs necessary\nto adapt the existing and proposed uses to a shared tower. The director of administration and the city council may consider expert\ntestimony to determine whether the fee and costs are reasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed\nunreasonable.\nF. Any other information which may be requested by the director of administration to fully evaluate and review the application and the\npotential impact of a proposed tower or antenna.\n4.25.06. General requirements and regulations:\nA. All freestanding towers must be set back from abutting property lines the distance of the height of the proposed tower.\nB. No freestanding tower may exceed 100 feet in height.\nC. No freestanding tower or antenna may be located within 500 feet of another freestanding tower.\nD. A new tower may not be established if there is a technically suitable space available on an existing tower within the search area that\nthe new cell is to serve. For the purpose of this article, the search area is defined as the grid for the placement of the antenna.\nE. No signs or illumination are placed on an antenna or tower unless required by state or federal regulation.\nF. No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower.\nG. An annual inspection by a licensed professional engineer must be performed to insure the structural integrity of the tower. The owner\nmust maintain copies of the inspection reports and make them available to the city upon request.\n4.25.07. Visual impacts:\nA. Freestanding towers must be concealed antennae towers or stealth facilities.\nB. All towers must either maintain a galvanized steel finish or be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.\nC. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a freestanding tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical\nequipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make\nthe antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.\nD. Equipment storage buildings must be constructed of appropriate materials so as to be visually compatible with the character of the\nsurrounding area.\nE.\nabout:blank\n93/153\n"}, {"page": "94", "text": "5/29/23, 10:30 PM\nSeabrook, TX Code of Ordinances\nEquipment storage platforms must be completely screened from public view. Chain link fences are permitted, but screen inserts must be utilized\nand maintained.\nF. Appropriate landscaping may be required where equipment storage buildings or platforms are visible from residential areas or\nthoroughfares.\n4.16.08. Principal, accessory, and joint uses:\nA. Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower are allowed but must not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor\nstorage. Mobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower shall not be stored or parked on the site of the tower, unless repairs\nto the tower are being made.\nB. Towers may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area.\nC. Placement of more than one tower on a lot is permitted, provided all setback and separation requirements are met.\nD. Access drives for antenna facilities must be maintained.\n4.25.09. Shared use:\nA. To encourage shared use of towers, no building permit or conditional use permit is required for the addition of antennas to an existing\ntower as long as the height of the tower or structure on which the antenna is placed is not increased and the requirements of this\narticle and any conditions granting the permit are met.\nB. Any conditional use permit which is granted for a new tower is specifically subject to the condition that the tower owner abides by the\nfollowing provisions relating to shared use, regardless of whether or not the ordinance granting the permit contains the conditions:\n1. The tower owner must respond in a timely, comprehensive manner to a request for information from a potential shared use\napplicant;\n2. The tower owner must negotiate in good faith for shared use by third parties; and\n3.\nThe tower owner must allow shared use where the third party seeking the use agrees in writing to pay reasonable, pro rata charges\nfor sharing, including all charges necessary to make modifications of the tower and transmitters to accommodate the shared use,\nand to observe whatever technical requirements are necessary to allow shared use without creating interference.\nC. The willful failure of an owner whose tower was approved under this article to comply with the requirements of this section is grounds\nfor withholding approval of any application by the owner for a building permit for the approved tower, for revoking the conditional use\npermit granted for the tower, and for refusing to approve a new conditional use permit for any new tower or antenna.\n4.25.10. Abandoned towers:\nA. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for any continuous period of 12 months is deemed abandoned, whether or not the owner or\noperator intends to make use of the tower. The owner of an abandoned antenna or tower and the owner of the property where the\ntower is located must remove the tower or antenna. If the antenna or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the\ncity ordering the removal, the city may remove the tower or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of the removal.\nB. If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use the abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and\nreceive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this article as if the tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna.\nC. It shall be the sole responsibility of the owner of the property where a communications tower is located to notify the city when a tower\nhas been abandoned.\n4.25.11. Pre-existing towers and nonconforming uses: All towers operative prior to the effective date of this article, are allowed to continue their\npresent usage as a nonconforming use and are treated as a nonconforming use in accordance with article 9 of these regulations. Routine\nmaintenance is permitted on the existing towers. New construction other than routine maintenance on an existing communication tower must\ncomply with the full requirements of this article.\n4.25.12.

A new development shall be defined as any new project built on a raw or\notherwise vacant tract or tracts of land, not associated with an existing structure. A structure shall be deemed to have lost its nonconformity as\ndetermined by appendix A, article 9.\nIt is the intent of this section to establish minimum standards for the provision, installation, and maintenance of landscape plantings in order to\nprovide for the orderly, safe, and environmentally sound development of land located within the corporate limits of Seabrook, thereby promoting the\nhealth, safety, and general welfare of the community as provided by law.\nThe regulations contained herein are necessary to enhance the community's aesthetic, environmental, and ecological qualities, as well as to\nbenefit safety in parking and pedestrian areas.\nThrough the use of landscaping, it is possible to improve the appearance of all areas by incorporating open space into development in ways that\nharmonize and enhance the natural and built environment. It is possible to improve environmental quality through the numerous beneficial effects\nof landscaping, including:\nA. The improvement of air and water quality through such natural processes as photosynthesis and mineral uptake.\nB. The use of trees and other plants to reduce erosion by the binding of soil particles with their roots thus holding the soil together\nagainst the effects of wind and water. When development increases the amount of impervious surface on a site, it greatly increases\nwater flow across exposed soils, causing serious water pollution problems. Vegetation slows this process by acting as a sponge,\ngradually releasing runoff. This improves water quality and reduces the need for engineered drainage solutions.\nC. Vegetation reduces and/or reverses air, noise, heat, and chemical pollution through the biological filtering capacities of trees and other\nvegetation.\nD. Landscaping reduces the increase in air temperatures caused by paved surfaces and automobiles through the process of transpiration\nassociated with plant material.\nVegetation also helps promote energy conservation through the creation of shade, reducing heat gain in or on buildings or paved areas.\nThe use of vegetation also enhances the safety of parking lots and pedestrian paths through the application of landscaping provisions which guide\nthe circulation of cars and people. Proper use helps ensure that a driver's vision is unobstructed. The regulations contained in this section of the\nordinance are aimed at achieving the goals, objectives, and policies, contained in the comprehensive master plan.\n7.01.02 Definitions: All related definitions are found in article 1, section 1.10 of appendix A.\n7.01.03 General applicability: Unless otherwise provided herein, this article shall apply to the following:\nA.

Excessive glare can be annoying and may cause safety problems.\nLight trespass reduces everyone's privacy, and higher energy use results in increased costs for everyone. There is a need for a lighting ordinance\nthat recognizes the benefits of outdoor lighting and provides clear guidelines for its installation so as to help maintain and compliment the city's\ncharacter. Appropriately regulated, and properly installed, outdoor lighting will contribute to the safety and welfare of the residents of the City of\nSeabrook.\nThis ordinance is intended to reduce the problems created by improperly designed and installed outdoor lighting. It is intended to eliminate\nproblems of glare, minimize light trespass, and help reduce the energy and financial costs of outdoor lighting by establishing regulations which limit\nthe area that certain kinds of outdoor-lighting fixtures can illuminate and by limiting the total allowable illumination of properties located in the City\nof Seabrook.\nAll business, residential, and community driveway, sidewalk and property luminaries should be installed with the idea of being a \"good neighbor\",\nwith attempts to keep unnecessary direct light from shining onto abutting properties or streets.\n8.10.03.
