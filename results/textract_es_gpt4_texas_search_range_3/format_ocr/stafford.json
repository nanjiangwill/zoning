Building setback requirements.\ni. Generally. No plat of any subdivision shall be approved unless building setback lines are\nestablished therein in accordance with the requirements of this section. It shall be unlawful\nfor any person to construct or erect, or cause to be constructed or erected, any building or\nstructure between a street right-of-way line or side property line and a building setback line\nestablished hereby except as specifically permitted herein. For the purposes of this section, a\n\"building setback\" shall mean an imaginary line within a lot or tract which runs parallel to the\nboundary of such lot or tract, or, when such lot or tract is encumbered by, or adjacent to, a\nstreet right-of-way or private street easement, an imaginary line which runs parallel to the\nboundary of such street right-of-way or private street easement.\nii.

Designation of front. Each lot or reserve shall have designated thereon a front building line.\nNo front building line shall be changed to a side building line except through a formal re-\nplatting of such lot or reserve.\n16. Reserve tracts.\ni. Reserve tracts are those individual parcels of land created within a subdivision plat which are\nnot divided into lots but are established to accommodate some specific purpose such as a\ncommercial center, industrial site, golf course or other type of private recreational facility,\nschool or church site, or sites for utility facilities such as water wells and other activities and\nland uses for which division into lots is not suitable or appropriate. Since the use of reserve\ntracts may not be completely determined by the sub divider or developer at the time plats are\nprepared and submitted to the city, these reserve tracts are often established as\n\"unrestricted reserves\" which allows maximum flexibility in the determination of the ultimate\nuse planned for such properties.\nii. Reserves established on any subdivision plat shall have frontage on and be immediately\nadjacent to at least one public street, with such frontage being not less than 60 feet in width.\nIn those instances outside the city limits where the average depth of an unrestricted reserve\nis more than 300 feet, the reserve access to all adjacent public streets shall be separated by a\none-foot reserve placed within the adjacent street right-of-way as provided in this section\nwhich will become automatically removed upon the approval and recording of a plat of the\nproperty within the reserve.\niii.\nabout:blank\n273/286\n"}, {"page": "274", "text": "6/2/23, 8:58 AM\nStafford, TX Code of Ordinances\nAll reserves shall be labeled and identified on the plat, and a description of the use intended for such reserve shall be\nnoted.\nIf\nthe use of the reserve is not restricted for any specific use, the reserve shall then be identified and noted as\nbeing unrestricted.

Lots generally.\ni. No plat of any subdivision shall be approved unless the lots established thereby comply with\nthe minimum standards provided in this division.\nii. Lots shall be designed, so far as possible, with side lot lines being at right angles or radial to\nany adjacent street right-of-way line. Where all lots are either perpendicular and at right\nangles or radial to adjacent street right-of-way, a suitable notation may be placed upon the\nplat in lieu of lot line bearings.\niii. Key or flag lots may be permitted under unusual circumstances; however, the narrowest part\nof such a lot, being the staff portion of the flag lot, shall not be less than 20 feet in width or\nhave a length of more than 200 feet. Such lot shall also be restricted to prevent the\nconstruction of any building, structure, wall or fence within the staff portion of such lot, and\nthe staff portion of such lot shall be restricted for access to such lot only. Such restrictions\nshall be shown on the face of the subdivision plat in the form of a notation or a part of the\ndedicatory language on the plat.\niv. Double-front lots will not be approved except in those instances where lots are restricted for\nresidential use and back upon an adjacent designated major thoroughfare or where special\ncircumstances would warrant a variance to this regulation.\nV. Rear and/or side vehicular driveway access from lots, restricted to the construction of\nresidential dwelling units, to adjacent streets designated as major thoroughfares or collector\nstreets will not be approved and such access restriction shall be noted directly upon the plat\nadjacent to the lots in question.\nvi. Each lot created within the city or its area of extraterritorial jurisdiction shall have available\nthereto a sanitary sewer system operated by a governmental entity. Septic tanks shall not be\npermitted.\nvii. All blocks established in any subdivision shall be designated by number with the numbers\nbeing consecutive within the whole subdivision plat. Lots established within such blocks shall\nalso be numbered with the numbers being consecutive within the block. Lot numbering may\nbe cumulative throughout the subdivision if the numbering system continues from block to\nblock in a uniform manner.\n18. Minimum sizes of lots.\ni. Lots to be established in any subdivision plat, which are designed or intended for\nnonresidential uses or are intended to be unrestricted, must have a minimum lot area of not\nless than 7,150 square feet and must have not less than 60 feet of frontage along and\nadjacent to at least one public street having a right-of-way width of not less than 50 feet.\nii. The size of lots restricted for single-family residential uses shall be as follows:\nabout:blank\n274/286\n"}, {"page": "275", "text": "6/2/23, 8:58 AM\nStafford, TX Code of Ordinances\nA. Radial lots, being those lots adjacent to curved streets or cul-de-sacs, shall have a width at\nthe front building setback line of not less than 50 feet.\nB. When lots are backing on a natural drainage way (bayou, creek, gully, etc.) or an open\ndrainage facility, such lots shall have a depth sufficient to provide at least 70 feet from the\nnearest drainage easement boundary line to the front building setback line.\nC. When lots are facing or backing on a designated major thoroughfare, such lots shall have\na depth at least ten feet deeper than the average depth of lots within the interior of the\nsubdivision having frontage on local streets.\nD. Except as provided hereinbelow, no lot shall be created which is less than 65 feet in width\nor less than 110 feet in depth, nor shall any such lot contain less than 7,150 square feet.\nProvided, however, lots may be created having less width, depth, and lot size as required\nabove if:\n(i) The average lot size in the subdivision is not less than 7,150 square feet;\n(ii) Fifty percent or more of the lots in the subdivision contain 7,150 square feet or more;\n(iii) No lot in the subdivision is less than 55 feet in width; and\n(iv) No lot in the subdivision contains less than 6,000 square feet.\niii. For the purposes of calculating the average lot size for a subdivision pursuant to subsection (I)\n(18)b.4.i. of this section, no lot shall be deemed to contain more than 9,000 square feet. For\nexample, if a subdivision contains two lots, one of which contains 6,000 square feet and the\nother 12,000 square feet, the average lot size is calculated by adding 6,000 and 9,000 and\ndividing by two, which would equate to a 7,500 square foot average lot size. Provided, further,\nin calculating the average lot size for a subdivision, areas dedicated for use of the residents of\na subdivision for recreational and open space purposes, including, but not limited to, parks,\nplaygrounds, greenbelts, swimming pools, tennis courts, recreation halls, and other similar\nrecreation amenities, as approved by the planning and zoning commission and city council,\nshall be considered as lot area. For example, if a subdivision contains four lots, two of which\ncontain 6,000 square feet and the other two 7,150 square feet, but the subdivision contains a\n2,500 square foot park, the average lot size is calculated by adding 6,000, 6,000, 7,150, 7,150,\nand 2,500 and dividing by four, and the resulting average lot size would be 7,200 square feet.\niv. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this section to the contrary, special purpose\nlots may be created which do not otherwise comply with the minimum lot size requirements\nherein established. The term \"special purpose lots\" means lots restricted to uses benefitting\nthe public or the owners of lots within a subdivision, including, but not limited to, lots housing\nfacilities for utilities, common area amenities, pipeline regulator stations, etc.\n19. Multifamily residential uses generally.\ni. General provisions. The following minimum requirements shall apply to all developments\ncontaining multifamily dwellings. All plats for multifamily dwelling developments shall include\nsite plan data to establish compliance with the provisions of this section.

For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the meanings\nascribed thereto:\nBuilding height means the vertical distance from grade to the highest finished roof surface in the\ncase of flat roofs or to a point at the average (median) height of the highest roof in the case of pitched\nroofs.\nMultifamily dwelling means any building within which two or more residential dwelling units are\ncontained.\niii. Lot size. No lot to be used for a multifamily dwelling shall be less than 100 feet in width nor\nless than 120 feet in depth.\niv. Building setbacks. There shall be building lines in accordance with the Building Regulations,\nTable 5 provisions of this section.\n20. Utilities. Adequate provision for all utilities shall be provided to the entire subdivision. All utility\ninstallations shall comply with the city minimum construction standards for community\nimprovements.\n21. Sidewalks. Paved sidewalks shall be provided along and adjacent to both sides of all streets.\nProvided, however, the planning and zoning commission and the city council may, if the proposed\nsubdivision is to contain an extension of an existing street which has open-ditch drainage and it is\nnot feasible to convert such open ditch drainage to an underground storm sewer along such\nextended portion, waive such requirement for sidewalks along such extended street. Sidewalks\nshall be constructed in accordance with the city minimum construction standards for community\nimprovements but shall not be required to be constructed until prior to the issuance of an\noccupancy permit for the building on the lot upon which the sidewalk abuts. No sidewalk shall be\nrequired along the Hwy. 59 frontage road.\n22. Street lighting.
