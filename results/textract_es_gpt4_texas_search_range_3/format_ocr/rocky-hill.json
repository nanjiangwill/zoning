The Fair Housing Act (FHA), as amended, is a federal antidiscrimination statute that\nprohibits discriminating against a person on the basis of disability by refusing to make reasonable accommodations\nwhen necessary to afford the person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.\nThe FHA and ADA require municipal governments to make reasonable accommodations to policies, practices, or\nprocedures to prevent discrimination on the basis of disability. Reasonable accommodations can include changes,\nmodifications or adjustments to local laws, ordinances, and regulations that prevent people with disabilities from\nhaving an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.\nThe Town of Rocky Hill Planning and Zoning Division shall make reasonable accommodations in policies, practices,\nor procedures when the accommodations are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless\nthose accommodations would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, activity, or cause an undue\nfinancial and administrative burden.\nA reasonable accommodation is a change, exception or adjustment to a rule, policy, practice or service that may be\nnecessary for a person with disabilities to have an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.\n3.F.2\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nAll reasonable accommodation applications that are submitted will be reviewed on an individual basis and\nindependently of all other requests.\nIn evaluating a Request for Reasonable Accommodation, the Commission, based upon consultation with, and the\nrecommendation of staff, shall consider competent, substantial evidence relating to the following:\nWhether the reasonable accommodation is necessary because of a disability.\nWhether there is an identifiable relationship, or nexus, between the requested accommodation and the person's\nneeds.\nWhether a sufficient alternative to the specific initial request exists, if the initial request is determined to be not\nreasonable.\nWhether granting the request would change the essential nature of the Zoning Code as compared to strict\napplication of the code to the circumstances or the request.\nWhether the request would impose undue financial and administrative burdens on the Town.\n3.F.3\nAPPLICATION REQUIREMENTS\nApplicants seeking Request for Reasonable Accommodation for a disability under the federal regulations provided\nby the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Fair Housing Act (FHA) should complete the application for a\nReasonable Accommodation / Modification.
