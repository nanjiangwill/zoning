Floodplain Regulations\nA.\nPURPOSE\nThese regulations are intended to provide a reasonable degree of protection to persons and property from the effects\nof flooding. The areas of the Town designated as lying within the one hundred (100) year floodplain (Special\nFlood Hazard Area) are subject to periodic inundation that may result in loss of life, property, and health and safety\nhazards. It is the purpose of this zone to minimize public and private losses in flood prone areas. The Special\nFlood Hazard Areas (SFHA) identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood\nInsurance Study (FIS) for the Town of Wethersfield, dated September 26, 2008, and accompanying Flood\nInsurance Rate Maps (FIRM), dated September 26, 2008, and other supporting data, and any subsequent revisions\nthereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this regulation. Since mapping is legally adopted by\nreference into this regulation must take precedence when more restrictive until such time as a map amendment or\nmap revision is obtained from (9/26/08)\nWhile the degree of flood protection required by this Article is considered reasonable for regulatory damages that\nresult from reliance on this Article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. A structure or\ndevelopment already in compliance with this regulation shall not be made non-compliant by any alteration,\nmodification, repair, reconstruction or improvement and must also comply with other applicable local, state and\nfederal regulations. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, modified or structurally\naltered without full compliance with the terms of this regulation and other applicable regulations. (9/26/08)\nB.\nENCROACHMENT STANDARDS\n1.\nEncroachment within the floodway is prohibited.\n2. Encroachment within the floodplain shall:\na. Require approval by the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Agency.\nb. Be in accordance with the minimum standards for the preservation and usage of land within the\nConservation Zone established by the Connecticut River Assembly pursuant to CGS Chapter 477c.\n3.\nApproval of encroachment for purposes other than farmland reclamation shall require certification to the\nInland Wetlands and Watercourses Agency by a professional engineer licensed in Connecticut that flood\nstorage capacity shall be created elsewhere in the floodplain in a volume equal to that consumed by the\nencroachment.\n4.\nApproval of encroachment within the floodplain for purposes of farmland reclamation shall:\na. Require the execution and filing of a covenant running with the subject land in favor of the Town for a\nperiod of at least ten (10) years, restricting the subject land to a farm use.\nb. Not cause the final elevation of the subject land to exceed elevation 28.00, MDC datum.\n5.\nNo encroachment in its cumulative effect shall cause the water surface elevation during flooding to exceed\nthe base flood water surface elevation, with floodway, specified for each flooding source cross section in\nTable 1 of the Flood Insurance Study.\n6.\nIn flood hazard areas designated \"A\" on the Wethersfield Flood Insurance Rate Maps, where base flood\nelevations have been determined but where a floodway has not yet been designated, no encroachment, new\nconstruction or substantial improvement shall be permitted which would increase base flood elevations more\nthan one (1) foot at any point along the watercourse when all anticipated development or encroachment is\nconsidered cumulatively with the proposed development or encroachment.\n7.\nCompensatory Storage - The water holding capacity of the floodplain, except those areas that are tidally\ninfluenced, shall not be reduced. Any reduction caused by filling, new construction, or substantial\nimprovements involving an increase in footprint to the structure shall be compensated for by deepening\nand/or widening of the floodplain. Storage shall be provided on-site, unless easements have been gained from\nadjacent property owners; it shall be provided within the same hydraulic reach and a volume not previously\nused for flood storage; it shall be hydraulically comparable and incrementally equal to the theoretical volume\nof flood water at each elevation, up to and including the 100-year flood elevation, which would be displaced\nby the proposed project. Such compensatory volume shall have an unrestricted hydraulic connection to the\nsame waterway or water body. Compensatory storage can be provided off-site if approved by the\nmunicipality.(9/26/08)\n8.\n(New) Equal Conveyance - Within the floodplain, except those areas which are tidally influenced, as\ndesignated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the community, encroachments resulting from\n52\n"}, {"page": "53", "text": "filling, new construction or substantial improvements involving an increase in footprint of the structure, are\nprohibited unless the applicant provides certification by a registered professional engineer demonstrating,\nwith supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering\npractice, that such encroachments shall not result in any (0.00 feet) increase in flood levels (base flood\nelevation).

Be water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water with structural components\ncapable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy during conditions of\nflooding.\n3. Access to any enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or\nlimited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or\nentry to the occupied area (stairway or elevator).\n4.\nA licensed professional engineer or architect shall certify to the Town that the design and methods of\nconstruction are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this\nsubsection or provide a minimum of two (2) openings with:\na.\nA total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to\nflooding.\nb.\nThe bottom of all openings no higher than one (1) foot above grade.\nC.\nScreens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices that permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in\nboth directions.\nE.\nFLOOD-PROOFING OF OTHER NON-RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES\n1.\nOther structures located in the Floodplain may be flood-proofed in lieu of being elevated provided that:\na.\nThe areas of the structure below the floodplain elevation are water tight with walls substantially\nimpermeable to the passage of water, and\nb.\nStructural components have the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects\nof buoyancy.\n2. A licensed professional engineer or architect shall certify to the Town that the design and methods of\nconstruction are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this\nsubsection or provide a minimum of two (2) openings with:\na.\nA total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to\nflooding.\nb.

The entire structure must meet the construction\nrequirements of the flood zone. The structure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or\nany other structure attached to the main structure.
