(The Plan)\n(a)\nPurpose and Authority. Increased development without proper\nconsideration of stormwater impacts can be a significant source of\npollution to Long Island Sound, its tributaries, and other waters of the\nState of Connecticut and the Town. These water resources are valuable\nnatural, economic, recreational, cultural and aesthetic resources. The\nprotection and preservation of these waters is in the public interest and is\nessential to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the Town. It\nis therefore, the purpose of this section to protect and preserve the\nwaters within the Town of Guilford from non-point sources of pollution\nthrough the proper management of stormwater flows and minimization of\npollutants as defined by the \"2004 Connecticut Stormwater Quality\n"}, {"page": "60", "text": "273-75.\nZoning Code Chapter 273 Town of Guilford\n273-75.\nManual\" prepared by the Connecticut Department of Energy and\nEnvironmental Protection, as it may be amended, (hereafter referred to\nas the CT Stormwater Quality Manual).\n[1]\nThe intent of the Regulations is to set forth Stormwater\nManagement Plan requirements, including design practices and\ntechnical standards, to be incorporated in the planning, design,\nconstruction and maintenance of development proposals,\nredevelopment proposals and other activities that change the\nland's surface and alter hydrologic conditions resulting in\npollution and adverse impacts to the surface water, groundwater\nand other natural resources of the Town of Guilford.\n[2]\nThe provisions of this ordinance are pursuant to Connecticut\nState Statutes 7-148 [c] (8) (A), 8-2(a), 8-25, and 22a-36 to 22a-\n45 inclusive and 8-2(b) and shall apply to all development\noccurring within the incorporated area of the Town of Guilford,\nConnecticut. The application of this ordinance and provisions\nexpressed herein shall be the minimum stormwater management\nrequirements and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of\nany other powers granted by State statute.\n(b)\nApplicability. No person shall submit a Site Plan application,\nSpecial Permit or Coastal Site Plan (CAM) application without\nincluding a Stormwater Management Plan that will control or\nmanage runoff from the land, except as provided within this\nsection. The Stormwater Management Plan must be designed\nconsistent with the CT Stormwater Quality Manual.\n(c)\nExemptions\n[1]\nUpon written request, the Commission may grant an exemption\nfrom this section, when the development proposal,\nredevelopment proposal or other activity will disturb less than a\ntotal of one acre of land surface area.\nNo exemption shall be approved that would cause an adverse\nimpact on the health, safety and welfare of the community or the\nsurface water, groundwater and other natural resources of the\nTown of Guilford. The Applicant shall demonstrate to the\nsatisfaction of the Commission that approval of an exemption will\nmeet this standard. Due to the critical sensitivity of the\nenvironmental resources to development of the area within the\nCoastal Boundary as defined in CGS Section 22a-94, the effect\non these resources must be paramount.

The sections that follow set forth the criteria for approval of PRD\nspecial permits, as well as the standards for approval of PRD project design and management\nprograms. While the PRD use is not mandatory for the development of residential areas of the\nTown, it is the intent of the Plan of Conservation and Development to encourage PRD's that can\nconform to special permit criteria. Application and review procedures for PRD's are set forth in\n$\u00a7273-100. and 273-101.\n$273-83. Criteria for special permit.\nA.\nFindings. The Town of Guilford will experience continuing residential growth. For most of\nthe period of time that zoning regulations have been in effect for the Town, new\nresidential development has typically consisted of single-family dwellings on individual\nbuilding lots in new subdivision layouts. There is a continuing backlog of unused but\napproved building lots.\n(1)\nIn the aggregate, these layouts, while providing sites for additional dwellings,\nhave also:\n(a)\nConsumed large amounts of acreage that previously contained\nagricultural, forest and conservation resources.\n(b)\nResulted in construction of many miles of new streets requiring Town\nmaintenance.\n(c)\nBeen randomly scattered around the Town and have necessitated undue\nextension of municipal services.\n(d)\nCaused damage to or have failed to fit the natural features of the\nenvironment.\n(e)\nProduced housing that is beyond the means of or fails to meet the needs\nof a substantial segment of Guilford families.\n(2)\nSince 1969 and as an alternative to typical subdivision layouts, the regulations\nhave also provided for PRD's, consisting of single-family detached dwellings or\nattached dwellings, garden apartments or townhouses, upon grant of a special\npermit. Prior to the effective date of this section, approved PRD's have increased\nthe supply of alternative dwelling types and have become the more marketable\nform of housing construction. There is a backlog of approved but unbuilt dwelling\nunits in PRD's. It is found that the PRD's:\n(a)\nMay encourage a faster rate of growth than established under the\nGrowth Management Program of the Plan of Conservation and\nDevelopment.\n(b)\nHave not materially produced housing within the means of lower-income\nGuilford families.\n"}, {"page": "73", "text": "273-.83.\nZoning Code Chapter 273 Town of Guilford\n273-83.\n(c)\nHave in some cases produced architectural effects and grouping of\npopulation not in harmony with existing neighborhoods.\n(d)\nHave not in some cases fitted building and site development to the\nnatural features of the environment.\n(3)\nThere are tracts of land in the Town which, subject to consideration on a case-\nby-case basis, are capable of use under alternative forms of residential\ndevelopment that avoid the above results and accomplish the objectives\nhereinafter specified.\nB.\nObjectives. A PRD shall consist of single-family detached dwellings or attached\ndwellings, garden apartments or townhouses or a combination thereof which achieve\nboth of the following primary objectives:\n(1)\nPreservation of open space, such as open space resources and/or conservation\nresource areas, as set forth in Program Nos. 1 and 5 of the Plan of Conservation\nand Development for the Town of Guilford, Connecticut, and which is either:\n(a)\nSignificantly beneficial to the community by preserving unusual open\nspace features within the PRD or constituting part of an open space and\nconservation resource system covering a larger area; or\n(b)\nA significant portion of and enhancement to the design of the PRD by\nachieving a contrast between building and nonbuilding areas and\nsupporting the character of the neighborhood and the community.\n(2)\nArchitecture and site development of design merit, contributing to the\nappearance and beauty of the Town and achieving convenience of residential\nliving and economies in the use of energy and in all cases shall also:\n(a)\nBe located on a tract of land having the capability of supporting such\nalternative form of development;\n(b)\nHave a harmonious relationship to adjacent neighborhoods, such as,\nwith regard to but not limited to, the location and bulk of buildings,\nmaintenance of privacy and traffic access; and\n(c)\nConstitute a form of residential development which achieves both of the\nabove objectives in a manner more effective than a subdivision of\nindividual building lots permitted on the tract.\nC.\nAdditional objectives. PRD's may also, and are encouraged to, achieve positive\npreservation of farmland in active use and other managed open space and lower-cost\ndwelling units, and, in support thereof, PRD's which achieve these objectives may\ncontain additional dwelling units, as long as the primary objectives are also achieved.\nD.\nArea requirements. The following land area and dwelling unit density requirements are\napplicable to any Planned Residential Development (PRD):\n(1)\nTract. The tract or lot containing a PRD shall have at least the following minimum\narea of contiguous, predominantly undeveloped land; provided, however, that\na special permit for a PRD on a tract of lesser area may, at the discretion of the\nCommission, be approved when the PRD contains an open space reservation\nwhich adjoins and supports a permanent open space reservation on another lot.\n"}, {"page": "74", "text": "273-.83.\nZoning Code Chapter 273 Town of Guilford\n273-83.\n(2)\nDwelling units. The maximum number of dwelling units in a PRD is determined\nbased in part upon a computation of the number of bedrooms (see $273-2.C. for\nthe definition of \"bedroom\") in relation to land area and land constraints within the\nPRD as follows:\n(a)\nFirst, the net square-foot land area of the PRD is determined by\nsubtracting the area of the following land constraints from the total PRD\nland area:\n[1]\nThe area of existing wetlands (see $273-2. for the definition of\n\"wetlands\");\n[2]\nThe area of existing watercourses (see $273-2. for the definition\nof \"watercourses\") having, at seasonal high flow or\nimpoundment, an area of 1/2 acre or more; and\n[3]\nThe significant area of steep slopes (greater than 25%).\n(b)\nIn Zones R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6 and R-7, the net square-foot land\narea of the PRD is divided by the following factor designated for each\ndistrict and multiplied by 3.75 bedrooms:\n(c)\nIn Zone R-8, the net square-foot land area of the PRD is divided by a\nfactor of 80,000 and multiplied by 2.75 bedrooms.\n(d)\nWithin this maximum bedroom count, the number of bedrooms in each\ndwelling unit may be varied, provided that the total number of bedrooms\ndoes not exceed such count.

that protection of existing and future groundwater supplies\ndemands greater action by state and local government; that a\ngroundwater protection program requires identification and delineation of\npresent and future water supplies in stratified drift aquifers supplying\ndrinking water wells.\n(b)\nThe Commission finds further that over twenty percent of Guilford\nresidents are served by public water supply wells that draw upon\nstratified drift aquifers that lie within the Town boundaries, and the other\neighty percent rely on private wells.\n(c)\nThe Commission recognizes that aquifers are vulnerable to\ncontamination from land use activities and that protection of Guilford's\ngroundwater resources is vital to ensure an adequate supply of safe,\npotable water.\n(2)\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this Section 273-92 is to safeguard public health and safety by reducing\nrisks of contamination of public water supply in the Town of Guilford by establishing\nGroundwater Protection Overlay Zones, requiring reviews of activities proposed to be\nconducted within those zones, and prohibiting certain activities within those zones.\n"}, {"page": "94", "text": "273-92.\nZoning Code Chapter 273 Town of Guilford\n273-92.\nB.\nDefinitions\n(1)\nAs used in this Section 273-92, the following definitions apply:\nAFFECTED WATER COMPANY -- means any public or private water company owning or\noperating a public water supply well within a Groundwater Protection Overlay area.\nAGRICULTURE AND FARMING -- are as defined in the Connecticut General Statutes Title1\nChapter 1, Sec.\nANCILLARY ACTIVITY -- means a regulated activity which is subordinate to, or supportive of,\nanother regulated activity conducted at the property under consideration, and which ancillary\nactivity involves the use or storage of hazardous material the quantity of which at any one time is\nless than one percent (1.0%) of the reportable quantity for that material set forth in 40 C.F.R.\n302.4 or which is no more than fifty-five gallons, or its equivalent in kilograms or pounds,\nwhichever quantity is less.\nAQUIFER -- means a geologic formation, group of formations, or part of a formation that contains\nsufficient saturated, permeable materials to yield significant quantities of water to wells and\nsprings.\nGROUNDWATER PROTECTION OVERLAY ZONE -- means that area consisting of well fields or\npotential well fields, areas of contribution, and recharge areas which is identified as a\nGroundwater Protection Overlay Zone on those maps set forth in Section 273-92.C.(1) of these\nRegulations, within which activities are regulated by this Section 273-92.\nAREA OF CONTRIBUTION -- means area of contribution as defined in Section 22a-354h of the\nGeneral statutes and as mapped by Level A mapping pursuant to Sections 22a-354b, 22a-354c,\nand 22a-354z of the General Statutes and Section 22a-354b-1 of the Regulations of Connecticut\nState Agencies, or as otherwise may be determined by the Commission.\nEXISTING WELL FIELDS -- means well fields in use by a public water supply system when\nmapping is required pursuant to Section 22a-354c of the General Statutes.\nCERTIFIED HAZARDOUS MATERIALS MANAGER -- means a qualified hazardous materials\nmanager, certified by the Institute of Hazardous Materials Management, who is qualified by\nreason of relevant specialized training and relevant specialized experience to conduct audits of\nregulated activities to ensure compliance with applicable law and to identify appropriate pollution\nprevention practices for such activities.\nCFR -- means Code of Federal Regulations.\nDEEP -- means State of Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.\nDPH -- means State of Connecticut Department of Public Health.\nFLOOR DRAIN -- means any opening in a floor or surface which opening or surface is designed\nto receive materials spilled or deposited thereon, including basement sumps.\nGROUNDWATER -- means water that lies below the surface of the earth, filling the spaces or\npores in soil and rock.\nHAZARDOUS MATERIAL -- means\n(a)\nany hazardous substance as defined in 40 CFR 302.4 and listed therein\nat Table 302.4,\n"}, {"page": "95", "text": "273-92.\nZoning Code Chapter 273 Town of Guilford\n273-92.\n(b)\nany hazardous waste as defined in Section in 22a-449(c)-101 of the\nRegulations of Connecticut State Agencies,\n(c)\nany pesticide as defined in Section 22a-47 of the General Statutes, or\n(d)\nany oil or petroleum as defined in Section 22a-448 of the General\nStatutes.\nFor the purposes of this Section 273-92, \"hazardous material\" does not include\nany gaseous substance, waste, or material;

Methods for Determining Maximum Number of Lots in an Open Space\nSubdivision\nTwo alternative methods for establishing the maximum number of lots in an Open Space\nSubdivision are available to the applicant. The method for making this determination is the\nchoice of the applicant.\nA.\nOption A; Two Plan Approach\n(1)\nThe maximum number of lots is determined by the preparation of a standard\nsubdivision plan by the applicant. The standard plan shall be prepared in\naccordance with the design standards of the Subdivision Code based on the\nzoning standards prescribed in the Zoning Code for the Zone District in which the\nproperty is located. The feasibility of each lot in this standard plan shall be based\non actual field testing, including a least one deep test pit and one percolation test\nper lot. The location of the open space required by the Subdivision Code shall\nbe shown on the plan.\n(2)\nThe Commission may request such additional information as it deems necessary\nto determine the feasibility of the lot layout of the conventional subdivision. If the\nstandard subdivision plan involves land regulated as an inland wetlands or\nwatercourse, preliminary plans shall be submitted by the applicant to the Inland\nWetlands Commission for its report, no later than the day the application is filed\nwith the Planning and Zoning Commission. In preparing its report, the Inland\nWetlands Commission may comment on the feasibility of the lot layout of the\nstandard subdivision in relation to its impact on wetlands and watercourses. The\nInland Wetlands Commission may also comment on the suitability of the\nproposed open space subdivision.\nB.\nOption B; Density Multiplier Approach\nThe maximum number of lots is determined according to the following;\nMaximum Residential Density. No Open Space Subdivision proposed using this approach shall\nexceed either the following maximum number of lots per acre of total area or the following\nmaximum number of lots per acre of developable area as defined below whichever is less and\nany calculation resulting in a fractional remainder shall be rounded down to the next lower whole\nnumber;\nFor purposes of this Section, \"Developable Area\" is defined as land on a parcel proposed as an\nOpen Space Subdivision exclusive of;\n(1)\nInland wetland or watercourse areas as defined by the Inland Wetlands and\nWatercourses Regulations of the Town of Guilford\n(2)\nAreas within the \"A\", \"AE\", or \"V\" flood zone as depicted on the Flood Hazard\nBoundary Map or the Flood Insurance Rate Map.\n175\nPage\nCELL (1, 1): \nZone District\nCELL (1, 2): \nTotal Area\nCELL (1, 3): \nDevelopable Area\nCELL (2, 1): \nR-5\nCELL (2, 2): \n.55\nCELL (2, 3): \n.70\nCELL (3, 1): \nR-6\nCELL (3, 2): \n.35\nCELL (3, 3): \n.40\nCELL (4, 1): \nR-7\nCELL (4, 2): \n.25\nCELL (4, 3): \n.30\nCELL (5, 1): \nR-8\nCELL (5, 2): \n.20\nCELL (5, 3): \n.25\n"}, {"page": "177", "text": "273-218.\nZoning Code Chapter 273 Town of Guilford\n273-218.\n(3)\nNaturally occurring slopes of land in excess of 25 percent (10 feet vertical in less\nthan 40 feet horizontal).\n(4)\nAreas subject to easements or permanent restrictions that prohibit building or\ndevelopment.\nSimultaneous with the submission of a Special Permit Application under this Section, the Open\nSpace Subdivision Plan shall be submitted to the Inland Wetlands Commission.
