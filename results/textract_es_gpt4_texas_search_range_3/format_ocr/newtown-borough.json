This Act contained\nnumerous provisions concerning the general government of the Borough of Newtown\nand Sections 42, 50 and 51 thereof were concerned with zoning of the Borough.\nSECTION 42 provided for the naming of a building inspector by the Warden and\nBoard of Burgesses in May 1931 and annually thereafter.\nSECTION 50 thereof included Sections 423 through 431 of the General Statutes,\nRevision of 1930, as amended thereafter, as a part of the zoning law of the Borough of\nNewtown.\nThe general zoning law contained in those sections as amended up to 1949 is\nnow contained in Sections 836-848 of the General Statutes, Revision of 1949. These\nsections have been extensively amended since 1949, and reference must be made to\nthe amending statutes for details.\nSECTION 51 provided for the naming of a Zoning Commission by the Warden\nand Board of Burgesses.\nThe appointments of the building inspector and the Zoning Commission were not\nmade within the time required by the Special Act of 1931, but the doings of the annual\nand special meetings at which the Warden and Burgesses were elected, and at which\nthe Warden appointed various officers, were validated in 1933 by Special Act No. 345\ncontained in Vol. 21 of the Special Laws of Connecticut at Page 1004, and approved\nMay 24, 1933.\nThe only other changes made in the Special Acts relating to zoning in the\nBorough of Newtown, are the following, all of which are contained in \"An Act Amending\nthe Charter of the Borough of Newtown,\" Special Act 106, Vol. XXVI Special Laws of\nConnecticut, Page 749, and approved April 9, 1953:\nSection 1. Section 42 of number 290 of the Special Acts in 1931 is amended to\nread as follows: At the first regular meeting of the Zoning Commission, following the\nannual Borough election in May 1953, and annually thereafter, there shall be appointed\nby the Zoning Commission a building inspector to hold office for one year or until the\nnext regular annual meeting of said Commission and he be responsible to said\nCommission. The building inspector shall possess such powers and perform such\nduties and services as the Zoning Commission may direct or as this act or the\nordinances of said Borough may specify. He shall be diligent in causing the\nenforcement of, and in detecting violations of, the provisions of the General Statutes,\nthis act or ordinance of said Borough relating to the construction, repair, alteration,\ndemolition or removal of buildings and structures within said Borough, or relating to any\nmatter within the scope of his powers and duties. If the construction of any building in\nthe course of erection shall not conform to the provisions of the General Statutes of the\nordinances of said Borough or the orders of the Zoning Commission of said Borough, he\nshall notify in writing the owner or owners, architects or builders, and if such\nPage 2\n"}, {"page": "9", "text": "construction shall not be made to so conform within 90 days, he shall notify the Zoning\nCommission, which shall take action to cause such construction to be made in\nconformity thereto.\nThis changed the original Section 42 concerning naming of a building inspector in\nseveral ways, the chief of which was to require thereafter that the building inspector be\nappointed by the Zoning Commission instead of the Warden of the Borough, and that he\nbe responsible to said Zoning Commission instead of to the Warden.\nSection 2. Section 51 of said number 290 of the Special Acts of 1931 is\namended to read as follows: At the annual meeting of said Borough to be held on the\nfirst Tuesday after the first Monday in May 1953, there shall be elected one member of\nthe Zoning Commission for a term of 5 years from the date of said annual meeting and\nat said annual meeting thereafter one member shall be elected for said term of 5 years.\nAny appointed members of said Zoning Commission shall be filled by appointment by\nthe remaining members of said Commission until the next regular annual meeting of the\nBorough. Said Zoning Commission shall be the zoning authority of the Borough of\nNewtown.\nThe above change made the Zoning Commission elected rather than appointed\nby the Warden, and provides for the filling of vacancies during the year by the remaining\nmembers of the Commission until the next regular annual meeting of the Borough.\nSection 3. Said Special Act is amended by adding Section 52 as follows: At the\nannual meeting of said Borough to be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in\nMay 1953, there shall be elected one member of the Zoning Board of Appeals for a term\nof 5 years from the date of said annual meeting and at said annual meeting thereafter\none member shall be elected for said term of 5 years. Any appointed members of said\nZoning Board of Appeals in office on the effective date of this act shall hold office until\nthe term for which they have been appointed shall expire. Any vacancy which may\noccur in said Zoning Board of Appeals shall be filled by appointment by the remaining\nmembers of said Zoning Board of Appeals until the next regular annual meeting of the\nBorough.\nThis section added an additional section to the Special Acts of 1931 and provides\nfor an elective Zoning Board of Appeals and the filling of vacancies as on the Zoning\nCommission. It was necessary to add this section because the Special Act of 1931 did\nnot specifically provide for a Zoning Board of Appeals, but by incorporation of the\nGeneral Statutes, Revision of 1930, under Section 427, there was set up a Board of\nAppeals to be appointed by the Zoning Commission.\nPage 3\n"}, {"page": "10", "text": "ARTICLE 1\nPURPOSE\nThese Zoning Regulations are promulgated to secure to the Borough of Newtown\nthe protections and benefits provided by Chapter 124 of the General Statutes, Revision\nof 1958, as amended.

The members of the committee considered State, regional and municipal\npolicies and past decisions and studied similar documents from regulatory commissions\nof village districts in other jurisdictions, as well as the federal standards for rehabilitation\nof properties.\nVillage District development is controlled by zoning regulations that are to be\ninterpreted with the help of such Village District Design Guidelines as may be adopted\nby the Commission from time to time. Guidelines have a role that is different in nature\nfrom the zoning regulations. Guidelines do not always dictate specific limits, nor does\nstrict adherence to them necessarily assure approval. Evaluation of buildings requires\njudgment in studying plans submitted. The Commission has to consider each design on\nits own merit, as well as its effect on the neighborhood and the Borough as a whole. By\nthemselves, guidelines do not guarantee excellent or even mediocre architecture. The\nimportant point is that by following these guidelines, the property owner is doing his part\nto help the Commission protect the fragile, irreplaceable environment of the Borough.\nThe guidelines are not designed to promote any particular architectural styles.\nTheir role is to protect existing properties against incorrect alterations and, as new\nbuildings are built and additions made to existing structures, to preserve the continuity\nand architectural unity of the district. Within that overall unity today are a variety of\nstyles and settings, and, as a result, different new buildings could be compatible. Some\nbuildings, however, may not be. For that reason, the intent of the guidelines is to be\nselective-and sometimes restrictive-in order to exclude designs that would erode the\nhistoric, cultural and economic resource built up over generations.\nHistoric Continuity\nThe historic value of the commercial center of the Borough is found in the design\nof its individual buildings, the street scene, and the overall relationship of buildings,\nstreets and topography as well as vehicular and pedestrian traffic and densities of uses.\nThe architecture and the street scene are a reflection of a society, economy, and\ntechnology somewhat different from today's. The Borough's commercial center evolved\nin a simpler society and before the widespread availability of electricity, large\nmachinery, easy transportation, low cost steel and glass, and elevators. The general\nappearance of street vistas and the present character of separate buildings represent\nan accumulation of many periods. The overall pattern of streets, lots, buildings, and\nPage A12-1\n"}, {"page": "94", "text": "landmarks was established in the 18th century and followed in the 19th and 20th\ncenturies. Today, caution and vigilance remain essential to the continued preservation\nof the Borough through regulation of the commercial center.\nDistinctive Character\nAnything as subtle as charm is difficult to define, and the quaint and distinctive\ncharacter of the center defies exact definition as well. Its history and that of the Town as\na whole inform it. The component parts of the Borough interrelate in a subtle and\ndistinctive way: the repetition and similarity of house after house with similar or special\narchitectural details and seldom of greater height than three stories; a mix of small and\ngrand houses on small lots facing adjacent streets; a variety of small business and\nprofessional offices. These elements have produced the ambience of the Borough for\nleisurely living and have given it quaint and distinctive New England small town charm\nthat is found with decreasing frequency.\nOverall Unity\nCourts have not attempted to define these special qualities but rather have\nlooked more toward a total concept or overall unity, as the definitive statement. The\nwording of the \"Village District\" statute, general rather than categorical, seems to take\ninto account that, within the overall entity of a Village District, there is a spread of\nhistoric styles, cultural influence, land use and density. However general this\nphraseology, its thrust and intention are unmistakable.\nDesign Quality\nWhile the quality of a building's design may not improve with age, every\ngeneration must evaluate the significance of architectural styles and examples, being\nguided by the wisdom of the past and wary of its folly. Some buildings that are\ninteresting and intriguing now, for instance, were previously considered to have very\nlittle value.\nMAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE VILLAGE DISTRICT DISTINCTIVENESS\nA.\nWhile a statement in the Introduction suggests that defining the \"quaint\nand distinctive character\" of the Borough and its commercial center is difficult, the major\nphysical components of its distinctiveness are not mysterious or elusive. The\nCommission, in attempting to fulfill its legal responsibility to preserve its rural New\nEngland village character, recognizes that size, scale and design of buildings, along\nwith workable pedestrian and vehicular traffic patterns are essential physical\ncomponents of the distinctiveness and uses them in evaluating the appropriateness of\nphysical changes proposed within the District.\nB.\nSCALE OF THE DISTRICT.\nVertical as well as horizontal distance is measured in human footsteps.\nHuman size and untaxed physical capability, along with available technology and\nmaterial, established the scale of the district. This human scale, reflected in the size of\nPage A12-2\n"}, {"page": "95", "text": "buildings, contributes more to the distinctiveness of the commercial district than any\nother single component.\nC.\nTEXTURE OF TYPICAL STREET SCENE (PATTERN CREATED BY\nSCALE, SETBACK, LANDSCAPING, DENSITY, TRAFFIC GENERATION, SIGNS,\nETC.).\nThe typical street scene facilitates pedestrian traffic unfettered access to\ncommercial uses.\nThe predominant ratio of solid wall area to area of openings, proportions\nand directional emphasis of wall openings and roof, parapet and floor shall be respected\nand maintained wherever possible.\nD.\nTYPICAL BUILDING MATERIALS (WALLS: BRICK, WOOD; ROOFS:\nSLATE, WOOD AND TILE SHINGLES).\nDesign unity within the District is greatly enhanced by the use of relatively\nfew materials and their repetition. Materials for exterior walls, doors, windows, roofs,\npaving, etc. shall be compatible in quality, color and texture with existing prevalent\nmaterials in the neighborhood.\nE.\nTYPICAL COMMERCIAL BUILDING SITE PLAN.\nThe pattern within the Borough and the District is of relatively small\nresidential and commercial buildings, punctuated by larger institutional and public\nbuildings. Business and commercial buildings, however, should not substantially\nexceed other commercial buildings in the vicinity in mass, nor should they dominate\nthem.\nF.\nLIAISON WITH TOWN.\n1.\nVisual Contact:\nBecause of the distinctive views of the Borough offered from Castle\nHill Road and other sites in the Town, care should be taken to prevent the\nintroduction of elements that would disrupt that element.\n2.\nPhysical Access:\nFree-flowing, convenient traffic patterns, both vehicular and\npedestrian, are the lifeblood of commerce and social intercourse. It is essential\nto public safety and to maintaining property values. Accordingly, it is one of the\nessential elements to be preserved, both for the short term and long term health\nof the community. Church Hill Road and Queen Street are burdened with a\nnumber of existing uses that contribute to the traffic problems currently existing\nthe District, including three schools and a significant shopping center. Church\nHill Road, moreover, previously provided the primary access for trucks between\nRoute 184 and Route 25. With the upgrade to the railroad underpass, it will\nundoubtedly again provide that access. The Borough, however, has little\ndiscretion with respect to controlling traffic facilities on those two roadways -\nroadways that are at the crossroad of the District.\nPage A12-3\n"}, {"page": "96", "text": "3.\nSize and Proportion:\nThe specific size of individual building elements makes a very\nsignificant difference in their appearance. Small differences in size may be\nreadily apparent, particularly when they constitute a large proportional difference.\nCertain elements are limited in their size because of historical\nbuilding conventions and 19th century construction technology. In some\ninstances, changes in building technology have resulted in corresponding\nchanges in the prevalent sizes of particular elements. And while technological\nimprovements through time have allowed increases in scale, such advances\nshould not dictate changes in the community. The possible should not control\nthe desirable. Thus, improperly sized buildings or uses would be detrimental to\nthe overall well being of the District, especially given limited traffic facilities.\nIn general, it can be said that buildings of various styles derive\nmuch of their effect and importance from the fact that their various parts adhere\nto systems of scale and proportion that are unique to the respective styles. So,\ntoo, with community styles. To tamper with these relationships can be detrimental\nto the sense of the building and the community alike. Although the rules of scale\nand proportion are too numerous to set down here, decisions are based upon the\nCommission's knowledge of the norms.\n4.\nDensity:\nDensity of use and mass of structure shall be vigorously held to the\nlegally permitted level, as per the Zoning Ordinance of the Borough of Newtown.\n5.\nStreetscapes:\nProposed additions to existing structures and new buildings shall\nnot be higher than the predominant building height on the block face between the\ntwo intersecting streets.\nApplicants for volumetric additions affecting the street fa\u00e7ade must\nprepare a block face drawing of the structure or structures proposed showing the\narea thereof as seen from the street, along with similar block face drawings of\nother buildings and structures in the immediate neighborhood, all rendered in the\nsame scale, so as to show the proportional relationship of the proposal to other\nbuildings and structures in the area.\nSUMMARY\nA.\nPREDOMINANT CHARACTERISTICS.\nThe distinctiveness of an area is created by its predominant\ncharacteristics, not the exceptions or deviations. While the Village District has variety in\nbuilding designs, this variety is within discernable limits. Uncontrolled variation or\ndesigns out of context will not preserve the District's distinctiveness.\nThough change is inevitable, even in an historic district, accommodating\nthe District to the requirements of contemporary life should not be achieved at the cost\nof the integrity of the district's unique environment.\nPage A12-4\n"}, {"page": "97", "text": "B.\nADDITIONS AND NEW BUILDINGS.\nAll structures should be recognizable products of their time of\nconstruction. Contemporary design for additions to existing buildings and new structures\nis encouraged, but contemporary designs must be compatible with the distinctive\ncharacter of the district and related to neighboring historic buildings in size, scale,\nmaterials, and site plan.\nThe size of business and commercial buildings must be limited as\nheretofore indicated to preserve the scale of the District. Large-scale business and\ncommercial buildings are alien to the distinctiveness of the Village District and the\nBorough.
