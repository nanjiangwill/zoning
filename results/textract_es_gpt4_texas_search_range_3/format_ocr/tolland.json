General Concepts/Design Guidelines\nArticle 7: Tolland Village Area (TVA)\nSection 7-1. Purpose\nThe Tolland Village Area Gateway District (TVA-GD) zone is a gateway to Tolland's historic town\ncenter and green. The purpose of the TVA-GD is to create an attractive entrance to Tolland and the\nTown Green while encouraging coordinated commercial retail, service, office, hospitality, multi-family,\nand mixed-use residential development that incorporate high standards of design at the interchange\ngateway entrances to the community. The goal is to promote walkable compact development-while\nrecognizing auto-oriented utility and character of the area-having scale and form consistent with\nthe natural landforms of the site, the character of the town, and is sensitive to the historic character\nof the Town Green area.\nSection 7-2. General Concepts/Design Guidelines\nThese standards and guidelines require a basic level of architectural variety, compatible scale, and\nmitigation of negative impacts. They are not intended to limit creativity. The purpose of these\nstandards and guidelines is to augment existing criteria with more specific interpretations that apply\nto the design of commercial developments. This district is intended to encourage smaller sites to\ncombine with other sites in order to provide larger-scale sites and developments.\nA. Siting\n1.\nDepending on the overall site design, and where otherwise practicable, buildings should\nbe sited toward the front of the lot and should maintain a pleasing spatial relationship\nwith other buildings and public and interior-access roadways.\n2.\nStructures should be sited in small groups wherever feasible.\n3.\nThe use of additive massing (the bulk of the building is broken into smaller sections and\nhorizontally offset) to provide visual interest is desired.\n4.\nAll effort should be made to preserve and enhance historic structures, unique landforms,\nrock outcrops, stone walls, vegetation, views, etc. and incorporate them into site design.\n5.\nSiting should not be detrimental to scenic vistas of the gateway from any public street\nincluding I-84. Items of special concern include the placement of dumpsters, loading\ndocks, roof-mounted mechanical units, and antennas.\n6.\nThe design of the storm water treatment system shall contain strategies associated with\nlow impact development to the maximum extent possible (MEP) as outlined in the Town\nof Tolland Design Manual.

If stormwater detention/retention basins are\nnecessary, provisions shall be made for shared structures and shared maintenance to the\nmaximum extent feasible.\nB. Access\n1.\nAccess management will be required on all sites, in order to reduce the number of\ndriveway cuts onto adjacent roads and mitigate the deterioration of traffic flow generally\ncaused by driveways on public roads. Access management techniques include shared\ndriveways (or provisions for future shared driveways for the first site in the area) or\ninterconnected driveways.\n2.\nUse shared parking with abutting properties wherever feasible.\n3.\nProvide safe, convenient pedestrian circulation, which also provides access to off-site\nsidewalks, trails, parks and other public places.\n4.\nLocate large parking areas at the side or rear of building where practical with landscaping\ndesigned to create visual assets.\nC. Site Amenities\n1.\nCreate pedestrian spaces such as plazas, \"greens\", commons and terraces within the\ndevelopment.\n2.\nAdd or create amenities such as benches, fountains, sculptures, art, bike racks, sitting\nwalls, planters, period-style lighting or banners.\n3.\nUse creative landscaping design, with plantings of sufficient size and quantity to clearly\nenhance the site.\nD. Architectural Guidelines\nThe purpose of architectural design review is to provide insights regarding Tolland's design\nobjectives, to encourage aesthetically pleasing commercial structures, to reduce massive scale and\nuniform impersonal appearance, to provide visual interest and scale consistent with the Town's\nidentity, size and character. All applications for Site Plan or Special Permit shall require design review\nwith consideration given to the following guidelines:\n1. Facades.\na.\nNo uninterrupted length of any facade shall exceed 100 feet and shall\nincorporate wall plane projections or recesses.\nPage 7-2\n"}, {"page": "68", "text": "Section 7-3. Uses\nb. The ground floor facade facing a public street should incorporate display\nwindows, lawnings or other such features to create visual interest.\nC. Windows should be recessed and should include visually prominent sills,\nshutters or other such forms of framing.\nd. All building facades that are visible from a public street, including I-84 and\nits ramps, should be attractively designed with windows and other\narchitectural elements so that no visible elevations look like the back of a\nbuilding.\n2. Roofs.\na. Variations in roof lines should be used to add interest and complement the\ncharacter of the Town.\nb. Rooftop equipment such as HVAC units shall be screened from public view\nwith parapets featuring three-dimensional cornice treatments.\n3.\nMaterials, colors and detail features.\na. Building facades and public-facing building sides should include a repeating\npattern including color, texture or change of materials.\nb. Predominant exterior building materials should be high quality materials\nsuch as brick, wood, sandstone and other native stone or tinted textured,\nconcrete masonry units.\nC.\nFacade colors should be low reflectance, subtle, neutral or earth tone colors.\nThe use of high intensity colors, metallic colors, black or fluorescent colors is\ndiscouraged.\nd.

General Concepts/Design Guidelines\nThese standards and guidelines require a basic level of architectural variety, compatible scale, and\nmitigation of negative impacts. They are not intended to limit creativity. The purpose of these\nstandards and guidelines is to augment existing criteria with more specific interpretations that apply\nto the design of GDD developments. This district is intended to encourage smaller sites to combine\nwith other sites in order to provide larger-scale sites and developments.\nA. Siting\n1.\nDepending on the overall site design, and where otherwise practicable, buildings should\nbe sited toward the front of the lot and should maintain a pleasing spatial relationship\nwith other buildings and public and interior-access roadways.\n2.\nStructures should be sited in small groups wherever feasible.\n3.\nThe use of additive massing (the bulk of the building is broken into smaller sections and\nhorizontally offset) to provide visual interest is desired.\n4.\nAll effort should be made to preserve and enhance historic structures, unique landforms,\nrock outcrops, stone walls, vegetation, views, etc. and incorporate them into site design.\n5.\nSiting should not be detrimental to scenic vistas of the gateway from any public street\nincluding I-84. Items of special concern include the placement of dumpsters, loading\ndocks, roof-mounted mechanical units, and antennas.\n6.\nThe design of the storm water treatment system shall contain strategies associated with\nlow impact development to the maximum extent possible (MEP) as outlined in the Town\nPage 12-1\n"}, {"page": "83", "text": "Section 10-2.

Access\n1.\nAccess management will be required on all sites, in order to reduce the number of\ndriveway cuts onto adjacent roads and mitigate the deterioration of traffic flow generally\ncaused by driveways on public roads. Access management techniques include shared\ndriveways (or provisions for future shared driveways for the first site in the area) or\ninterconnected driveways.\n2.\nUse shared parking with abutting properties wherever feasible.\n3.\nProvide safe, convenient pedestrian circulation, which also provides access to off-site\nsidewalks, trails, parks and other public places.\n4.\nLocate large parking areas at the side or rear of building where practical with landscaping\ndesigned to create visual assets.\nC. Site Amenities\n1.\nCreate pedestrian spaces such as plazas, \"greens\", commons and terraces within the\ndevelopment.\n2.\nAdd or create amenities such as benches, fountains, sculptures, art, bike racks, sitting\nwalls, planters, period-style lighting or banners.\n3.\nUse creative landscaping design, with plantings of sufficient size and quantity to clearly\nenhance the site.\nD. Architectural Guidelines\nThe purpose of architectural design review is to provide insights regarding Tolland's design\nobjectives, to encourage aesthetically pleasing commercial structures, to reduce massive scale and\nuniform impersonal appearance, to provide visual interest and scale consistent with the Town's\nidentity, size and character. All applications for Special Permit shall require design review with\nconsideration given to the following guidelines:\n1. Facades.\na.

Low Impact Development\nto land development projects. LID utilizes many tools to reduce the impact of development on the\nenvironment. A primary benefit of LID is a better balance between conservation of natural resources,\ngrowth, ecosystem protection and the public health.\nB. Goals\n1.\nPreserve open space within developments by using flexible residential development\nsubdivision standards as found in Section 5-4.\n2.\nIncorporate natural site elements (ridge lines, significant trees, open meadows, suitable\nsoils for infiltration, wetlands and streams) into the design as features.\n3.\nMinimize land clearing and disturbance and increase natural landscape buffers at the limit\nof development to improve storm water management.\n4.\nIncorporate decentralized storm water management systems into the site design, treat\nstorm water runoff at its source and disconnect impervious areas.\n5.\nMaintain pre-development times of concentrations for post-development runoff.\n6. Maintain sheet flow to the maximum extent possible, avoid concentrating runoff, and\nreduce runoff volumes by infiltration.\n7.\nProvide water quality treatment to remove pollutants from storm water, pollution.\n8. Modify human activities to reduce the introduction of pollutants into the environment.\n9.\nEncourage public education and participation in environmental protection within the\ncommunity.\nC. Benefits\nThere are many benefits associated with the use of low impact development for all of the\nstakeholders in the development field -the environment, the municipality, and the developer. The\nbenefits of LID for each are:\n1.\nEnvironmental benefits:\na.\nPreserve the biological and ecological integrity of natural systems through the\npreservation of trees and natural vegetation.\nb. Protect the water quality by reducing sediment, nutrient, and toxic loads to\nwetland/watercourse aquatic environments and also terrestrial plants and animals.\n2.\nMunicipal benefits:\na.

Low Impact Development Strategies\n1.\nVegetation and Soils: retain native forest cover on undeveloped sites, restore vegetated\narea on previously cleared sites when possible as vegetation captures rainfall, thus\nincreasing evapotranspiration and infiltration.\n2. Site Design:\na. Define and locate critical resource areas, such as wetlands/watercourses, unusual\nforest features, and soils with moderate to high infiltrative capacities.\nb. Locate roads, driveways, parking areas, home sites and other buildings away from\ncritical resource areas.\nC. Minimize impervious surfaces such as roads, driveways, parking areas, and roof tops.\nd. Eliminate direct discharges of runoff from impervious areas to wetlands and\nwatercourses.\n3.\nStorm Water Management:\na. Reduce reliance on the use of traditional storm water collection and conveyance\nsystems (catch basins, pipes, and detention basins) and use small scale storm water\nmanagement systems, such as bioretention and rain gardens. Integrate source storm\nwater controls during the design process.\nb. Create a site design that slows runoff from rainfall events and increases the amount\nof time that runoff stays on the site.
