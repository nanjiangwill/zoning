Purpose\nThe purpose of this section is:\n1. Encourage permanent preservation & protection of open space, greenway\nconnections, scenic vistas, agricultural lands, forest lands, water quality and other\ncultural, historical or natural resources, which has an overall effect of increasing\nland values;\n2. Facilitate the construction of streets, utilities, building sites and public services in\na more economical and efficient manner with reduced maintenance costs;\n3. Provide wildlife corridors connecting open spaces and protecting wildlife habitat;\n4. Provide land for active recreation where needed;\n5. Reduce demand for public-funded green space and providing means for expanding\npublic trails and greenways.\nB. Density Limitation Formula\nThe maximum number of lots permitted in a subdivision is determined by multiplying the developable\narea of the parcel of land (in acres) by the density factor for that zone. No parcel of land or lot shall\nhave the density factor reapplied once the maximum lot yield has been reached for the original parcel\nof land that existed as of July 15, 2011. A fractional remainder shall be \"rounded up\" if the product of\nthe calculation is above 0.50 lots. A data table shall be included on the subdivision plans showing\ntotal acreage, density factor, open space (Fee-in-lieu-of open space at commission's discretion),\ndevelopable acreage, lot yield, and remaining land provision acreage (if desired by applicant).\nThe Planning and Zoning Commission strongly recommends that the applicant participate in a pre-\napplication meeting with town staff to discuss the conceptual aspects of the proposed development\nincluding storm water infrastructure and associated technical reporting and to prepare and present a\nconceptual plan, or its equivalent.

Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water\nor erosion or, in flood heights or velocities;\n2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be\nprotected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;\n3. Control the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective\nbarriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;\n4. Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or\nflood damage; and,\n5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood\nwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\nSection 5.2\nObjectives\nThe objectives of this section are:\n1. To protect human life and health;\n2. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\n3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally\nundertaken at the expense of the general public;\n4. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,\ntelephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in flood plains;\n5.

For the purposes of this definition\n\"substantial improvement\" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or\nother structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external\ndimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either: (i) any project for improvement\nof a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are\nsolely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or (ii) any alteration of a structure listed on the National\nRegister of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.\nSection 5.4\nGeneral Provisions\nA.\nLands to which this Ordinance Applies.

When such data is provided by an applicant or whenever such data is\navailable from any other source (in response to the Town's request or not), the Town shall adopt a\nregulatory floodway based on the principle that the floodway must be able to convey the waters of\nthe base flood without increasing the water surface elevation more than 1 foot at any point along the\nwatercourse.\n5.6.3 Specific Standards\nThe following provisions shall apply in all areas of special flood hazard (A1-30, AE, and AH Zones where\nbase flood elevations data has been provided).\nA.

Such certification shall be provided to the Zoning Enforcement Officer.\nC. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry\ndebris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:\nD. Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development\nshall be prohibited unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided\ndemonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the\noccurrence of the base flood discharge.
