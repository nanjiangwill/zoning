These new services transmit radio waves of such a frequency and\npower that will likely require numerous antenna locations. These antennas may be located on\nbuildings, water towers, and other similar structures but will also frequently be located on new or\nenlarged towers. This requires that the Town of Vernon regulate these wireless communication\nsystem facilities in a different manner than conventional television and radio transmission\ntowers, which are able to transmit their signals at much greater distances.\nA number of providers of wireless communication services have recently been licensed by the\nFederal Communications Commission and additional providers are expected to be licensed in the\nCELL (1, 1): \n22.2.17.2\nCELL (1, 2): \nThe previous application had paid all fees in full;\nCELL (2, 1): \n22.2.17.3\nCELL (2, 2): \nMinimal additional staff time will be needed for review and processing the application;\nCELL (3, 1): \n22.2.17.4\nCELL (3, 2): \nThe application is from a municipal entity;\nCELL (4, 1): \n22.2.17.5 The application pertains to a non-profit entity.\nCELL (4, 2): \n22.2.17.5 The application pertains to a non-profit entity.\n"}, {"page": "140", "text": "near future.
