Purpose and Authority\n101\nTITLE\nThese Regulations shall be known as the \"Zoning Regulations, Town of North Stonington,\nConnecticut,\" and are referred to herein as \"these Regulations.\"\n102\nAUTHORITY\nThese Regulations have been promulgated by the North Stonington Planning and Zoning\nCommission, hereinafter referred to as the Commission, in accordance with and under the authority\nprescribed by Chapter 124 of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended. The Town's initial\nZoning Regulations were adopted by the Commission on May 21, 1964.\n103\nPURPOSE\nThese Regulations are adopted to further the goals and objectives of the Plan of Conservation and\nDevelopment and to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic, flood and\nother dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to\nprevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate the\nadequate provision for transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public\nrequirements; to preserve the character of the various parts of the Town; to conserve the value of\nbuildings; to protect historic factors; to control soil erosion and sedimentation; to encourage energy\nefficient patterns of development, the use of solar and other renewable forms of energy, and energy\nconservation; and to encourage the most appropriate use of land throughout the Town of North\nStonington. In addition, these Regulations are adopted to give consideration to the character of each\narea and its peculiar suitability for particular uses; conserve the value of buildings and encourage\nthe most appropriate use of land throughout North Stonington; protect historic factors and\nresources; protect existing and potential public surface and ground drinking water supplies; provide\nfor the development of housing opportunities, including opportunities for multifamily dwellings,\nconsistent with soil types, terrain and infrastructure capacity, for all residents of North Stonington\nand the planning region; and provide for housing choice and economic diversity in housing,\nincluding housing that will meet identified housing needs. Further, these regulations, and\nsubsequent amendments thereto, are enacted to carry out the purposes set forth in Chapter 124, and\nparticularly \u00a78-2, of the Connecticut General Statutes.\n104\nZONING DISTRICTS AND OVERLAY AREAS\nThe Town of North Stonington is divided into the following principal Zoning Districts:\n(R40)\nHigh Density Residential District\n(R60)\nMedium Density Residential District\n(R80)\nRural Residential Preservation District\n(C)\nCommercial District\n(VC)\nVillage Commercial\n(HC)\nHighway Commercial District\n(ED)\nEconomic Development District\n(RC)\nResort Commercial District\n(I)\nIndustrial District\nIn addition to the foregoing principal zoning districts, the following Overlay Areas have been\nestablished:\n(VPO)\nVillage Preservation Overlay Area\n(WSPO)\nWater Supply Protection Overlay Area\n(SUO)\nSeasonal Use Overlay Area\n1-1\n"}, {"page": "5", "text": "Chapter 1 - Purpose and Authority\n(AHO)\nAffordable Housing Overlay Area: Meadow Court\n105\nZONING MAP\nThe boundaries of the various Zoning Districts and Overlay Areas are as shown on the \"North\nStonington, Connecticut, Zoning Map\" which accompanies, and which, with all explanatory\nmatters thereon, is a part of these Regulations. A copy of the Zoning Map, indicating the latest\namendments, shall be kept up-to-date in the Land Use Office and the Office of the Town Clerk for\nthe use and benefit of the public.\n106\nDISTRICT BOUNDARIES\nIn determining the boundaries of Zoning Districts shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules\nshall apply.\n106.1\nWhere district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the center lines of\nstreets, highways, waterways or railroad rights-of-way or such lines extended, such center\nlines shall be construed to be the boundaries.\n106.2\nWhere district boundaries are not indicated as approximately following the center lines of\nstreets, highways, waterways or railroad rights-of-way or such lines extended, the\nboundaries shall be determined in accordance with the following rules:\nA.\nwhere district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the property\nlines of parks or other publicly owned lands, such lines shall be construed to be\nsuch boundaries;\nB.\nin all cases where a district boundary line is located not farther than 15 feet away\nfrom a lot line of record, such boundary line shall be construed to coincide with\nsuch lot line; and\nC.\nin all other cases where dimensions are not shown on the map, the location of\nboundaries shown on the map shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing\nthereon.\nD.\nWhen a district boundary cannot be determined using the methods described\nabove, the Commission may use any reasonably available information to establish\nthe location of the boundary.\n106.3 Lot Divided by District Boundary. If a lot is divided by a district boundary, the bulk\nregulations for the district having the largest minimum lot area requirement shall be\napplicable to the entire lot. For example, if a lot is divided by the boundary between the\nR40 and R60 Zoning Districts, the bulk regulations for the R60 Zoning District shall apply\nto the whole lot. The buffers required for any lot divided by a district boundary shall be\ndetermined in each part by the buffer requirements for the district in which that part is\nlocated. The uses allowed on any lot divided by a district boundary shall be determined in\neach part by the use regulations for the district in which that part is located. This provision,\nhowever, shall not be deemed, on its own, to allow multiple principal uses on a single lot.\nFor example, if a single-family home is already located on a lot divided by the boundary\nbetween a residential and commercial district, no commercial use may be made of that\nportion of the lot lying in the commercial district.\n1-2\n"}, {"page": "6", "text": "Chapter 1 - Purpose and Authority\n107\nPERMITS AND APPLICABILITY\nA. No building and/or portion of a building shall be erected, moved or structurally altered; nor\nshall any use be established or changed; nor shall any excavation be made for a proposed\nbuilding or structure, until a Zoning Permit has been issued by the Zoning Enforcement Officer\nor the Commission indicating conformance:\n1. with these Regulations; or\n2. to a Site Plan or Special Permit approval granted by the Planning and Zoning\nCommission; or\n3. to a variance granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals.\nB. No building and/or portion of a building shall be erected, moved or structurally altered until a\nBuilding Permit has been issued by the Building Official and in most instances, approval\nhas\ngiven by Ledge Light Health District.\nC. No Accessory use/structure shall be established/erected without first establishing/erecting a\nprincipal use/structure except as provided for elsewhere in these regulations.\n108\nCONSISTENCY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL\nThese Regulations are intended to comply with all applicable provisions of state and federal law.\nIn particular, many of the procedural requirements set forth in these Regulations are based solely\non state requirements that were in effect at the time of adoption. In the event that state or federal\nlaw is later modified or is determined by a court to be inconsistent with any provisions of these\nRegulations, it is the intention of the Commission that the relevant provisions shall be deemed\nsuperseded by the applicable requirements of state or federal law and that those requirements shall\nbe applied as though they were expressly incorporated herein.\n1-3\n"}, {"page": "7", "text": "Chapter 2 - Interpretation\n201\nGENERAL PROVISIONS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF THESE REGULATIONS\n201.1 Prohibited if not permitted\nAny use of land, buildings or structures not expressly permitted by these Regulations as a\nprincipal use in a particular Zoning District, or allowable as an accessory use to such a\nprincipal use, is prohibited in that District.\n201.2 Application of Other Laws\nExcept as expressly provided herein, these Regulations operate independently from laws\nand regulations established by agencies other than the Commission. The fact that a use,\nincluding a building or other structure, may comply with these Regulations does not mean\nthat it complies with all other applicable laws, regulations or other legal restrictions or\nrequirements. Therefore, the issuance of any permit or approval by the Commission or its\nauthorized agent(s) does not necessarily mean that a landowner has obtained all necessary\npermits or approvals for the use, or that the use may be lawfully established without such\nother permits or approvals. By way of example only, the Commission might issue a permit\nfor a use that is, nonetheless, not allowable due to private land restrictions or because state\nor federal law may restrict such use. The Commission has no legal authority to determine\nwhether legal restrictions other than those established by these Regulations, or by the North\nStonington Subdivision Regulations, apply to any particular parcel of land. Likewise, the\nCommission has no responsibility to alert an applicant or landowner about the possible\napplication of any other laws, regulations, or similar restrictions that may affect any parcel\nof land.\n201.3 Conflicting Standards\nWhen two or more differing standards are provided in these Regulations for any use, the\nmost restrictive provision shall apply.\n210.4 References to Statutes and Regulations\nWhenever any reference is made in these Regulations to a federal or state statute or\nregulation, the reference shall be interpreted to mean the statute or regulation as it may\nhave been most recently amended, revised or renumbered (i.e., the most current form of\nthe statute or regulation), unless the context of the reference to the statute or regulation\nrequires a different interpretation.\n202\nSPECIFICALLY PROHIBITED USES\nWithout limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions, the following uses are expressly\nprohibited in the Town of North Stonington:\nA. landfills, resource recovery facilities, and non-municipal transfer stations, recycling facilities,\njunk yards, private dumps, and the dumping or incineration of toxic substances, effluent,\ngarbage or rubbish;\nB. uses that involve any activity, or the use of any material, defined as \"obscene\" or \"obscene as\nto minors\" pursuant to $53a-193 of the Connecticut General Statutes, as amended;\nC. the mining of trap-rock and/or other quarry-type stone;\nD. circuses and amusement parks as principal uses;\n2-1\n"}, {"page": "8", "text": "Chapter 2 - Interpretation\nE. the distillation of bones, and tanneries;\nF. coal or petroleum distillation or derivation of byproducts; blast furnaces or smelting of ores or\nmetal, manufacture of explosives; manufacture of cement, asphalt, bituminous, lime, gypsum,\nor plaster of paris, or chlorine, or carbolic, hydrochloric, nitric, picric or sulphuric acid;\nfat\nrendering in the manufacture of tallow, grease or oil; refining and recovery of products from\nfish or animal refuse; composting in excess of one hundred cubic yards per year (unless\nassociated with a permitted waste to energy facility or other approved biotech facility); fuel\nmanufacture and storage by other than a public utility company except for on-site use; and\nG. the use, for permanent storage outside of a building, of trailers and all other cargo containers\ncustomarily used for road or sea transportation.

The Commission reserves the right\nto specify the manner in which it wishes the ZEO to enforce these Regulations and may\nadopt specific policies for enforcement.

Designs for complying\nwith this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or\narchitect, or meet the following minimum criteria listed in sections (1)-(7) below:\n1. Provide a minimum of two (2) openings (hydraulic flood vents) having a total net\narea of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area\nsubject to flooding. These hydraulic openings must be located on at least two\ndifferent walls. Only the area (square footage) that lies below the BFE can be used\nin the calculation of net area of vents required. If the structure has more than one\nenclosed area, openings must be installed in the exterior walls of each enclosed\narea SO that flood waters can enter directly from the outside;\n2. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. At\nleast one side of the structure's fully enclosed area must be at or above grade. Fill\nplaced around the foundation walls must be graded SO that the elevation inside the\nenclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent outside elevation on at least\none side of the building. The finished floor of the enclosed area shall be no lower\nthan the bottom of the foundation openings. The foundation slab of a residential\nstructure, including the slab of a crawlspace, must be set equal to the outside\nfinished grade on at least one side of the building;\n3. The openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or\ndevices provided they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters in both\ndirections without any external influence or control such as human intervention,\nincluding the use of electrical and other non-automatic mechanical means. Other\ncoverings may be designed and certified by a registered professional engineer or\n3-13\n"}, {"page": "23", "text": "Chapter 3 - General Provisions\napproved by the Planning and Zoning Commission;\n4. The area cannot be used as finished living space. Use of the enclosed area shall be\nthe minimum necessary and shall only be used for the parking of vehicles, building\naccess or limited storage. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum\nnecessary to allow for the parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage\nof\nmaintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior\ndoor) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). The enclosed area shall not\nbe used for human habitation or partitioned into separate rooms;\n5. All interior walls, floor, and ceiling materials located below the BFE shall be\nunfinished and resistant to flood damage;\n6. Electrical, plumbing, HVAC ductwork, machinery or other utility equipment and\nconnections that service the structure (including, but not limited to, furnaces, oil\nor propane tanks, air conditioners, heat pumps, hot water heaters, ventilation,\nwashers, dryers, electrical junction boxes, circuit breaker boxes and food freezers)\nare prohibited in the fully enclosed area below the BFE. Utilities or service\nequipment located in this enclosed area, even if elevated above the BFE in the\nspace, will subject the structure to increased flood insurance rates.\n7. A residential building with a structurally attached garage having the floor slab\nbelow the BFE is considered an enclosed area below the BFE and must meet the\nstandards of sections (1)-(6) listed above. A garage attached to a residential\nstructure, constructed with the garage floor slab below the BFE, must be designed\nto allow for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in both directions. Flood\nopenings or vents are required in the exterior walls of the garage or in the garage\ndoors. The human intervention necessary to open garage doors when flooding\noccurs is not an acceptable means of meeting the openings requirements. In\naddition to the automatic entry of floodwaters, the areas of the garage below BFE\nmust be constructed with flood resistant materials. Garages attached to non-\nresidential structures must also meet the aforementioned requirements or be dry\nflood proofed as per the requirements of $307.6(B).\nD. Manufactured (Mobile) Homes and Recreational Vehicles (RVs).\n1. In all Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA), any manufactured (mobile) homes to\nbe newly placed, undergoing a substantial improvement or repaired as a result of\nsubstantial damage, shall be elevated SO that the bottom of the lowest floor is at or\nabove the base flood elevation (BFE). The manufactured home must also meet all\nthe construction standards per $307.6. This includes SFHAs outside\na\nmanufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or\nsubdivision, in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, in an\nexpansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or on a site in an\nexisting park which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a\nresult of a flood.\n3-14\n"}, {"page": "24", "text": "Chapter 3 - General Provisions\n2. All manufactured (mobile) homes within a SFHA shall be placed on a permanent\nfoundation which itself is securely anchored and to which the structure is securely\nanchored SO that it will resist flotation, lateral movement and hydrostatic pressures.\nAnchoring may include, but not be limited to, the use of over-the-top or frame ties\nto ground anchors.\n3. All manufactured (mobile) homes within a SFHA shall be installed using methods\nand practices which minimize flood damage. Adequate access and drainage should\nbe provided. Elevation construction standards include piling foundations placed\nno more than ten (10) feet apart, and reinforcement is provided for piers more than\nsix (6) feet above ground level.\n4. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within a SFHA shall either (i) be on the site\nfor fewer than 180 consecutive days, and (ii) be fully licensed and ready for\nhighway use, OR (iii) meet all the general standards of $307.4.1 and the elevation\nand anchoring requirement listed above for a manufactured home in $307.6(D).

It, too, is\nconfined to the southern part of Town and has excellent road access.\n[R-80]\nThis Zoning District extends throughout the northern three quarters of the Town,\nand it includes most of the Town's reserved open space, agriculture, and\nnumerous scenic and rugged topographic features worthy of preservation in their\nnatural state. The majority of this area is particularly remote from municipal\nfacilities and services and is very lightly developed at present. The major\nobjectives of these Regulations with regard to this district are to maintain the low\ndensity of development in this area, encourage a continuation of agricultural\nactivities, and preserve the remote feel and rural character.\n[SUOA] The Seasonal Use Overlay Area (SUOA) is designed to provide flexibility to\nseasonal residential uses on small lots that were created before May 21, 1964.\n501\nDIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS (See Chapter 4 for full details)\nThe following dimensional requirements shall apply to lots within the specified Zoning Districts,\nexcept as may be otherwise expressly provided in these Regulations.
