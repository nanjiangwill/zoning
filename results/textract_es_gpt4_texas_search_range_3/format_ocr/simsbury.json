Claims of hardship based on the structure, on economic\ngain or loss, or on personal or self-created circumstances are not sufficient cause\nfor the granting of a variance.\n2.\nNo variance may be issued within a regulatory floodway that will result in any\nincrease in the 100-year flood levels. A variance may be issued for new\nconstruction, substantial improvements and other development necessary for the\nconduct of a \"functionally dependent use\" provided that there is good and\nsufficient cause for providing relief; and the variance does not cause a rise in the\n100-year flood level within a regulatory floodway. The structure and other\ndevelopment must be protected by methods that minimize flood damages.\n3.\nAny applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that\nthe structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below\nthe base flood elevation (BFE), and that the cost of flood insurance will be\ncommensurate with the increased risk resulting from the lowest floor elevation\nup to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage.\n"}, {"page": "178", "text": "- 178 of 182 -\nARTICLE THIRTEEN\nAMENDMENTS\nThese regulations may be amended or repealed as provided in the Zoning Law either on the\ninitiative of the Zoning Commission or by petition.
