Title and Authority\n(a) Aquifers are an essential natural resource and a major source of public drinking water for\nthe State of Connecticut. Use of groundwater will increase as the population grows and\nopportunities for new surface water supplies diminish due to the rising cost of land and\nincreasingly intense development. At the same time, numerous drinking water wells have\nbeen contaminated by certain land use activities, and others are now threatened. To address\nthis problem, Connecticut has established the Aquifer Protection Area Program\n(Connecticut General Statutes $22a-354a to $22a-354bb) to identify critical water supply\naquifers and to protect them from pollution by managing land use. Protection requires\ncoordinated responsibilities shared by the state, municipality and water companies to ensure\na plentiful supply of public drinking water for present and future generations. It is therefore\nthe purpose of these regulations to protect aquifer protection areas within the City of\nMiddletown by making provisions for:\n(1)\nimplementing regulations consistent with state regulations and An Act Concerning\nAquifer Protection Areas, Connecticut General Statutes $22a-354a to \u00a722a-354bb\n(\"the Act\");\n(2)\ndelineating aquifer protection areas on the city/town zoning or inland wetland and\nwatercourse areas maps;\n(3)\nregulating land use activity within the aquifer protection area including: prohibiting\ncertain new activities; registering existing regulated activities; and issuing permits for\nnew regulated activities at registered facilities; and\n(4)\nadministering and enforcing these regulations.\n(b) These regulations shall be known as the Aquifer Protection Area Regulations (the \"APA\nRegulations\") of the City of Middletown.\n(c) These regulations were adopted and may be amended, from time to time, in accordance\nwith the provisions of $22a-354p of An Act Concerning Aquifer Protection Areas, the\nConnecticut General Statutes $22a-354a to \u00a722a-354bb and the Regulations of Connecticut\nState Agencies $22a-354i-1 through $22a-354i-10.\n(d)\nThe Planning and Zoning Commission of the City of Middletown is established as the\nAquifer Protection Agency (the \"Agency\") in accordance with the \"Ordinance for the\nEstablishment of an Aquifer Protection Agency,\" (the \"APA Ordinance\") effective January\n3, 2006, and shall implement the purposes and provisions of the APA Ordinance and the\nAct.\n-2-\n"}, {"page": "265", "text": "(e) The Agency shall administer all provisions of the Act and shall approve or deny\nregistrations, issue permits, issue permits with terms, conditions, limitations or\nmodifications, or deny permits for all regulated activities in aquifer protection areas in the\nCity of Middletown pursuant to the Act.\nSECTION 2.
