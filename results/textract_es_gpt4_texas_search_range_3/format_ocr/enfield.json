Accessory off street parking facilities in existence on the effective date of these\nRegulations shall not hereafter be reduced below, or if already less than required shall not be further\nreduced below, the requirements for a similar new building or use under the provisions of these\nRegulations.\nB. No building or structure shall be erected, enlarged, modified, or its use changed to a use requiring\nadditional off-street parking and/or loading spaces unless permanently maintained off-street parking and\nloading spaces are provided for the new use in accordance with the provisions of these Regulations, except\nwhere such change of use, new building, alteration or increase in floor area requires no increase in parking\nover what presently exists.\n10.10.1 General Requirements\nA. Accessory off street parking and off-street loading facilities shall be provided as required by these\nRegulations for all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land established in each district after\nthe effective date of these Regulations.\nB.

Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall hereafter be changed to a new use, parking or\nloading facilities shall be provided as required for such new use. However, if the said building or structure\nwas erected prior to the effective date of these Regulations, additional parking or loading facilities are\nmandatory only in the amount by which the requirements for the new use would exceed those for the\nexisting use if the latter were subject to the parking and loading provisions of these Regulations\nD. In situations where parking facilities are permitted on land other than the lot on which the building or use\nbeing served is located, such facilities shall be in the same possession as the lot occupied by the building\nor use to which the parking facilities are accessory. Such possession may be either by deed or long-term\nlease, the term of such lease to be determined by the Commission. The owner of the land on which the\nparking facilities are to be located shall be bound by covenants, filed on record in the Office of the Town\nClerk, requiring such owner, his or her heirs and assigns, to maintain the required number of parking\nfacilities for the duration of the use served or of said lease, whichever shall terminate sooner.\nE. Off street parking facilities required as an accessory use to all uses permitted by these Regulations shall be\nsolely for the parking of passenger vehicles of patrons, occupants, and employees of those uses.\nF. When the application of these off-street parking Regulations results in a requirement of not more than three\n(3) spaces on a single lot in any Business District, such parking spaces need not be provided. However,\nwhere two (2) or more uses are located on a single lot only one of these uses shall be eligible for the above\nexemption.
