Title and Authority\nAquifers are an essential natural resource and a major source of public\ndrinking water for the State of Connecticut. Use of groundwater will\nincrease as the population grows and opportunities for new surface water\nsupplies diminish due to the rising cost of land and increasingly intense\ndevelopment. At the same time, numerous drinking water wells have\nbeen contaminated by certain land use activities, and others are now\nthreatened. Thus, protecting groundwater from pollution requires\ncoordinated responsibilities shared by the state, municipality, and water\ncompanies to ensure a plentiful supply of public drinking water for\npresent and future generations. It is therefore the purpose of these\nregulations to protect aquifer protection zones within the Town of\nThompson by making provisions for:\na. Regulating certain land use activities within the aquifer\nprotection zones,\nb. Delineating the aquifer protection zones of the Town\nGroundwater or Aquifer Resources Map,\nC. Administering and enforcing these regulations.\nB. Aquifer Protection Zone\n74\n"}, {"page": "79", "text": "The Aquifer Protection Zone shall consist of two (2) distinct zones:\nAquifer Protection Zone I (APZ I) and Aquifer Protection Zone II (APZ II).\nThese Aquifer Protection Zones consist of land overlying stratified drift\naquifers which are present or potential sources of municipal water\nsupply. The intent of these regulations in this section is: to prevent the\ncontamination and other impairment of these valuable groundwater\nresources; to establish aquifer protection zones and regulate activities\nwhich pose a threat to groundwater when located entirely or in part\nwithin aquifer protection zones; to establish best management practices\nfor existing and future regulated activities; and to provide for a review\nprocess for exempting certain activities in an aquifer protection zone in\ncases where the Commission determines that such activities do not pose\na threat to the groundwater.\na. APZ I \"Aquifer Protection Zone I\" refers to the wellhead\nprotection zone for Thompson's existing public water\nsupply, and it is currently mapped to a Level B standard as\nrequired by Connecticut General Statutes (C.G.S.), Section\n22a-354c.

All proposed activities on parcels within or partially within one of the\nAquifer Protection Zones, APZ I and APZ II, shall be reviewed by the\nZoning Enforcement Officer to determine if the proposal poses a threat\nto groundwater. Groundwater threats are identified in the Connecticut\nDEP Bulletin #26, titled \"Protecting Connecticut's Groundwater\", pages\n106 through 116.

Upon review, if the Zoning Enforcement\nOfficer finds that the proposed activity poses no threat to groundwater\nas described in the Connecticut DEP Bulletin #26, then the activity will be\nexempt from requiring a permit.\nIf the Zoning Enforcement Officer finds that the proposed activity poses a\npotential threat to groundwater, then a Special Permit application as\ndescribed in Section VII of these regulations will be required. The\napplicant will be required to utilize Best Management Practices (BMPs) in\naccordance with the standards set forth in the Connecticut DEP's Best\nManagement Practices document, as part of the Special Permit\napplication. BMPs are required in order to avoid contamination/pollution\nof the groundwater.\nAll completed reviews with the Zoning Enforcement Officer's findings and\ncomments shall be kept on file by the Zoning Enforcement Officer and\nshall be presented to the Commission at the next regularly scheduled\nmeeting.\n2. Activities which pose a significant threat to groundwater quality are\nlisted in the Connecticut DEP Bulletin #26, titled \"Protecting\nConnecticut's Groundwater\", pages 29, and 106 through 116.

These\nregulations are designed to insure that land will be usable for\nresidential, commercial, or agricultural purposes following the removal\nof top soil, sand, gravel, or other fill, and to provide for the\nreestablishment of ground level and protection of the area by suitable\ncover.\n1. EXEMPT OPERATIONS\nTemporary earthwork for the following operations are permitted in\nany zoning district of the Town, provided they meet all other\nrequirements of the Zoning Regulations, and further provided not\nmore than 3,000 cubic yards of any earth material is removed from\nthe site.\na.

PURPOSE\nTo provide for the location of wireless communication towers,\nantennas and facilities while protecting neighborhoods and\nminimizing adverse visual and operational effects through careful\ndesign, siting and screening consistent with the provisions of the\n1996 Telecommunications Act. This section of the Zoning Regulations\nis consistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1996 in that it does\nnot discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services,\nor regulate the placement, construction, and modification of personal\nwireless service facilities on the basis of environmental effects of\nradio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply\nwith FCC regulations concerning such emissions. Other specific\nwireless telecommunication purposes are as follows:\na. To encourage use of nonresidential buildings and structures, such\nas water storage tanks.\nb. To require joint use of new or existing towers and facilities\nwhenever possible.\nC. To avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower\nfailure through engineering and careful siting of towers.\nd. To accommodate the need for wireless communication towers and\nantennas while regulating their location and number.\n92\n"}, {"page": "97", "text": "e. To protect historic and residential areas from potential adverse\nimpacts of wireless communication facilities.\nf. To encourage suitable design measures to minimize adverse visual\neffects of wireless communication facilities.\ng. To reduce the number of towers and/or antennas needed in the\nfuture.\n2. SITING PREFERENCES\nThe general order of preference for alternative facility locations shall\nrange from A as the most preferred to E the least preferred:\na. On existing or approved towers.\nb. On existing structures such as nonresidential buildings/facades,\nwater towers/tanks, utility poles, chimneys, bridges, grain\nelevators, and silos, or in structures such as steeples, clock and\nbell towers.\nC. On new towers located on property occupied by one or more\nexisting towers. This recognizes an already proven good site, and\nimplies that clustering or tower \"farming\" is more desirable than\nscattering or dispersal. However, with lower power PCS, which can\nrequire more antennas for coverage, clustering may not necessarily\nprovide seamless coverage.\nd.

The Commission may require the submission of\npropagation modeling results to facilitate its review of tower\nheight.\n1. In all residential zones, accessory structures such as radio and\ntelevision transmission relay or receiving, wireless\ntelecommunication towers and/or antennas shall be allowed\nprovided that the resulting total height (including supporting\nstructures) is not greater than the maximum allowable building\nheight measured from ground level, and provided that the\nheight of the structure is less than its distance from any\nproperty line.
