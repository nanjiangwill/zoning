EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL PLAN\n4.1 To be eligible for certification, a soil erosion and sediment control plan\nshall contain proper provisions to adequately control accelerated erosion and\nsedimentation and reduce the danger of storm water runoff on the proposed\nsite base on the best available technology. Such principles, methods, and\npractices necessary for certification are found in the Connecticut Guidelines\nfor Soil Erosion and Sediment Control (1985), as amended. Alternative\nprinciples, methods, and practices may be used with prior approval of the\nCommission.\n4.2 Said plan shall contain, but not limited to:\nA. A narrative describing:\n1. the development;\n2. the schedule for grading and construction activities including:\na. start and completion dates;\nb. sequence of grading and construction activities;\nC. sequence for installation and/or application of soil\nerosion and sediment control measures;\nd. sequence for final stabilization of project site.\n3. the design criteria for proposed soil erosion and sediment control\nmeasures and storm water management facilities.\n4. the construction details for proposed soil erosion and sediment\ncontrol measures and storm water management facilities.\n5. the installation and/or application procedures for proposed soil\nerosion and sediment control measures and storm water\nmanagement facilities.\n6.

Soil erosion and sediment control plans shall\nresult in a development that minimizes erosion and sedimentation during\nconstruction, is stabilized and protected from erosion when completed; and\ndoes not cause off-site erosion and/or sedimentation.\n5.2 The minimum standards for individual measures are those in the\nConnecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control (1985),\nas amended.
