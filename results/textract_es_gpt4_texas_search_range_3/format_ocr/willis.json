Each hole should be a minimum of 1 square foot surface area; and\n(C) Using the pocket penetrometer take seven (7) readings, eliminate the highest and the lowest and average the\nremaining five (5).\n(2) Soil surveys from the U.S. Department of Agriculture;\n(3) Values from tables of allowable or presumptive bearing capacities given in local building codes. Such tables are\ncommonly available from the local authority having jurisdiction; or\n(4) Any other test data from soil analysis reports.\n(b)\nThe footing must be placed on firm, undisturbed soil, or fill compacted to at least 90% of its maximum relative density.\nInstallation on loose, noncompacted fill may invalidate the home's limited warranty.\n(c) See the Footer Configurations figure in \u00a7 80.240(b)(22) of this title.\n(d)\nFooter sizing and capacities: The Footer Capacities table in \u00a7 80.240(a)(8) of this title represent maximum loads and\nspacings based on footer size and soil bearing capacity. Other footers may be used if equal or greater in bearing area than\nthose footer sizes tabulated.\n(e) Piers and pier spacings: Spacing and location of piers shall be in accordance with the tables listed in \u00a7 80.240(a)(9\nand (10) of this title.\n(1) Spacing shall be as even as practicable avoiding obstacles that are not in control of the installer along each main I-\nbeam. Pier spacing may exceed tabulated values up to 30% so long as the total pier count remains the same. End piers are\nto be located within 24 inches of the end of the main frame.\n(2) Piers shall extend at least 6 inches from the centerline of the I-beam or be designed to prevent dislodgment due to\nhorizontal movement of less than 4 inches.\n(3) Load bearing supports or devices shall be registered with the Department in accordance with \u00a7 80.62 of this title\n(relating to Registration of Stabilizing Components and Systems).\n(4) Sidewall openings greater than 4 feet shall have perimeter piers located under each side of the opening, i.e. patio\ndoors, recessed porches/entries, bay windows and porch posts. Perimeter piers for openings are not required for endwalls.\n(f) Pier design: Piers shall be constructed per the details in the Pier Design figure in \u00a7 80.240(b)(23) of this title.\n(1) Shimming (if needed): Shims are commonly used as a means for leveling the home and filling any voids left between\nthe bottom flange of the I-beam and the top of the pier cap. Wedge shaped shims must be installed from both sides of the I-\nbeam to provide a level bearing surface. The allowable height must not exceed 1 inch. Shims shall be a minimum of 3 inches\nwide and 6 inches long.\n(2) See the table in \u00a7 80.240(a)(9) of this title for the pier loads (pounds) at tabulated spacings WITHOUT perimeter\nsupports.\n(3) See the table in \u00a7 80.240(a)(10) of this title for pier loads (pounds) at tabulated spacings WITH perimeter supports\nand the Perimeter Pier Front and Side View figure in \u00a7 80.240(b)(24) of this title.\n(g) See the Typical Multi-Section Pier Layout figure in \u00a7 80.240(b)(25) of this title.\n(h) See the Typical Single Section Pier Layout figure in \u00a7 80.240(b)(26) of this title.\n(i) Multi-section units mating line column supports:\n(1) On multi-section units, openings larger than 4 feet must have piers installed at each end of the opening. To\ndetermine the pier loads, refer to the table in \u00a7 80.240(a)(II) of this title. See the Determining Column Load and Marriage\nLine Elevation figure in \u00a7 80.240(b)(27) of this title.\n(2) Column loads for each section may be combined when the columns are opposite each other. The footer must be\nsized for the combined loading.\n(3) Additional piers are required under marriage walls (see wall between column #3 and #4 in the Marriage Line\nElevation figure in \u00a7 80.240(b)(27) of this title. The maximum spacing is the same as the spacing at the main I-beams,\n"}, {"page": "25", "text": "without perimeter piers, and one half the spacing of the perimeter piers, with perimeter piers installed.\n(4) See the table in \u00a7 80.240(a)(II) of this title for the mating line column loads.\n\u00a7 80.62. Registration of Stabilizing Components and Systems.\n(a) Installers shall use only prefabricated or site built stabilizing components and systems which are:\n(1) registered with the Department,\n(2) specified by the home manufacturer's DAPIA approved installation instructions, or\n(3)\nspecified for one or more homes in a particular area by a Texas licensed engineer or architect.\n(b) Before accepting a registration of any prefabricated stabilizing component or system that will be used for more than\none home or granting renewal of such, the Department will require the component or system to be certified by an engineer,\narchitect, or independent testing laboratory.

The location and alignment of designated major thoroughfares must be in general\nconformance with the latest edition of the major thoroughfare and freeway plan adopted by the city. Proposals which\nconstitute a change in the location or alignment of any designated major thoroughfare or freeway illustrated on this plan may\nbe approved by the City Council if public benefit is substantiated.\n(2) Right-of-way; widening; transitions. The minimum width of the right-of-way to be dedicated for any designated major\nthoroughfare should not be less than 100 feet. In those instances where the plat is located adjacent to an existing\ndesignated major thoroughfare having a right-of-way of less than 100 feet, sufficient additional right-of-way must be\ndedicated to accommodate the ultimate development of the major thoroughfare in question on the basis of a total right-of-\nway width of 100 feet. Where the construction of concrete pavement with curbs, gutters, and storm sewers is not feasible\nand open ditch drainage is planned, the minimum right-of-way width required for the development of a designated major\nthoroughfare must be more than 100 feet and of sufficient width to accommodate the approved roadway pavement,\nattendant drainage facilities, and utilities. In those instances where it is proposed to extend an existing major thoroughfare\nhaving a right-of-way width of 80 feet, the right-of-way to be dedicated for the extension of this major thoroughfare should be\nincreased through a transitional area from 80 feet in width to 100 feet in width over a distance of 200 feet. Similar transitional\nareas will be required where other existing right-of-way widths are encountered.\n(3) Curves and intersections. Curves proposed for the right-of-way of designated major thoroughfares must have a\ncenterline radius of 2,000 feet or more.

In no instance, however, will the Council grant a variance\nindicating the centerline radius of any designated major thoroughfare to be less than 1,150 feet. Reverse curves should be\nseparated by a tangent distance of not less than 100 feet. Intersections with other public streets should be at right angles,\nexcept in those instances where the subdivider requests a variance as provided for herein. Where acute angle intersections\nare approved, however, a radius of at least 25 feet in the right-of-way line at the acute corner must be provided.\n(C) Local streets.\n(1) Location and alignment. The location and alignment of local public streets proposed to be dedicated and established\nwith a subdivision or development plat should be designed in conformance with the concepts listed in division (A) above.\n(2) Right-of-way width; widening. The width of the right-of-way to be dedicated for any public street not designated as a\nmajor thoroughfare or freeway must be at least 60 feet, except as provided below. In those instances where a subdivision\nplat is located adjacent to an existing public street, the street not being designated as a major thoroughfare, having a right-\nof-way width less than 60 feet, sufficient additional right-of-way must be dedicated within the subdivision plat boundary to\naccommodate the ultimate development of the subject street to a total right-of-way width of not less than 60 feet. A right-of-\nway width of 55 feet may be provided when the street is not designed to be extended into properties outside the plat\nboundaries, has an ultimate length not to exceed 800 feet as a cul-de-sac or when in the configuration of a loop having an\ninternal block length of less than 1,000 feet, where storm sewers are to be provided and where the adjacent properties\nbeing platted are subdivided into lots, designed for residential purposes, having a lot width at the right-of-way line of less\nthan 40 feet.\n(3) Curves and intersections.

Public alleys must have a right-of-way width of not less than 20 feet.\nIntersections with public alleys or public streets must be at right angles, except in those instances where the subdivider\nrequests a variance as provided for herein. All corners at the intersection of alley right-of-way with public streets or other\nalleys must have at least a 25-foot radius or 15-foot angular cutbacks provided. Curves in alleys should be kept to a\nminimum and should have a centerline radius of not less than 300 feet. Reverse curves in alleys should be separated by a\ntangent distance of less than 50 feet.\n(C) Dead-end alleys. No dead-end or cul-de-sac alleys will be permitted.\n"}, {"page": "43", "text": "(Ord. 96-0220, passed 2-20-1996; Ord. 19-1022A, passed 10-22-2019) Penalty, see \u00a7 154.99\n\u00a7 154.27 PUBLIC STREET AND ALLEY WIDTH (SUGGESTIONS).\n(A) Major thoroughfares; 100-foot right-of-way.

The city will review and consider all development projects where private streets are proposed to be\ndeveloped which would provide access to any residential building or dwelling unit, or any part thereof, which is located more\nthan 300 feet from the nearest public street to which the private street intersects. The city will review and consider any\nproposed project where a private street is intended to serve four or more separate lots or individual building sites designed\nfor sale to the general public for residential purposes. Parking lots and aisles within the parking lots and private driveways\nwithin shopping centers, institutions, and commercial and industrial developments are required to be approved by the city.\n(B) General arrangement and layout. The pattern or layout of the street system in any project should provide for the\nfollowing basic design concepts:\n(1) Provide adequate vehicular access to all buildings and facilities within the plat boundaries;\n(2) Provide adequate interior traffic circulation and access to all buildings containing dwelling units by firefighting\npersonnel and equipment;\n(3) Provide adequate access to the existing public street system adjacent to the boundaries of the plat and; and\n(4) Be so designed to allow for the smooth flow of vehicular traffic, avoiding traffic hazards such as closely off-set\nintersections, angular and multiple point intersections, jogs, and other design features which would induce a hazard to\nvehicular traffic and the occupants of the project.\n(C) Width. Since private streets are established without the benefit of a formalized right-of-way width, the width of a\nprivate street is considered by the city to be the width of the surface of the pavement measured from edge to edge. Under\nthese circumstances, the right-of-way width and the pavement width of a private street are considered coterminous and the\nterms are used interchangeably. It is the policy of the city that the minimum acceptable unobstructed width of any private\nstreet should not be less than 28 feet. If parallel parking is proposed along the private street, additional width may be\nrequired to accommodate the parking.\n(D) Dead-ends, cul-de-sacs, and T-type turnarounds. Dead-end private streets must be terminated by a circular cul-de-\nsac having a paving radius of not less than 50 feet or a T-type turnaround designed in conformance with the standards\napproved by the Fire and Public Works Departments.\n(E) Length of cul-de-sacs or dead-end streets. Dead-end private streets must not extend further than 300 feet from the\nnearest right-of-way line of the intersecting public or private street measured along the centerline of the private street to the\ncenter of the circular turnaround (cul-de-sac) or the outer limit of the paving in the T-type turnaround configuration.\n(F) Intersections. In those instances where a private street intersects with a public street paved with dual roadways and\nesplanade, the private street should be located at an established esplanade opening. Private streets must not be direct\n(straight line) projections of any public street, except in those instances where:\n(1) The extension is at an intersection with a public street paved with dual roadways and esplanade; and\n(2) Where the private street is two separate 20-foot (minimum) roadways separated by a minimum 20-foot curb section\nat the public street intersection and the private street is not a direct connection (straight line) between two public streets. In\nthose instances where the private street is not a direct extension of a public street, then the private street must offset a\nminimum distance of 125 feet centerline to centerline from any public street intersection. Intersections of all private streets\nmust be at right angles with variations not to exceed ten degrees. Right angle intersections of private streets must have a\n20-foot radius at all corners. Acute angle intersections must have 25-foot radii at the acute corner on both public and private\nstreets.\n(G) Multiple access points to public streets. All projects containing private streets must have a private street system so\n"}, {"page": "44", "text": "designed to provide adequate emergency vehicular access and the private street system must be designed to provide more\nthan one point of access to the project or development from the public streets adjacent to the boundaries of the project or\ndevelopment in those instances where it is the opinion of the Fire Chief that additional access points will be necessary to\nensure the safety and general welfare of the public and occupants of the project.\n(Ord. 96-0220, passed 2-20-1996; Ord. 19-1022A, passed 10-22-2019) Penalty, see \u00a7 154.99\n\u00a7 154.29 STREET NAMES.\n(A) Public streets. All public streets contained in any subdivision plat or development plan approved by the city must be\nnamed in conformance with the following considerations.\n(1) New street names, not extensions of existing names, must not be duplicates of any existing street name located\nwithin the city or its exclusive extraterritorial jurisdiction.\n(2) Existing street names must be used in those instances where a new street is a direct extension of an existing street\nor a logical extension (when the streets in question are not and cannot be physically continuous) thereof except in those\ninstances where the existing street name is a duplicate street name.\n(3) Street name suffixes such as court, circle, and loop should be designated on streets which are cul-de-sacs or in a\nconfiguration of a loop street. Suffixes such as boulevard, speedway, parkway, and expressway should be confined to\ndesignated major thoroughfares or local streets designed to handle traffic volumes in excess of normal neighborhood traffic\ngeneration. Suffixes such as highway or freeway must be used only to designate highways or freeways falling under the\njurisdiction of the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation.\n(4) Street name prefixes such as north, south, least, and west be used to clarify the general location of the street;\nhowever, the prefixes must be consistent with the existing and established street naming and address numbering system of\nthe general area in which the street is located.\n(5) Alphabetical and numerical street names must not be designed on any subdivision plat or development plan except\nin those instances where the street is a direct extension of an existing street with such a name and is not a duplicate street\nname.\n(B) Private streets. Street names will not be approved on any private street, driveway, or access easement shown on any\nplat submitted to the city for approval.\n(Ord. 96-0220, passed 2-20-1996; Ord. 19-1022A, passed 10-22-2019) Penalty, see \u00a7 154.99\n\u00a7 154.30 BLOCK LENGTHS.\n(A) Measurement criteria. Block lengths are to be determined by the measurement along the face of a block (being the\nadjacent street right-of-way line) from one street intersection to another street intersection where the streets provide cross-\ntraffic circulation (not cul-de-sac street). In those instances where a loop street configuration is involved the interior block\nformed by the loop streets is measured through the center of the block and between adjacent street right-of-way lines.\nVariations in the block lengths herein specified may be considered by the city upon receipt of a request from the subdivider\nfor a variance and in those situations where a block may be adjacent to a major topographical feature, such as a river, canal,\nbayou, gully, ravine, a major drainage ditch, lake, pit, or mine excavation; a major right-of-way or easement for high voltage\nelectrical transmission lines, underground pipelines, railroad rights-of-way, and facilities; designated freeways; a public park\nor other publicly owned and operated facilities such as dams, reservoirs, schools, airports, or golf courses and; privately\nowned golf courses and lakes when the golf courses and lakes are an integral part of the layout and subdivision design\nof\nthe overall tract being developed. In no instance, however, will the Council grant a variance indicating that a block adjacent\nto the conditions and features mentioned above to be more than 2,640 feet (one-half mile) in length measured along the\nblock face.\n(B) Major thoroughfares. The maximum length for blocks adjacent to designated major thoroughfares must not be more\nthan 1,800 feet.\n(C) Local streets. The maximum length for blocks adjacent to local streets must not be more than 1,000 feet, except\nunder the following circumstances.\n(1) Loop streets may have an internal block length of not more than 800 feet.\n(2) Cul-de-sacs may have a block length of not more than 800 feet, measured from the intersection with the right-of-\nway of a cross street along the center line of the cul-de-sac street to the center of the circular turnaround at the end of the\ncul-de-sac.\n(3) Stub streets or dead ends may have a block length of no more than 800 feet unless terminated with a circular\nturnaround suitably modified to accommodate future extension of street into adjacent property.\n(D) Private streets. See \u00a7 154.28(E) regarding the length of cul-de-sac or dead-end private streets.\n(Ord. 96-0220, passed 2-20-1996; Ord. 19-1022A, passed 10-22-2019) Penalty, see \u00a7 154.99\n\u00a7 154.31 ONE-FOOT RESERVES.\n"}, {"page": "45", "text": "In those instances where any public street is established in a plat submitted to the city and where the public street forms\neither a stub street into adjacent acreage or where the public street lies along and parallel with the plat boundary and\nadjacent to acreage, a one-foot wide reserve must be established within the street right-of-way to form a buffer strip,\ndedicated to the public, between the public street right-of-way and the adjacent unsubdivided acreage to prevent access to\nthis public street from the adjacent unsubdivided acreage unless and until the city has had an opportunity to review the\ndevelopment proposals for the adjacent acreage and a plat of the adjacent property is duly recorded.

Public utility easements are those easements established with a plat which is designed to\naccommodate public owned or controlled utility facilities necessary to provide various types of utility services to the\nindividual properties within the plat boundaries. Public utility easements may be used for, but not limited to, facilities\nnecessary to provide water, electrical power, natural gas, telephone, telegraph, and sanitary sewer services. Storm sewers\nor open drainage ways must not be constructed within public utility easements unless specifically approved by the City\nDirector of Public Works and where additional easement width is provided to conform to the standards established herein for\ndrainage easements.\n(1) Location. Public utility easements must be provided along the front of all lots designed for the development of a\nstructure containing residential dwelling units and in such other locations as determined to be necessary by the City Director\nof Public Works and worked out with the owner or developer and any other utility companies involved. Public utility\neasements located along the outer boundaries of a plat must contain the full width required for the easement except in\nthose instances where the adjacent property is within a portion of a previously approved plan and under the same ownership\nas the property being platted or where additional easement width is dedicated by separate instrument by the owner of the\nadjacent tract. In those cases, one-half of the required easement width is dedicated by separate instrument by the owner of\nthe adjacent tract. In those cases, one-half of the required easement width may be dedicated within the plat boundary with\nthe other half provided outside the plat boundary by separate instrument or through notation on the plat certifying the\nownership and dedication of the easement.\n(2) Public utility easement widths; dead ends. All public utility easements established within any subdivision plat must\nnot be less than ten feet in width to accommodate a single utility line, and not less than 16 feet in width to accommodate two\nor more utility lines. In those instances where underground electrical facilities are to be installed within the public utility\neasement, the easement width must not be less than 16 feet in width. Additional width may be determined to be necessary\nby the City Director of Public Works and worked out with the owner or developer and any other utility companies involved\nbased on the proposed or future utilities to be contained within the easement. No dead-end public utility easements will be\npermitted by the city.\n(B) Drainage easements. All drainage easements must be located and dedicated to accommodate the drainage\nrequirements required for the proper development of the property within the subdivision boundaries and within its natural\nwatershed and in conformance with the requirements of the City Director of Public Works and other governmental agencies\ncharged with the responsibility of storm drainage or flood control within the area the subdivision is located. A suitable note\non the plat must restrict all properties within the subdivision ensuring that drainage easements within the plat boundaries\nshall be kept clear of fences, buildings, plantings, and other obstructions to the operations and maintenance of the drainage\nfacility and abutting property shall not be permitted to drain directly into this easement except by means of a drainage\nstructure approved by the City Director of Public Works or other authorized public drainage or flood control official.\n(C) National Flood Insurance Program. The city and the county, as well as other county units of government, have agreed\nto participate in the National Flood Insurance Program and, through this participation, the limits of the 100-year flood plain\nfor all natural drainage ways has been determined and special regulations for construction of facilities which fall within the\ndesignated 100-year flood plain have been established. It is the policy of the city to inform persons who submit plats to the\ncity if the property illustrated on the plat falls within the established flood plain and to suggest that they seek more detailed\ninformation from the agencies who control construction in these areas.\n(1) Existing easements; fee strips. All easements or fee strips created prior to the subdivision of any tract of land must\nbe shown on the subdivision plat of the land with appropriate notations indicating the name of the holder of the easement or\nfee strip, the purpose of the easement and generally the facilities contained therein, the dimensions of the easement or fee\nstrip tied to all adjacent lot lines, street rights-of-way, and plat boundary lines and the recording reference of the instruments\ncreating and establishing the easement or fee strip. In those instances where easements have not been defined by accurate\nsurvey dimensions such as \"over and across\" type easements, the subdivider should request the holder of the easement to\naccurately define the limits and location of his or her easement through the property within the plat boundaries. If the holder\n"}, {"page": "47", "text": "of the undefined easement does not define the easement involved and certifies his or her refusal to define the easement to\nthe city the subdivision plat must provide accurate information as to the center line location of all existing pipelines or other\nutility facilities placed in conformance with the easement holder's rights and building setback lines must be established 15\nfeet from and parallel with both sides of the center line of all underground pipelines or pole lines involved.\n(2) Establishment of special use easement. The establishment of special use utility easements may be provided on a\nsubdivision plat when the easement is for the purpose of accommodating a utility facility owned, operated, and maintained\nby a unit of government and is restricted to either water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers, or for drainage purposes and\nwhere it has been determined by the City Director of Public Works that these facilities cannot or should not be\naccommodated within a general purpose public utility easement or public street right-of-way. Easements proposed to be\nestablished for any private utility company or private organization providing utility services and restricted for their exclusive\nuse cannot be shown on or established by a subdivision plat, however, the private utility facilities can be accommodated and\nplaced within the general purpose public utility easements, public streets, and alleys established within the plat boundary.\nNothing herein, however, may prevent the private utility companies from granting and establishing special or exclusive use\neasements by separate instrument if the arrangements are deemed necessary to properly serve the properties within the\nplat boundaries.\n(Ord. 96-0220, passed 2-20-1996; Ord. 19-1022A, passed 10-22-2019) Penalty, see \u00a7 154.99\n\u00a7 154.35 BUILDING SETBACK RESTRICTION.\n(A) Generally. Building setback restrictions have traditionally been required by the city in various degrees dependent\nupon the type and design characteristic of the streets which the restrictions parallel. These restrictions are designed and\napplied to assure that occupied buildings, particularly residential and commercial buildings where a concentration of people\nis involved, are located a sufficient distance away from the adjacent street to avoid damage to the structure and occupants\nby errant vehicles, to lessen or minimize the effect of noise and pollutants generated by traffic on the occupants of adjacent\nbuildings, to ensure that the location of buildings do not create any traffic hazard by blocking or restricting lines of sights,\nparticularly at intersections and along curves, to provide some additional open space in addition to the space within the\nstreet right-ofway for the free movement of police, firefighters, and others in emergency situations, and when appropriate\nsufficient yard space and open space separating building structures which may enhance the visual character and value of a\nparticular development. Building setbacks shall be established and maintained as provided herein and shall in no case be\nless than the building setbacks established in the city zoning regulations found in Chapter 155.\n(B) Major thoroughfares. Properties adjacent to designated major thoroughfares must have a front building setback from\nthe adjacent major thoroughfare right-of-way of not less than 25 feet. When the lot sides on a major thoroughfare, a side\nbuilding setback of at least 20 feet must be provided. In those instances where such a lot backs on a major thoroughfare, a\nrear building setback of not less than ten feet will be required.\n(C) Local streets. Properties adjacent to local streets must have a front building setback from the adjacent street right-of-\nway of not less than 25 feet. When the lots side on a local street, a side building setback of 15 feet must be provided. When\nthe lots back on a local street, a rear building setback of ten feet must be provided.\n(D) Building setback line off-sets and transitions. In those instances where the required building setback restriction line\nchanges from one tract to another, a transitional building setback line must be provided having a minimum angle of 45\ndegrees. The transition must take place on the lot or tract having the lesser building setback restriction requirement.\n(E) Pipelines; railroad rights-of-way. Where underground pipelines carrying flammable products under pressure through\nproperties within a plat boundary or where properties within the plat back or side along a railroad right-of-way, a 15-foot\nbuilding setback restriction must be provided adjacent to the pipeline easement or fee strip (or the center line of the pipeline\nfacility if no easement is defined) or railroad right-of-way line.\n(Ord. 96-0220, passed 2-20-1996; Ord. 13-1119A, passed 11-19-2013; Ord. 19-1022A, passed 10-22-2019) Penalty, see \u00a7\n154.99\n\u00a7 154.36 RESERVE TRACTS.\n(A) Generally. Reserve tracts are those individual parcels of land created within a subdivision plat which are not divided\ninto lots, but are established to accommodate some specific purpose such as a commercial center, industrial sites, a golf\ncourse, or other type of private recreational facility, schools or church sites or sites for utility facilities such as water wells and\nstorage areas, wastewater treatment plants, electrical power stations, or other activities and land uses which division into\nlots is not suitable or appropriate. Since the use or reserve tracts may not be completely determined by the subdivider or\ndeveloper at the time plats are prepared and submitted to the city, these reserve tracts are often established as \"unrestricted\nreserves\" which allows maximum flexibility in the determination of the ultimate use planned for the properties.\n(B) Public street access. Reserves established on any subdivision plat must have frontage on and be immediately\nadjacent to at least one public street, with the frontage being not less than 60 feet in width. In those instances where the\naverage depth of an unrestricted reserve is more than 300 feet, the reserve access to all adjacent public streets must be\nseparated by a one-foot reserve placed within the adjacent street right-of-way as provided for in \u00a7 154.31 which will become\nautomatically removed upon the approval and recording of a suitable development plat of the property within the reserve.\n(C) Identification and designation. All reserves must be labeled and identified on the plat and a description of the use\nintended for the reserve must be noted. If the use of the reserve is not restricted for any specific use, the reserve must then\nbe identified and noted as being unrestricted. All reserves are to be identified and designated by alphabetical letters, not\n"}, {"page": "48", "text": "numbers, along with an indication as to the total acreage of the reserves must be shown within each reserve boundaries.\n(Ord. 96-0220, passed 2-20-1996; Ord. 19-1022A, passed 10-22-2019) Penalty, see \u00a7 154.99\n\u00a7 154.37 LOTS; GENERAL PROVISIONS.\n(A) Generally. The purpose of this section is to provide general overall guidelines for the establishment of individual lots\nwithin subdivisions designed to accommodate various types of residential housing schemes without resorting to more\nspecific and detailed standards strictly associated with a particular housing type or market label which may be associated\nwith a subdivision of land containing lots designed to be offered for sale to the general public.\n(B) General lot design; arrangement layout. The general lot design within any subdivision should be based upon the\nconcept that the lots are created and established as undivided tracts of land and that purchasers of the lots can be assured\nthat these tracts of land meet the following basic criteria.\n(1) The lot is of sufficient size and shape to allow the construction of a residential dwelling unit which can meet the\nrequirements of established building or construction codes, housing and public health codes, and ordinances and accepted\nfamily living standards.\n(2) The lot is of sufficient size and shape to accommodate easement for all public and private utility services and\nfacilities to adequately serve any residential dwelling unit constructed thereon.\n(3) The lot is of sufficient size and shape and is so located that direct vehicular access is provided from a public street\nor through an approved permanent access easement and that the required number of vehicles can be parked on the lot\nwithout encroachment within any adjacent public street or alley rights-of-way.\n(C) Lot shapes. Lots should be designed, so far as possible, with side lot lines being at right angles or radial to any\nadjacent street right-of-way line. Where all lots are either perpendicular and at right angles or radial to adjacent street rights-\nof-way, a suitable notation may be placed upon the plat in lieu of lot line bearings.\n(D) Key or flag lots. Key or flag lots may be permitted under unusual circumstances; however, the narrowest part of such\na lot, being the staff portion of the flag lot, must not be less than 20 feet in width or have a length of more than 200 feet. The\nlot must also be restricted to prevent the construction of any building, structure, wall, or fence within the staff portion of the\nlot and that the staff portion of the lot will be restricted for access to such lot only. The restrictions must be shown on the\nface of the subdivision plat in the form of a notation or a part of the dedicatory language on the plat.\n(E) Double-front lots. Double-front lots will not be approved except in those instances where lots are restricted for\nresidential use and back up on an adjacent designated major thoroughfare or where special circumstances would warrant a\nvariance to this regulation.\n(F)\nStreet access limitations. Rear and side vehicular driveway access from lots, restricted for the construction of\nresidential dwelling units, to adjacent streets designated as major thoroughfare, freeway, highway or any other public street\nwhich carries a traffic volume where additional vehicular driveways would create a traffic hazard or impede the flow of traffic,\nwill not be approved and the access restriction must be noted directly upon the plat and adjacent to the lots in question.\n(G) Lot and block identification. All blocks established in any subdivision shall be designated by number with the numbers\nbeing consecutive within the whole subdivision plat. Lots established within the blocks shall also be numbered with the\nnumbers being consecutive within the block.

(See division (I) below.) Two off-street parking spaces\nmust be provided on or adjacent to each lot with the width of the spaces being not less than eight and one-half feet each\nand that the spaces cannot be in tandem.\n(I) Minimum lot sizes; special conditions. To accommodate various types of unique and innovative housing forms which\nare usually based upon a concept of reducing the area of individually owned lots and grouping the lots together to more\nefficiently utilize the total space within the subdivision by creating common open spaces, scenic and recreational areas, and\nother spaces which would compensate for the reduction of land area contained within the individually owned lot, the\nfollowing standards have been developed and applied to a variety of the housing forms including, but not limited to\ntownhouses, town homes, patio homes, courtyard homes, planned unit developments, cluster homes, or any other\ndesignation of whatever nature. All other provisions contained in this manual are applicable to these types of housing forms\nunless specifically noted herein.\n(1) Street access. In general, all lots shall have frontage and be adjacent to at least one public street having a right-of-\nway of not less than 60 feet. Lots containing an area less than 3,500 square feet may have frontage on a public street, may\nhave frontage upon an approved common courtyard or common open space having frontage on a public street or may have\nfrontage upon a private street which connects with a public street. In these instances where the special lot is to be\nestablished without direct frontage along an adjacent public street, the lots must be part of a unified development scheme\nwhere the owners' association, corporation, or other organization as one of its purposes the continued care and\nmaintenance of all commonly owned properties within the subdivision, particularly the areas established as private streets.\nProof of establishment of the legally binding restrictions and obligations must be provided to the city prior to the recording of\nany plat containing any lots not having frontage along an adjacent public street.\n(2) Reduced lot area; width. Lots proposed to be established under these special conditions must be sanitary sewered\nlots and may have a gross area of not less than 1,400 square feet with a minimum width not less than 18 feet. Two off-street\nparking spaces must be provided on or adjacent to each lot with the width of the spaces being not less than eight and one-\nhalf feet each and that the spaces cannot be in tandem.\n(3) Compensating common open space required.\n(a) In those instances where the proposed lot has a gross area of less than 7,000 square feet, compensating\ncommon open space must be established and provided within the plat boundary and based upon the following schedule:\n(b) In no instance, however, will the compensating open space contained within any subdivision having special lots be\nless than 21,780 square feet (one-half acre) or shall the compensating open space required be in excess of 25% of the\ngross area of the property within the plat boundary exclusive of any public street rights-of-way involved. This does not apply\nto subdivisions having special lots and containing less than ten acres. Subdivisions having special lots and containing less\nthan ten acres must, however, provide compensating open space in accordance with the schedule. If a plat containing lots\nrequiring compensating open spaces is less than ten acres, but is a part of a larger tract, being planned and developed as\nan overall design, the city may take in consideration the overall development scheme in the determination of compensating\nopen space requirements provided for herein.\n(Ord. 96-0220, passed 2-20-1996; Ord. 19-1022A, passed 10-22-2019) Penalty, see \u00a7 154.99\n\u00a7 154.38 COMPENSATING OPEN SPACE; GENERALLY.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCompensating Opening Space Requirements (Lots Less Than 5,000 Square Feet in Area)\nCELL (1, 2): \nCompensating Opening Space Requirements (Lots Less Than 5,000 Square Feet in Area)\nCELL (2, 1): \nAverage Area of Lots (Square Feet)\nCELL (2, 2): \nCompensating Open Space Required Per\nLot\n(Square Feet)\nCELL (3, 1): \nCompensating Opening Space Requirements (Lots Less Than 5,000 Square Feet in Area)\nCELL (3, 2): \nCompensating Opening Space Requirements (Lots Less Than 5,000 Square Feet in Area)\nCELL (4, 1): \nAverage Area of Lots (Square Feet)\nCELL (4, 2): \nCompensating Open Space Required Per\nLot\n(Square Feet)\nCELL (5, 1): \n1,400 to 2,000\nCELL (5, 2): \n720\nCELL (6, 1): \n2,001 to 2,500\nCELL (6, 2): \n600\nCELL (7, 1): \n2,501 to 3,000\nCELL (7, 2): \n500\nCELL (8, 1): \n3,001 to 3,500\nCELL (8, 2): \n400\nCELL (9, 1): \n3,501 to 4,000\nCELL (9, 2): \n300\nCELL (10, 1): \n4,001 to 4,500\nCELL (10, 2): \n200\nCELL (11, 1): \n4,501 to less than 7,000\nCELL (11, 2): \n100\n"}, {"page": "50", "text": "(A) Generally. Compensating open space required to be established when lots are proposed to be created with areas\nless than 7,000 square feet is necessary to provide some space for children to play outdoors within their immediate\nneighborhood or block which will allow them an opportunity to play catch, basketball, fly a kite or glider, ride a tricycle, skate,\nuse small scale playground equipment which may be provided, and other activities normally accommodated in the front or\nback yard of the typical suburban home. Without this compensating open space, the only alternative for the children to play\nin areas where yard space has been eliminated, for all practical purposes by a reduction in the lot area, is the street adjacent\nto their home. Obviously, this is a very hazardous situation and directly affects the quality of life in these neighborhoods.\nCompensating open space also allows the individual housing units and lots to be grouped in a manner which creates\neconomics in the installation of utilities and streets required to serve these individual private properties and provides an\nopportunity for the subdivider to design and develop a more attractive residential neighborhood and fully utilize any natural\nor\ntopographic features which may be present on the tract being subdivided.\n(B) Limitations; courtyards.\n(1) Compensating open spaces are to be considered to be only those areas not specifically designated or used as lots,\nbuilding sites for dwelling units, building sites for utility or storage purposes, vehicular parking lots, carports or garages or\ndriveways thereto, or streets either public or private. These properties must be restricted for the exclusive use of owners\nwithin the subdivision and owned, managed and maintained under a suitable binding agreement among the property\nowners. Compensating open spaces may remain undeveloped or landscaped and may be developed for recreational\npurposes (both active or passive) and can be used to provide courtyard access from groups or clusters of lots adjacent to\npublic streets.\n(2) Compensating open spaces used as courtyards which are designed to provide primary access from groups or\nclusters of lots or building sites adjacent to public streets must have an average width between the fronts of the lots or\nbuildings of 25 feet with a minimum of the distance being not less than 20 feet. The length of the courtyards should not be\nmore than 200 feet (about 66.5 yards) extending away from the public street which the courtyards must open onto.\n(C) Greenbelt areas within any multi-family residential complex.\n(1) Definition of greenbelt area. A GREENBELT AREA shall consist of open earthen areas bearing trees, shrubbery, or\ngrass. Sidewalks, tennis courts, swimming pools, and the like shall not be considered a part of a GREENBELT AREA.\n(2) Requirement. Any plan for the multi-family residential complex shall provide for a greenbelt area equal to 20% of a\ntotal living area on all floors of the complex. At least 10% of the required greenbelt shall be evenly distributed within the\ncomplex. The remaining percentage of greenbelt may be developed as a park within the complex.\n(3) Disclosure on plans.

The\nFEMA flood boundaries shall represent the minimum flood boundaries to be used.\n(N) All development shall be designed and constructed in a way to have no negative affect on surrounding areas or\nunreasonably:\n(1) Impede the natural flow of surface waters from higher adjacent properties;\n(2) Alter the natural flow of surface waters so as to discharge them upon adjacent properties at a more rapid rate or in a\ndifferent location than would result from the pre development natural flow of surface waters; or\n(3) Collect or concentrate the flow of surface waters for discharge into an existing natural or artificial drainage way in\na\nmanner which exceeds the capacity of the receiving water course.\n(O) Storm drainage released from the site will be discharged to a watercourse of an adequate size to control the peak\nrunoff expected after development. The City Engineer shall be provided the necessary data showing the adequacy of the\nwatercourse. Criteria for on-site development shall apply to off-site improvements. Any discharge point exiting the property\nshall be within the required drainage easements or right of way on adjacent property. Determination of the minimum\neasement required shall be made by the City Engineer.\n(P) The design, size, type and location of all storm drainage facilities shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer.\nThe requirements set forth in this section shall be considered minimum requirements. The developer and his or her engineer\nshall bear the total responsibility for the adequacy of the design. The approval of the facilities by the City shall in no way\nrelieve the developer of such responsibility.\n(Q) Requests for a variance, detailing specific reasons for the variance, shall be submitted in writing. The City Engineer\nshall make a recommendation to the City Council for its approval of the variance. Variations and modifications to the storm\ndrainage requirement of the city may be made when special or peculiar factors and conditions warrant such variations and\nmodifications, and when such variations and modifications do not affect the general intent, application or spirit of the storm\ndrainage rules and regulations of the city.\n(Ord. 09-0721, passed 7-21-2009; Ord. 19-1022B, passed 10-22-2019) Penalty, see \u00a7 155.999\n"}, {"page": "96", "text": "INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT\n\u00a7 155.210 OVERSIZING.\n(A) Where necessary to provide for development of adjacent properties or to conform to the provisions of the\ncomprehensive plan, the city may require the dedication or installation of oversized infrastructure. The developer shall be\nresponsible for the entire costs of designing and installing all infrastructure, which is intended for the primary purpose of\nserving a new development.\n(B) The City Council upon the recommendation of the City Engineer and the Planning and Zoning Commission shall\ndetermine the need for oversized infrastructure at the earliest practical stage prior to the time of plat approval. The City\nEngineer may recommend that oversized infrastructure be required.\n(C) If the developer contends that infrastructure requirements imposed as a condition of plat approval actually constitute\noversizing, then, the developer must request the Planning and Zoning Commission to determine whether or not such\nrequirements actually constitute oversizing. In reaching such a determination, the Commission shall consider the actual\nrequirements which are reasonably necessary to provide service to the development in accordance with good engineering\npractices, including the development's location and size, proximity to sources of water supply and waste water treatment,\nthe effect on line pressures and gravity flow, the size of existing infrastructure to which connection is to be made and any\nother relevant matters. If the Commission shall determine that requirements actually constitute oversizing, then the\nCommission shall also determine whether or not a need exists for such oversized infrastructure.\n(D) If it is determined that a need exists for the installation of oversized infrastructure, then the Planning and Zoning\nCommission shall recommend that the City Council enter into an agreement with developer providing for the funding and\nconstruction of oversized infrastructure. If the City council shall fail to take action upon such recommendation within 30 days\nof preliminary plat approval, then the recommendation shall be rejected and the developer may proceed to obtain final plat\napproval without oversizing.\n(E) Oversized infrastructure does not include land or infrastructure provided outside of a new development, which are\nnecessary for the provision of services to the development. While not eligible for oversize participation, the developer may\nbe eligible for reimbursement under the city's policy set out below on the extension of infrastructure winch benefits other\nabutting properties.\n(Ord. 09-0721, passed 7-21-2009)\n\u00a7 155.211 REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENTS FOR OVERSIZED INFRASTRUCTURE.\n(A) The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend and the City Council may approve an agreement for\ndeveloper reimbursement for the installation of oversized infrastructure. Such agreements must be approved and executed\nprior to final plat approval.\n(B) Reimbursable costs are limited to the difference between the materials and installation costs of the oversized\ninfrastructure and the estimated costs of infrastructure of a size necessary to serve the proposed development only.\nProvided that necessary public easements have first been dedicated and accepted, the City may elect to perform the work\nusing its own forces.\n(C) Where the work is to be performed by the developer, the agreement must provide for the establishment of an escrow\naccount into which both the city and developer shall deposit their respective estimated costs. Payments shall be disbursed\nfrom the escrow account only upon the mutual approval of both city and developer. Contracts paid from the escrow account\nmust provide for a minimum 10% retainage or require that payment be withheld until completion and acceptance of the\nrequired work. Where the city contribution is estimated to exceed the amount for which competitive bidding would be\nrequired, the agreement must require that the contract be competitively bid and awarded in conformity with the provisions of\nstate law applicable to public works contracts, including provision for performance and payment bonds in favor of the city.\n(Ord. 09-0721, passed 7-21-2009)\n\u00a7 155.212 REIMBURSEMENT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE INSTALLED OUTSIDE A DEVELOPMENT.\n(A) Where streets, water lines, sewer lines or other infrastructure installed within public easements are provided outside\nof the development and thereby benefit other abutting undeveloped properties, the City may impose and collect an acreage\nfee on behalf of the original developer installing such infrastructure. A formula that shall determine how much of the original\nextension and oversized utilities cost will be reimbursed to the original developer will be agreed on prior to granting access\nto a subsequent development to the newly extended infrastructure.\n(B) Acreage fees must be calculated on a front foot basis and total acreage to be served, which distributes the cost\nequally among all abutting property owners who subsequently benefit from the original infrastructure extension(s). Acreage\nfees may not include reimbursement for costs incurred within the interior of the original developer's development. The\noriginal developer's application for acreage fee reimbursement must include a proposed fee as well as an accounting of the\ncosts included within the fee. The Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council must approve the fee prior to\ncollection.\n(C) Acreage fees applicable to subsequent development(s) will be collected upon final plat approval or the issuance of a\nbuilding permit for the abutting property, whichever occurs first, and promptly remitted to the original developer.
