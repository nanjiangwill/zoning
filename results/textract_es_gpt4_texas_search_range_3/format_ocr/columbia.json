As this\nstormwater runoff flows across the ground and hard surfaces, it picks up phosphorus from\natmospheric, organic and inorganic materials, fertilizers and soil particles. This phosphorus goes\ndirectly into the Lake unless the stormwater slows enough to seep into the soil where\nphosphorus and other surface contaminates are naturally removed. Increased levels of\nphosphorus can cause eutrophication resulting in algae blooms and increased weed growth.\nThe purpose of this regulation is to implement the recommendations of the 2002 Columbia Lake\nManagement Plan which was based on the 1998 scientific study that determined the maximum\namount of phosphorus Columbia Lake could support in order to maintain Columbia's water\nquality for the future. Each parcel within the Overlay Zone has a maximum annual amount of\nphosphorus runoff level, called \"Maximum Parcel Allocation\", to sustain the Columbia Lake\nwater quality as described and determined in the Columbia Lake Management Plan.\nBased on scientific analysis of Columbia Lake water since 2003, this is a proven measure to\nprotect and ensure the future viability of Columbia Lake.\n21.4.2 Columbia Lake Watershed Protection Area Overlay Zone Maps\nThe Columbia Lake Watershed Protection Area is divided into three subzones based on\nproximity to the Lake: Immediate (A) which drains directly to Columbia Lake; Intermediate (B)\nwhich drains through more extensive flow paths to tributary streams; and Remote (C) which\nprimarily first drains to a large, wooded swamp that provides natural renovation of stormwater.\nThese Overlay Zones are shown on the Zoning Map of the Town of Columbia.\n21.4.3 Applicability\nWithin the Columbia Lake Watershed Protection Area, these regulations shall apply to all new\nstructures, additions to existing structures, additions to or expansion of non-permeable ground\nsurfaces or any activity that requires a Planning and Zoning, Zoning Boards of Appeals, or Zoning\nCompliance Certificate. These requirements shall be in addition to the zoning requirements for\nthe underlying Residential-Agricultural District; in the event of a conflict, the more restrictive\nrequirements shall apply.\nColumbia Zoning Regulations Effective 5/17/21\n30\n"}, {"page": "35", "text": "21.4.4 Columbia Lake Watershed Protection Area Overlay Zone Requirements\nFor all applicable land use activities within the Columbia Lake Watershed Protection Overlay\nZone, a Nutrient Allocation Worksheet shall be used to calculate the Maximum Parcel Allocation\nof phosphorus runoff for the subject parcel, and to estimate the phosphorous runoff both\nbefore, and after, the proposed changes.\nIf the proposed changes result in phosphorous runoff that exceeds the Maximum Parcel\nAllocation, the parcel's runoff must be mitigated.\nThe proposed mitigation (See Best Management Practices in Section 21.4.7) shall be shown on\nthe site plan submitted for the building or zoning permit.\nOnce implemented, all Best Management Practices (BMPs) mitigations as shown on the\napproved site plan shall be maintained and kept in working condition by the property owner.\nIf the BMPs as shown on the approved site plan have not been adequately maintained, no\nfurther zoning permits shall be issued until the BMPs on the site have been brought back to\nworking condition.\n21.4.5 Nutrient Allocation Worksheet to Determine Compliance with Phosphorus Runoff\nSurface Runoff Factors: Surface types over which rainwater drains on a parcel have different\nphosphorus runoff factors based on the potential of stormwater infiltration. Hard surfaces such\nas roofs and driveways have a high factor because stormwater cannot be absorbed into the\nground resulting in surface runoff; woodlands have a low factor as stormwater is absorbed into\nthe ground with little surface runoff.\nThe Nutrient Allocation Worksheet first calculates the Maximum Parcel Allocation for\nphosphorus leaving that specific parcel, in pounds per acre, based on the square footage of the\nparcel. The Nutrient Allocation Worksheet is also used to estimate the amount of phosphorus\nrunoff from the parcel both as it currently exists, and after the proposed changes (\"Proposed\nChanges\") based on the area of each surface type (for example - roofs, driveways, lawns, and\ngardens).\na.\nIf the Nutrient Allocation Worksheet estimates the amount of phosphorous runoff after the\nProposed Changes does not exceed the Maximum Parcel Allocation for that parcel, no\nmitigation is required.\nb. If the Nutrient Allocation Worksheet estimates the amount of phosphorous runoff after the\nProposed Changes to be greater than the Maximum Parcel Allocation for the parcel,\nmitigation to reduce the phosphorus runoff is required. The maximum estimated\nphosphorus leaving the parcel after the Proposed Changes cannot exceed the greater of the\nMaximum Parcel Allocation or 90% of the estimated phosphorus runoff of the parcel before\nthe proposed changes.\nFactors and co-efficient not listed on the Nutrient Allocation Worksheet may be used if based on\nrelevant scientific analysis and if approved by the Zoning Agent.\nIf the changes in surface types on the approved site plan results in a greater reduction in\nphosphorous runoff than is required, the excess reduction will be documented and carried\nforward to a future Nutrient Allocation Worksheet.\nColumbia Zoning Regulations Effective 5/17/21\n31\n"}, {"page": "36", "text": "21.4.6 Exception for Mitigating Parcel Surface Changes totaling 120 sq. ft. or Less\nThe Zoning Agent may approve a change of surface type from pervious to non-pervious (such as\nerecting a shed or adding or increasing a patio area) that is less than 120 square feet in surface\narea without requiring a Nutrient Allocation Worksheet if the change in surface type is mitigated\nto capture 2\" of stormwater. The Zoning Agent may approve more than one change of surface\ntype providing the total mitigated surface change approved under this Section does not exceed\n120 square feet. Thereafter, all future surface changes will require a Nutrient Allocation\nWorksheet and compliance with Section 21.4.4 and Section 21.4.5.\n21.4.7 Best Management Practices (BMPs) for Reduction of Phosphorus Runoff\nThe most important step in protecting Columbia Lake is thoughtful land stewardship that\nacknowledges the relationship between activities on land and the resulting lake water quality.\nPhosphorus runoff can be reduced by two methods:\n1) by changing the type of existing surfaces to ones that increase the stormwater infiltration\ninto the ground; and/or\n2) by detaining stormwater in swales, ponds or underground chambers to allow infiltration\ninto the ground before it reaches Columbia Lake.\nA number of manuals and websites have examples or diagrams of BMPs. The University of\nConnecticut's NEMO Center's website (nemo.uconn.edu/tools/index) stormwater section\ncontains some examples, explanations, and diagrams for BMPs that might be appropriate for a\nsite.\nThe most valuable and practical BMPs include:\nSite layout:\nMaintain pre-development vegetation\nLocate non-pervious areas so as to direct stormwater to desired locations\nReduce non-pervious areas\nMinimize creation of steep slopes\nEncourage sheet flow of stormwater versus channelization\nUse vegetated swales to interrupt sheet flow of stormwater\nUse permeable pavement that will be maintained\nAdditional methods:\nCreate a native woodland with appropriate trees, underbrush and groundcovers\nDirect roof runoff to an underground detention (drywells, designed above the\nmaximum high groundwater table)\nDirect driveway runoff to an underground detention or aboveground swale or pond\nDirect lawn sheet flow to a rain garden or lawn swale\nMaintain mulched areas especially on the down slopes of lawns and hard surfaces\nUsually, a combination of several of these methods are used. The Nutrient Allocation\nWorksheet has factors to calculate how changing surface types would impact the phosphorous\nleaving the site.\nColumbia Zoning Regulations Effective 5/17/21\n32\n"}, {"page": "37", "text": "21.4.8 Provision and Procedures for Reduction of Lake Watershed Protection Requirements\nIn a case where the applicant of a proposed activity governed by this Section is unable to comply\nwith the requirements of this Section, the Commission may receive and evaluate a written\nrequest, site plan, other relevant materials, and verbal testimony to consider reduction of the\nrequirements of this Section.
