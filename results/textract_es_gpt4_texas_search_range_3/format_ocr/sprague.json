In order to provide a variety of living, shopping and employment opportunities\nand settings, the Town of Sprague is divided into several zoning districts. The boundaries of the\ndistricts reflect many considerations, including existing land use, physical characteristics, access\nand the availability of and proximity to public facilities and services. The general intent of each\nzoning district is as follows:\n4.1.1 R-120 Natural Resource Protection Zone - This zone encompasses physically\nsensitive areas which have severe limitations for development such as inland wetlands,\nsurface reservoirs and their watersheds, aquifers, shallow depth to bedrock soils, steep\nslopes, floodplains and streambelts, and significant adjoining areas to these resources. It\n13\n"}, {"page": "14", "text": "SPRAGUE ZONING REGULATIONS AS OF 6/2/21\nmay also include open space, recreation, and conservation areas. The intent is to protect\nthese resources and to contribute to the scenic and aesthetic quality of the Town by\nlimiting land uses to low density uses.\n4.1.2 R-80 Rural Zone - These areas are generally rural in character and the zoning is\nintended to keep the intensity of uses as low as possible. Agriculture, conservation and\nrecreation uses, and scattered residences are the predominant uses of land in these\ndistricts.\n4.1.3 I Industrial - This zone includes the Town's existing major industries as well as\nadjacent land for new expanded activities. These areas have either good access by road\nor rail or are served by public utilities.\n4.1.4 Watercourse Focus Area Overlay Zone (WFA) - The regulations contained in\nthis section are not intended to be substituted for other general zoning provisions, but\nshould be considered to be additional requirements to be met by applicants as part of\napproval of any permit application. The purpose of the Watercourse Focus Area Overlay\nZone is to provide the Sprague Planning and Zoning Commission, Sprague Inland\nWetlands and Watercourses Commission, and the Sprague Conservation Commission\nwith an additional level of review and regulation to control how land use and\ndevelopment, permitted by the Town of Sprague's primary zoning districts, occurs in\nsensitive or unique environmental areas. (See WFA Special Permits Section 12.21 for\nrequirements in this zone)\nAny area of land, submerged, emergent, of wetland or upland soils, located in an area SO\ndesignated on the Zoning Map of the Town of Sprague. This area is identified for\npurposes of regulation and protection of groundwater and surface water resources,\nincluding aquifers, soils; to reduce the amount of nutrients, sediment, organic matter,\npesticides, and other harmful substances that reach watercourses, wetlands, or subsurface\nwater bodies by using scientifically proven processes including filtration, deposition,\nabsorption, plant uptake and denitrification, and by improving infiltration, encouraging\nsheet flow, and stabilizing concentrated flows. Regulation and protection shall strive to\nminimize fragmentation of the landscape, maintain biodiversity and protect unique\nenvironmental features.\n4.1.5 Baltic Economic Development Zone - The Baltic Economic Development Zone is\nto facilitate the development of, and encourage the revitalization of, a compact village\ncenter that promotes mixed uses such as housing, commerce with a range of retail stores\nand services, social and civic uses, access to the Shetucket River, business growth, a\nproper balance between accommodating pedestrian use and the automobile, a pattern of\ndevelopment that respects and fosters Sprague's historic past, the preservation of historic\nresources, views and vistas, buildings that are in proper size and scale with respect to the\nstreetscape and one another; in concert with the objectives of the Sprague Plan of\nConservation and Development. Commercial activities would be limited to those which\nare compatible with the intensity of development in the surrounding area.

Introduction. The design of buildings, structures, and landscapes in Baltic Village is valued by its\nresidents and the United States Department of the Interior who designated the Baltic Village National\nRegister of Historic Places in 1987. The Design Review Standards have been developed to guide\nproposed development in the Baltic Village Zone and the Baltic Economic Development Zone\n(\"Baltic Village\") and help to ensure that the unique qualities of the area is preserved and enhanced\nto everyone's benefit. The Design Review Standards shall serve as the criteria for the review and\napproval of projects for which design review is applicable.\nB. Applicability. Design review shall be required for new construction, substantial reconstruction,\nexterior modifications, and/or changes in land use of property that are visible from public view.\nDesign review shall not be required for maintenance, repair or replacement projects that do not alter\nthe existing appearance or for interior improvement projects that are not part of a change in land use.\nApplicants for zoning permits within the Baltic Village and Baltic Economic Development Zones\nshould confer with the Zoning Enforcement Officer regarding potential applicability of Design\nReview Standards to their projects.\nC. Process.\n1.\nPre-Application. Applicants may appear before the Planning and Zoning Commission to\ndiscuss a proposed application prior to its submission in accordance with CGS Sec. 7-159b.\n2. Design Review Application. Design review applications shall include site and floor plans,\nand elevations to scale, and other information to support discussion with Village District\nConsultant or Design Review Board (\"Design Professional\") and be the basis for approval.\n3. Review Process. Applicants may meet with the Design Professional to discuss the proposed\ndesign. The Design Professional will issue its findings and recommendations as a report to\nthe Commission within thirty-five (35) days of application receipt.\n4.\nAdditional Review. The applicant may request the opportunity to provide further information\nor changes to their application prior to the completion of the design review report, including\nan extension of time under CGS if necessary to submit additional information.\n5. Approval Process. The Design Professional recommendation will be considered as part of the\nproject application for final decision by the Commission and read into the record. The\nCommission may approve the design review application, approve it with conditions, or deny\nthe application based its non-conformity with the Design Review Standards.\n6. Criteria for Recommendations and Decisions. Both the Design Professional and Planning and\nZoning Commission shall use the Design Review Standards and The Secretary of the\nInterior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings\nas the entire basis for their findings. Design Principles articulate overall goals for the design\ncharacter within districts and the Design Standards describe potential approaches to\nachieving those principles.\nD. Design Principles\n1.\nValued Historic Character. Designs shall respect the history of Baltic Village which is\nSprague's town center with a walkable urban landscape, dense housing core, historic\narchitecture, pedestrian and human scale, municipal buildings, parks and recreation facilities,\nand former mill sites located on the banks of the Shetucket River. Buildings that have been\ndesignated as contributing to the Baltic Village National Register of Historic Places should\nbe restored to reflect their original architecture. Alterations or renovations to other buildings\nshould similarly be based on the original styles and architecture. New buildings or major\n96\n"}, {"page": "97", "text": "SPRAGUE ZONING REGULATIONS AS OF 6/2/21\nadditions may reflect or interpret the historic styles in the area but need not attempt to\nbecome exact reproductions or replicas. Designs for any building project should appear to be\nin balance with, rather than predominate over, its neighbors.\n2. Context of Building Types and Styles. Much of the architecture and landscape of Baltic\nVillage was established 150+/- years ago and represents building types and styles linked to\nthe era in which it was created. This pattern should continue into the future. (See Subsection\nF. for more on \"Context\".)\n3.\n3. Non-Automobile Environment. The location and design of parking areas should limit the\nvisual impact of the automobile. Parking is a practical need, but the more dominant character\nof the landscape and an emphasis on pedestrian connections and access should be the\ndominant image, rather than large areas of paving or asphalt.\nE. Design Standards\n1. Site Layout and Organization\na) Create landscaped space between the street and building that serve as a foreground.\nb) Locate significant accessory or companion buildings to the side or rear of the main\nstructure or building on the site. Principle buildings should not be concealed by secondary or\naccessory buildings directly in front of them.\nc) Provide significant facades facing the street. Buildings within Baltic Village traditionally\nface a street are two (2) or more stories high and contain a significant fa\u00e7ade with entrance.\nd) Locate parking in secondary rather than prominent locations. Parking areas should be\nplaced at the side or rear of structures and be partially concealed with landscaping, fencing or\nwalls.\ne) Limit view of garages and garage doors. Locate parking garage bays and doors SO that they\nare either along the side or rear of buildings.\nf) Respect existing open landscapes. Although buildings and landscaping may be created\nbetween public vantage points and such open areas, view corridors should be left open.\n2. Architecture and Building Design\na) Retain and renovate existing historic structures. Historic buildings should be retained,\nrestored or renovated to retain and express their original conditions, styles and features.\nb) Additions, major alterations, or replacement of historic structures should be consistent in\narchitectural style and character. Where major changes to a building occur, including\nreplacement, changes should extend the style and architectural characteristics of that building\nor the district. The architectural style and the overall way in which it is used should reflect\nthe influence of nearby and adjacent buildings. Use materials, details, and features\nappropriate for the chosen architectural style and influences. Where a new structure or\nsubstantial reconstruction of a building occurs, the materials, colors and features used should\nbe consistent with the architectural style of the building chosen rather than becoming a\ncollection of different styles and elements. See \"Context\" in Subsection F.\nc) Avoid blank walls or facades and flat roofs facing the street or visible from street.\nd) Mechanical and satellite dish equipment shall be concealed from public roadways.\n3. Site and Landscape Design\na) Use fence and walls for practical purposes. In a village landscape, walls and fences serve\npractical purposes such as enclosing special places and uses, or separating pedestrian areas\nfrom vehicle areas. They should not be employed primarily as site decoration and shall not be\nchain link or stockade in the front yard setback. Fences erected in the front yard shall not be\nmore than four (4) feet in height and more than one-half (1/2) solid, and stone walls should\nnot be more than three (3) feet in height.\n97\n"}, {"page": "98", "text": "SPRAGUE ZONING REGULATIONS AS OF 6/2/21\nb) Screen mechanical and satellite equipment and dumpsters. Roof, ground or concrete pad-\nmounted mechanical equipment and dumpsters shall be concealed from public view using\nevergreen plant materials complementary to the landscaping or architectural detailing\ncomplementary to the building.\nc) Signs shall complement the architecture and site design. Signs shall be integrated into the\noverall site design and complementary in color and materials with the buildings and\nlandscape and avoid blocking views to historic buildings or features.\nF. Context. The design of new construction, substantial rehabilitations, exterior modifications or\nchanges in land use should take into account its \"context\". The context includes the characteristics of\nthe site, existing buildings, and relationship to neighboring properties and Baltic Village as a whole.\nMany buildings and sites are excellent examples of a nineteenth-century mill village setting.\nAs part of the design and pre-application process, applicants should identify the style of any\nbuildings that they anticipate renovating or expanding, including important architectural\ncharacteristics. They should also consider adjacent or nearby buildings and consider whether or not\nthe architectural style or other characteristics should be a direct influence on their project.\nThe following buildings are examples of the variety of styles and architectural characteristics that\nhelp compose Baltic Village. New construction, renovation or substantial improvement to property\nshall be consistent with these styles.\nVillage Mill Housing. Most of the original 130 mill houses still stand today and represent an\nexcellent example of the historic and uniform architectural landscape that helps identify Baltic\nVillage.
