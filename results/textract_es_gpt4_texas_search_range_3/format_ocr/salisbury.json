The purpose of this regulation is to broaden the options for a variety of\nhousing types by permitting an apartment associated with a single family owner occupied\nresidence and lot. The Commission finds that such apartments are an expeditious option for\nthe creation of much needed, low impact, housing units which can be dispersed within the\ncommunity, that such apartments often require modest construction modifications and such\nimprovements can readily blend into existing residential neighborhoods, and that an\napartment in an accessory structure, such as a garage or barn, further expands new housing\nopportunities while avoiding the need to alter existing homes.\nb.\nGeneral. An apartment may be permitted within an existing or proposed single-family\ndwelling subject to Site Plan approval. An apartment in an approved accessory building\nassociated with a single family dwelling may be permitted subject to approval of a Special\nPermit provided only one apartment is permitted on a lot and the site plan and proposed\nimprovements are designed to maintain residential appearance and character on the lot.\nC.\nOwner Occupied. The applicant shall be the owner of the lot. The applicant, or their family\nmember, shall reside in either the principal dwelling or the apartment unit.\nd.\nApartment Floor Area. The minimum floor area for an apartment in a principal dwelling or in\nan accessory building shall be 350 square feet or the minimum required by the State Building\nCode, whichever is less.

These overlay districts facilitate the development of a\nPage 48\n"}, {"page": "49", "text": "Salisbury Planning and Zoning Regulations - 2019\nvariety of housing choices that would appeal to seniors, families, and those employed in the community.\nThe Multi-Family Housing and Pocketknife Square Overlay Districts provide flexibility within the context\nof the Town's zoning ordinance to encourage the development of multi-family housing to meet these\ncommunity needs. The Multi-Family Housing Overlay District is mapped within the existing village\ncenters and to undeveloped or underdeveloped parcels with access to public sewer adjacent to the village\ncenters. Upon a petition to the Planning and Zoning Commission to amend the zoning map in accordance\nwith Section 911 of the Zoning Regulations of the Town of Salisbury, the Multi-Family Housing Overlay\nDistrict may be extended for the purpose of constructing multi-family housing outside the village center.\nThe Pocketknife Square Overlay District is mapped to the parcels within the immediate vicinity of\nPocketknife Square, and promotes the adaptive re-use of existing structures and contextual redevelopment.\n405.2 Definitions\nFor the purpose of this section the following terms shall be defined as follows:\nAFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT. A housing unit that is affordable to a household whose income does not\nexceed 80% of the area median income (AMI) for Litchfield County or the State of Connecticut, whichever\nis less, as defined annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and for\nwhich the annual housing cost of a unit including: common charges; principal, interest, taxes and insurance\n(PITI), as applicable; and tenant paid utilities on a rental unit; does not exceed 30% of 80% AMI, adjusted\nfor family size. Affordable housing units shall be deed restricted for use as affordable housing for a\nminimum of 50 years.\nCOMMUNITY AMENITIES. Customary accessory residential amenities intended for use by residents of\nthe development, including but not limited to playscapes, fitness centers, community recreation rooms,\ngardens, walking trails, outdoor exercise equipment, swimming pools, and sport courts.\nDENSITY BONUS. An incentive-based zoning tool that permits an increase in the maximum allowable\ndevelopment on a property in exchange for achieving a stated public policy goal.\nSTREET WALL. A street wall is a line of building facades that maintain a consistent front yard setback\nand minimal side yard setbacks thus forming a \"wall.\"\n405.3\nPermitted Uses\nWithin the Multi-Family Housing and Pocketknife Square Overlay Districts, new construction multi-family\nhousing shall be permitted as a Special Permit use. Conversion to multi-family dwellings shall be permitted\nin accordance with Section 209.2.\n405.4\nMFH Overlay District Density\nThe determination of the permitted number of new construction dwellings, lot size and related bulk\nrequirements for the MFH Overlay District shall be as follows:\na.\nGeneral purpose. The permitted number of dwellings for a multi-family development is equal\nto the net buildable area of the site multiplied by the density factors assigned for each overlay\ndistrict. The site capacity calculation provides the mechanism for subtracting from the base\nsite area all portions of a site considered inappropriate for the development. Consequently, the\npurpose of this section is to determine the extent to which a site may be utilized given its\nunique characteristics.\nb.\nCalculation of base site area. The base site area shall be determined as follows:\nPage 49\nCELL (1, 1): \nCalculation of Base Site Area\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \n1.\nGross site area as determined by actual on-site survey\nCELL (2, 2): \nacres\nCELL (3, 1): \n2.\nSubtract land constituting roads and land within rights-of-way of\nexisting roads, rights-of-way of utilities and easements of access\nCELL (3, 2): \nacres\n"}, {"page": "50", "text": "Salisbury Planning and Zoning Regulations - 2019\nand land with deed restrictions prohibiting building or\ndevelopment\n3.

The total acreage of each resource shall be\nmultiplied by its respective open space ratio to determine the amount of resource protection\nland or area required to be kept in open space to protect the resource or feature. The sum total\nof all resource protection land on the site equals the total resource protection land on the site.\nIt should be noted that certain categories may overlap and are not intended to be duplicated.\nd. Determination of site capacity. Individual site capacity is determined by calculating the net\nbuildable site area. For multi-family developments, the number of dwelling units permitted is\ndetermined by multiplying the density factor for each overlay district by the net buildable\narea. The calculations are as follows:\ne. Density factors.\n1.\nDensity factors for the MFH Overlay District. The maximum density factors to be\nused in the previous calculation shall be as follows:\n2.\nA bonus density factor of four (4) may be applied at the discretion of the Planning\nand Zoning Commission for the provision of affordable housing where a minimum\nof fifty percent (50%) of the units are affordable as defined herein.\nPage 50\nCELL (1, 1): \nResource or Feature\nCELL (1, 2): \nOpen Space\nRatio\n(A)\nCELL (1, 3): \nAcres in\nResource\n(B)\nCELL (1, 4): \nTotal land in\nResource\n(A * B)\nCELL (2, 1): \nLakes, ponds and watercourses\nCELL (2, 2): \n1.0\nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (3, 1): \nWetlands\nCELL (3, 2): \n1.0\nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (3, 4): \nCELL (4, 1): \nFloodplains\nCELL (4, 2): \n1.0\nCELL (4, 3): \nCELL (4, 4): \nCELL (5, 1): \nModerate slopes (15% to 25%)\nCELL (5, 2): \n0.5\nCELL (5, 3): \nCELL (5, 4): \nCELL (6, 1): \nSteep slopes (25% or greater)\nCELL (6, 2): \n1.0\nCELL (6, 3): \nCELL (6, 4): \nCELL (7, 1): \nTotal land in resource =\nCELL (7, 2): \n--\nCELL (7, 3): \nCELL (7, 4): \nCELL (1, 1): \nDetermination of Site Capacity\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \n1.

Subsequent to the adoption of these Regulations\nunder the terms of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 a federal court ruled that only the State of\nConnecticut (currently under the State Siting Council) could regulate the location of such towers and\nfacilities. However, the State Citing Council must consider the policies and practices of the town where a\ntower is proposed. Accordingly, these Regulations are retained as a statement of the Planning and Zoning\nCommission's policy and practice regarding tower siting.\nAlso, the Commission retains the right to regulate the location of communication antennas under a certain\nsize as established by the State of Connecticut. In these cases the requirements for communication antenna\nlocation shall be regulated according to the requirements in these Regulations.\n1000.2 Purpose\nThe purpose of the regulation is to regulate the placement of antennas, towers and other wireless facilities,\nto protect the aesthetic quality of the Salisbury sky-line and to assure the safety of the community.

Establish locations least disruptive to the public health, safety and welfare of the Town of\nSalisbury and consistent with the Town Plan of Conservation and Development;\nC.
