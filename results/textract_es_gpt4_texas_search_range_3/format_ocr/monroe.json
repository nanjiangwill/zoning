The Commission finds that quality landscaping and lighting provides many unique services and\nvalues to the community. Landscaping softens the edges of buildings, screens undesirable places,\nmakes large buildings appear smaller and more human scale, assists in maintaining biodiversity,\nand can create places for social gathering. Vegetation recycles the air and water, absorbs\npollution and sequesters carbon, buffers noise, and provides shade, air-cooling and windbreak\nprotection. Quality landscaping also helps control flooding and erosion of topsoil, provides\nhabitat for birds and other wildlife species, buffers and screens incompatible uses, provides\nprivacy from visual intrusion, light and noise, moderates microclimate conditions such as that\nwithin paved parking facilities by providing vegetative shading, absorption of reflected heat and\ncreation of natural wind breaks, improves the quality of the environment, enhances property\nvalues and beautifies the community which ensures the maintenance of existing community\ncharacter attributes deemed important to the Town.\nB. Quality lighting minimizes light pollution through use of appropriately designed, installed and\nmaintained light fixtures which are fully and permanently fixed and shielded, which lighting is\ndesigned to be shut off when the facility served is closed.\n$6.2.2 General Landscaping and Lighting Design Standards\nA.

Finding of Fact - Cause and Effect\nThe flood hazard areas of the Town of Monroe are subject to periodic inundation which results in\nloss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental\nservices, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the\ntax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.\nThese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood\nhazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage\nuses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected\nfrom flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.\nB. Statement of Purpose\n(1)\nObjectives\nIt is the purpose of this Section to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare,\nand to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by\nprovisions designed:\n(a)\nTo protect human life and health;\n(b)\nTo minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\n(c)\nTo minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and\ngenerally undertaken at the expense of the general public;\nAmended Effective Through April 28, 2021\nArticle 6, p.43\n"}, {"page": "149", "text": "Town of Monroe Zoning Regulations\n(d)\nTo minimize prolonged business interruptions;\n(e) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains,\nelectric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special\nflood hazard;\n(f)\nTo help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development\nof areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;\n(g)\nTo insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood\nhazard; and\n(h)\nTo ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume\nresponsibility for their actions.\n(2)\nMethods of Reducing Flood Losses\nIn order to accomplish its purposes, this Section includes methods and provisions for:\n(a)\nRestricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property\ndue to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or\nin flood heights or velocities;\n(b)\nRequiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be\nprotected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;\n(c)\nControlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural\nprotective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;\n(d)\nControlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase\nflood drainage; and\n(e)\nPreventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally\ndivert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.\n$6.6.2 Applicability\nA.
