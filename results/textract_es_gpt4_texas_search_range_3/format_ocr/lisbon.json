A Golf Course Community\n- Active Adult shall be a common interest community and as such, shall be subject to the provisions\nof the Connecticut Common Interests Ownership Act, Chapter 828, as amended, of the Connecticut\nGeneral Statutes. The GCC is available only to property wholly located within the Town of Lisbon,\non lands currently zoned R-60 or R-80 with access immediately to or within 1,500 feet of a state\nhighway.\nThe provisions of the GCC will apply only to specific properties that are rezoned to a GCC\ndesignation by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Upon rezoning to GCC designation, a unique,\nnumbered zoning district classification (GCC [#]) will be created on the Zoning Map of the Town of\nLisbon, and the Master Plan approved in conjunction with the map amendment shall become an\nintegral part of the zoning for the land included within that GCC and shall establish the zoning\nstandards for that GCC.\nThe zoning district only exists within the text of these Regulations and is not placed on the Lisbon\nZoning Map until approval of an application to create a particular GCC and to affix that zoning\ndistrict to a specific property(s). The creation of a GCC can only be accomplished by approval of a\nzoning map change, which requires a concurrent master plan. Subsequent to the approval of the\nzoning map change and master plan, a site plan application and accompanying site plan must be\napproved before site development can begin. Such detailed site plan must comply in all respects\nwith the approved master plan, and any other applicable provisions of these Regulations.\n7A.1.2 Relationship to Zoning Regulations:\nUses within the GCC shall be subject to all provisions and definitions of these Regulations.\nHowever, because the intent of the GCC is to provide flexibility in design standards in order to\nachieve important design objectives as described herein, in cases of conflict with other provisions of\nthese Regulations including the zoning definitions, the provisions of this section shall prevail.\n7A.1.3 Purposes of GCC: The purposes of the GCC are as follows:\nA.

Buildings shall define the streetscape through the use of setbacks along the\nbuild-to line for each block. The build-to line shall be generally continued across side yard\nsetback areas between buildings by using landscaping. The streetscape shall also be reinforced\nby lines of closely planted shade trees, and may be further reinforced by walls, hedges or fences\nwhich define front yards.\nArchitectural Character. Buildings may be either traditional in their architectural character or\nbe a contemporary expression of traditional styles.\nScale. The scale of new construction, including the arrangement of windows, doors and other\nopenings within the fa\u00e7ade, shall be compatible with historic buildings in the region.\nBuilding Mass. Buildings of forty (40) feet or more in width shall be visually divided into\nsmaller increments to reduce their apparent size and contribute to a human scale development.\nThe mass of these buildings shall be de-emphasized in a variety of ways through architectural\ndetails such as divisions or breaks in materials, window bays, separate entrances and entry\ntreatments, variations in rooflines, awnings, or the use of sections that may project or be\nrecessed up to ten (10) feet.\nRoof Materials. Roof materials and color should be traditional, meaning they should be within\nthe range of colors found on buildings in the region. The use of fascias, dormers and gables is\nencouraged to provide visual interest.\nExterior Wall Materials. Exterior wall materials, color and texture should be similar to that\nfound on buildings in the region.\nColors. Colors found on exterior surfaces shall be harmonious with surrounding development\nand shall visually reflect the traditional colors of the region.\nAccessory Structures. All accessory structures, screen walls and exposed areas of retaining\nwalls shall be of a similar type, quality and appearance as the principal structure.\nC.\nSite Circulation to include:\nPedestrian, including materials to be used for walkways and the location thereof\nBicycle trails, and the location and construction method thereof\nPublic transit access, including the design of bus shelters and the location thereof\nMotor vehicles, including the hierarchy of road widths and specifications and the width of each\ntype of roadway; the location of parking areas and the methods of screening or buffering them\nfrom the public areas, and the methods of illuminating them so to avoid glare on adjoining\nparcels.\nd.\nStreetscape and landscaping standards, including materials, street furniture, illumination, cross\nwalks, and preservation of existing specimen trees.\ne.\nLighting and signage standards, including an overall sign plan, with method of illumination\nspecified.\nf.\nWaste disposal facilities, such as dumpster areas and the screening or enclosure thereof.\ng.\nTreatment of service areas, loading and delivery areas and above ground utilities such as\ntransformer boxes.\nSPECIFIC SITE AND DESIGN CRITERIA\ni.\nPurpose\nThe site and design review process for the district seeks to encourage visual harmony, respect\nhistoric integrity, and encourage creative design solutions. These guidelines are not limited to\ndictate style but rather to provide framework of common principles that foster design\ncompatibility within the district where the GCC is situated.
