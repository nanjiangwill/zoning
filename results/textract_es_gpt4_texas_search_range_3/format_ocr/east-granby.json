Prepare plans for development of the site utilizing the following guidelines:\na) Avoidance of Impacts:\nProtect as much undisturbed land as possible to maintain pre-development hydrology\nthrough interception of rainfall by vegetation, evapotranspiration, and infiltration.\nProtect the natural drainage systems, such as wetlands, watercourses, ponds, vernal\npools, and natural depressions on the landscape to the maximum extent possible.\nThese areas can collect, hold and in the case of natural depressions infiltrate rainfall\ninto the ground.\nMinimize the extent of land clearing and the disturbance and/or grading of natural\nsoils. Un- disturbed soils have significantly higher infiltration rates than disturbed\nsoils.\nPreserve soils with high to moderate infiltration rates (Soil Classes A and B) by\nconcentrating impervious surfaces on those soils with low infiltrative capacities (Soil\nClass C).\nImplement techniques to prevent the compaction of natural soils.\nb) Reduction of Impacts:\nMinimize the extent of impervious areas on the site, particularly those directly\nconnected to drainage outfalls.\nIncrease the \"Time of Concentration\" for post-development conditions to closely\napproximate or match the \"Time of Concentration\" for pre-development conditions\nby the utilization of overland flow across naturally vegetated surfaces to the\nmaximum extent practical.\nUtilize low maintenance landscapes that will encourage the retention and planting of\nnative types of vegetation, and minimize the extent of lawn areas.\nc) Management of Impacts:\nUse vegetated conveyance and source treatment systems to collect and infiltrate\nrunoff as close as possible to the source of the runoff, such as bioretention systems\nfor roof drains.\nUse rain barrels or cisterns to collect and reuse runoff from roof areas for non-\npotable purposes.\nDisconnect impervious areas to the maximum extent practical by directing runoff\nfrom impervious surfaces onto vegetated surfaces.\n3/5/96 w/ amendments to 6/18/16\n101\n"}, {"page": "116", "text": "ADDENDA\nUtilize deep soil scarification (a minimum of 12\" below finish grade) on disturbed\nsoils to loosen the soils and increase the infiltrative capacity of the soils.\nImplement procedures to prevent or minimize the use of compounds which are\nresponsible for the pollutants found in non-point source runoff. This includes\nreducing the use of sand and salt on roads, parking areas and driveways without\ncompromising the safety of these surfaces.\nReduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides on lawn and landscape area to the\nmaximum extent practical.\nUtilize multiple stormwater treatment systems in series to reduce pollutant loads\nfrom stormwater as well as infiltrate runoff prior to discharging to natural wetland or\nwatercourse systems.\n6. Utilize the following guidelines for site layout:\na) Road Layout and Design:\nRoad alignments should follow the existing contours to the maximum extent\npractical to minimize excessive cuts and fills,\nMinimize the extent of directly connected impervious area to the maximum extent\npractical. This can be achieved by the minimization of drainage structures on the\nroad, such as catch basins and connecting pipe and the use of vegetated swales along\nthe road in appropriate locations.\nUtilize LID treatment strategies to treat runoff at the source and not at the end of the\npipe.\nUtilize multiple LID treatment systems in a series to increase the effectiveness of the\npollutant removal from the stormwater.\nb) Driveway Layouts:\nLayout out the location of the driveway to minimize cuts and fills.\nUse impervious area disconnection strategies to intercept, and direct runoff to\nvegetated surface or vegetated treatment system prior to the runoff reaching the road.\nDirect runoff from driveway onto vegetated areas for a minimum of 75' to facilitate\ninfiltration.\nc) Lot Designs:\nLayout site improvements in such a manner as to minimize site clearing by\ndelineating the smallest possible area for clearing and site disturbance where roads,\nstructures and other improvements are to be constructed.\nLayout buildings, driveway and on-site sewage disposal systems in such a manner as\nto minimize the extent of soil disturbance and grading on the lot.\nUtilize the natural topography when siting a proposed building to minimize site\ndisturbance (such as creating a walkout basement for a building on a natural 15-20%\nslope).\nAvoid randomly disturbing areas of the site where it is not necessary, this will\npreserve the infiltrative capacity of native soils.\nUse \"source\" controls such as rain barrels for roof runoff to collect and reuse runoff;\nrain gardens for roof runoff to infiltrate runoff into the ground; impervious area\ndisconnection to allow runoff to occur as overland flow across a vegetated surface.\nConsider the use of meadow filter strips at the downhill limits of development to\nfilter runoff prior to leaving the lot.\n102\n3/5/96 w/ amendments to 6/18/16\n"}], "town": "east-granby"}
