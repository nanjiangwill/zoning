Purpose and findings.\nA. The intent of this article is to regulate adult-oriented establishments which, because\nof their very nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable characteristics,\nparticularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances,\nthereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas. Special regulation of\nthese uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the\nblighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. The primary control or\nregulation is for the purpose of preventing a concentration of these uses in any one\narea as well as the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Orange. The\nregulations are, therefore, adopted to protect retail trade, prevent crime, maintain\nproperty values, preserve the quality of neighborhood property and life, address\nrelated concerns with littering, parking, traffic, and public indecency, to maintain\nthe interest of persons in their property in a state of good repair, and to spend,\npatronize and trade in their community.\nB. Statistics and studies performed by a substantial number of cities and towns in the\nUnited States indicate that:\n(1) Large numbers of persons frequent such adult-oriented establishments,\nespecially those which provide closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms for\nthe private viewing of SO called adult motion pictures and/or videotapes and/\nor live entertainment; and\n(2) Such closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms have been used by patrons,\nclients or customers of such adult-oriented establishments for the purpose of\nengaging in specified sexual activities; and\n(3) Male and female prostitutes have been known to frequent such. establishments\nin order to provide sex for hire to the patrons, clients or customers of such\nestablishments within such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms; and\n(4) Doors, curtains, blinds and/or other closures installed or on the entrances and/\nor exits of such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms which are closed while\nsuch booths, cubicles, studios and rooms are in use, encourage patrons, clients\nor customers using such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms to engage in\nspecified sexual activities therein with prostitutes and/or with other persons\nand/or by themselves, thereby promoting or encouraging prostitution and the\ncommission of specified sexual activities which cause blood, semen, urine or\nother bodily secretion to be deposited on the floors and/or walls of such\nbooths, cubicles, studios and rooms which deposits could prove detrimental to\nthe health and safety of other persons who may come into contact with such\ndeposits; and\n(5)\nBooths, cubicles, studios and rooms which are closed while such booths,\ncubicles, studios and rooms are in use often contain holes that have been cut\nor smashed out of the walls or other partitioning material.

These promote\nand encourage specified sexual acts to occur between persons anonymously.\nAnonymous sexual contact poses a higher risk of spread of communicable\ndiseases including the AIDS virus and Hepatitis B and other sexually\ntransmitted diseases. Further, the existence of such holes in booths, cubicles,\nstudios and rooms in an adult-oriented establishment provides an increased\nrisk that blood, semen, urine and other bodily secretions will be deposited on\nthe floors and/or walls of such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms, which\ndeposits could prove detrimental to the health and safety of other persons who\nmay come into contact with such deposits; and\n(6)\nSpecified sexual activities often occur at unregulated adult-oriented\nestablishments which provide live adult entertainment, specified sexual\nactivities, including sexual physical contact between employees and patrons,\nclients or customers of adult-oriented establishments, and specifically include\nlap dancing and/or manual or oral touching or fondling of specified anatomical\nareas whether clothed or unclothed. Such casual, sexual physical contact\nbetween strangers may result in the transmission of communicable diseases\nwhich would be detrimental to the health of the patrons, clients or customers\nand employees of such adult-oriented establishments; and\n(7) The unregulated operation of adult-oriented establishments is associated with\nan increase in the incidents of sex-related crimes and also has a disruptive\neffect on the surrounding neighborhood by causing excessive noise, parking\nproblems, the presence of discarded sexually oriented material on residential\nlawns, and the performance of sexual acts in public places; and\n(8) The reasonable regulation and supervision of such adult-oriented\nestablishments tends to discourage prostitution, other sex-related crimes,\nanonymous high-risk sexual contact and/or high-risk unsanitary sexual\nactivity, excessive noise and property devaluation, thereby decreasing the\nincidents of communicable diseases and sex-related crimes and thereby\npromoting and protecting the health, safety and welfare of the employees and\nthe public who patronize such establishments and protecting the health, safety,\nand property interests of the Town and its citizens.\nC.\nThe continued unregulated operation of adult-oriented establishments is and would\nbe detrimental to the general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of Orange.\nThe Constitution and the laws of the State of Connecticut grant to the Town powers,\nespecially police power, to enact reasonable legislation and measures to regulate\nand supervise adult-oriented establishments in order to protect the public health,\nsafety and welfare.\nD.\nIt is not the intent of the Orange Plan and Zoning Commission to deny any person\nrights to speech protected by the United States and/or State Constitutions, to impose\nany limitations or restrictions on the content of any communicative materials,\nincluding sexually-oriented films, videotapes, books and/or other materials, nor to\ndeny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain or view any sexually oriented\nmaterials protected by the United States and/or State Constitution or to restrict or\ndeny any Constitutionally protected rights that distributors or exhibitors of such\n383:124\n"}, {"page": "125", "text": "\u00a7 383-144\nZONING\n\u00a7 383-145\nsexually oriented materials may have to sell, distribute or exhibit such materials.\n\u00a7 383-145.

General.\nA.\nFinding: The scheme of the Orange Zoning Regulations has always included the\nregulation of signs to provide adequate means of expression and to promote the\neconomic viability of the business community while protecting the Town and its\ncitizens from a proliferation of signs of a type, size, location and character which\nwould adversely impact upon the aesthetics of the community and create hazards to\nthe health, safety and welfare of the community. The Commission finds that signs\nprovide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of\nmessages. However, left unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as\na traffic hazard and detriment to property values and the community's overall public\nwelfare as an aesthetic concern.\nB.\nPurpose and intent: The purpose and intent of this article is to regulate the number,\nlocation, size, type and use of signs within the Town in order to promote the public\nhealth, safety and welfare and to maintain, enhance and improve the aesthetic\nenvironment of the Town by preventing visual clutter that is harmful to traffic\nsafety and the appearance of the community. The intent of this section is to improve\nthe visual appearance of the Town while providing for effective means of\ncommunication, consistent with constitutional guarantees. This section does not\nregulate, nor is it intended to regulate, the message displayed on any sign, or to\nregulate building design or any display not defined as a sign, or any sign which\ncannot be viewed from outside a building.\nC.\nNoncommercial signs: Notwithstanding any other pro vision in this article or these\nRegulations to the contrary, any sign authorized in these Regulations may contain\nany noncommercial copy in addition to, or in lieu of, any other copy.
