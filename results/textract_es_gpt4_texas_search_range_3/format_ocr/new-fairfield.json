Establishment\nThe establishment of the Floodplain Overlay District is based on data from the study conducted\nby the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and presented in the report entitled,\n\"The Flood Insurance Study, Town of New Fairfield, Connecticut, Fairfield County\" (Study),\ndated June 18, 2010 and adopted into the New Fairfield Code of Ordinances at Chapter 5 and\nby reference into these Zoning Regulations.\n5.1.2. Special Flood Hazard Areas\nThis regulation shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the Town of New Fairfield\nidentified by the FEMA in its Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) dated February 15, 1984, the\nStudy, and other supporting data applicable to the Town of New Fairfield, and any subsequent\nrevisions thereto, which are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this regulation.\nSince mapping is legally adopted by reference into this regulation it must take precedence\nwhere more restrictive until such time as a map amendment or map revision is obtained from\nFEMA. Areas of special flood hazard are determined utilizing the base flood elevations (BFE)\nprovided on the flood profiles in the Study for a community. BFEs provided on a FIRM are only\napproximate (round up or down) and should be verified with the BFEs published in the Study for\na specific location.\nThe Study and the FIRM divide the Town into three areas:\nA. A zones, with no base flood elevations determined, which represent areas of flooding\nanticipated to occur every one-hundred (100) years.\nB. AE zones, with base flood elevations determined, which represent areas of flooding\nanticipated to occur every one-hundred (100) years.\nC. X zones, which are areas between the limits of the 100-year flood and the 500-year\nflood; or certain areas subjected to one-hundred (100)-year flooding with average depth\nless than one (1) foot; or which are areas of minimal flood hazard.\n5.1.3.

Purpose and Objective\nThe flood hazard areas of the Town of New Fairfield are subject to periodic inundation by\nfloodwaters that may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of\ncommerce and government service, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and\nrelief, and impairment of tax base. It is the purpose of this regulation to promote the public\nhealth, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flood\nconditions in specific areas by:\nNew Fairfield Zoning Regulations\n67\nApril 4, 2016\n"}, {"page": "72", "text": "A.

Floodplain Overlay District Boundaries\nThe Floodplain Overlay District is defined as being those areas within the bounds of A Zones,\nAE Zones, and X Zones as presented on the FEMA created Flood Insurance Rate Maps\n(FIRM). The Floodplain Overlay District overlaps other zoning districts. Where conflicts in uses\nor standards between the Floodplain Overlay District and the underlying zone occur, the\nmore\nrestrictive of the two will take precedence.\n5.1.6. Floodplain Overlay District Zones\nThe Floodplain Overlay District is subdivided into two Zones:\nA. Floodway - The Floodway is the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent area\nwithin the A and AE zones that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood\nwithout cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot at any\npoint.\nB. Flood Fringe - The Flood Fringe is that area between the Floodway and the outer\nlimits of the base flood within the A and AE zones and sometimes the X zone. It thus\nencompasses the portion of the Floodplain Overlay District which can be encroached\nupon without raising the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot.\n5.1.7. The Floodway and the Flood Fringe\nThe Floodway and the Flood Fringe are represented on the FIRM incorporated into these\nRegulations and referenced in the Study.\nA. When base flood elevation data and/or floodway data have not been provided, the\napplicant of any application, petition or request for Special Permit, Site Plan and/or\nSubdivision Approval shall provide the Zoning Commission with data which meets the\nstandards of accepted engineering practice and the requirements of the National Flood\nInsurance Program, such that it may review and reasonably utilize such base flood\nelevation and/or floodway data in order to administer the provisions of this regulation.\nInformation in the form of land surveys, structural engineering, and/or hydraulic\nengineering shall be prepared at the expense of the applicant. Should data be provided,\nthe Commission shall adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the\nfloodway must be able to convey the waters of the base flood without increasing the\nwater surface elevation more than one (1) foot at any point along the watercourse.\nNew Fairfield Zoning Regulations\n68\nApril 4, 2016\n"}, {"page": "73", "text": "B.

This includes the\nelevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) and\nflood-proofing for all new construction and substantial improvements. When flood-\nproofing is utilized for a particular structure, the Zoning Commission shall obtain\ncertification from a registered professional engineer or architect, in accordance with\nSection 5.1.13 C.3.\nC. When base flood elevations have been determined with AE zones in the community's\nFIRM but a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the Zoning Commission must\nrequire that no new construction, substantial improvements, repair to structures which\nhave sustained substantial damage or other development, including fill, shall be\npermitted which will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than\none (1.0) foot at any point within the community when all existing and anticipated\ndevelopment is considered cumulatively with the proposed development.\nD. Aboveground Storage Tanks - Above-ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc) which\nare located outside or inside of the structure must either be elevated above the base\nflood elevation (BFE) on a concrete pad, or be securely anchored with tie-down straps\nto\nprevent flotation or lateral movement, have the top of the fill pipe extend above the BFE,\nand have a screw fill cap that does not allow for the infiltration of flood water.\nE. Portion of Structure in Flood Zone - If any portion of a structure lies within the Special\nFlood Hazard Area (SFHA), the entire structure is considered to be in the SFHA. The\nentire structure must meet the construction requirements of the flood zone. The\nStructure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other\nstructure attached to the main structure. Decks or porches that extend into a more\nrestrictive flood zone will require the entire structure to meet the standards of the more\nrestrictive zone.\nF. Structures in Two Flood Zones - If a structure lies within two or more flood zones, the\nconstruction standards of the most restrictive zone apply to the entire structure (i.e., V\nZone is more restrictive than A zone; structure must be built to the highest BFE). The\nstructure includes any attached additions, garages, decks, sunrooms, or any other\nstructure attached to the main structure. (Decks or porches that extend into a more\nrestrictive zone will require the entire structure to meet the requirements of the more\nrestrictive zone.)\nG. No Structures Entirely or Partially Over Water - New construction, substantial\nimprovements and repair to structures that have sustained substantial damage cannot\nbe constructed or located entirely or partially over water unless it is a functionally\ndependent use or facility.\nNew Fairfield Zoning Regulations\n69\nApril 4, 2016\n"}, {"page": "74", "text": "5.1.8.

Purpose\nAquifers are an essential natural resource and a major source of public drinking water for the\nState of Connecticut. Use of groundwater will increase as the population grows and\nopportunities for new surface water supplies diminish due to the rising cost of land and\nincreasingly intense development. At the same time, numerous drinking water wells have been\ncontaminated by certain land use activities, and others are now threatened. Stratified drift\naquifers, which are existing or potential public drinking water sources, have historically been\ncontaminated by activities associated with certain land uses. Therefore, it is necessary that\nspecific controls over land use be exercised within these areas to protect the Town's major\ngroundwater resources and ensure a future supply of safe drinking water for the Town of New\nFairfield and its residents.\n5.2.2. Authority\nThese regulations are adopted pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-2 and 8-3, that require the\nZoning Commission to consider protection of existing potential public water supplies in these\nRegulations.

Statement of Purpose\nThe Town of New Fairfield recognizes that wireless communication services are an important\npart of the daily lives of many people. The Town wishes to allow for the availability of adequate\nwireless communications service in New Fairfield while striving to find the least obtrusive means\nof having such services available.\n9.2.2 Basic Program\nThere are two ways that wireless telecommunications services are regulated in Connecticut:\nA. The Connecticut Siting Council regulates non-municipal wireless telecommunications\ntowers and associated facilities;\nB. The Zoning Commission regulates municipal wireless telecommunication towers and\nnon-tower telecommunications facilities.\nThese policy preferences are intended to provide guidance to wireless telecommunications\nproviders (WTPs), the Siting Council (CSC), and the Zoning Commission (ZC) in terms of the\nsiting of new wireless telecommunications facilities (both tower and non-tower).\nThe Town of New Fairfield intends to carefully review applications for wireless\ntelecommunications facilities (whether to the CSC of the ZC) that may affect the community or\nits residents.\nWhen the Town is notified (as required) of pending application to the CSC for a wireless\ntelecommunications tower, it is the intent of the Town to schedule a public informational meeting\nwhere the WTP can explain the need for and the impact of the proposed wireless\ntelecommunications tower and associated facilities. Based on the input received at this meeting\nand other information collected, the Town of New Fairfield will prepare and provide testimony to\nthe CSC for use during the permitting process.\n9.2.3 Basic Policy Preferences\nThe Town of New Fairfield seeks to encourage or require the siting of wireless\ntelecommunications facilities in ways that will:\nA. Allow for permitting of locations which are found to be the least visually obtrusive;\nB. Establish locations least disruptive to the public health, safety, and welfare of New\nFairfield and consistent with the Plan of Conversation and Development;\nC. Protect the Town's visual quality and minimize any adverse visual impacts through\nproper design, siting, and screening;\nD. Safeguard the community;\nE. Minimize potential damage to adjacent properties;\nF. Minimize the number of towers, especially ground-mounted towers;\nNew Fairfield Zoning Regulations\n159\nApril 4, 2016\n"}, {"page": "166", "text": "G. Restrict the height to that needed to establish opportunities for co-location of multiple\ncarriers; and,\nH. Provide for the orderly removal of abandoned antennas and towers.\n9.2.4 Specific Policy Preferences for Towers\nThe Town of New Fairfield requests that WTPs and the CSC consider the following issues in\nevaluating each application for wireless telecommunications towers in New Fairfield:\nA. Location\n1. Towers should be located to serve areas lacking adequate wireless\ntelecommunication service that have been identified by the CSC.\n2. Applications should include a review presenting alternate locations and\nalternate technologies.\n3. In order to minimize visual impacts, more short towers providing capacity in\nsmaller geographic areas are generally preferred over fewer tall towers providing\ncoverage over a larger geographic area.\n4.\nIf a tall tower is considered necessary, is should allow for co-location of\nmultiple carriers, including emergency services, within the service area.\n5. Parties wishing to locate telecommunications towers within New Fairfield\nshould fly a balloon from the site at the proposed tower location so that visual\nimpacts may be evaluated from various locations. The Balloon shall fly on a\nSaturday, with 1 mile visibility from 7:00 AM - 7:00 PM at the proposed maximum\nheight of the tower.\nB. Protection of Important Resources\n1. The location should preserve the integrity of environmentally sensitive areas\nincluding unique wildlife habitats, wetlands, historic, and archaeological\nresources.\n2. A location within or adjacent to any officially designated historic areas and any\nresource on the Local, State, and/or National Register of Historic Places should\nbe avoided.\n3. There should be no detrimental impact to any scenic area, vista, ridgeline, or\nsignificant geologic or natural features within New Fairfield, especially those\nnoted in the Plan of Conservation and Development.\n4. Views from any designated scenic roads should be protected.\n5. The use of public areas, including parks and recreational facilities should not\nbe compromised.\n6. The design, location and operation should not interfere with existing and\nproposed public safety communication facilities utilized by the Town.\nNew Fairfield Zoning Regulations\n160\nApril 4, 2016\n"}, {"page": "167", "text": "C. Design Considerations\n1. Towers should include an adequate fall zone that will protect safety.\n2. The use of stealth technologies to camouflage facilities should be employed\nwhenever possible.\n3. Signage and/or lighting should not be permitted except what may be clearly\nnecessary for public safety;. Strobe lighting shall be avoided wherever possible.\n4. Site planning standards should include minimizing impervious surfaces,\navoiding soil erosion and runoff problems, maintaining natural buffers, providing\nfor security, and safe access management.\n5. Towers should accommodate both the applicant's antennas and comparable\nantennas to reduce the number of Towers required to serve the Town.\n6. Wherever possible, antennas should be screened from view from adjacent\nlots and from public streets and accessory buildings used only for housing\ntelecommunications equipment and fences should be architecturally designed to\nblend into the neighborhood. Landscape buffers shall be provided around the\nperimeter of the facility.\n7. All utilities to serve the facility shall be installed underground unless otherwise\napproved by the commission.\n8. Generators, if utilized, should comply with state noise regulations.\nD. Permitting Considerations.\nProvisions should be made for removal of the tower if it is no longer being used as was\noriginally permitted.\n9.3\nDENSITY BASED ZONING CALCULATIONS\nMaximum densities used throughout these Regulations are derived by the following process.\nMinimum lot sizes in each district are converted into ratios (i.e. the R-88 District two-acre minimum lot size\nis expressed as one dwelling unit divided by two acres).\n1 dwelling unit /2 acres = 0.5 dwelling units per acre\nNext, any mandatory open space is set aside (for this example, the 20 percent level is used), leaving 0.4\ndwelling units per acre.\n0.5 dwelling units per acre - 20 percent open space = 0.4 dwelling units per acre\nFinally, ten percent (10%) of the density is subtracted for roads and an efficiency loss factor that accounts\nfor irregularities in lot shape, terrain, soils, and other natural constraints. These factors vary according to\nthe minimum requirements of each district.\n0.4 dwelling units per acre - 10% roads & efficiency loss factor = 0.35 dwelling units per acre\nNew Fairfield Zoning Regulations\n161\nApril 4, 2016\n"}, {"page": "168", "text": "To illustrate how density factors and minimum lot sizes function together, a conventional (minimum lot size\nbased) development pattern and a conservation (density-based) development pattern are applied to a\nparcel of land in a simplified example below.\nStarting with a ten (10) acre farmstead in the one-acre R-44 zone, subtract one (1) acre to create a lot for\nthe existing farmhouse.\n10 Acre Farmstead\nNot to scale\nTo determine the number of dwelling units permitted in a conventional (minimum lot size) subdivision,\nmultiply the R-44 density factor of 0.7 dwelling units per acre by ten (10) acres.\n0.7 dwelling units per acre X 10 acres = 7 dwelling units\nAfter accounting for the existing farmhouse, six (6) additional dwelling units remain.\n7 dwelling units - farmhouse = 6 additional dwelling units\nTo illustrate how this methodology compares to the old minimum lot size methodology, subtract two (2)\nacres of open space from the ten (10) acre farmstead, then subtract one (1) acre for the existing\nfarmhouse and one (1) acre to account for the road and an efficiency loss factor, resulting in six (6) acres\nleft for six (6) one-acre lots.\n10 acre farmstead - 2 acres open space - 1 acre farmstead - road & efficiency loss = 6 one-acre\nlots\nNew Fairfield Zoning Regulations\n162\nApril 4, 2016\n"}, {"page": "169", "text": "A conventional subdivision is illustrated below:\nConventional (Minimum Lot Size) Subdivision\nNot to scale\nTo determine the number of dwellings permitted in a conservation (density-based) subdivision, multiply the\nR-44 density factor of 0.7 dwelling units per acre by ten (10) acres.\n0.7 dwelling units per acre X 10 acres = 7 dwelling units\nOnce the number of dwelling units is determined, the Planning Commission can waive minimum lot size,\nroad frontage and other specified standards in order to increase the amount of open space, configure\nopen space to protect important resources and/or provide maximum benefit to all residents, preserve half\nof the existing street frontage, and reduce the amount of road that must be built and maintained.\nA conservation subdivision is illustrated below.\nConservation (Density-Based) Subdivision\nCELL (1, 1): \nNot to scale\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \nNew Fairfield Zoning Regulations\nCELL (2, 2): \n163\nApril 4, 2016\n"}, {"page": "170", "text": "The 0.7 dwelling units per acre density factor is applied only to buildable land that is free of wetlands,\nfloodplain, and steep slopes exceeding twenty-five (25) percent, thus reducing the development potential\nof environmentally sensitive land such as the wetlands illustrated above.\nThe Open Space District is unique in its application due to the differential between its density of 0.08\ndwelling units per acre (equivalent to a conventional ten-acre zone) and its minimum lot size requirement\nof two-acres. To require a ten-acre minimum lot size corresponding to its density factor would encourage\nunnecessary consumption and clearing of land that is contrary to several of the purposes of the District\nsuch as maximizing open space and protecting Candlewood Lake.\nFor example, 100 acres of buildable land in the Open Space District would be multiplied by the density\nfactor of 0.08 to arrive at a development potential of eight dwelling units. With a minimum lot size of two-\nacres, the eight dwelling units could be built on as little as 16 acres plus the area of a road right-of-way.\nThe resulting development might look similar to that found in an R-88 District, but leave as much as 80%\nof the surrounding land as open space.
