Buffer Strip\nIn the Housatonic River Overlay Zone Inner Corridor the Buffer Strip is the area between the River's\nordinary high water mark and 75 feet inland which is designed for the purposes of protecting water\nquality by aiding the infiltration and cleansing of surface storm water runoff, maintaining river bank\nstabilization, controlling erosion from the site to the river and associated wetlands, to provide shade\nfor river fisheries and habitat and to assist in screening the view of development from the river.\n2. Ordinary High Water Mark\nIn the Housatonic River Overlay Zone Inner Corridor the ordinary high water mark is the line along the\nriver bank where the presence and action of the river water creates an obvious transition zone\nbetween the river and the normally dry land above it. The area within the ordinary high water mark\ninclude land that is marked by river water flow created erosion, especially in areas with a steep bank,\nthe presence of a gravel stream bank, areas where there is the destruction or prevention of woody\nterrestrial vegetation, areas where aquatic vegetation is predominant or other easily recognized\ncharacteristic of the active river channel.\n3. Buildable Area\nA rectangular area of a lot that contains no wetlands soils, water bodies, watercourses, utilities or\naccess easements, rights of way or any naturally occurring slope exceeding 25% as measured using 2\nfoot contour intervals. Within the Housatonic River Corridor Overlay Zone Inner Corridor in addition to\nthe above such rectangular area shall contain no land within the FEMA Identified Flood Hazard Area.\n4. Low Impact Stormwater Control Measures\nLow Impact Stormwater Controls in the HROZ Inner Corridor involved use of natural methods to\ncontrol and treat stormwater runoff such as land conservation measures, treating stormwater runoff\nmovement using vegetation and landscape features, use of other multiple natural based, non-\nstructural measures to reduce and cleanse runoff and prevent pollution. Examples include rain\ngardens, grass swales, and use of cisterns and rain barrels to collect and reuse runoff. Appropriate Low\nImpact Stormwater Controls are found in numerous publications including the Connecticut Stormwater\nQuality Manual.\nD Inner Corridor Requirements: The Inner Corridor includes the requirement to maintain a Buffer Strip\nconsisting of the land within 75 feet of the River's ordinary high water mark as defined herein which is\nregulated to meet the purposes of the overlay zone, especially to protect and preserve water quality,\nprevent erosion, maintain wildlife habitat and protect river fisheries.\n1.

Therefore, the\nPlanning and Zoning Commission of the Town of North Canaan, Connecticut, does ordain as follows:\n1.2\nFINDING OF FACT\nThe flood hazard areas of the Town of North Canaan are subject to periodic flood inundation which results in the\nloss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,\nextraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which\nadversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.\nThese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the floodplains causing increases in flood\nheights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other\nlands which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage. Uncontrolled\ndevelopment and use of the floodplains can adversely affect the community.\nThe Town of North Canaan has voluntarily participated in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP since\n11/18/1998). The NFIP is founded on a mutual agreement between the federal government and each participating\ncommunity. Local, state and federal governments must share roles and responsibilities to meet the goals and\nobjectives of the NFIP. The community's role is of paramount importance. Property owners are able to receive\nfederally-subsidized flood insurance only if the community enacts and enforces the minimum floodplain\nregulations required for participation in the NFIP.\n1.3\nSTATEMENT OF PURPOSE\nIt is the purpose of this regulation to regulate floodplain development, promote public health, safety, and general\nwelfare, and minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:\n1.3.1 protect human life and health, and prevent damage to property;\n1.3.2 minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects;\n1.3.3\nminimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the\nexpense of the general public;\n1.3.4 minimize prolonged business interruptions and other economic disruptions;\n78\n"}, {"page": "79", "text": "1.3.5 minimize damage to public facilities, infrastructure and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric,\ntelephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges, located in the floodplain;\n1.3.6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas in\nsuch a manner as to minimize flood damage and flood blight areas;\n1.3.7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area;\n1.3.8 prevent increase in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property\nowners;\n1.3.9 ensure that those who occupy the flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions; and\n1.3.10 discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use or\nstructure outside of the floodplain.\n1.4\nOBJECTIVES\nIn order to accomplish its purposes, this regulation includes objectives, methods and provisions that:\n1.4.1 Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flood or erosion\nhazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;\n1.4.2 Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood\ndamage at the time of initial construction;\n1.4.3\nControl the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers that are\ninvolved in the accommodation of flood waters;\n1.4.4 Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and\n1.4.5\nPrevent or regulate the construction of barriers or obstructions which will unnaturally divert flood waters\nor which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\n2.0\nDEFINITIONS\nUnless specifically defined below, words and phrases used in this regulation shall have the same meaning as they\nhave in common usage and to give this regulation it's most reasonable application.\nBase Flood - The flood having a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, also\nreferred to as the one hundred (100) year flood, as published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency\n(FEMA) as part of a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and depicted on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).\nBase Flood Elevation (BFE) - The elevation of the crest of the base flood or 100-year flood.
