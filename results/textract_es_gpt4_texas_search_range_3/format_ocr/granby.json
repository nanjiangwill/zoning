At the\ntime of the rewriting of this zone in July of 2000, there were only 2 owners of\nthis entire land area, with Griffin Land Resources owning all but approximately\n32 acres. The undeveloped nature of the property and the small number of\nowners provide the Town with a unique opportunity to guide the development\nof this area to assure that it is compatible with the Town's Plan of Conservation\nand Development.\nThe ED zone has several important attributes. It is strategically located\ngeographically, with direct access to Route 10/202 and easy access to Route\n189. The ED Zone can be serviced by public water and public sewer and is\nlinked to major electrical and communication services.\nThe area that comprises the ED Zone has been set aside for non-residential\ndevelopment since zoning was first established in Granby in the 1950s. This is\nthe primary and only significant area remaining within the Town with potential\nfor the diversification of the Town's tax, employment and commercial service\nbase. It is the desire of the Town of Granby to have this area developed in a\nmanner, which accomplishes this diversification while preserving the Town's\nfundamental values and rural atmosphere as outlined within the Plan of\nConservation and Development.\nUnderstanding the attributes of the ED Zone, as outlined above, the Town has\nan opportunity to encourage development within this area in a manner that can\nbe a model of quality and success. The development of the ED Zone can\ndemonstrate that preservation and growth are not mutually exclusive and that\ndiversification of the Town's tax, employment and commercial service base,\nwhile preserving the Town's fundamental values and rural atmosphere, can be\nachieved. A variety of Special Regulations have been adopted to regulate\ndevelopment within this ED Zone. These Regulations are found in Section\n3.9.4.\n32\n"}, {"page": "33", "text": "SECTION 3\nUSE DISTRICTS\n33\nCELL (1, 1): \n3.9.1\nCELL (1, 2): \nPermitted Uses, subject to the Special ED Zone Criteria outlined herein.\nThe following uses are permitted:\nCELL (2, 1): \n3.9.1.1\nCELL (2, 2): \nBusiness or professional offices, including financial institutions and/or office\nparks;\nCELL (3, 1): \n3.9.1.2\nCELL (3, 2): \nUtility Use, subject to Section 8.25;\nCELL (4, 1): \n3.9.1.3\nCELL (4, 2): \nAgricultural uses;\nCELL (5, 1): \n3.9.1.4\nCELL (5, 2): \nGovernmental buildings and facilities including fire houses; and\nCELL (6, 1): \n3.9.1.5\nCELL (6, 2): \nAccessory uses customarily incidental to principal uses, including garages,\nstorage buildings, and employees' recreational, commissary and clinical\nfacilities, subject to Section 8.1.\nCELL (7, 1): \n3.9.2\nCELL (7, 2): \nSpecial Permit Uses, subject to the Special ED Zone Criteria and to\nSection 8.2.\nThe Commission may grant Special Permits for the following uses, subject to\nthe applicable criteria of Section 8.2:\nCELL (8, 1): \n3.9.2.1\nCELL (8, 2): \nBiological, medical, technological and other research and development\ncenters;\nCELL (9, 1): \n3.9.2.2\nCELL (9, 2): \nCommercial recreational facilities, including health clubs, indoor and outdoor\nrecreational complexes and all associated fields, courses, buildings and\nequipment;\nCELL (10, 1): \n3.9.2.3\nCELL (10, 2): \nHealth care facilities including hospitals, convalescent homes, nursing homes\nand similar uses;\nCELL (11, 1): \n3.9.2.4\nCELL (11, 2): \nAssisted Living facilities for elderly persons and/or persons with special needs;\nSection 3.7.4 shall be used as a basic guideline in the development of such\nfacilities;\nCELL (12, 1): \n3.9.2.5\nCELL (12, 2): \nRestaurants, subject to Section 8.16;\nCELL (13, 1): \n3.9.2.6\nCELL (13, 2): \nPrivate schools with or without dormitories and other associated structures,\nfields and uses;\n"}, {"page": "34", "text": "SECTION 3\nUSE DISTRICTS\n34\nCELL (1, 1): \n3.9.2.7\nCELL (1, 2): \nRetail sale, rental and/or repair of items such as food, clothing, hardware,\ngarden supplies, jewelry, electronics, appliances, books, sporting goods,\nnursery items, home improvement products and general merchandise;\nCELL (2, 1): \n3.9.2.8\nCELL (2, 2): \nFuneral homes and associated uses and structures;\nCELL (3, 1): \n3.9.2.9\nCELL (3, 2): \nMovie theaters, performing arts theaters, auditoriums and assembly halls;\nCELL (4, 1): \n3.9.2.10\nCELL (4, 2): \nPersonal services, including barbershops, beauty shops, cleaning\nestablishments, tailor shops and appliance and other general repair shops,\nexcluding automobile repair;\nCELL (5, 1): \n3.9.2.11\nCELL (5, 2): \nVeterinary hospitals;\nCELL (6, 1): \n3.9.2.12\nCELL (6, 2): \nChurches, religious buildings and other non-profit organizations;\nCELL (7, 1): \n3.9.2.13\nCELL (7, 2): \nManufacturing, storing, processing, fabricating, packaging or assembling\nactivities wholly within a building or unified complex of buildings;\nCELL (8, 1): \n3.9.2.14\nCELL (8, 2): \nPlumbing, heating, electrical, industrial and general contracting establishments\nwhich may include showrooms, storage and maintenance of heavy\nconstruction equipment;\nCELL (9, 1): \n3.9.2.15\nCELL (9, 2): \nRetail sales or alcoholic beverages, subject to Section 8.3;\nCELL (10, 1): \n3.9.2.16\nCELL (10, 2): \nHotels, motels or inns, including all necessary facilities to accommodate\nconventions or large meetings;\nCELL (11, 1): \n3.9.2.17\nCELL (11, 2): \nAdult Oriented Establishment, Subject to Section 8.24,\nCELL (12, 1): \n3.9.2.18\nCELL (12, 2): \nUtility Use, subject to Section 8.25.\nCELL (13, 1): \n3.9.2.19\nCELL (13, 2): \nActive Adult Residential Development, subject to Section 8.27.\nCELL (14, 1): \n3.9.3\nCELL (14, 2): \nRequired Lot Areas, Coverage, Heights and Frontages.\nCELL (15, 1): \nCELL (15, 2): \nFor required lot areas, yards, coverage, heights and frontages, refer to Section\n5.\n"}, {"page": "35", "text": "SECTION 3\nUSE DISTRICTS\n3.9.4\nSPECIAL REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE ED ZONE.\n3.9.4.1\nCURB CUT LOCATIONS/TRAFFIC ANALYSIS\nThe Route 10 corridor study recognizes the area of the ED Zone as a future\ndevelopment area.

In\ndetermining whether or not to allow the square footage to exceed 40,000\nsquare feet, the Commission shall consider the building design, the site\ncharacteristics, the compatibility of the structure with surrounding buildings, the\nquality of building materials and the quantity and quality of the landscape\nmaterials, all of which can aid in reducing the visual bulk and mass of the\nbuilding.\nRetail uses shall be limited to the hours of 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. and the\nCommission may further restrict the hours of the retail development based on\nthe specific proposal for use.

The further goal of\nthe zone is to encourage the continued rehabilitation of the commercial center,\nencourage a greater variety of mixed uses and unite the uses through common\ndesign features, pedestrian and vehicular access, common signage, lighting\nand through the inclusion of street furniture and common open areas. Overall\nthe goal is to integrate commercial and noncommercial uses through the\ncreation of a mixed-use district that has the look and feel of a traditional New\nEngland village. The Granby Center Zone is designed to maintain and\npromote an area where residential development can exist within reasonable\nproximity to commercial type development.

The Commission, the public and new applicants should\nrecognize the limited area of the Town Center and the need to diversify\nthe commercial uses. The success of the center as a local commercial\nservice center is largely dependent on the availability of a wide range of\ncommercial retail items, services and offices.

Uncontrolled development and use of the\nfloodplains can adversely affect the community.\nThe Town of Granby has voluntarily participated in the National Flood\nInsurance Program (NFIP) since February 15, 1980. The NFIP is founded on\na mutual agreement between the federal government and each participating\ncommunity. Local, state and federal governments must share roles and\nresponsibilities to meet the goals and objectives of the NFIP. The community's\nrole is of paramount importance.
