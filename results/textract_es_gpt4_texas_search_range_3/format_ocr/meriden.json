There are five TOD sub-districts:\n(a) Historic - Commercial Sub-District [TOD-HC].\nFigure 213-1. Buildings fronting the north side of West Main Street\n[1] Home to the Meriden Historic District, this area focuses on two key\ncommercial corridors along Colony and West Main Streets and is\ncharacterized by a range of architectural styles from the late 19th and\nearly 20th centuries. The purpose of this sub-district is to enhance\nthe cohesive character of the center of Meriden through the\nrestoration and reuse of existing buildings of merit and encourage\nhigh-quality infill on vacant or underdeveloped properties.\n[2] The placement of buildings should reinforce a pedestrian-friendly\nenvironment by contributing to defining the edges of streets in ways\n213:61\n"}, {"page": "62", "text": "\u00a7 213-27\nMERIDEN CODE\n\u00a7 213-27\nthat are consistent with buildings that remain a part of the traditional\nurban character. New development should reinforce the existing\nscale of the district and be respectful of adjacent residential districts\nand architecture.\n[3] Mixed-use, commercial development is the focus of this sub-district.\nGround-floor retail uses should be designed with highly transparent\nstorefronts. Residential uses fronting on primary streets south of\nFoster Street must be contained in mixed-use buildings.\n(b) Park Sub-District [TOD-P].\nFigure 213-2. A pocket park along Pratt Street in the Park Sub-District\n[1] This sub-district is characterized by the significant amount of usable\nopen space - with the focal point being the major public park in the\ncenter of Meriden. The Park Sub-District is bounded to the west by\nthe railroad tracks and Intermodal Transportation Center and to the\neast by a reconceived Pratt Street boulevard, both of which will\nprovide important first impressions for visitors to Meriden.\n[2] The quality of the public realm will be defined by thoughtfully\ndesigned pedestrian environments, where the ground floors of\nbuildings contribute to lively and interactive streetscapes. Infill\ndevelopment along Pratt Street will help define the eastern edge of\nthe major public park.\n[3] High-quality, high-density, mixed-income housing, complemented\nby a mix of appropriately scaled commercial uses and publicly\naccessible institutional uses, will make this a vibrant 24/7\nneighborhood.\n(c) Hanover Sub-District [TOD-H].\n213:62\n"}, {"page": "63", "text": "\u00a7 213-27\nZONING\n\u00a7 213-27\nFigure 213-3. Residential building similar to what might be found in\nthe Hanover Sub-District\n[1] The Hanover Sub-District holds a very important position in the\ncenter of Meriden. Just south of West Main Street and the Historic-\nCommercial Sub-District, and adjacent to the greenway running\nalong Harbor Brook, this sub-district is suitable for high-density,\nmixed-income residential development.\n[2] The conversion of Hanover Street to two-way traffic will help\nstimulate commercial development along this important corridor.\nMixed-use infill in the blocks north of Hanover Street will support\nMeriden's commercial core, while areas to the south have\ntremendous potential for a variety of residential typologies that will\nhelp knit together surrounding residential districts.\n[3] The development standards in this sub-district encourage high-\ndensity, mixed-income residential by allowing more height, as well\nas flexibility with building siting and parking requirements.\n(d) Civic Sub-District [TOD-C].\nFigure 213-4. Board of Education Building in the Civic Sub-District\n[1] This sub-district is characterized by a wide range of civic and\ncultural buildings, including Meriden City Hall and the public\nlibrary. In addition to these large-scale public buildings, there exist\na number of more-intimate residential streets that provide a\ncomplementary fabric for the neighborhood.\n[2] The Civic Sub-District is established in order to both showcase these\nimportant institutions, many of which front on East Main Street, and\nalso preserve the character of the smaller-scale residential streets.\n[3] While a mix of uses is encouraged in this sub-district, new buildings\nshould be carefully located SO that their use and scale are respectful\n213:63\n"}, {"page": "64", "text": "\u00a7 213-27\nMERIDEN CODE\n\u00a7 213-27\nof their immediate context. This means appropriately siting\nbuildings relative to the street and designing to an appropriate level\nof architectural articulation.\n(e) Gateway Sub-District [TOD-G].\nFigure 213-5. Enterprise Center in the Gateway Sub-District\n[1]\nThis sub-district is established to help define the character of a key\ngateway into the City northeast of the major public park. Envisioned\nas a primary vehicular link from the interstate highway system to the\ncenter of Meriden, the Gateway Sub-District will be defined largely\nby the quality of the streetscapes and the development that evolves\nalong the Pratt Street corridor.\n[2] Adaptive reuse and infill on highly visible, vacant properties along\nthis new boulevard is desired. Larger setbacks that allow for more\nflexibility in the siting of buildings in conjunction with a more-\ndiverse range of permitted uses, which may include industrial\nactivity, make this a truly unique area.\n[3] Though located farther from the Intermodal Transportation Center\nthan other sub-districts, residential uses are encouraged through\nincentives for greater height and flexibility in certain development\ncriteria, including parking ratios. High-quality development remains\na strong emphasis.\n(2) TOD Sub-District Zoning Map.

Per its Land Use Plan of Development, the City, confronted with\ndecreasing supply of suitable land for economic development, recognizes the need\nto provide for carefully planned and unified industrial projects which will maximize\nthe use of this scarce resource. This section intends to encourage:\n(1) Flexibility and efficiency in land development for industrial purposes.\n(2) The more efficient use of public facilities required to support industrial\ndevelopment.\nB.\nDefinition. A \"unified industrial district\" shall mean a parcel of land owned,\ndeveloped and maintained as an entity to be used for industrial and related purposes.\nC.\nApplicability. The provisions of this section can be applied to any parcel of land\nwhich is in single ownership, four acres or more in size and not in excess of nine\nacres. The entire parcel designated as a unified industrial district shall be located in\nan industrial district.\nD.\nPermitted uses. Uses permitted in a unified industrial district may include all those\nuses permitted by right within the zoning district in which it is located. Different\nindustrial and related uses are allowed in the same or separate buildings on a parcel\ndesignated as a unified industrial district.\nE.\nRequirements. The following shall be met for approval by the Planning\nCommission:\n(1) All density requirements, including lot area, lot coverage and height\nrequirements of the zoning district, must be met.\n(2) The minimum setbacks required for the district shall apply to the periphery of\nthe district designated as a unified industrial district.\n(3) A minimum distance of 30 feet must be maintained between all buildings\nwithin the unified industrial district.\n(4) No portion of the parcel designated as a unified industrial district shall be of\nless width than required by the zoning district.\n(5) The parcel must have the required width on a City-accepted street.\n(6) The entire unified district must be serviced by public water and sewer.\n213:142\n"}, {"page": "143", "text": "\u00a7 213-33\nZONING\n\u00a7 213-33\n(7) Roads within the unified industrial district are to be private and shall not be\nthe maintenance responsibility of the City of Meriden.

The stated purpose of this section is to encourage the growth and diversity\nof the City's economic base in an efficient, planned, environmentally and\naesthetically sensitive manner along the I-691 and I-91 corridor. Further, this\nsection is meant to allow the City to compete in the region's growth and take\nadvantage of the City's central location and the site's locale on the interstate\nhighway system. This section of the Meriden Zoning Regulations is prescribed by\nthe City's 2009 Plan of Conservation and Development.\nB.\nStatement of objectives.\n(1) Development within the IDD may receive favorable consideration where the\nfollowing conditions are present and the following objectives are achieved:\n(a) To accommodate future growth which will enhance the tax base through\nthe optimum use of appropriate parcels for economic development\npurposes;\n(b) To encourage maximization of building coverage by discouraging excess\nparking spaces and providing common parking areas;\n(c) To provide for the appropriate use of undeveloped land;\n(d) To maintain proper mixture of uses to insure overall sustainability;\n(e) To protect the existing adjoining residentially zoned neighborhoods by\nappropriate buffers and by additional landscaping along the perimeter of\nthe zone;\n(f) To control strip development and \"big box\" development through design\ncontrols and restrictive regulations SO as to insure a positive image and to\nprevent blighting influence; and to encourage application of creative\ndesign techniques to foster attractive, well planned developments which\nwill be aesthetically integrated with adjacent areas;\n(g) To provide appropriate landscaping for green areas and development\nschemes and enhance natural settings;\n(h) To protect the integrity of environmentally sensitive areas;\n(i) To facilitate traffic and pedestrian circulation and safety by providing the\nnecessary roadway infrastructure;\n(j) To provide for the development of a capital plan for general\nimprovements which insure that the private sector will participate in the\nfinancing improvements, thereby relieving the public burden;\n(k) To provide adequate facilities for sanitary sewerage, water supply,\nstormwater drainage and other utilities for the life of the development.\n(2) If any of the conditions noted above are not present when a developer submits\nan application for development within the IDD, the Planning Commission may\ndecide not to give further consideration to the application unless the developer\n213:222\n"}, {"page": "223", "text": "\u00a7 213-43.1\nZONING\n\u00a7 213-43.1\npresents adequate evidence of his ability and willingness to correct any\ncondition not meeting these objectives or the official action of the municipal\nor state agency which will satisfy the condition within a time period acceptable\nto the Planning Commission.\n(3) This statement of objectives shall not be subject to variation or exception by\nany City agency.\nC.\nPlanning Commission authority.

The Interstate District shall apply only to a tract of property of 55\nacres or more contiguous to I-691 and/or I-91, which tract is under single ownership\nand shall remain under single ownership. This district is intended to encourage\nsmaller sites to combine with other sites to provide larger-scale developments;\ntherefore, special provisions are included to allow consolidation of smaller\ncontiguous lots. Contiguous lots, zoned differently than IDD, will continue to be\nconforming until included in the IDD overall development plan and zoned IDD.\nE.\nPermitted uses.\n(1) Primarily, a commercial district which will allow a fully integrated mixed-use\nland use pattern of commercial, residential, institutional, and cultural uses to\nfurther the purpose of this regulation. These uses are to be developed in a\ncompatible and attractive manner per standards set forward in this regulation\nand best practices of urban design principles. Further, the initial structures\nwithin the IDD must be commercial (retail and office), of a minimum size of\n50,000 square feet. A certificate of occupancy must be issued for these initial\ncommercial buildings prior to the issuance of a building permit for any other\nuse.
