Uniform numbering Scheme: All numbering will be updated to the following scheme\n1.A.1.a.(1)(a)i.\n2. All zoning terms, such as Building or Floor Area Ratio, are defined and listed\nalphabetically in Section 3.B. All defined terms are italicized throughout the text, in order\nto allow users to refer back to the definitions section more easily.\n3. Certain Uses are defined and listed alphabetically in Section 5.E. They are marked in\nspaced lettering throughout the text to allow easy reference to the defined uses.\n4. Text in [square parenthesis] is not part of the Zoning Regulations but comments or\nheaders intended to make the Zoning Regulations more user-friendly.\n5. Section 7.3 - Special Permit Uses for Historic Buildings and Section 12 - Automobile\nParking and Loading Spaces are currently under review by the Land Use Boards and have\nnot been updated with the new formatting.\n6. Legally non-conforming or non-compliant uses are \"grandfathered in\", i.e., they can\ngenerally continue to remain (see Section 10 for more details). In order to identify when\nZoning Regulations have been updated, the application numbers for the Zoning Text\nChange Applications that added, modified or deleted certain Sections are added in the\nfollowing format (210-21). The first three digits indicate the year a text change was filed\n(210=2010); the number after the hyphen (-21) are the unique identifier for the application.\nIf a structure was built prior to the effective date of a text change application, it may have\nbecome legally non-conforming or compliant and was built to the standards in effect\nprior to the effective date of the text change. You may contact the Land Use Bureau to\naccess the original standards by contacting StamfordLandUse@StamfordCT.gov or (203)\n977-4711.\n7.

Buildings may be set back further from the front property line to accommodate\noutside dining on retail Streets or to provide small landscaped Front Yards to buffer\nground floor residential uses or where necessary to align the Building with existing\nBuildings on adjoining properties, to accommodate an irregular property line condition, to\naccommodate an existing unique landscaping feature, or to create publicly accessible open\nspace.\n(b) Surface parking shall be located to the rear of the Principal Building, with suitable\nlandscaped islands and perimeter landscaped screening. Large surface parking Lots shall\nbe divided with rows of landscaping no less than six feet (6') in width, to create parking\n\"fields\" of no more than 50 spaces each. Limited parking may be permitted along the side\nof the Principal Building, provided that no parking or access aisles shall be located\nin\nadvance of any front Building fa\u00e7ade on the Lot or on an adjoining parcel, and a dense\nlandscaped buffer shall be provided with a minimum width of ten feet (10') and with plant\nmaterials maintained at a height of three (3') to four (4') feet, interrupted only by permitted\ndriveways and walkways. Where a screening wall with a height of three (3') to four (4')\nfeet is provided, the buffer width requirement may be reduced to five feet (5'). Parking\nSpaces on street corners are discouraged.\n(c) The number and width of curb cuts to off-street parking and loading areas shall be\nminimized to enhance pedestrian safety, to maintain an active Street Wall and to preserve\nthe opportunity for on-street parking. The consolidation and sharing of driveways and\ncurb cuts between adjacent properties and interior connections between parking Lots\nand/or the use of shared parking facilities is strongly encouraged.\n(d) Exterior lighting, averaging not less than one-half (0.5) foot candles, shall be provided to\ninsure adequate and safe lighting of all pedestrian sidewalks, walkways and Parking Areas\nwithin the site and along the property frontage to the curb line.

Design compatibility\nincludes complementary Building style, form, size, colors and materials. Multiple\nBuildings on the same site shall be designed to create a cohesive visual relationship\nbetween the Buildings.\n(b) Buildings shall be designed to have a clear base, middle and top, with horizontal elements\nseparating each.\n(c) Coordination of the height of new Buildings or substantial reconstruction projects, as\ndefined in subsection 4.B.7.e(6), with the actual and apparent height of adjacent Structures\nis encouraged, especially where Buildings will adjoin or be close to each other.\nCoordination of Building Height can often be achieved by adjusting the height of a wall,\ncornice or parapet line to match that of the adjacent Building. Similar design linkages can\nbe achieved to adjust apparent height by placing window lines, belt courses, and other\nhorizontal elements in a pattern that reflects the same elements on neighboring Buildings.\n(d) Buildings shall be designed to reduce their perceived height and bulk by incorporating\narchitectural strategies such as, but not limited to, dividing the Building mass into smaller-\nscale components and providing articulation of all fa\u00e7ades. On larger Buildings, the\nrooflines of Buildings can follow the variation in bay massing SO as to appear as a series of\nside-by-side Buildings or bays. Rooflines shall be emphasized, for example with gabled or\nother pitched roof forms, parapets, balustrades, and/or cornices. Where side elevations of\nBuildings are prominently exposed to pedestrian view from public Streets, architectural\nstrategies shall be employed to provide articulation of the fa\u00e7ade and to diminish perceived\nheight.

Tinted glass is discouraged and reflective glass shall not be\npermitted. Storefront windows are encouraged to have a minimum height of six feet (6')\nwith a window sill of not more than three feet (3') above grade, and to occupy seventy-five\npercent (75%) or more of the Building frontage on the Street. Primary store entrances shall\nopen to the Street where possible. Where storefronts do not open to the Street, Building\nfa\u00e7ades should be highly articulated with projections, recessions, windows, and other\ndesign elements to avoid blank, featureless areas.\nThe floor to ceiling height of a non-residential ground floor shall be no less than twelve\nfeet (12').\n(k) Building fa\u00e7ades and site improvements significantly exposed to public view shall be\nconstructed with high quality, durable exterior materials.

FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND SCOPE\n1. The City has determined that:\na.\nSince 1951, the City of Stamford has had in effect a comprehensive system of Sign regulations\ngoverning the location, size and number of Signs that can be erected in the City. These\nregulations are intended to create a legal framework for a balanced system of signage to\nimprove and enhance the City of Stamford's interests in promoting public safety, preventing\ntraffic hazards, and creating an aesthetically pleasing community. The City finds that Signs\nprovide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages.\nHowever, left unregulated, Signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and\ndetriment to property values and the City's overall public welfare as an aesthetic concern.\nb. As a result of its comprehensive sign regulations, and in particular its restrictions on the\nheight, area and location of signage, the City of Stamford presents an aesthetically pleasing\nenvironment and provides for traffic substantially free of unsafe diversions.\nC. It has never been the intention of the City and its enforcement efforts to interpret, restrict or\nregulate the messages contained on signage in the City.\n2. The purposes of this Section are to regulate the number, location, size, type, and use of Signs\nwithin the City in order to promote the public health, safety and welfare; to maintain, enhance and\nimprove the environment of the City by preventing visual clutter that is harmful to traffic safety\nand the appearance of the community; to balance the rights of persons to convey their messages\nthrough Signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of\nSigns; and to ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations, while providing for\neffective means of communication, consistent with constitutional guarantees. This Section does\nnot regulate, nor is it intended to regulate, the message displayed on any Sign, Building design or\nany display not defined as a Sign.\n3. It is hereby declared unlawful for any person, corporation or entity to construct, place, install,\nalter, change, maintain, use or to permit the construction, placement, installation, alteration,\nchange, maintenance, or use of any Sign contrary to or in violation of the provisions of this\nSection.\n13.B. NONCOMMERCIAL SIGNS\nNotwithstanding any other provision in this Section or these Regulations to the contrary, any Sign\nauthorized in these Regulations may contain any noncommercial copy in addition to, or in lieu of,\nany other copy. Signs containing only noncommercial copy shall be deemed to be On-site Signs,\nnot Off-site Advertising Signs.\n13-1\n"}, {"page": "360", "text": "August 31, 2021\n13.C. PERMITS\n1. Permits Required\nExcept as provided elsewhere in these Regulations, it shall be unlawful for any person to post,\ndisplay, substantially change, or erect any Sign authorized by this Section without first having\nobtained a Zoning Permit as prescribed in Section 17 of these Regulations.
