Parking and loading areas shall be provided and maintained to accommodate\nthe needs generated by the permitted use of the property in a manner that is safe, efficient, and harmonious\nwith surrounding land uses.\n15.2\nLocation and Ownership. Required accessory parking spaces, open or enclosed, shall be provided upon\nthe same lot as the use to which they are accessory or, if approved by the Commission, within 200 feet\nwalking distance of the lot on which the principal use is located. In all cases, such parking spaces shall\nconform to all the Regulations of the district in which the parking spaces are located; and in no event shall\nsuch parking spaces be located in any Residential District unless the use to which the spaces are accessory\nare permitted in such Residential District. Such spaces shall be either (1) in the same ownership as the use\nto\nwhich they are accessory or (2) be subject to a perpetual easement, dedicating such spaces as appurtenant\nto the property on which the principal use is located, which easement shall contain affirmative covenants\nrequiring the owner of the principal use to maintain the required number of parking spaces available either\n(a) throughout the existence of such use to which they are accessory or (b) until such spaces are provided\nelsewhere, and which easement and covenant shall be subject to the approval of the Commission.

Areas which may be computed as off-street parking spaces include\nany private garage, carport, or other area available for parking, other than a street or driveway. For\nresidential parking, a driveway within a required front yard for a single-family residence may count as\nparking space. A driveway serving a two-family residence may be counted as parking space for one of the\ntwo units only.\n15.4\nSize of Spaces. Entrance and exit lanes shall not be computed as parking space except for driveways for\none-family and two-family residences. Minimum parking space dimensions shall be ten (10) feet wide by\ntwenty (20) feet long, except for handicapped spaces, which shall conform to State requirements.
