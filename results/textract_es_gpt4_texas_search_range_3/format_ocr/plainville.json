The intent of a Redevelopment Design District is to permit\nprincipal buildings and uses or groups of principal buildings and uses as a unified development on a single\nparcel or across contiguous parcels that have been combined for this purpose. The regulation strives to\npermit flexibility from underlying zoning requirements with an emphasis on design standards to assure that all\nprojects reflect a quality aesthetic while enhancing the character of the town/neighborhood. Redevelopment\nDesign Districts shall inspire a more harmonious relationship between the development, the parcel(s), and the\nsurrounding area than is possible using underlying zoning regulations. The RDD shall promote access to\nservices and transportation while protecting the character of the community and abutting parcels through\nthoughtful site design. In addition, it is the purpose of this regulation to:\na. Revitalize targeted parcels with mixed-use development that will provide for a variety of housing and\nbusiness opportunities.\nb. Invigorate industrial parcels into distinctive retail/service/residential environment.\nC.\nEncourage smart growth and low-impact development.\nd.\nPromote the development of human-scale neighborhoods in walking distance of public transit.\ne.\nAssist the Town of Plainville to comply with the State Zoning Enabling Act, Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7\n8-2, by adopting zoning regulations that promote economic diversity and housing choice.\nf.\nEnsure high quality site planning, architecture, and landscape design that is consistent with the\nsurrounding neighborhoods and the distinct visual character of the historic structures in Plainville.\ng.\nEstablish development standards that ensure context-sensitive design and creative site planning in the\nreuse of existing buildings and construction of new buildings.\nh.\nNotwithstanding approval of a Redevelopment Design District, the requirements of the underlying zone\nshall continue to apply if a project approved as a Redevelopment Design District is not constructed within\nstatutory timeframes.\n2. General Concepts - The RDD is an optional development that may be permitted in lieu of a standard\ndevelopment under the requirements of the underlying zone via special exception and site plan approval.\nThe RDD regulations pay careful attention to the design and aesthetics of buildings and site development\nfeatures with special consideration given to insure that surrounding areas and neighborhoods are not\nnegatively impacted. The establishment of a mixed land use pattern must accomplish the stated purpose of\nthe regulation and the successful applicant will present a planned community with features and amenities that\nare supportive of and complimentary to the proposed uses.

Required Primary Parcel Characteristics - The RDD must be located on parcels designated as brownfields,\ngrayfields, or vacant and/or underutilized parcels and shall contain either: 1) vacant or underutilized industrial\nbuildings or groupings of buildings, or 2) vacant parcels that have previously contained vacant or underutilized\ncommercial or industrial buildings or groupings of buildings that have been demolished, or 3) vacant parcels\nthat have otherwise been used for industrial quarry activity. The primary RDD parcel may not be used to\ndevelop greenfields, open space, or any other area that has not been previously developed or used for\ncommercial or industrial purposes. The primary parcel, whether or not combined with other parcels, must\nexhibit one or more of the aforementioned characteristics.

The Commission finds that solar energy is beneficial to the environment and provides an\neconomical energy source to those who choose to use it. The Commission also finds that standards are\nrequired to protect the character and aesthetics of the community, as well as to protect property values and\nthe quiet and peaceful enjoyment of real property. It is also recognized that the Town of Plainville is not a\nland-rich community. As such, ground mounted solar energy installations shall be permitted only where it can\nbe demonstrated that no prudent and feasible alternative exists, and then only to the degree needed to\nsatisfy the needs of the onsite consumer and other applicable standards as follows.\n2.\nNo ground mounted solar energy system shall be permitted unless it can be documented that the on-site\nconsumer's structure(s) have been deemed unfit for a roof top installation by a qualified structural engineer,\nor a qualified solar energy system installation engineer, and where such deficiencies cannot be remedied for\nless than 15% of the total project costs. Such documentation shall be provided in writing by said professional\nand shall bear that professional's seal. Such documentation shall be further subject to review by town\nplanning, engineering and building officials.\n3.\nRooftop solar energy systems\nInstallations for properties in residential, commercial and industrial zones are permitted by right if it can be\ndemonstrated the installation can comply with the following standards:\na.\nRooftop installations shall not exceed a height of greater than eight (8) inches from the peak of the\nhighest roof ridgeline on roofs having a pitch equal to or greater than 2-inch vertical for every 12-inch\nhorizontal rise, not including projections such as cupolas or similar features, nor greater than a vertical\nheight of five (5) feet above a flat roof system, or a pitched roof system having less than a 2-inch vertical\nfor every 12-inch horizontal rise. Inverters, where required by code to be co-located on the roof, shall be\nlocated in a manner that minimizes visibility at all times.\nb.\nIn order to preserve community aesthetics, visible portions of the installations shall incorporate\nsymmetry. Where practical, vent stacks and other roof protrusions shall be relocated to allow for the\ngreatest symmetry possible. Such relocation shall not be required when documentation is submitted to\nverify that such equipment relocation would exceed 15% of total project costs. Any such additional costs\nshall be cumulative along with additional costs required for structural roof repair.\nC.\nNo panels shall be installed that will cause glare onto any adjacent property.\n4. Ground mounted solar energy systems\nInstallations for properties in residential, commercial and industrial zones are permitted only after a site plan\napplication is submitted and approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Any such application shall\ncomply with the following standards:\na. Under no circumstance may ground mounted installations be approved where an alternate rooftop\ninstallation is feasible.\nb. Energy capacity requirements shall be documented based upon historic and proposed use and shall be\nprovided by a qualified solar energy system installation engineer.\nC.\nNo such residential installation shall occupy more ground area than that of the one story footprint of the\nprimary structure, and\nd. No such commercial/industrial installation shall occupy more ground area than that needed to adequately\nservice the needs of the occupants and operational requirements of any premises as certified by a\nqualified solar energy system installation engineer.\ne. Ground mounted installations shall not exceed a height of six (6) feet from adjacent grade at any point.\nf.\nNo such installation shall be permitted in any front yard.\ng.\nRear and side yard setbacks shall be a minimum of 10 feet from any property line.\n101\n"}, {"page": "108", "text": "Section 6.05\nh.\nGround mounted installations and associated electrical connections may be secured by any conforming\nfence of the owners choosing; however, the entire installation shall be screened from view from any\npublic street or adjacent residential lot by arborvitae or an approved alternate planted six feet on center\nin areas that will not interfere with solar access. Landscape screening shall be located outside of any\nfence used to secure the installation.\ni.\nNo panels may be installed that will cause glare onto any adjacent property, public or private.\n5.\nAbandonment/Discontinuance: Any solar energy system shall be considered abandoned when it fails to\noperate for more than one year due to malfunctioning components, disrepair, or by virtue of reaching the end\nof its useful life.\n6.\nRemoval: Any solar energy system that has been abandoned for a period in excess of two years shall be\ndismantled and removed at the owner's expense.\n7.\nReferral: All solar energy system installations submitted for approval to the building official shall be referred\nto the Department of Planning and Economic Development for compliance review and process determination.\n102\n"}, {"page": "109", "text": "Section 7.01\nArticle 7.

The responsibility of the Planning and Zoning Commission, is to\ninsure that any special exception use does not impact the existing neighborhood in a negative manner. A special\nexception use may be acceptable or inappropriate depending on the intensity of the use and proximity to and\nimpact upon neighboring properties.
