Such reviews are carried out by an\nindependent Architectural Design Review Board (ADRB), whose members are\nappointed by the Board of Selectmen.\n2.15.2 Architectural Design Review Board.\nThe ADRB functions in an advisory capacity to the Planning and Zoning\nCommission, providing comment on site plan and Special Use Permit applications\nwith regard to the scale, massing, colors and proportions of buildings,\nlandscaping, public spaces, lighting and signage.
