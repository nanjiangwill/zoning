The appearance of a single property also has\na\ncumulative effect which can enhance or diminish the beauty of the entire Town, and consequently the values of\nproperty elsewhere within the Town.\nORGANIZATION\nThis set of Regulations has been organized around four main thematic elements. Understanding this\norganization will help the user quickly locate the regulatory provisions they seek.\nThese Regulations are intended to be a dynamic document, not a static document. It is anticipated that these\nRegulations will be regularly reviewed and updated, as necessary, to anticipate and reflect the ever changing\nneeds of the community and to guide land use activities in Cromwell in ways that will continue to maintain and\nenhance community character and protect the public health, safety, and welfare.\nCromwell Zoning Regulations 10252015\nCELL (1, 1): \nTHEME\nCELL (1, 2): \nSECTIONS\nCELL (1, 3): \nDESCRIPTION\nCELL (2, 1): \nBasics\nCELL (2, 2): \nIntroduction and\nDefinitions\nCELL (2, 3): \nBackground information and how the regulations will be\nused and interpreted\nCELL (3, 1): \nZones and Uses\nCELL (3, 2): \nResidential Zones\nBusiness Zones\nSpecial Zones\nCELL (3, 3): \nInformation about the various zoning districts and the\nstandards that apply within them\nCELL (4, 1): \nStandards\nCELL (4, 2): \nBasic Standards\nSpecial Permits\nSpecial Requirements\nCELL (4, 3): \nRequirements for landscaping, signage, parking, non-\nconforming uses and other activities\nCELL (5, 1): \nAdministrative\nCELL (5, 2): \nProcedures\nAdministration\nZoning Board of Appeals\nCELL (5, 3): \nHow applications will be processed and the regulations\nwill be administered\n"}, {"page": "4", "text": "Cromwell Zoning Regulations 8.25.2015\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nREGULATION AMENDMENTS\nCELL (2, 1): \nAdoption Date:\nCELL (2, 2): \nEffective Date:\nCELL (2, 3): \nDescription of Amendment:\nCELL (3, 1): \nApril 19, 2005\nCELL (3, 2): \nApril 26, 2005\nCELL (3, 3): \nChange to 13 regarding posting of sign for Special Permit application\nCELL (4, 1): \nMay 3, 2005\nCELL (4, 2): \nMay 31, 2005\nCELL (4, 3): \nChange to 10 revising the Conservation Subdivision Special Permit\napproval process\nCELL (5, 1): \nJune 7, 2005\nCELL (5, 2): \nJune 24, 2005\nCELL (5, 3): \nChange to 18 regarding amount of parking at Retail and restaurant uses\n(approved on 6/72005, Filed with Town Clerk on 6/24/05)\nCELL (6, 1): \nJuly 5, 2005\nCELL (6, 2): \nJuly 13, 2005\nCELL (6, 3): \nChange to 16 regarding erosion and sediment control.\nCELL (7, 1): \nAugust 2, 2005\nCELL (7, 2): \nAugust 9, 2005\nCELL (7, 3): \nChange to 15 regarding filling and excavating; new 11.12 for car wash.\nCELL (8, 1): \nJanuary 17, 2006\nCELL (8, 2): \nJanuary 23, 2006\nCELL (8, 3): \nChange to 4 (Moratorium on Zone Changes) And 10 (Moratorium on\nConservation Subdivisions)\nCELL (9, 1): \nFebruary 7, 2006\nCELL (9, 2): \nFebruary 15, 2006\nCELL (9, 3): \nChange to 4.2.84A (Wholesale Nurseries in PO Zone).\nCELL (10, 1): \nJune 6, 2006\nCELL (10, 2): \nJuly 1, 2006\nCELL (10, 3): \nChange to 4.3.b.

Therefore, the\nPlanning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Cromwell, Connecticut, hereby established a Special Flood\nHazard Area Overlay District.\n4.2.B\nFinding of Fact.\n1.\nThe flood hazard areas of the Town of Cromwell are subject to periodic flood inundation\nwhich results in the loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of\ncommerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood\nprotection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the\npublic health, safety and general welfare.\n2.\nThese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the floodplains\ncausing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard\nCromwell Zoning Regulations 8.25.2015\nBUSINESS ZONES\n62\nCELL (1, 1): \nBASE\nCELL (1, 2): \nOVERLAY\nCELL (1, 3): \nFLOATING\nCELL (2, 1): \nRiparian Protection\nCELL (2, 2): \nSpecial Flood Hazard Area\nCELL (2, 3): \nActive Adult Housing\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (3, 3): \nInstitutional Development\nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (4, 3): \nMixed Use\nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nCELL (5, 3): \nPlanned Residential District\n"}, {"page": "71", "text": "areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately\nelevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage. Uncontrolled\ndevelopment and use of the floodplains can adversely affect the community.\n3.\nThe Town of Cromwell has voluntarily participated in the National Flood Insurance\nProgram (NFIP) since prior to 1990. The NFIP is founded on a mutual agreement between\nthe Federal government and each participating community. Local, State and Federal\ngovernments must share roles and responsibilities to meet the goals and objectives of the\nNFIP. The community's role is of paramount importance. Property owners are able to\nreceive Federally-subsidized flood insurance only if the community enacts and enforces the\nminimum floodplain regulations required for participation in the NFIP.\n4.2.C\nPurpose.\nIt is the purpose of this regulation to regulate floodplain development, promote public health, safety, and\ngeneral welfare, and minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions\ndesigned to:\n1.\nTo protect human life and health, and prevent damage to property;\n2.\nTo minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects;\n3.\nTo minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally\nundertaken at the expense of the general public;\n4.\nTo minimize prolonged business interruptions and other economic disruptions;\n5.\nTo minimize damage to public facilities, infrastructure and utilities, such as water and gas\nmains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges, located in the\nfloodplain;\n6.\nTo help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood\nhazard areas in such a manner as to minimize flood damage and flood blightareas;\n7.\nTo insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area;\n8.\nTo prevent increase in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in\nconflicts between property owners;\n9.\nTo ensure that those who occupy the flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their\nactions; and\n10. To discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate\nthe activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.\n4.2.D\nObjectives.\nIn order to accomplish its purposes, this regulation includes objectives, methods and provisions that:\n1.\nRestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flood or\nerosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or\nvelocities;\n2.\nRequire that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected\nagainst flood damage at the time of initial construction;\n3.\nControl the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective\nbarriers that are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;\nCromwell Zoning Regulations 8.25.2015\nBUSINESS ZONES\n"}, {"page": "72", "text": "Area of Shallow Flooding.
