This Section is intended to minimize the problems caused by improperly designed and installed outdoor lighting.\n2.\nImproperly designed outdoor lighting can cause glare, defined as light emitted with an intensity great enough to reduce a viewer's ability to\nsee and, in extreme cases, causing momentary blindness. Glare can create a nuisance or hazard for users of neighboring properties and for\nmotorists or pedestrians on public streets. In addition, light that crosses a property boundary, particularly from a nonresidential to a\nresidential property, can cause a nuisance by reducing nighttime privacy. These requirements are adopted to minimize glare from outdoor\nlighting and reduce the spillover of light beyond the area for which it is intended.\nB. Applicability\nThe requirements of this Section apply to lighting in residential and non-residential districts, not including lighting of public streets.\n104\n"}, {"page": "113", "text": "TOWN OF PUTNAM ZONING REGULATIONS\nC.

Spotlights - A spotlight concentrates the light into a directed beam aimed in a particular direction. Spotlights are allowed subject to the\nfollowing:\ni.\nThe light shall be directed only onto the facade of a building or sign on the same lot.\nii. Facades and signs located less than 50 feet from a residential district shall not be illuminated by a spotlight.\niii. The lamp shall be shielded on the rear and sides by a material that fully blocks light. This shield shall extend at least 6 inches in front\nof the lamp.\niv. The width of the front opening of the light shield shall be no more than the length of the shield.\nc.\nLow Intensity Lights - Light fixtures with the following characteristics are permitted without cutoff shields:\ni.\nThe lamp(s) housed by the fixture do not emit a total of more than 16,000 lumens for freestanding fixtures, or 10,000 lumens for\nfixtures attached to structures, based on the manufacturer's lumen rating for the initial light output of the lamp(s).\nii. The lamp is no more than 14 feet above ground level for freestanding fixtures, or 8 feet above ground level for fixtures attached to\nstructures.\n105\n"}, {"page": "114", "text": "TOWN OF PUTNAM ZONING REGULATIONS\niii. For fixtures with shields or other design features to direct the light, the light is not directed toward adjacent properties or public\nstreets.\niv.

Purpose and Applicability\nThese regulations are intended to provide for increased flexibility, balanced by increased control, in the development of land SO as to facilitate\nthe preservation of open space, natural resources, recreational uses, and community character.\n1. The purposes of this Section are to:\na.\npromote conservation of soils, wetlands, streams, large and healthy stands of trees, existing farmland, stone walls, and other significant\nnatural and cultural features and landmarks, making the best use of the land through avoidance of unnecessary regrading of the natural\nterrain;\n131\n"}, {"page": "140", "text": "TOWN OF PUTNAM ZONING REGULATIONS\nb. enhance the value to the public of abutting or neighboring parks, forests, greenways, wildlife preserves, nature reservations or\nsanctuaries or other open spaces;\nc. enhance public recreation opportunities, including access to greenway networks and trails;\nd.\nencourage the permanent preservation of open space, agricultural lands, forest lands and other natural resources including aquifers, water\nbodies and wetlands, and historical and archaeological resources;\ne. encourage a less sprawling and more efficient form of development that consumes less open land and conforms to existing topography\nand natural features;\nf.\nmaintain the traditional New England rural character and land use pattern in which small villages contrast with open space and\nfarmlands;\ng. facilitate the construction of streets, utilities and public services in a more economical and efficient manner;\nh.\nensure that residential developments are designed to minimize impacts to the natural features of the land, including wetlands,\nwatercourses, forests, prime agricultural land, steep slopes, plants, wildlife, historically and culturally significant sites, scenic views, and\nrural character;\ni.\nencourage development out of view from the road, and promote alternatives to strip residential development lining roadsides in the town;\nand\nj. provide wildlife corridors connecting open spaces, needed by wildlife to ensure their survival.\n2.\nApplicability.

General Density Limitations\nExcept as otherwise provided in these Regulations, the overall density of an OSRD subdivision shall be no greater than what would be allowed\nin the district under conventional zoning. The maximum number of units for an OSRD subdivision shall be determined by the Yield Plan\nMethod, as follows.\n132\n"}, {"page": "141", "text": "TOWN OF PUTNAM ZONING REGULATIONS\n1. Under the Yield Plan Method, the applicant must provide a preliminary conceptual subdivision plan consisting of lot and street layouts\nconforming to the Zoning and Subdivision Regulations governing conventional subdivision lots. Although such yield plans shall be\nconceptual in nature, and are not intended to involve significant engineering costs, they must be realistic and must not show potential house\nsites or streets in areas that would not ordinarily be legally permitted in a conventional subdivision layout. Consequently, yield plans must\nidentify physical and other features that would limit or restrict the use of the parcel for development, including, but not limited to,\ntopographic contours, at a contour interval of no less than ten (10) feet; wetlands and watercourses; 100-year floodplains (Flood Zones A, as\nshown on FEMA maps); slopes exceeding twenty-five percent (25%); rock outcrops; and easements and rights-of-way affecting the parcel.\nOn lots that would not be served by public sewerage or a centralized private sewage treatment facility, soil suitability for individual septic\nsystems must be demonstrated. The Planning Commission may select a small percentage of lots (10 to 15%) to be tested, in areas considered\nto be marginal. If all tests on the sample lots meet applicable Public Health Code requirements, the applicant's other lots shall also be deemed\nsuitable for septic systems, for the purpose of calculating total lot yield. However, if any of the sample lots fail, several others (of the\nPlanning Commission's choosing) shall be tested, until all the lots in a given sample pass.\nC. Density Bonuses\nThe maximum number of lots allowed under this Section and/or under Section 401 may be increased in one of the following ways:\n1. Open Space Maintenance Fund. The Planning Commission may allow a density bonus to generate additional income to the applicant for\nthe express and sole purpose of endowing a permanent fund to offset continuing open space maintenance costs. The density bonus granted\nunder this subsection shall be limited to fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of lots that would otherwise be allowed under this Section\nand/or under Section 401 as may be applicable. Any such density bonus shall be conditioned upon the provision by the owner of the parcelto\nbe subdivided of an agreement to pay a fee into an open space maintenance fund to be established and maintained by either (1) the Town\nof\nPutnam or (2) the organization to be charged with the maintenance of the open space provided in the applicable subdivision plan. The\namount of the fee shall be set by the following formula: [(CFMV/N) X (0.5 XL)], where CFMV is the cumulative fair market value of all of\nthe buildable lots or parts resulting from the subdivision, N is the total number of buildable lots or parts resulting from the subdivision, and\nXL is the number of additional lots allowed by the density bonus. The value of CFMV shall, at the option of the applicant, be (1) the 100%\nvalue of all of the buildable lots or parts as determined by the Town Assessor for tax purposes as of the effective date of the subdivision\napproval, or (2) determined by a licensed Connecticut real estate appraiser chosen jointly by the applicant and the Planning Commission, in\nwhich case the applicant shall be responsible for any appraisal fees.\n2.\nOther Open Space Dedications. A density bonus may be granted for the provision of excess open space, meaning the amount of any open\nspace acreage that is greater than the minimum amount that would be required under this Section.

Design examples of towers include, but are not limited to, self-supporting lattice, guide (guy-wire) and monopole.\n148\n"}, {"page": "157", "text": "TOWN OF PUTNAM ZONING REGULATIONS\nWireless telecommunication facility includes the equipment and structures involved in receiving or transmitting electromagnetic waves\nassociated with wireless telecommunication services, together with all cabinets, buildings, transformers and associated structures.\nWireless telecommunication services are services associated with the transmission and/or reception of wireless telecommunications. These\nservices may include by way of example, but not limited to, cellular personal communications, specialized, mobilized, radio and paging.\nC. Siting Preferences\nThe general order of preference for alternative facility locations shall range from A as the most preferred to E as the least preferred:\n1. On existing or approved towers.\n2. On existing structures such as nonresidential buildings/facades, water towers/tanks, utility poles, chimneys, bridges, grain elevators, and\nsilos, or in structures such as steeples, clock and bell towers.\n3. On new towers located on property occupied by one or more existing towers. This recognizes an already proven good site, and implies that\nclustering or tower \"farming\" is more desirable than scattering or dispersal. However, with lower power PCS, which can require more\nantennas for coverage, clustering may not necessarily provide seamless coverage.\n4.
