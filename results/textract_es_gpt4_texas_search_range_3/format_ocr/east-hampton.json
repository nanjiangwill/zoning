Therefore, the East\nHampton Planning & Zoning Commission of the Town of East Hampton, Connecticut, does ordain as follows:\nB.\nFinding Of Fact\nThe flood hazard areas of the Town of East Hampton are subject to periodic flood inundation which results in the\nloss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,\nextraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which\nadversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.\nThese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the floodplains causing increases in flood\nheights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other\nlands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage. Uncontrolled\ndevelopment and use of the floodplains can adversely affect the community.\nThe Town of East Hampton has voluntarily participated in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) since\nOctober 16, 1979. The NFIP is founded on a mutual agreement between the federal government and each\nparticipating community. Local, state and federal governments must share roles and responsibilities to meet the\ngoals and objectives of the NFIP. The community's role is of paramount importance. Property owners are able to\nreceive federally-subsidized flood insurance only if the community enacts and enforces the minimum floodplain\nregulations required for participation in the NFIP.\nC.\nStatement Of Purpose\nIt is the purpose of this regulation to regulate floodplain development, promote public health, safety, and general\nwelfare, and minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:\n1.\nTo protect human life and health, and prevent damage to property;\n2. To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects;\n3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at\nthe expense of the general public;\n4.\nTo minimize prolonged business interruptions and other economic disruptions;\n5.\nTo minimize damage to public facilities, infrastructure and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric,\ntelephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges, located in the floodplain;\n6.\nTo help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas\nin such a manner as to minimize flood damage and flood blight areas;\n7. To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area;\n8. To prevent increase in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between\nproperty owners;\n9. To ensure that those who occupy the flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions; and\n10.\nTo discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity, use\nor structure outside of the floodplain.\n29\n"}, {"page": "40", "text": "D.\nObjectives\nIn order to accomplish its purposes, this regulation includes objectives, methods and provisions that:\n1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flood or erosion\nhazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;\n2.\nRequire that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood\ndamage at the time of initial construction;\n3.\nControl the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers that are\ninvolved in the accommodation of flood waters;\n4.\nControl filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage;\nand\n5.

The Planning and Zoning Official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any\nvariances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) upon request.\n2. Specific Situation Variances\na. Buildings on a Historic Register - Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or\nrestoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of\nHistoric Places, or any locally-adopted historic district without regard to the procedures set forth\nin the remainder of this Section and provided the proposed reconstruction, rehabilitation or\nrestoration will not result in the structure losing its historical designation.\nb.\nFunctionally Dependent Use or Facility - Variances may be issued for new construction and\nsubstantial improvements and other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally\ndependent use or facility provided the structure or other development is protected by methods\nthat minimize flood damage, creates no additional threat to public safety, and meets all the\nrequirements of Section 9.5.C.\nC.\nFloodway Prohibition - Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any\nincrease in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.\n3.\nConsiderations For Granting Of Variances - In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of\nAppeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other\nsections of this regulation and the items listed below as 9.5.C. Upon consideration of these factors and\nthe purposes of this regulation, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of\nvariances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this regulation.\na. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;\nb. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;\nC.\nThe susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such\ndamage on the individual owner;\nd.\nThe importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;\ne.\nThe necessity of the facility to waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent\nfacility;\n43\n"}, {"page": "54", "text": "f.\nThe availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding or erosion damage for the\nproposed use;\ng.\nThe compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;\nh.\nThe relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management\nprogram for that area;\ni.\nThe safety access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;\nj.\nThe expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters\nand the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and\nk.\nThe costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including\nmaintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water\nsystems, and streets and bridges.\n4. Conditions For Variances\na. Variances shall only be used upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to\nafford relief considering the flood hazard; and in the instance of a historical building, a\ndetermination that the variance is the minimum necessary as not to destroy the historic\ncharacter and design of the building and result in the loss of historic designation of the building.\nVariances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A properly issued\nvariance is granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that\ncomplying with the regulation would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the\nsurrounding property owners. Those characteristics must be unique to that property and not be\nshared by adjacent parcels. For example, economic or financial hardship is not sufficient cause\nfor a variance, nor are inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal\npreferences or disapproval of one's neighbors.\nb.\nVariances shall only be used upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination\nthat failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; (iii) a determination\nthat the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to\npublic safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, damage the rights or property\nvalues of other persons in the area, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with\nexisting local laws, ordinances or regulations. Only hardships that are based on unusual or\nunique physical characteristics of the property in question, characteristics that are not shared by\nadjacent parcels, shall qualify to meet subsection (ii) above. Claims of hardship based on the\nstructure, on economic gain or loss, or on personal or self-created circumstances are not\nsufficient cause for the granting of a variance.\nC.\nNo variance may be issued within a regulatory floodway that will result in any increase in the\n100-year flood levels. A variance may be issued for new construction, substantial improvements\nand other development necessary for the conduct of a \"functionally dependent use\" provided\nthat there is good and sufficient cause for providing relief; and the variance does not cause a rise\nin the 100-year flood level within a regulatory floodway. The structure and other development\nmust be protected by methods that minimize flood damages.\nd. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will\nbe permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation (BFE) and\nthe elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk\nresulting from the lowest floor elevation.\nK.\nEnforcement\n1.\nEach Building Permit and/or Zoning Certificate of Approval shall authorize, as a condition of approval, the\nPlanning and Zoning Official or designated agents to make regular inspections of the subject property.\nThe Planning and Zoning Official or designated agents are also authorized to inspect any property in a\nSpecial Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) where it appears that violations of these regulations may be taking\nplace.\n44\n"}, {"page": "55", "text": "2.\nIf the Planning and Zoning Official finds that any person is undertaking any construction, substantial\nimprovement, filling, or any other activity or maintaining a condition which is in violation of these\nregulations, the Planning and Zoning Official shall:\na.\nIssue a written order by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the subject property owner,\nordering that the activity cease and ordering the property owner to either obtain a Building\nPermit and/or Zoning Certificate of Approval prior to continuing with the activity or, if\nappropriate, ordering that all violations and/or obstructions be removed from the Special Flood\nHazard Area (SFHA) immediately.\nb.\nNotify the Building Official and request that any building and or zoning Certificate of Approval(s)\nin force be revoked or suspended and that a stop work order be issued.\nC.\nThe Planning and Zoning Official may suspend or revoke a Floodplain Development approval if it\nis found that the applicant has not complied with the terms, conditions or limitations set forth in\nthe approval or has exceeded the scope of work as set forth in the application including\napplication plans.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any substantial and material\nchange will be subject to the same procedural requirements for a zone change as required by the original\nzone change application adopting the Mixed Use Development District. For purposes hereof, a\nSubstantial and Material Change is:\na. any reduction to any component of the MUDD in excess of ten (10%) percent thereof or (ii) any\nincrease in the net square footage of all buildings in the MUDD by more than ten (10%) percent\nor (iii) any substantial change in the general layout and arrangement of uses and neighborhoods\nin the MUDD which would alter the general character of the neighborhood settings of each\nphase of the MUDD as approved by the Commission.\nb.\nNotwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, no such reduction to any component\nof the MUDD shall be authorized which would increase the percentage of residential to non-\nresidential uses in the MUDD without the approval of a new Master Plan.\n3.\nExcept as provided in Article 6 hereof, the Mixed Use Development District will supersede all pre-existing\nzoning, and any development of the zoned property owned and/or controlled by the Applicant, will be\nsubject to the specific requirements for the Mixed Use Development District set forth herein and as\ndelineated in the approved Master Plan.\nC.\nIntent\n1.\nUnified and Comprehensive Design. The Mixed Use Development District is designed to encourage\nmixed-use developments incorporating a neighborhood concept for separate and distinct neighborhoods\nwithin the Mixed Use Development District which are laid out, planned and designed to create a single\nintegrated community on large blocks of land, whether or not the Applicant is the owner of all of the\nparcels within the district boundaries. Such unified design shall include comprehensive standards for the\narchitectural style of buildings within each neighborhood of the MUDD; provision of open spaces and\nrecreational areas, including pedestrian linkages and linked community facilities; the design of utilitarian\n88\n"}, {"page": "99", "text": "elements such as street furniture, lighting fixtures, and signage; preliminary designs for sewer, water and\nstormwater management and renovation for the district.\n2.\nMaximum Utilization of Infrastructure. To direct more intensive development to areas of the Town\nwhere the highway connections, pedestrian linkages, public transportation utilities, water and sewer\nfacilities and topography will support such development, in accordance with the recommendations of the\nTown's Plan of Conservation and Development.\n3. Expand Property Tax Base and Employment Opportunities. Use the incentives of higher density\nresidential development and increased flexibility in overall development density and intensity to create an\nexpanded non-residential tax base for the Town; to create attractive commercial, recreational and\nlifestyle environments which address the needs of Town and regional residents for shopping, services and\nrecreational opportunities; to create employment opportunities for existing and future residents; and to\ncreate open space and recreational facilities that do not rely on public funds for their establishment\nand/or operation.\n4.\nIncreased Residential Diversity and Opportunity. Provide housing for persons who, due to age, income,\nhealth or lifestyle choice, require or demand more compact residential patterns than are possible with\neither (i) conventional single-lot subdivisions or (ii) development which can occur under existing multi-\nfamily development regulations; encourage varied housing types and to require the clustering of housing\non land most capable of supporting it, and to create open space corridors between such clusters. Nothing\nherein contained shall be construed to prevent the incorporation of single family subdivision building lots\nwithin a MUDD; provided, however, that any such single family residential building lot shall comply with\nany bulk requirements established by the Master Plan, and not based upon the bulk regulations contained\nin the underlying zoning district.\n5.\nHealth, Safety, and Welfare; Plan of Conservation and Development. To encourage mixed use\ndevelopment, including recreational and lifestyle opportunity development at such degrees of intensity as\ncan be conveniently accommodated by available infrastructure, or such infrastructure that may be\ndeveloped or improved at the Applicant's expense, in a manner which is consistent with the Plan of\nConservation and Development of the Town of East Hampton and which promotes the health, safety,\neconomic development and general welfare of the Town.\nD.\nMixed Use Development District\n1. Applicants. Any owner of property within a proposed MUDD may apply to the Commission for a change\nof zoning district classification from the underlying zoning district to MUDD. Such owner, herein referred\nto as the Applicant, need not own all land within the proposed MUDD, and failure to own all land within\nsuch proposed district shall not prevent the Commission from hearing or granting any such application;\nprovided, however, that the owner of each parcel delineated on the Master Plan for which MUDD\napproval is requested consents, in writing, to the filing of the application for the MUDD. For the purpose\nof this Section, the term \"underlying zoning district\" shall be defined as the zone(s) or district(s) existing\non the subject parcel prior to the filing of an application for a MUDD.\n2. Limitations on Underlying Zoning Districts. An Applicant can only apply for MUDD zoning district\nclassification in existing Commercial and Design Development zones.\n3.\nUses Allowed and Required. A MUDD may include any use of land set forth in the following Sections of\nthese Regulations, developed at the density and in accordance with the design parameters permitted by\nthis Section 6.4 of these Regulations, in distinction to the density and design requirements set forth in the\nhereinafter referenced underlying districts:\na.\nResidential District Uses: Any use permitted by right or by special permit in the R1 District, the\nR2 District, the R3 District, and specifically including zero lot line subdivisions and two-family and\nmulti-family residential uses, but excluding farms, seasonal roadside stands, kennels, wineries,\nexcavation and filling operations other than for construction-related site grading, and\ncemeteries. The permitted uses expressly include housing types which would be compatible with\na\nneighborhood or village type development. The overall residential density of the MUDD shall\nnot exceed six (6) dwelling units for each acre of land in the MUDD, including open space and\n89\n"}, {"page": "100", "text": "recreational areas. In the event that the residential component of a MUDD includes not less than\n10 percent of the proposed dwelling units as dwelling units which are designated as affordable\nhousing units as defined in Connecticut General Statutes Section 8-30g, the overall maximum\nresidential density of the MUDD shall be increased to eight (8) dwelling units for each acre of\nland in the MUDD, including open space and recreational areas.

The preparation of the preliminary plan is recommended to facilitate the general\nconsideration of factors and problems affecting the development of the land before the Applicant\nproceeds with the official application and the preparation of submittable maps, plans and documents\nrequired for formal consideration by the Commission. The presentation of a preliminary plan will more\nreadily and economically facilitate alterations and changes recommended by the Commission. The pre-\napplication conference and the informal consideration of the preliminary plan shall not be deemed to\nconstitute any portion of the official and formal procedure of applying for a change of zone or a Master\nPlan approval. Neither the Applicant nor the Commission shall be in any way bound by statements made\nin such informal discussions, their purpose being only to minimize delay, expense and inconvenience to\nthe public, the Applicant, and the Commission upon the future receipt, if any, of a formal application for a\nMUDD. Following any informal discussion, the Commission may suggest that the proposal, or certain\naspects thereof, be referred to other municipal, State, or Federal agencies for review and comment, or\nmay suggest that additional information is or will be required prior to action on a formal application for\nchange of zone.\n90\n"}, {"page": "101", "text": "2.
