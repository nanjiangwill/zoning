The total area of the parcel, as measured for purposes of this\nsection, shall exclude the following: (i) land that is not \"buildable land,\" as defined in Section 2.02 of the\nZoning Regulations, and (ii) existing and proposed streets and highways, easements and rights-of-way for\nvehicular access and utilities.\n29\n"}, {"page": "36", "text": "b.\nYield Plan Method: If the applicant chooses the Yield Plan Method, the applicant must\nprovide a preliminary conceptual subdivision plan consisting of lot and street layouts conforming to the\nZoning and Subdivision Regulations governing conventional subdivision lots.

Consequently, yield plans must identify physical and\nother features that would limit or restrict the use of the parcel for development, including, but not limited\nto, topographic contours, at a contour interval of no more than ten (10) feet; wetlands and watercourses;\n100-year floodplains (Flood Zones A, as shown on FEMA maps); slopes exceeding twenty-five percent\n(25%); rock outcrops; and easements and rights-of-way affecting the parcel.\nOn lots that would not be served by public sewerage or a centralized private sewage treatment\nfacility, soil suitability for individual septic systems must be demonstrated. The Commission may select\na small percentage of lots (10 to 15%) to be tested, in areas considered to be marginal. If all tests on the\nsample lots meet applicable Public Health Code requirements, the applicant's other lots shall also be\ndeemed suitable for septic systems, for the purpose of calculating total lot yield.
