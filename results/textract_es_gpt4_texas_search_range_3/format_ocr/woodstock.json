Standards for Stormwater Runoff, Erosion & Sediment Control\nThe proposed development shall be designed so as to meet the following standards:\na.\nPreserve pre-development site hydrology (i.e., runoff, infiltration, interception, evapo-\ntranspiration, groundwater recharge, and stream baseflow);\nb. Preserve and protect wetlands, stream buffers, natural drainage systems and other\nnatural features that provide water quality/quantity benefits;\nC.\nManage runoff velocity and volume in a manner that has minimal impact on the physical\nand biological character of existing drainage systems and prevents increases in\ndownstream flooding/streambank erosion;\nd.

This\nLot 1\nis the Original Lot.\nThe Owner wants to split off one lot. and since it is after the\nadoption of the Subdivision Regulations, AND the lot has\nsufficient room to provide two lots compliant with the Zoning\nRegulations, the Owner is eligible for one Free Split.\nThere are now two lots, 1 and 1A.\nFree Split\nsome time later\nLot 1\nNow the Owner of Lot 1 wants to sell off some more land by\ncreating new lot(s). The new lot(s) are created through a\nSubdivision. for the sake of this example, Lot 1 is converted\ninto 3 lots (Lot 1. Lot 1B & Lot 1C).\nLot 1A\nNow four lots exist from the Original Lot (including 1A).\nNote:\n1. Even if only 1 new lot was created from the Original Lot after\nthe Free Split, it would require a Subdivision.\nSubdivision\n2. If the Lot 1A Owner wanted to further divide this lot, he /she\nwould also need to do a Subdivision.\nin both cases, the above scenarios require a Subdivision\nbecause these lots would be created after the adoption of the\nSubdivision Regulations AND the Free Split was already\ntaken from the Original Lot with Lot 1A.\nIf the Owner of Lot 1C wanted to sell off some land by\ncreating new lots, that would be a Re-subdivision, shown\nhere as lots 1C & 1C-1.\nNote:\n1. This is an example of lot labeling, which is meant to illustrate\nRe-subdivision\nthe history of the lots which makes it easier to track them\nthrough the Land Records.\n2. All lots must conform to the Zoning Regulations in place\nwhen they are created.\n3. The only other way to sell land is with a Boundary Line\nAdjustment which merges a \"minor\" area into the adjacent\nlot; this must be researched by the property owner to ensure\nit does not actually fall under the category of Free Split,\nSubdivision or Re-subdivision Please see \"How to Deter-\nmine Property Division in Woodstock, CT\" handout.\nRECAP: ALL new lots created from the Original Lot after the\nFree Split require a Subdivision or Resubdivision\nThis diagram was created by Delia P.

Applicants\nare strongly encouraged to consider these resources and measures during the initial planning and\ndesign phase of the application process.\nAlthough not required, applicants are also encouraged to meet with Conservation Commission\nstaff (as the schedules of our volunteer members allow) during the planning phase, to review\nnatural and cultural resources and conservation measures.
