This section allows the approval, as Special Exception after a public\nhearing, of the development of an interior lot that does not meet lot frontage requirements of the zoning\ndistrict in which it is located. This section is not intended to encourage the development of land\ncharacterized by severe physical limitations\nB. Applicability\n1. This section does not apply to development of new subdivision lots on new streets. Such lots must\nmeet the required width upon the street as defined in Article 10: Definitions (Lot Frontage). This\nsection is intended to allow for the division of existing properties into not more than 2 new lots, 1\nor both of which cannot meet lot frontage requirements for the zone.\n2. Properties upon which interior lots are proposed must have been in existence as recorded by deed\nin the South Windsor land records, prior to adoption of this regulation on June 11, 1990. This\nregulation is not intended to allow for the creation of remainder \"parcels\" of land (upon which\ninterior lots are subsequently requested) without adequate frontage when new subdivisions are\napproved.\n3. Not more than 2 interior lots shall be approved on an existing parcel regardless of the number of\nfrontage access areas. An existing parcel that has been divided into 2 interior lots under this\nregulation shall not be re-divided into further interior lots under this regulation at any time.\n4. Interior lot development shall be limited to single-family dwellings and permitted accessory\nstructures.\n5. Interior lots will be allowed only in the following zones: RR, A-20, A-30, A-40, and AA-30. Any\nexisting conforming frontage lot must continue to meet the current zoning requirements.\nPage 3-9\n"}, {"page": "30", "text": "ARTICLE - RESIDENTIAL ZONES\nC. Approval Criteria\nIn reviewing and acting upon any proposal for an interior lot, the Commission shall determine that the\nfollowing criteria are met.\n1. The proposed interior lot(s) shall be deemed to accomplish the best use of the subject land and shall\nbe justified by the subject area's boundary configurations, topography, soils or other natural\nresource characteristics. In reviewing a proposed interior lot, the Commission shall carefully\nevaluate aesthetics; proximity to neighboring properties and dwelling units; restriction of existing\nviews; proposed buffering/screening: potential drainage, traffic and environmental impacts;\ndriveway locations, slopes and sight lines; utility service capabilities; property value impacts; and\nfuture land use alternatives. The applicant must demonstrate to the Commission that there are\nminimal impacts for all of the above-listed criteria.\n2. Except for requirements modified by this interior lot section, all new interior lot development shall\nconform to all requirements prescribed for the zone in which the interior lot is located.\n3. All interior lots shall have a minimum area which is double the required area for the zoning\ndistrict in which the interior lot is established with the exception of A-20 zones, which shall have a\nminimum lot area that is triple the minimum required lot area. Minimum lot area shall be\ncalculated exclusive of access area. Where lot approval is requested in an open-space subdivision,\nminimum area is still twice the standard lot size for the district.\n4. The access area is defined as the area in front of the minimum lot width line. The minimum lot\nwidth line is defined as the line perpendicular to the mean direction of the lot side lines, at which\nthe required minimum width is obtained. The minimum lot width shall generally be parallel to the\ntown street from which access is obtained. All interior lots must have a width at the minimum lot\nwidth line equal to 1.5 times the required lot width for the zoning district in which it is located.\n5.\nAll proposed interior lots shall include an access way meeting the following standards:\na. The access way portion of the interior lot shall directly front on a public street and be owned\nin fee by the interior lot. Alternatively, an access easement can be granted for the interior lot\nover the existing frontage provided that frontage is in excess of the minimum frontage\nrequirements of the underlying zone by a minimum of 25 feet;\nb. The access way shall have suitable sight lines along the street it fronts upon;\nC. No access way shall be located adjacent to another access way to an interior lot. There must be\na separating distance between access ways equal to the minimum lot width in the zone in which\nthe interior lots are located.\n6. Driveways to interior lots shall be designed and constructed to accommodate fire apparatus and\nother emergency equipment. All application for interior lots shall detail the nature of proposed\ndriveway construction including proposed location, width and building materials, and provision for\nvehicles to turn around. Driveway plans must be reviewed and approved by the Town Engineer and\nthe Fire Marshal.\n7. Not more than 2 interior lots may be accessed by a single access way. Access rights must be\ndocumented for both lots.\n8. There are no established front yard setbacks. An application will be evaluated for its aesthetic\nimpact on neighboring properties, especially front/existing lots.

There is a balance between neighborhood acceptance and community needs.\n2. The existing/proposed commercial/office uses are compatible with residential uses.\n3. The internal traffic circulation pattern is designed to minimize safety hazards for residents,\nparticularly with respect to access into and out of the building.\n4. Site design adequately reflects that residents' needs are accommodated as an integral part of the\nsite design (e.g., recreation, parking, storage, access) such that the site functions as an integrated\nsite.\nPage 4-\n"}, {"page": "47", "text": "ARTICLE 4 - COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES\n5. The proposed mixed use furthers the purpose stated in paragraph 4.1.8.A.\n6.\nThere is no undue concentration of high-density residential development in any\narea/neighborhood.\nThe Commission shall grant all approvals subject to such conditions and safeguards as will carry out the\nexpressed purpose of these regulations.\nAll requirements of the underlying zone that are not expressly altered by the above requirements must be\nmet.\nSection 4.2\nBuckland Road Gateway Development Zone (GD)\n4.2.1 Purpose\nThe purpose of the Buckland Road Gateway Development Zone is to create an attractive entrance to South\nWindsor. This zone should foster high-quality development of businesses and sites, with careful attention\nto the appearance of buildings and surrounding site, integration of historic structures where possible, and\nprofessional landscaping. Within the Zone, it is beneficial to the economic viability of the Zone and the\noverall high-quality of the area to introduce a multifamily residential component at certain, but not all,\nlocations to create a fully-integrated mixed-use land use pattern to accomplish the purpose of the Zone.\nAccess management will be an integral part of site planning, with interior service drives and limited curb\ncuts to facilitate traffic flow and safety. In recognition of the fact that it is generally site appearance and\nperformance that determine whether a use is desirable or undesirable, and that there will be desirable uses\nthat have not been developed yet, permitted uses will be those that are able to meet all of the standards\nenumerated below and in other applicable sections of these regulations.\n4.2.2 Definitions\nDevelopment Area Plan: Is defined as the site area within boundaries shown on the submitted General\nPlan of Development or Final Plan that illustrates the proposed development and its physical impacts on\nsurrounding area, facilities and systems in accordance with the regulations. The intent of this is to\nillustrate the contiguous area for the purposes of creating a new mixed use development.\nDrive-Through Facility: An establishment that by design encourages or permits customers to receive\nservices or obtain goods while remaining in their motor vehicles.\nHuman Scaled: Site and building design elements that are dimensionally related to pedestrians, such as:\nsmall building spaces with individual entrances (e.g., as is typical of downtowns and main street\ndevelopments); larger buildings which have articulation and detailing to break up large masses; narrower\nstreets with tree canopies; smaller parking areas or parking areas broken up into small components with\nlandscaping; and pedestrian amenities, such as sidewalks, plazas, outdoor seating, shorter light poles\n(usually 10-14'), weather protection (e.g., awnings or canopies), and similar features. These features are\nall\ngenerally smaller in scale than those which are primarily intended to accommodate automobile traffic.\nPedestrian Amenities: Pedestrian amenities serve as informal gathering places for socializing, resting, and\nenjoyment of a particular area and contribute to a walk-able center. Typical amenities include extra wide\nsidewalks, street trees, sitting spaces, weather protection (awnings or canopies), pedestrian scale lighting,\nbus stop seating, sidewalk dining, etc.\nPedestrian-Friendly/Pedestrian-Oriented: Development which is designed with an emphasis primarily\non the sidewalk and pedestrian access to and within the site and building, rather than on auto access and\nparking areas. The building is generally placed close to the street and the main entrance is oriented to the\nPage 4-11\n"}, {"page": "48", "text": "ARTICLE - COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES\nstreet sidewalk. There are generally windows or display cases along building fa\u00e7ades which face the street.\nStrip Commercial Center: Strip commercial centers are typically developed, owned and maintained as a\nunit and have large parking lots in front, with many/most of the stores arranged in a straight row and an\nautomobile-centric design. Proliferation results in a pattern of development wherein commercial\ndevelopment is strung along an arterial thoroughfare.\n4.2.3 General Concepts\nA. Site planning is an essential criterion of the Buckland Road Gateway Development Zone. Sites\ndeveloped under this zone are intended to be carefully planned, both within the site's own boundaries\nand in relation to surrounding properties and the entire Buckland Road Gateway Development zone. It\nis the express intention of these Buckland Road Gateway Development zone regulations to result in\ndevelopments that do not resemble typical 'strip commercial centers'. All developments shall be\nhuman scaled, pedestrian friendly/pedestrian oriented developments with pedestrian amenities.\nB. Retail developments depend on high visibility from major public streets. In turn, their design deter-\nmines much of the character and attractiveness of major streetscapes. The marketing interests of many\ncorporations, even with strong image-making design by professional designers, can be potentially\ndetrimental to community aspirations and sense of place when they result in developments that do not\ncontribute to or integrate with the Town in a positive way. In recognition of this, the Gateway zone\nincludes special standards and guidelines for retail developments. These standards and objectives\nrequire a basic level of architectural variety, compatible scale, and mitigation of negative impacts. The\nstandards are by no means intended to limit creativity; it is the Town's hope that they will serve as a\nuseful tool for design professionals engaged in site-specific design. The purpose of these standards and\nguidelines is to augment existing criteria with more specific interpretations that apply to the design of\nretail store developments.\nC. All buildings must be individually designed by registered architects for compatibility with South\nWindsor and must conform to the provisions of Section 8.7, Architectural and Design Review. The type\nof design excellence described in Section 8.7 is usually not obtained with stereotypical franchise-type\nbuilding designs. Applicants must avoid submitting stereotypical franchise-type buildings unless the\nbuilding truly demonstrates architectural excellence.\nD. This zone is intended to encourage smaller sites to combine with other sites in order to provide\nlarger-scale sites and developments. As an incentive to promote combining of properties, a 5%\nimpervious coverage bonus will be granted for nonconforming lot consolidation per paragraph 4.1.7.D.\nE. Access management will be required on all sites in order to reduce the number of driveway cuts onto\nBuckland Road and mitigate the deterioration of traffic flow generally caused by driveways on arte-\nrial streets. Access management techniques will include shared driveways (or provisions for future\nshared driveways for the first site in an area), interior service drives, and other techniques included in\nSouth Windsor's access management program.\nF. On sites where stormwater detention/retention will be accomplished via surface detention/retention\nbasins, provisions shall be made for shared detention/retention basins to the maximum extent feasible.\nPage 4-10\n"}, {"page": "50", "text": "ARTICLE - COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES\n4.2.4 Pre-Application Discussion\nApplicants are encouraged to initiate a pre-application conference with the Commission to discuss the\nconceptual aspects of the proposed development and to prepare and present a conceptual plan for informal\nconsideration by the Commission. Neither the pre-application conference, the informal review of the\nconcept plan, nor the Commission's suggestions shall be deemed to constitute approval or denial of any\nportion of the application.\n4.2.5 Permitted Uses\nA. Permitted uses are those commercial, institutional, cultural and municipal uses that reflect the\npurposes of these regulations by careful attention to the appearance and siting of their buildings and/or\nsite amenities, and that meet all of the performance standards enumerated within this section and all\nother applicable sections of the these regulations, with the exception of the following specifically\nprohibited uses in Section 4.2.6\nB. Grocery stores shall be permitted SO long as any grocery store proposed is at least 975 feet corner to\ncorner from any other existing grocery store. 'Specialty' food stores (including, but not limited to,\nhealth foods, cheese shops, etc.) of less than 10,000 square feet in size are not considered to be grocery\nstores and are permitted regardless of their distance from any permitted grocery store or other\n'specialty' food store.\nC. Multifamily Residential Use, subject to the requirements of this Section and the specific requirements\nof Section 4.2.15.\nD. Automotive fuel stations are permitted only when accessory to a retail sales and inventory use, where\nthe automotive fuel station use is directly related to such retail sales and inventory use which has a\nminimum gross floor area of 100,000 square feet. Such facility must be a minimum of 500 feet from\nBuckland Road and within 1,500 feet of the primary building. In addition to motor vehicle refueling,\nsuch automotive fuel stations may also provide: (i) re-energizing services such as propane, electricity\nor similar service, which may be dispensed directly to the vehicle from pumps, plugs, couplings or\nsome other approved means. The Commission may determine hours of operation. The automotive fuel\nstation shall be designed with the same criteria applicable to permitted uses as provided by Section\n4.2.5 (A).\nE. Drive-through facilities are a permitted use provided they comply with the design standards as set forth\nin Section 4.2.16 and only when the use to which the drive-through facility is a part of meets the\nfollowing criteria:\na. Hot meals must be made to order.\nb. Use must be part of a multi-tenant building.\nC. Restaurant must offer table delivery of food.\nd. Metal silverware, ceramic plates, and other dishwasher safe materials are required for patron's\nuse on premises. Food cannot be served on premises in/on Styrofoam or plastic.\ne. The facility must be part of a planned unit development of at least two-hundred thousand\n(200,000) square feet of gross building area.\nF. Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) is permitted as a primary use by Special Exception.\nPage 4-12\n"}, {"page": "51", "text": "ARTICLE 4 - COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES\n4.2.6 Prohibited Uses\nA. Gasoline service stations, except an automotive fuel station which is permitted as provided by Section\n4.2.5.D; automotive, boat, recreational vehicle, truck, and similar sales, service and repair garages.\nPublic display of any vehicle for sale is strictly prohibited.

Any use similar in purpose, use, or service to the above prohibited uses, regardless of its name or\ntitle; and\nM. On-site dry cleaning.\n4.2.7 Consolidated Parcels\nA. Purpose\nIn the interest of promoting development continuity, the consolidation of contiguous parcels is\nencouraged. 'Consolidation' is defined here as the integration of 2 or more individually owned parcels into\na single Consolidated Parcel for the purposes of creating a shared-use arrangement of selected site\ncomponents, e.g. common points of access/egress, drive passage, parking, loading/unloading, building\ncoverage and yards.\nB. Procedure\n1.\nA consolidated parcel shall be developed with an integrated plan of buildings, parking, loading\nand unloading, and open space.\nPage 4-13\n"}, {"page": "52", "text": "ARTICLE - COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES\n2.\nThe owner of each lot shall give to the owner of each lot in the consolidated parcel by deed,\neasement, or agreement filed in the Office of the Town Clerk, the right of entrance, exit, passage,\nparking, and loading.\nC. Access\nThe Commission may require or limit the number of access/egress drives and/or direct the placement of\nsame within a Consolidated Parcel such that only 1 or more of several individually or commonly owned\n\"sub-parcels\" within the Consolidated Parcel would have a point of access/egress. Such restriction would\nbe in accordance with current access management policies and plans.\nD. Yards\nSide or rear yards may be ignored along common boundaries of consolidated lots.\nE. Impervious Coverage Bonus\nA 5% impervious coverage bonus may be granted for the consolidation of 2 or more lots that are\nnon-conforming to the minimum lot size requirement into 1 larger lot. When a non-conforming lot is\ncombined with a conforming lot, an additional 5% of the area of the non-conforming lot can be added to\nthe total impervious surface allowed.\n4.2.8 Yard and Bulk Requirements\nA. Minimum lot size is 3 acres. Pre-existing legally created lots that do not meet the minimum 3 acre\nrequirement shall be considered legally nonconforming lots in accordance with Section 2.5 Building\non Existing Nonconforming Lots.\nB.\nIn order to ensure that there will be large open spaces between the front of buildings and public roads,\nwith minimal yard spaces at the rear of properties, the following setbacks shall apply:\n1. Minimum lot frontage is 200 feet;\n2. Minimum lot depth is 200 feet;\n3. Minimum front yard setback is 65 feet;\n4. Minimum side yard setback is 25 feet; and\n5. Minimum rear yard setback is 10 feet.\nC. Where the Gateway Development Zone abuts a residential zone, the minimum setback from the\nproperty boundary shall be 65 feet. Front and side yard setbacks are exclusive of all structures (except\npermitted signs).\nD. The Commission may grant a waiver to the yard setback requirements for art/sculpture or other\ndecorative items such as fountains.\nE. Maximum impervious coverage is 60%. The Commission may grant a 5% bonus for consolidated\nparcels (in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4.1.8.D).\nF. The maximum building height is 60 feet/4 stories for any building that is at least 125 feet from a\npublic street right-of-way, provided, however, that any portion of such building located within 125 feet\nof the public street right-of-way or any building located in its entirety within 125 feet of the public\nstreet right-of-way shall have a maximum height of 30 feet/2 stories.\nPage 4-14\n"}, {"page": "53", "text": "ARTICLE 4 - COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES\nG. The applicant may request and the Commission may grant a height waiver to increase the building\nheight to 90 feet/6 stories for a building or portion thereof located at least 200 feet from any public\nstreet and from any residential zone boundary, if the Commission determines that the site is suitable for\na taller building and that the character of the Gateway Development Zone is enhanced rather than\ndiminished by a taller building. In order to qualify for a height waiver, the applicant must demonstrate\nthat the taller building conforms with the following criteria:\n1. Site location and topography are such that the taller building blends in with its surroundings\nrather than standing out from the surroundings. These criteria will generally be met when the site\nelevation is substantially lower than the adjacent public street(s), and the surrounding commercial\ndevelopment is at a higher elevation than the adjacent public street(s).\n2. The taller building does not unduly disrupt the character of a residentially-zoned neighborhood.\nH. A 5% reduction in maximum impervious coverage is required for each additional floor above 4\nstories. The resulting green areas are to be distributed around the taller building, not isolated in a portion\nof the site with low visibility in relation to the subject building. This 5% reduction is applicable to the\nimpervious coverage assigned to the tall building based on the applicable formulas for the minimum\nrequired lot size.\n4.2.9 Site Appearance Requirements\nA. Sites, buildings, signs, and landscaping shall be designed in accordance with the criteria and standards\ncontained in Section 8.7 Architectural and Design Review. Existing trees and hedgerows shall be\nincorporated into site design and preserved to the maximum extent possible. Street trees/landscaping\nshall be incorporated into landscaping plans. Buildings constructed with a visible metal exterior are not\npermitted. All building elevations that are visible from a public street must be attractively designed,\nwith windows and/or other architectural elements and features such that no visible elevation looks like\nthe back of a building.\nB. Historic structures shall be preserved and incorporated into site design to the maximum extent\npossible.\nC. Existing healthy trees of 6 inch caliper and greater (to be survey-located either singly or as groups)\nshall be incorporated into the site plan to the maximum extent possible. Similarly, significant stands\n(10 or more trees) of related species, or consistent scrub-shrub groupings occurring in front, side or rear\nyards shall be preserved whenever feasible. Welling or mounding are recommended techniques when\ngrade changes are required.\nD. Driveway lighting in close proximity to Buckland Road shall incorporate standard fixtures and poles in\norder to obtain a uniform lighting appearance along Buckland Road. The remainder of the drive-\nway/parking lot lighting shall incorporate standard fixtures (or equivalent) from the Gateway Lighting\nPlan.\nE.\nAll business, servicing, or processing, shall be conducted within completely enclosed buildings, with\nthe following exceptions:\n1. Off-street parking/loading;\n2. Seasonal outdoor dining (in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.15);\n3.\nOutdoor amenities normally conducted as accessory uses to a hotel, such as swimming pool and\npatio;\nPage 4-15\n"}, {"page": "54", "text": "ARTICLE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES\n4. Outside display of merchandise for sale on the interior part of a pedestrian environment such as in\na village-style shopping center, or a courtyard area with kiosks or market carts, where outside\nmerchandise display is an integral part of the theme and thus enhances the appearance of the site.\nThis section is not intended to allow outside display of merchandise typically sold inside retail\nstores in conventional shopping areas; rather, it is intended to encourage true pedestrian-oriented\nareas in a village atmosphere.\nF. Outside dining and display areas shall not occupy sidewalks intended for pedestrian passage and\naccess. Outside dining and display areas must be shown on the site plan and approved by the\nCommission.\nG. For the purpose of this Section, garden shops that are contained within walls shall be permitted even\nthough the enclosure does not have a partial or complete roof. The applicant may propose, and the\nCommission may accept, a ventilated wall similar in appearance to the rest of the building. A fence is\nnot a wall.\nH. Areas reserved for open space and set aside to meet impervious coverage requirements shall be\ndistributed throughout the site in such a manner that the land is visible (from public streets) and/or use-\nable (e.g., for pedestrian circulation, outdoor entertainment and cultural events, band shell, or arts/crafts\nshows).\nI.\nOutdoor storage is prohibited except as expressly permitted in paragraph 4.2.9.E.4 above.\nJ.

Items designated as\n'objectives' are not mandatory, but are stated in order to provide insight regarding the Town's design\nobjectives. Items designated as \"standards\" are mandatory. All design details are subject to Commission\napproval.\nA. Facades and Exterior Walls\nObjective: Facades should be articulated to reduce the massive scale and the uniform, impersonal\nappearances of retail buildings and provide visual interest. The intent is to encourage a more human scale\nthat South Windsor residents will be able to identify with their community.\nStandards:\n1. Facades greater than 100 feet in length, measured horizontally, shall incorporate wall plane\nprojections or recesses having a depth of at least 3% of the length of the facade and extending at\nleast 20% of the length of the facade. No uninterrupted length of any facade shall exceed 100\nhorizontal feet.\n2. Ground-floor facades that face public streets shall have arcades, display windows, entry areas,\nlawnings, or other architectural features along no less than 60% of their horizontal length.\nAlternatively, other pedestrian-attractive features such as benches, niches, plantings, and pavers,\nmay be used to create pedestrian interest, subject to Commission approval.\nPage 4-16\n"}, {"page": "55", "text": "ARTICLE 4 - COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES\nB. Detail Features\nObjective: Buildings should have architectural features and patterns that provide visual interest at the scale\nof the pedestrian, reduce massive aesthetic effects, and recognize local character. The elements in the\nfollowing standard should be integral parts of the building fabric, and not superficially applied trim or\ngraphics, or paint.\nStandards: Building facades must include a repeating pattern of at least two of the elements listed below or\nof\nother architectural features. At least 1 of these elements shall repeat horizontally. All elements shall\nrepeat at intervals of no more than 30 feet.\n1. Color change;\n2. Texture change;\n3. Material module change; or\n4. Expression of architectural or structural bay through a change in plane no less than 12 inches in\nwidth, such as an offset or reveal.\nC. Roofs\nObjective: Variations in rooflines should be used to add interest to, and reduce the massive scale of, large\nbuildings. Roof features should complement the character of adjoining neighborhoods.\nStandards: Roofs shall have no less than two of the following features:\n1. Overhanging leaves, extending no less than 3 feet past the supporting walls;\n2. Sloping roofs that do not exceed the average height of the supporting walls, with an average slope\ngreater than or equal to 1 foot of vertical rise for every 3 feet of horizontal run and less than or\nequal to 1 foot of vertical rise for every 1 foot of horizontal run;\n3. Three or more roof slope planes; or\n4. Other roof features.\n5. In addition, rooftop mechanical equipment must be set back from building edges, appropriately\nscreened and/or located SO the equipment is not visible from public streets.\nD. Materials and Colors\nObjective: Exterior building materials and colors comprise a significant part of the visual impact of a\nbuilding. Therefore, they should be aesthetically pleasing and, where appropriate, compatible with\nmaterials and colors used in adjoining neighborhoods.\nStandards: Predominant exterior building materials shall be high quality materials. These include, with- out\nlimitation:\n1. Brick;\n2. Wood;\n3. Sandstone;\n4. Other native stone;\n5. Textured concrete masonry units; and\n6. Glass.\nPage 4-17\n"}, {"page": "56", "text": "ARTICLE - COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES\nPredominant exterior building materials shall not include the following:\n1. Smooth-faced concrete block;\n2. Tilt-up concrete panels;\n3. Pre-fabricated steel panels; or,\n4. Fiberglass or metal (excluding metal roofs).\nFacade colors shall be low reflectance, subtle, neutral or earth tone colors. The use of high intensity\ncolors or fluorescent colors is prohibited.\nNeon tubing or similar lighting is an unacceptable feature for building trim or accent areas, unless a waiver\nis granted by the commission.\nE. Back and Side Facades\nObjective: All facades of a building should contribute to the pleasing scale features of the building and\nencourage community integration by featuring characteristics similar to the front facade.\nStandard: All building facades shall comply with the requirements of Section 4.2.9.A Facades and\nExterior Walls.\nF. Shopping Cart Management\nObjective: Shopping carts can become an unattractive facet of a retail operation when not actively man-\naged. Outside storage of carts and parking lots with shopping carts strewn around can detract from even the\nmost attractive building design.\nStandard: Any retail business that uses shopping carts outside of the building shall have a Commission-\napproved cart management plan. The management plan must specify the retail operation's cart\nmanagement program to prevent accumulation of carts in the parking lot. Shopping carts shall be stored in\na location and design approved by the Commission. For grocery stores as defined in paragraph 4.2.5.B of\nthese regulations, the management plan must require that the carts be returned to the approved cart storage\narea immediately after use by the customer. The approved management plan must be implemented. Failure\nto maintain the standards of the management plan will be subject to enforcement as a zoning violation.\n4.2.11 Access and Parking\nA. Access Management\nRegulation of vehicular access is necessary to maintain the efficient and smooth flow of traffic, to protect\nthe functional level and maximize the traffic capacity of Buckland Road. An access management plan and\nprogram has been developed to address:\n1. Limiting the number of driveways;\n2. Choosing driveway locations to reduce conflicts;\n3. Designing driveways to reduce conflicts and the severity of conflicts; and\n4. Requiring roadway improvements that reduce or control conflicts.\nAll sites within the Buckland Road Gateway Development Zone must be designed to incorporate all\napplicable access management practices and techniques to accomplish the above objectives. Access\nmanagement practices may include such considerations as:\nPage 4-18\n"}, {"page": "57", "text": "ARTICLE 4 - COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES\n1. Shared access between 2 adjacent lots;\n2. Consolidated access for contiguous lots;\n3. Alternative access via side streets; and\n4. Frontage roads.\nB. Streets\nAll streets to be dedicated to the Town shall conform to all applicable Town ordinances and regulations, including the\nPublic Improvement Specifications and the Subdivision Regulations.\nC. Off-Street Parking\nIt is the intent of this Regulation to create off-street parking that is creative and to achieve attractive,\ninnovative parking layouts that will accent and highlight buildings and features of the Buckland Road Gateway\nDevelopment Zone.\n1. The view of parking areas from public streets shall be minimized through the use of perimeter landscaping and\nberms in addition to any other requirements for parking area landscaping\ncontained in this regulation. Other landscaping elements such as decorative fencing, sculptures, fountains,\nstone walls, or attractive walkways and pedestrian spaces are highly encouraged.\n2. Off-street parking shall generally be distributed around buildings in order to ensure pedestrian\noriented/pedestrian friendly sites where pedestrians and the building architecture, rather than the automobile\nand the parking lot, are the primary focus Not more than one-third (33%) of the\nparking shall be located between the principal building and the public street. Corner lots shall have not more\nthan one-third (33%) of the parking located between the principal building and Buck- land or Oakland Road.\nThe second frontage street shall have not more than 25% of the parking located between the buildings and the\nsecondary street.

Parking areas that are screened from Buckland/Oakland roads by the principal building(s).\nC.\nParking distributed around three sides of the principal building(s), provided that not more than 33% of the\nparking is located between the building(s) and Buckland/Oakland roads.\nd. The Commission may, in its sole discretion, grant a waiver to the provisions of this section for creative,\ninnovate and outstanding parking lot design with features that cause the parking lot to become an integral\ndesign feature of the site. Such features could include (but are not limited to) curvilinear designs;\narchitectural pavement including pavers, stamped concrete; exceptional landscaping.\ne.\nEVSE Ready Spaces and EV Installed Spaces shall be provided as described in 6.4.10. Minimum Number\nof EVSE Parking Spaces and Appendix H Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment.\n3. No required front yard setbacks shall be used for parking or circulation (except for entrance drives to the\nsite).\nD. Landscaping Amount\n1. Parking lots located between a building and Buckland Road or Oakland Road (without any other intervening\nbuilding) shall provide at least 12% landscaped area. This landscaped area\nmay\ninclude islands between bays of parking, planted peninsula islands including peninsulas along the perimeter of\nthe parking area, other free-standing landscaped areas (with a minimum dimension of at least 8 feet in its\nnarrowest dimension), and any other area approved by the Commission.\nPage 4-21\n"}, {"page": "58", "text": "ARTICLE 4 - COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES\n(Not more than 2 peninsulas may be located back-to-back. The purpose of the peninsulas is to break\nup the parking lot.)

All other parking areas shall meet the landscaping requirements of Section 6.4.6 Parking Lot\nLandscaping.\nE. Landscaping Design\n1.\nIt is the intent of these regulations to allow the applicant to have flexibility in the design of\nparking areas. Parking area design is to take into account natural features whenever possible,\ngrading of the site, visibility of the site from adjacent public streets, and the even distribution of\nlandscaping throughout the parking area. The following are examples of possible layouts of parking\narea landscaping:\nParking Area Sample Layout - Diagram 1\nParking Area Sample Layout - Diagram 2\n2. Parking areas may be divided into individual bays (a bay is an aisle with a row of parking spaces\non each side of the aisle). Each bay must be separated from other bays by a landscaped island of at\nleast 8 feet in width the entire length of the bay. Terminal islands shall separate the bay from any\ndriveways or access ways. See Diagram 1. Note: the sole purpose of the parking diagrams is to\nillustrate parking lot landscaping and possible arrangement of bay, not to illustrate possible layout\nof parking in relation to building.\nPage 4-20\n"}, {"page": "59", "text": "ARTICLE - COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES\n3. Parking areas may be divided into individual areas connecting across bays. Such areas are to be\ndivided by landscaped islands at least 16 feet wide at every row of parking spaces. Such\nlandscaped islands shall occur at least every 10 parking spaces. It is not necessary that such islands\nalign with each other from bay to bay. See Diagram 2.\n4. Other alternative parking designs, including covered parking or multi-level parking, may be\napproved by the Commission in lieu of, or in addition to, the above designs when such alternative\ndesign is creative and uses unusual layouts or landscaping design to achieve attractive,\nunconventional parking areas.\nF. Loading Docks/Receiving Areas\n1. Loading docks/receiving areas shall not be visible from Buckland Road or residential zones.\nSufficient on-site vehicular maneuvering area must be provided; trucks destined to, or coming\nfrom, loading docks shall not require maneuvering movements within the public highway. The\nnumber of loading spaces shall be sufficient to accommodate the anticipated loading requirements\nof building users, which requirements shall be in accordance with industry practice, but not to\nexceed said requirement.\n2. No loading, trash removal or compaction, or other such operations shall be permitted between the\nhours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. unless the applicant submits evidence that sound barriers\nbetween all areas for such operations effectively reduce noise emissions to a level of 45 db,\nas\nmeasured at the lot line of any adjoining property. No truck deliveries or pickups are allowed\nbetween the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. Hours of truck deliveries or pickups for times\nbetween 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. may be allowed only as a Special Exception use if the\nCommission determines that the criteria in Section 8.4, Special Standards and Procedures, as well\nas the following criteria, are satisfied.\na. There shall be no truck delivery or pickups between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 5 a.m.\nb. A truck routing plan shall be submitted showing truck movements for the site that access the\nsite only from Buckland Road and Deming Street without passing by any residential\nbuildings within Evergreen Walk in the Buckland Road Gateway Development Zone or\nresidentially zoned properties.

That this zone is intended to encourage smaller sites to combine with other sites in order to provide\nlarger-scale sites and developments. As an incentive to promote combining of properties, a 5%\nimpervious coverage bonus will be granted for property consolidation per paragraph 4.1.7.D.\nE. That access management is required on all sites, in order to reduce the number of driveway cuts onto\nRoute 30 and/or other arterial streets to mitigate the deterioration of traffic flow generally caused by\ndriveways on arterial streets. Access management techniques include shared driveways (or provisions\nfor future shared driveways for the first site in an area), interior service drives, and other techniques\nincluded in South Windsor's Access Management Program.\nF. That all development be sensitive to environmentally regulated areas within the zone.

Architectural and site design criteria and guidelines will be as described in Section 8.7 Architectural\nand Design Review.\nB. Relationships to land uses in abutting zones and adjacent developments within the zone\n(compatibility) are important considerations that will be critically reviewed by the Commission.\nConcerns in this regard will include view sheds; buffers (vegetative and architectural); building scale,\nmassing, con- figuration and height; light spill; emissions (noise); use intensity/frequency; light/air\nobstruction; and signage.\nC. Building height shall be compatible with highway elevation unless applicant demonstrates to the\nCommission that building height is irrelevant in a specific area. Taller buildings are recommended\nwhere I-291 is above grade, SO that the traveling public is not looking down upon a building's roof.\nWhen this is unavoidable, the roof must be designed to be attractive from the highway; flat roofs are\nnot acceptable when below the I-291 grade and visible from the highway at any time of year. Taller\nbuildings are also expected to provide increased building setback from the street upon which they front.\nIn no instance shall a building exceed 5 stories or 60 feet, whichever is less.\nD. The Corridor Development zone includes extensive areas of regulated wetlands and utility\nreasements/rights-of-way. These areas will be incorporated into site planning to provide (as appropriate)\nmulti-use trails that traverse the corridor.\nE. All business, servicing, processing (except for off-street parking/loading) shall be conducted within\ncompletely enclosed buildings. Outdoor storage and/or activities may be allowed only as a Special\nException use if the Commission determines that the criteria in Section 8.4, Special Standards and\nProcedures, as well as the following criteria, are satisfied.\n1.\nOutdoor storage is NOT allowed for products and/or materials used in manufacturing,\nprocessing, packaging and/or assembly of components or goods for sale or distribution;\nconstruction businesses; or wholesale or retail sales (except garden/nursery centers accessory to\na permitted use). Outdoor storage, however, IS allowed as an accessory use to a product\ndistribution center, provided:\na.\nThe maximum allowable area of outdoor storage is no greater than 10% of the total site area;\nand\nb. Such outdoor storage area is appropriately screened from public streets by effective\narchitectural and/or landscape architectural elements, which may include, for example,\nextensions of building walls, plant materials, berms, fences, or a combination of one or more\nof these elements.\n2.\nOutdoor storage must be screened from public streets. The Commission may require that outdoor\nstorage also be screened from abutting properties.\n3.\nOutdoor activities must be screened from public streets and abutting properties unless the\nCommission determines that screening is not necessary because the outdoor activities do not\ndetract from the character of the development and the neighborhood.\nF.\nLoading docks shall generally not be visible from Route 30 or I-291.

Pavement Size\nContiguous pavement areas for parking (exclusive of islands) shall not exceed 1 acre, at which point a\nmajor island division will be required. \"Major island division\" is a planted median extending the longest\ndimension of the one-acre paved area and a minimum of 20 feet in width. Mounding is encouraged,\nprovided it does not interfere with sight lines.\nC. Parking in Yards\n1. There will be no parking permitted in required yards abutting Route 30 or I-291.\n2. Side and rear yard parking are encouraged for all business and industrial uses.\n3. Front yard parking, as the dominant parking area, will be considered for commercial and service-\noriented developments only.\n4.4.7 Pedestrian/Bicyclist Circulation\nSidewalks are encouraged between site buildings and parking areas. Sidewalks may be provided along at\nleast 1 side of private drives and linked with sidewalks on Route 30 where appropriate. Alternative\nsidewalks or pedestrian access ways located within a site are encouraged, provided that such alternative\nsidewalks interconnect to existing or future walkways on abutting properties. The applicant is encouraged\nto provide site interior walkways that link street/drive walks with existing or future multimodal trail\nsystems, such as that connecting Manchester Trail with Bissell Bridge.\n4.4.8 Fencing\nFencing presents a barrier to wildlife and tends to visually partition the environment, and, as such, is dis-\ncouraged except where required for security purposes. Fencing will be in accordance with requirements\nfor materials, height, setbacks and screen requirements. With the exception of special treatments that may\nbe architecturally related to the individual structure, fencing should be consistent throughout the site.\nBarbed wire fencing is prohibited. An applicant can request the installation of barbed wire by special\nexception in accordance with Section 8.7 and subject to the following criteria:\nInstallation of barbed wire fencing cannot be adjacent to or visible from the public way;\nDemonstration and/or justification of installation based on security needs;\nNo barbed wire fencing can be installed within 100 feet of a residential zone boundary;\nAny barbed wire fencing installed must be a minimum of 8 feet high; and\nCross razor wire (also called concertina razor wire) is prohibited.\nPage 4-21\n"}, {"page": "74", "text": "ARTICLE - COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES\n4.4.9 Conservation Easements\nThe I-291 Corridor Development zone includes extensive areas of regulated wetlands which, when\ncombined with other easements including wetland buffer areas, constitute a significant portion of the total\nacreage. In accordance with the overall development concept, the Town is seeking to acquire a\nconservation easement that will encompass the several discrete wetlands groups including various areas\nof non-wetland lands. These non-wetlands that are associated by vegetation with the regulated wetlands\nare essentially undevelopable because of their close proximity to the regulated wetlands and anomalous\nconfiguration.

The above may be waived by the Commission in cases where the\nproposed rail spur or siding will not, in the opinion of the Commission, cause undue noise or visual\ndisruption, or safety hazard, to abutting residential zones or uses. The Commission may require\nspecial screening and/or noise abatement measures for rail sidings.\n4.5.6 Building Height\nThe maximum building height is 50 feet/4 stories for any building that is at least 350 feet from a\nPage 4-36\n"}, {"page": "75", "text": "ARTICLE 4 - COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES\npublic street right-of-way and from any residential zone boundary (excluding dedicated public open\nspace), pro-vided, however, that any portion of such building located within 350 feet of the public\nstreet right-of-way or any building located in its entirety within 350 feet of the public street right-\nof-way shall have a maxi- mum height of 40 feet/2 stories.\nThe applicant may request and the Commission may grant a height waiver to increase the building\nheight to 75 feet/5 stories for a building or portion thereof located at least 350 feet from any public\nstreet and from any residential zone boundary, if the Commission determines that the site is suitable\nfor a taller building and that the character of the Industrial Zone is enhanced rather than diminished\nby a taller building. In order to qualify for a height waiver, the applicant must demonstrate that the\ntaller building con- forms with the following criteria:\n1. The taller building does not unduly disrupt the character of a residentially zoned neighborhood.\n2.\nRelationships to land uses in abutting zones and adjacent developments within the zone\n(compatibility) are important considerations that will be critically reviewed by the\nCommission. Concerns in this regard will include view sheds, buffers (vegetative and\narchitectural), building scale / massing / con- figuration / height, light spill, emissions (noise),\nuse intensity/frequency, light/air obstruction, and signage.\n3.\nA 5% reduction in maximum impervious coverage is required for each additional floor above\n50 feet/4 stories. The additional green areas are to be distributed around the taller building, not\nisolated in a portion of the site with low visibility in relation to the subject building.

The area bounded by Chapel Road, Burnham Street and Long Hill Road is generally characterized by\nexisting single-family residences, including historic structures, and vacant interior property, with many\nconstraints to development, such as wetlands, electric transmission easements, and I-291 itself. These\nconstraints generally limit the vacant land's suitability for residential development, yet the existing\ncharacter of that area generally precludes large-scale industrial and commercial development. In\nrecognition of these contrasting development characteristics, and in order to preserve the residential\nand historic character of the existing neighborhoods, the purpose of the RR/I-291 Overlay Zone is to\nallow the development of small-scale commercial and institutional uses that are compatible with the\nresidential character of the area in such characteristics as:\n1. Architectural character;\n2. General aesthetics of the site;\n3. Operational restrictions such as daytime operating hours; and\n4. Site and building scale and massing.\nB. The overlay zone is not intended to in any way limit or negate the uses permitted in the underlying\nzone.\nPage 5-10\n"}, {"page": "89", "text": "ARTICLE - OVERLAY ZONES\n5.4.2 General Concepts\nA. Permitted uses in this zone will be limited to those low-intensity, low-customer/client turnover uses\nthat can clearly demonstrate compatibility with residential uses without relying heavily on buffering\nand screening to achieve that compatibility (although buffering/screening will be required as\nappropriate). Uses with high-client turnover are not allowed because the higher trip generation is not\ncompatible with residential neighborhoods.\nB.\nArchitectural scale must be similar to the scale of the surrounding existing development, including\nbuilding height. Architectural design, including roof design, must be compatible with surrounding\narchitectural design.\nC. All development must exhibit a high standard of quality in construction detail, materials, and\nappearance.\nD. Site planning is an essential criterion. Sites developed under this zone are intended to be carefully\nplanned, both within the site's own boundaries and in relation to surrounding properties.\nE. All development will be sensitive to environmentally-regulated areas within the zone. Maximum\neffort will be made to retain and integrate significant natural features into the development proposal.\nF. In recognition that the RR/I-291 Overlay Zone permits commercial uses in a residential-character\nneighborhood, parking lot arrangement and landscaping must differ from traditional parking lots that\nhave large expanses of wide open pavement. Site driveways and parking areas will not be intrusive to\nthe existing residential neighborhoods. The location of the site driveway must be particularly sensitive\nto the surrounding land uses and must be chosen with care.\nG. Access management regulations shall be incorporated into the site plan where required.\n5.4.3 Permitted Uses\nAll uses shall require Special Exception approval.\n5.4.4 Prohibited Uses\nProhibited uses are all uses that do not meet the purpose and general concepts of this regulation. Retail\nsales and high-turnover uses with frequent customer arrivals and departures are prohibited.\n5.4.5 Site Appearance Requirements\nA. Sites, buildings and landscaping shall be designed in accordance with the criteria and standards con-\ntained in Section 8.7 Architectural and Design Review. Scale and massing of site buildings and\nstructures shall be compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.\nB. Architectural design shall be compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. Flat roofs are not per-\nmitted. Buildings visible from a public street must have the appearance of traditional wood or brick\nconstruction or facade. Buildings with metal facades are not permitted.\nC. Historic structures shall be preserved and incorporated into site design to the maximum extent\npossible.\nD.

Parking lots must be located out of view of the public street, either by location behind the\nprincipal building or by retaining an existing wooded area that completely screens the parking lot\nfrom the street.\n2. If located in view of the street, parking areas shall be divided into \"islands\" of parking spaces, with\nan \"island\" not to exceed 10 parking stalls. An island must be surrounded visually with separating\nlandscape elements including trees and bushes. Other landscaping elements such as decorative\nfencing, sculpture/fountains, stone walls, or walkways/pedestrian spaces (consistent with the\ncharacter of the surrounding neighborhood) are highly encouraged.\nB.\nMaximum efforts shall be made to create an unusual parking lot design that is aesthetically pleasing\nand contains significant landscaping elements. Alternative parking designs may be approved by the\nCommission in lieu of the island design when such alternative design is creative and uses unusual\nlayouts or landscaping design to achieve attractive, unconventional parking areas.\nC. Required front yards shall not be used for parking or circulation.\n5.4.7 Performance Standards\nA. Hours of operation\n1. Hours of operation shall be compatible with the residential neighborhood, and shall generally be\nlimited to weekdays during regular business hours. 'Regular business hours' are defined, for\npurposes of this regulation, to consist of Monday through Friday, 7:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. Any\nbusiness hours outside of regular weekday hours require advance approval from the Commission.\n2. External vehicle operations such as truck deliveries and refuse removal must not cause disruption\nto the residential character of the area. Deliveries, trash removal and other external business\noperations (such as sweeping of parking lots) are prohibited outside of the normal hours that such\noperations occur for the residential neighborhoods.\nPage 5-12\n"}, {"page": "91", "text": "ARTICLE - OVERLAY ZONES\nB.

While the Commission would like to encourage property owners to develop in accordance with the\nprovisions of this section, the CCOZ is an overlay zone where the property owner may choose whether\nto develop in strict accordance with all of the provisions of the underlying zoning district or in strict\naccordance with all of the provisions of this section.\nB. The CCOZ is intended to result in a mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly area with a 'sense of place'. Since\nthe creation of a 'village-type' setting requires careful attention to design and compatibility among a\nvariety of property owners and situations, excellence in site planning and architectural design is an\nessential criterion of the CCOZ. All developments shall be human scaled, pedestrian/\nfriendly/pedestrian oriented developments with pedestrian amenities. All developments shall be\ndesigned to be bicycle-friendly.\nC. As authorized by CGS Section 8-2j and as recommended in the Plan of Conservation and Develop-\nment, the CCOZ is hereby designated as a 'village district' where the Commission may regulate new\nconstruction, substantial reconstruction and rehabilitation of properties in view from public road- ways,\nincluding, but not limited to, (1) the design and placement of buildings, (2) the maintenance of views,\n(3) the design, paving materials and placement of roadways, and (4) other elements that the Commission\ndeems appropriate to maintain and enhance the character of South Windsor Center.\nD. Unless an alternative overall plan is found acceptable by the Commission, all development shall be\nsubstantially in accordance with the development concepts expressed for South Windsor Center in the\nPlan of Conservation and Development, including those for capacity corridors, character corridors,\nstreet sections, pedestrian and bicycle connections, development opportunities and open space/\nconservation areas.\n5.6.4 Pre-Application Discussion\nApplicants are encouraged to initiate a pre-application conference with the Commission to discuss the\nconceptual aspects of the proposed development and to prepare and present a conceptual plan for\ninformal consideration by the Commission. Neither the pre-application conference, the informal review of\nthe concept plan, nor the Commission's suggestions shall be deemed to constitute approval or denial of any\nportion of the application.\nPage 5-18\n"}, {"page": "97", "text": "ARTICLE 5 - OVERLAY ZONES\n5.6.5 Permitted Uses\nA.\nUses or activities requiring a special exception in accordance with the special permit considerations\nin Section 8.4.B and Section 5.6.12 of these regulations:\n1.\nConstruction of any new building or substantial reconstruction of any existing building in the\nCenter Core Overlay District;\n2.

The goal is to\ncompliment the rural flavor here, while recognizing land owners' potential need for commercial\nopportunities. The area will serve to transition from the more rural surroundings to the built-up sections of\nRoute 5 in East Windsor and in South Windsor southerly of the Scantic River.\n5.8.2 General Concepts\nA. While the Commission would like to encourage property owners to develop in accordance with the\nprovisions of this section, the R5NOZ is an overlay zone where the property owner may choose whether\nto develop in strict accordance with all of the provisions of the underlying zoning district, or in strict\naccordance with all of the provisions of this section.\nB. Given that this area serves as an entrance to South Windsor from the north, excellence in site planning,\nlandscape architecture, and building architecture is an essential element of the R5NOZ. All such\ndevelopments shall take into consideration travel speeds on the abutting highway and compatibility\nwith adjoining residential uses. Landscape architectural elements (e.g., berms and plantings) are thus\ncritical between proposed buildings, parking areas, and Route 5, and between buildings/parking lots\nand residences. Low Impact Development (LID) measures shall be incorporated into the site design.\nC. Locating of site driveways and parking areas must be sensitive and not intrusive to the existing\nresidences in the area.\nD. Access management regulations shall be incorporated into the site design where required.\n5.8.3 Pre-Application Discussion\nApplicants are encouraged to initiate a pre-application conference with the Commission to discuss the\nconceptual aspects of the proposed development and to prepare and present a conceptual plan for informal\nconsideration by the Commission. Neither the pre-application conference, the informal review of the\nconcept plan, nor the Commission's suggestions shall be deemed to constitute approval or denial of any\nportion of the plan.\n5.8.4 Permitted Uses\nA.

The Sullivan Avenue Mixed-Use Development Overlay Zone (SAMUD-OZ) shall be\nimplemented through zone change/general plan of development and special exception / site\nplan processes in accordance with Section 8.3 (Zone Change Standards and Procedures) of\nthese regulations. For the initial application, the zone change application map shall be\naccompanied by a general plan of development (see Section 8.6.3). The second application\nwill be for a special exception/site plan (see Section 8.6.2).\n2. The SAMUD-OZ is not intended, in any way, to limit or negate the uses permitted in the\nunderlying General Commercial Zoning District.\n3. The SAMUD-OZ is an overlay zone with its own set of requirements and restrictions. The\nintent of the SAMUD-OZ is that the requirements of the General Commercial underlying zone\n(including but not limited to dimensional requirements and design criteria), apply to any\nproposed mix-use development unless those requirements specifically conflict with a\nrequirement in the SAMUD-OZ, in which case the SAMUD-OZ requirement shall control.\n4. All SAMUD developments shall exhibit a high standard of quality in construction detail,\nmaterials, site design, and appearance.\n5. Site planning is an essential criterion. Sites developed under the SAMUD-OZ are intended to\nbe carefully planned, both within the site's own boundaries and in relation to surrounding\nproperties.\nPage 5-35\n"}, {"page": "116", "text": "6.

Where feasible, roof runoff shall be\ncollected and reintroduced to the groundwater table via infiltration devices where soils and water\ntable depths may permit. Energy dissipaters and flow spreading devices shall be used to discharge sheet\nflows over lawns. Storm runoff generated from parking and road pavements that carry sands, road salts,\noils, etc. are initially treated at catch basins where some heavy particulates are trapped in basin sumps,\nand then further treated in extended detention basins or engineered structures to remove more sediment,\noil, grease, and other pollutants.\nD. The applicant shall employ, as appropriate, the extended wet-bottom detention basin technique for\nmetering site-generated storm runoff prior to discharge to off-site drainage systems. Such basins should\nbe ultimately sized to accommodate more than 1 user. The applicant is encouraged to enter into an\neasement agreement with adjacent lots to create a shared-use detention facility.

To afford South Windsor innovative owner-occupied one-family dwellings that constitute well-\nplanned, functional, and aesthetically pleasing residential environments, and which by design are\ncompatible with abutting zones and uses;\n2. To increase the supply of affordable housing within the town; and\n3. To protect environmentally sensitive areas of town that are unprotected through other means.\nThe Commission encourages the use of open space as a buffer between the public and the developed are-\nas, with the developed areas clustered into the interior and the open space becoming a visual open space\nshared by the public (particularly when there is a natural feature that would enhance the buffer). The\ndevelopment should consist of clusters of buildings to give the appearance of small neighborhoods with\nopen space between the clusters.\n3.3.2 Establishment of Zone\nThe DRZ zone may be established after consideration of various factors, including, but not limited to the\nsupply of affordable housing in the town and those criteria outlined in Article 8 Zone Change, Special\nException and Site Plan Standards and Procedures.\n3.3.3 Form of Ownership/Occupancy\nA. Ownership in a DRZ development is limited to common interest community form of ownership. All\nland except that in the approved exclusive use area(s) shall be owned by the common interest com-\nmunity, or, at the discretion of the commission, environmentally sensitive land may be deeded to the\nTown of South Windsor or to a non-profit organization that will protect it in perpetuity.\nB. The development shall comply with Chapter 828 of the Connecticut General Statutes, i.e., Common\nInterest Ownership Act, and all other state and local common interest community regulations.\n3.3.4 Dwelling Size and Type\nA. The size of dwelling units shall not exceed 1400 square feet. An applicant may request a waiver of this\nprovision from the Commission for specific dwelling units after demonstrating good cause for such\nwaiver. Where a waiver is granted, the Commission may condition such waiver to ensure that the intent\nof these regulations is not compromised. A variety of sizes is desirable.\nB. Applicants may provide a variety of unit types. Affordable units shall be equally dispersed through- out\nthe development. Affordable units must have a mix of number of bedrooms, including three- bedroom\nunits. The applicant's site development plan shall show the mix of unit types.\nC. In addition to interior storage areas, each dwelling unit in a DRZ zone shall have 60 square feet\nexterior storage.\nPage 11-32\n"}, {"page": "269", "text": "Article 11- Appendices\n3.3.5 Area and Density Requirements\nA. There is no minimum parcel size. The suitability of the proposed parcel for the Designed Residence\nZone will be determined based upon the criteria enumerated previously. The parcel must consist of\ncontiguous acreage not divided by a public street. The parcel shall have at least 200 contiguous feet on\na\ntown-owned street, and the primary entrance must be located within the 200 feet of frontage. Where\nthe proposed number of units exceeds 65 feet, a secondary entrance may be required by the\nCommission. The entire parcel must be located in the proposed DRZ zone area.\nB. The minimum frontage requirement may be reduced by 1 foot for every 2 feet by which the\ndevelopment's front yard setback is increased; provided, however, that the frontage is not reduced to\nless than 100 feet. Where the increased setback/reduced frontage provision is used, no\npavement/parking areas/impervious areas shall be allowed within additional setback.\nC. The maximum number of units allowed is 80 units.\n3.3.6 Density Bonus\nA. The overall density of the development shall be 3 dwelling units multiplied by the net buildable acre-\nage of the parcel. Density bonuses as outlined below may be granted by the Commission upon\nsatisfaction of the appropriate requirements. All calculations of proposed density must appear on the\nGeneral Plan of Development, and are arrived at by multiplying the requested density by the net\nbuildable acreage (see Article 10 Definitions). In no case shall the allowable density exceed 4 units per\nacre of net buildable acreage.\nB. In order to meet the purposes of these regulations and to increase the supply of affordable housing in\nthe Town of South Windsor the following modifications in density shall be allowed providing that all\nother requirements of these regulations are met. In all cases the developer must show the Commission\nthe means by which these dwelling units shall remain affordable on resale as well as assure the\nCommission that the units will remain owner-occupied. Furthermore, when the density is increased, at\nleast half the required affordable units must be made affordable by decreasing the square footage of the\nunit, rather than leaving unfinished interiors.\nC. Density bonuses may be allowed in accordance with the following:\nTable 3.3.6A Density Bonuses\nD. In order to meet the purpose of these regulations and to protect environmentally sensitive land that may\nnot be protected under the authority of the Inland Wetlands Agency/Conservation Commission or other\nregulatory body of the Town, State, or Federal Government, the Commission may at its discretion\nincrease the allowable density to not more than 4 units per acre of net buildable acreage and/or reduce\nthe required percentage of affordable units, providing that the developer furnishes the Commission an\nacceptable method by which such land shall remain undisturbed over time.\nPage 11-33\nCELL (1, 1): \nPercentage of Affordable Units\nCELL (1, 2): \nAllowable Density\n(units per acre of buildable land)\nCELL (2, 1): \n15%\nCELL (2, 2): \n2.5\nCELL (3, 1): \n20%\nCELL (3, 2): \n3.0\nCELL (4, 1): \n25%\nCELL (4, 2): \n3.5\nCELL (5, 1): \n30%\nCELL (5, 2): \n4.0\n"}, {"page": "270", "text": "Article 11- Appendices\n3.3.7 Minimum Setbacks\nA.
