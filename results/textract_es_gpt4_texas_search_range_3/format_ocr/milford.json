A curb\ncut may be placed directly next to an existing curb cut on an adjacent parcel.\nAdditions to and Renovations of Existing Buildings\nNew additions to existing buildings should be harmonious with the built form of the\nsurrounding area. Construction of additions should seek to minimize the loss of historic\nmaterials on exterior walls. The building finish used for the addition should be similar to\nthe existing structure in material, quality, color and dimension. If an addition will have\ntoo overwhelming an impact upon the architecture and/or the historic qualities of an\nexisting building, visual separation of the addition and the existing structure should be\nemployed to protect the nature of the building.\nThe scale of an addition should be at a scale compatible with the existing building.\nDamaged or deteriorated significant architectural features should be repaired rather\nthan replaced. If replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material\nbeing replaced.\nFaux historic treatments for additions are discouraged. The architecture of additions\nshould complement the existing character while still remaining a product of their own\ntime period.\nAppendix B: MILFORD CENTER DESIGN DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT - DESIGN GUIDELINES\nPage B-3\n"}, {"page": "390", "text": "Signage\nGeneral\n1.\nAll signage shall be well-crafted and maintained, professionally made and\nsecurely and appropriately attached to buildings.\n2.\nFlashing signs, roof signs, and excessively large projecting signs that interrupt\nthe visual continuity and harmony of the street are not permitted.\n3.\nProjecting signs and banners attached to building fa\u00e7ades should be placed no\nlower than twelve (12) feet above grade.\n4.\nSignage should be at a scale that does not overwhelm the building to which it\nis attached.
