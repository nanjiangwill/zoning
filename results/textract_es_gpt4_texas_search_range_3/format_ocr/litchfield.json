NON-CONFORMING USES, BUILDINGS/STRUCTURES, LOTS\n1. Purpose. As required by Section 8-2 of the Connecticut General Statutes, these regulations do not prohibit the\ncontinuance of any non-conforming use, lot, building or structure legally existing at the time of the adoption of these\nregulations or any relevant amendment thereto. It is the public policy of the Town, and the intent of these regulations,\nthat the degree of non-conformity in any non-conforming situations be eliminated, as quickly as justice allows.\n2. General Rule Concerning Change of Non-conforming Situation to Conform. Once a non-conforming situation, or any\nportion thereof, has been changed so that it conforms to these regulations, that situation or portion thereof shall not revert\nto or again become non-conforming.\n3. Change of Non-conforming Use. The Commission shall determine whether a non-conforming use has changed such that\nits status is altered from a non-conforming use to an unlawful use. In determining whether an activity represents such a\nchange in non-conforming use, consideration shall be given to the following three factors:\ni.\nThe extent to which the new use reflects the nature and purpose of the original non-conforming use;\nii.\nAny difference in the character, nature and kind of use involved;\niii.\nAny substantial difference in effect upon the surrounding area resulting from the differences in the activities\nconducted on the lot.\n4. Enlargement of Buildings Containing a Non-conforming Use. A building containing a non-conforming use in a residence\ndistrict shall not be enlarged in total floor area or volume, except as approved by the Commission in accordance the\nfollowing standards and requirements:\ni.\nThe Commission shall find that the proposed enlargement will not have significant additional adverse impact\nupon the surrounding land uses and the neighborhood\nii.\nThe applicant shall provide a statement from the assessor or copies of the assessor's records documenting that\nthe building has not been expanded since the date it became non-conforming. Where the building was previously\nexpanded the applicant shall document that the expansion was approved by the Town and the total floor area\nof the expansion does not exceed 25% of the total floor area of the building which is devoted to the non-\nconforming use.\niii.\nThe total floor area of the enlargement shall not exceed 25% of the total habitable floor area legally dedicated\nto the non-conforming use at the time it became non-conforming (including any previously granted approval for\nexpansion).\niv.\nEnlargements shall be allowed only to an existing building containing a non-conforming use. No new building\nor structure containing a non-conforming use shall be permitted.\nV.\nThe total maximum building coverage of the lot with the enlargement shall not exceed 25% of the total lot area.\nvi.\nOnly portions of the building or structure that meet the yard and set back and other dimensional requirements of\nthese regulations shall be eligible for a variance and the location and dimensions of the enlargement shall\nconform to the requirements herein.\nvii. Off-street parking spaces meeting the requirements of these regulations shall be provided on the lot.\n5. Enlargement or Additions. No non-conforming building or structure shall be altered, enlarged or extended in any way that\nincreases the area or space of that portion of the building or structure which is non-conforming. This prohibition includes\nbut is not limited to second-story additions or similar additions to the height or bulk of that portion of a building which is\nnon-conforming.\n6.\nChange to a Non-conforming Sign. A non-conforming sign is a sign existing prior to the effective date of these regulations\n(or pertinent amendment thereto) which does not meet the size, height, location, lighting or other requirements of these\n54\n"}, {"page": "56", "text": "The Litchfield Zoning Regulations\nNON-CONFORMING USES, BUILDING/STRUCTURES LOTS\nEffective 1/15/2019\nregulations. A non-conforming sign may be continued or repaired provided such repair does not result in an increase in\nthe area of such sign or otherwise increase its non-conforming condition. Once a non-conforming sign is removed it shall\nnot be reestablished. Where the commission approves a change from one non-conforming use to another non-conforming\nuse the new use may continue to utilize the existing sign space. A change in the location of sign space may be permitted\nby the Zoning Board of Appeals only where there is a reduction of the existing sign area and where, in the opinion of the\nZoning Board of Appeals , the proposed signage will be more suitable for the lot and for the surrounding neighborhood.\n7.\nImprovements and Repair. A non-conforming building or structure may be improved, repaired or reconstructed as made\nnecessary by wear and tear or deterioration, however substantial improvements to buildings or manufactured homes in\nthe FP-O district shall be subject to the requirements of the district.\n8. Casualty. Any non-conforming building or structure which has been damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, explosion, act\nof nature or public enemy may be restored and used in the manner in which it exists and was used prior to such damage.\nAny such restoration within the FP-O district shall meet the standards and conditions for said district.\n9.\nChanges While Permit is Open. Nothing in this section shall require any change in the plans, construction, or designated\nuse of a building for which a building permit has been issued in accordance with these regulations, provided construction\ncommences prior to the adoption of these regulations or any relevant amendment thereto, and is completed within one\nyear of adoption of same.\n10. Abandonment of a Non-conforming Use. The continuance of any non-conforming use, building or structure existing at\nthe time of the adoption of such regulations shall not be prohibited. A non-conforming use shall not be terminated solely\nas a result of nonuse for a specified period of time without regard to the intent of the lot owner to maintain that use.\nWhenever a non-conforming use of land, building or structure or any portion thereof, has been abandoned, such non-\nconforming use shall not thereafter be reestablished and all future use shall be in conformity with these regulations.\n55\n"}, {"page": "57", "text": "The Litchfield Zoning Regulations\nSPECIFIC STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS\nEffective 1/15/2019\nSPECIFIC STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS\nSee Table of Contents\n56\n"}, {"page": "58", "text": "The Litchfield Zoning Regulations\nSPECIFIC STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS\nEffective 1/15/2019\nA.
