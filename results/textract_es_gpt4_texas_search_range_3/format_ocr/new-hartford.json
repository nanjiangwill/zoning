BMPs include simple nonstructural methods, such as good\nhousekeeping and preventive maintenance. BMPs may also include structural modifications, such as the\ninstallation of Bioretention measures. BMPs are most effective when used in combination with each\nother, and customized to meet the specific needs (drainage, materials, activities, etc.) of a given\noperation.\nBioretention - A practice to manage and treat Stormwater Runoff by using a specially designed planting soil bed\nand planting materials to filter runoff stored in a shallow depression. The areas consist of a mix of\nelements each designed to perform different functions in the removal of pollutants and attenuation of\nStormwater Runoff.\nCatch Basin Inserts - A structure, such as a tray, basket, or bag that typically contains a pollutant removal medium\n(i.e., filter media) and a method for suspending the structure in the catch basin. They are placed directly\ninside of existing catch basins where Stormwater flows into the catch basin and is treated as it passes\nthrough the structure.\nCatch Basin - A structure placed below grade to conduct water from a street or other paved surface to the storm\nsewer.\nCisterns - Containers that store larger quantities of rooftop Stormwater Runoff and may be located above or\nbelow ground. Cisterns can also be used on residential, commercial, and industrial sites. See also Rain\nBarrel.\nDisturbance - Any clearing, grubbing, filling, grading, excavating, constructing, depositing, or removing material\nthat could leave the ground surface subject to the potential for accelerated erosion or an increase in the\nrate of runoff.\nDeep Sump Catch Basins - Storm drain inlets that typically include a grate or curb inlet and a sump to capture\ntrash, debris and some sediment and oil and grease. Also known as an oil and grease Catch Basin.\nDry Detention Pond - Stormwater basin designed to capture, temporarily hold, and gradually release a volume of\nStormwater Runoff to attenuate and delay Stormwater Runoff peaks. Dry Detention Ponds provide water\nquantity control (peak flow control and stream channel protection) as opposed to water quality control.\nAlso known as \"dry ponds\" or \"detention basins\".\nFilter Strip - A strip or area of vegetation for removing sediment, organic material, nutrients and chemicals from\nrunoff or wastewater. They are typically located downgradient of Stormwater outfalls and level spreaders\nto reduce flow velocities and promote infiltration and filtration.\nNew Hartford Zoning Regulations\n131\n"}, {"page": "142", "text": "SECTION 6.8\nEffective October 1, 2016\nSTORMWATER MANAGEMENT STANDARDS\nGrass Drainage Channels - Traditional vegetated open channels, typically trapezoidal, triangular, or parabolic in\nshape whose primary function is to provide non-erosive conveyance, typically up to the ten (10) year\nfrequency design flow. They provide limited pollutant removal through filtration by grass or other\nvegetation, sedimentation, biological activity in the grass/soil media, as well as limited infiltration if\nunderlying soils are pervious.\nGroundwater Recharge - The process by which water that seeps into the ground, eventually replenishing\ngroundwater Aquifers and surface waters such as lakes, streams, and the oceans. This process helps\nmaintain water flow in streams and wetlands and preserves water table levels that support drinking water\nsupplies.\nGroundwater Recharge Volume (GRV) - The post-development design recharge volume (on a storm-event basis)\nrequired to minimize the loss of annual pre-development\nGroundwater Recharge. The GRV is determined as a function of annual pre-development recharge for site-specific\nsoils or surficial materials, average annual rainfall volume, and amount of impervious cover on a site.\nHydrodynamic Separators - A group of Stormwater treatment technologies designed to remove large particle\ntotal suspended solids and large oil droplets, consisting primarily of cylindrical-shaped devices that are\ndesigned to fit in or adjacent to existing Stormwater drainage systems. The most common mechanism\nused in these devices is vortex- enhanced sedimentation, where Stormwater enters as tangential inlet\nflow into the side of the cylindrical structure. As the Stormwater spirals through the chamber, the\nswirling motion causes the sediments to settle by gravity, removing them from the Stormwater.\nInfiltration Practices - Stormwater Treatment Practices designed to capture Stormwater Runoff and infiltrate it\ninto the ground over a period of days, including infiltration trenches and infiltration basins.\nLow Impact Development (LID) - Low Impact Development is a site design strategy intended to maintain or\nreplicate predevelopment hydrology through the use of small- scale controls integrated throughout the\nsite to manage runoff as close to its source as possible.\nNon-Routine Maintenance - Corrective measures taken to repair or rehabilitate Stormwater controls to proper\nworking condition. Non-Routine Maintenance is performed as needed, typically in response to problems\ndetected during routine maintenance and inspections.\nOil/Particle Separators - Consist of a subsurface structure with one (1) or more chambers designed to remove\ntrash and debris and to promote sedimentation of coarse materials and separation of free oil (as opposed\nto emulsified or dissolved oil) from Stormwater Runoff. Oil/Particle Separators are typically designed as\noff-line systems for pre- treatment of runoff from small impervious areas, and therefore provide minimal\nattenuation of flow. Also called oil/grit separators, water quality inlets, and oil/water separators.\nPermeable Paving Materials - Materials that are alternatives to conventional pavement surfaces and that are\ndesigned to increase infiltration and reduce Stormwater Runoff and pollutant loads. Alternative materials\ninclude modular concrete paving blocks, modular concrete or plastic lattice, cast-in-place concrete grids,\nand soil enhancement technologies. Stone, gravel, and other low-tech materials can also be used as\nalternative for low traffic application such as driveways, haul roads, and access roads.\nPorous Pavement - Porous Pavement is similar to conventional asphalt or concrete but is formulated to have\nmore void space for greater water passage through the material.\nNew Hartford Zoning Regulations\n132\n"}, {"page": "143", "text": "Effective October 1, 2016\nSECTION 6.8\nSTORMWATER MANAGEMENT STANDARDS\nPretreatment - Techniques used in Stormwater management to provide storage and removal of coarse materials,\nfloatables, or other pollutants before the Primary Stormwater Treatment Practice.\nPrimary Stormwater Treatment Practices - Stormwater Treatment Practices that are capable of providing high\nlevels of water quality treatment as stand-alone devices: can be grouped into five (5) major categories -\nStormwater Ponds, Stormwater Wetlands, Infiltration Practices, filtering practices, and Water Quality\nSwales.\nRain Barrels - Barrels designed to retain small volumes of runoff for reuse for gardening and landscaping. They\nare applicable to residential, commercial, and industrial sites and can be incorporated into a site's\nlandscaping plan. The size of the Rain Barrel is a function of rooftop surface area and the design storm to\nbe stored. Rain Barrels capture runoff that would otherwise be lost to storm drains, divert water to the\nlandscape, and conserve tap water. For large Rain Barrels, see \"Cistern.\"\nRain Garden - Functional landscape elements that combine plantings and a specially designed planting soil bed in\ndepressions that allow water to pool for only a few days after a rainfall then be filtered by and slowly\nabsorbed by the soil and plantings. Rain Gardens improve water quality by reducing the sediment,\nnutrients, bacteria, and chemicals from flowing into water bodies.\nResponsible Party - The person or organization responsible for construction and/or maintenance of a Stormwater\nFacility.\nRoutine Maintenance - Maintenance performed on a regular basis to maintain proper operation and aesthetics.\nSecondary Stormwater Treatment Practices - Stormwater treatment practices that may not be suitable as stand-\nalone treatment because they are either not capable of meeting the water quality treatment performance\ncriteria or have not yet received the thorough evaluation needed to demonstrate the capabilities for\nmeeting the performance criteria.\nSite Stormwater Management Plan - A Plan in accordance with Section C below describing the potential water\nquality and quantity impacts associated with a development project both during and after construction.

TELECOMMUNICATION POLICY\nA.\nStatement of Purpose\nThe Town of New Hartford recognizes that wireless communication services are an important part of the daily lives\nof many people. The Town wishes to allow for the availability of adequate wireless communications service in\nNew Hartford while striving to find the least obtrusive means of having such services available.\nB.\nBasic Program\nThere are two ways that wireless telecommunications services are regulated in Connecticut:\nthe Connecticut Siting Council regulates wireless telecommunications towers and associated facilities,\nthe Planning and Zoning Commission regulates non-tower telecommunications facilities.\nThese policy preferences are intended to provide guidance to wireless telecommunications providers, the\nConnecticut Siting Council (CSC), and the Planning and Zoning Commission (PZC) in terms of the siting of new\nwireless telecommunications facilities (both tower and non-tower).\nThe Town of New Hartford intends to carefully review applications for wireless telecommunications facilities\n(whether to the CSC or the PZC) that may affect the community or its residents.\nWhen the Town is notified (as required) of a pending application to the CSC for a wireless telecommunications\ntower, it is the intent of the Town to schedule a public informational meeting where the wireless\ntelecommunications provider can explain the need for and the impact of the proposed wireless\ntelecommunications tower and associated facilities. Based on the input received at this meeting and other\ninformation collected, the Town of New Hartford will prepare and provide testimony to the CSC for use during the\npermitting process.\nC.\nBasic Policy Preferences\nThe Town of New Hartford seeks to encourage or require the siting of wireless telecommunications facilities in\nways that will:\nAllow for facilities which are found to be the least visually obtrusive.\nEstablish locations least disruptive to the public health, safety, and welfare and consistent with the Plan of\nConservation and Development.\nProtect the town's visual quality and minimize any adverse visual impacts through proper design, siting,\nand screening.\nSafeguard the community,\nMinimize potential damage to adjacent properties.\nRestrict the Height to that needed to establish opportunities for co-location of multiple carriers.\nProvide for the orderly removal of abandoned antennas and towers.\nAppendix 16\n"}, {"page": "203", "text": "Effective October 1, 2016\nAPPENDIX\nD.\nSpecific Policy Preferences For Towers\nThe Town of New Hartford requests that wireless telecommunications providers and the CSC consider the\nfollowing issues in considering any application for telecommunications facilities in New Hartford:\n1.\nLocation\na. Towers should be located to serve areas lacking adequate wireless telecommunication service\nthat have been identified by the CSC.\nb. Applications should include a review of Alternate locations and Alternate technologies.\nC.\nIn order to minimize visual impacts, more short towers providing capacity in smaller geographic\nareas are generally preferred over fewer tall towers providing service over a larger geographic\narea.\nd.\nIf a tall tower is considered necessary, it should allow for co-location of multiple carriers,\nincluding emergency services, within the service area.\ne.\nParties wishing to locate telecommunications towers within New Hartford should fly a balloon\nfrom the site at the proposed tower location so that visual impacts may be evaluated from\nvarious locations.\n2.\nProtection of Important Resources\na. The location should preserve the integrity of environmentally sensitive areas including unique\nwildlife habitats, historic, and archaeological resources.\nb.\nA location within or adjacent to any officially designated historic areas and any resource on the\nNational Register of Historic Places should be avoided.\nC. There should be no detrimental impact to any scenic area, vista, ridgeline, or significant geologic\nor natural features within the Town, especially those noted in the Plan of Conservation and\nDevelopment.\nd.\nViews from any designated scenic roads should be protected.\ne.\nThe use of public areas including parks and recreational facilities should not be compromised.\n3.\nDesign Considerations\na. Towers should include an adequate fall zone that will protect public safety.\nb. The use of stealth technologies should be employed whenever possible.\nC.\nSignage and/or lighting should not be permitted except what may be clearly necessary for public\nsafety.\nd.\nSite planning standards should include minimizing impervious surfaces, avoiding soil erosion and\nrunoff problems, maintaining natural Buffers, providing for security, and safe access\nmanagement.\n4.\nPermitting Considerations\na.\nProvisions should be made for removal of the tower if it is no longer being used as was originally\npermitted.\nAppendix 17\n"}, {"page": "204", "text": "APPENDIX\nEffective October 1, 2016\nAPPENDIX 5.
