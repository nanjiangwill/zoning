The intent of\nthe district is to preserve rural character. Land uses in the rural use district areas are not\nserved and have no plans to be served by municipal water and sewer. Agriculture\noperations are a large presence in the RU District. See Exhibit 1.\n2.\nRelationship to Roads. While Arterial and Collector Roads exist in the RU, they are sparsely\nlined by development. Open Space corridors provide primary character determinants of the\ndistrict and shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable through the regulation of\nusage, site development, and design standards.\n3.\nRelationship to the Natural Environment. The primary development issue to be addressed\nin RU is the cohesion of the natural and built environment noting the primary goal of\npreserving the natural Landscape. This Section addresses this primary objective by limiting\nand directing on-site development intrusions that would affect various natural resources.\nAnother focus is the preservation of agricultural lands and uses.\n4.\nDevelopment Flexibility.

The Commission may allow for off-street parking in the Historic Preservation Overlay\nZone to be provided at eighty percent (80%) of the requirements of Section 10 of these\nRegulations if it can be documented that:\n1. The proposed uses have significantly different peak usage periods,\n2. The proposed uses will share trips with adjacent uses sufficiently to reduce\nparking demand or\n3. Off-street public parking exists within five hundred (500) feet of the proposed site.\nB. Parking Layouts and Paving Materials: Large areas of pavement surrounding Buildings\nremove a structure from its historical context and detract from the visual integrity of\nthe architecture. Parking areas should be located at the rear of the Building, if possible,\nwith provisions made for handicapped or special needs as necessary. Avoid large\nunrelieved areas of asphalt paving through landscaping, screening and terracing.\nThough access from the rear of Buildings to parking lots may be required, main\nentrances in most cases should continue to be located in the front of Buildings. If rear\nparking is not possible, parking areas should be located on the sides of Buildings, with\nproper landscaping and screening. Alternatives to asphalt paving, such as stone pavers,\ncan be used effectively in parking areas and on walks.\nC. Alternative surface treatments for Driveways and parking areas may be approved by the\n77\n"}, {"page": "78", "text": "Effective date: January 15, 2015\nCommission if the alternative treatment is documented to be technically adequate,\nrepresents sound engineering principles, and is satisfactory to the Town Engineer.\nD. Shared (common) Driveways may be utilized for access to the site where cross-\neasements have been recorded.\nE. Buffering and landscaping for sites in the Historic Preservation Overlay Zone must be\ndemonstrated to be consistent with or an enhancement to existing landscaping and/or\nvistas. Stone walls are a feature of Colchester's Landscape and should be maintained\nand restored where possible. Fencing, when used, should respect the scale and\nproportions of surrounding materials and Landscape features. Trees form an important\nnatural feature of the environment, and in many instances the older ones have\nhistorical significance in themselves, and should be preserved if possible, consistent\nwith the health of the tree.\n7. Signage\nSigns play an important role in defining the character of architecture and are especially\nimportant in commercial Buildings which rely on their Signs as a means to locate and\nadvertise business. Signs should relate to the pedestrian scale of their surroundings in\nColchester. They should be compatible with the Building's style and materials; lettering and\ncomposition should relate to the architectural style. Signs should be scaled and located to\ncomplement the Building's composition and architectural detail and avoid covering or\nobscuring significant architectural detail or features. They should consist of materials and\ncolors appropriate and compatible with the Facade design and materials. The removal\nof\nsigns whose designs are inappropriate to the architecture can dramatically improve the\nappearance of a Building. Older signs of historic or artistic value shall be retained and\nrestored. This can include a large range of styles and types, including Signs painted on\nBuildings, early advertisements and early 20th-century Neon Signs.\n9.2\nAQUIFER PROTECTION\n9.2.1\nAquifer Protection Zone (APZ)\nA.\nPurpose, Statement of Intent - The purpose of this Regulation is to protect and preserve\nGround Water quality within Stratified Drift Aquifers which are existing or are potential\npublic drinking water supplies.
