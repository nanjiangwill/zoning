Subsequently the city has updated\nthe Zoning Ordinance on an annual basis with indexing provided by Municipal Code Corporation.\nThe Zoning Ordinance was republished in its entirety by Municipal Code Corporation in 2003. The Zoning\nOrdinance will be updated by supplements published by Municipal Code Corporation. Each replacement\nsupplement will carry a supplement number, starting with No. 1, at the bottom left of the page.\nThe Zoning Ordinance is divided into articles which are then divided into sections. The pages of this volume\nare numbered with a two-part system with the article number as a prefix and a sequential numeral as the section\npart. The Code Comparative Table and the Index at the end of the volume carry their own prefix designations.\nThe republication of this volume was under the direct supervision of Robert S. Hornyak, Editor, and credit is\ngratefully given to other members of the publisher's staff for their able assistance throughout the project.\nMUNICIPAL CODE CORPORATION\nTallahassee, Florida\nSUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE\nThe table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been\nconsidered for codification in each supplement.

The specific\npurpose of these districts is to stabilize and preserve the low-density residential character of these areas to the\nmaximum possible extent. To this end the use of land and buildings within these areas is limited primarily to single-\nfamily homes. The particular character, size and surroundings of these areas create little need for the location\nwithin their boundaries of further such non-residential uses as generally support a low-density residential area,\nand the location of any further such uses within these areas would undesirably limit or diminish the number of\nhomes in them. It is hereby found and declared that these regulations are necessary for the protection of these\nareas and that their protection is essential to the maintenance of a balanced community of sound residential areas\nof diverse types.\nAll RS-2 Districts are subject to the general provisions for residence districts set forth in Article IV as well as to all\nother provisions of this ordinance.\nUses permitted.

BUSINESS AND INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS\nARTICLE V. BUSINESS AND INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS\nSection 41. Description and purpose of business and industrial districts.\nThe Business and Industrial districts contained in this zoning ordinance are established to provide for the\nmost rational and orderly separation of land uses according to their function in the city, and to fulfill the other\npurposes of zoning. The regulations herein adopted are hereby found and declared to be appropriate to New\nHaven and in accordance with a comprehensive plan designed for the continued vitality and development of the\ncity. The following statements of description and purpose outline the main functions of these districts in the zoning\nplan.\nBusiness A Districts-Genera Business. These districts serve several functions. They provide central\nconcentrations of convenience goods and services for one or more neighborhoods, supplemented by more\nscattered stores for such goods and services within the neighborhoods provided for under a special provision of\nthe regulations for residence districts. They provide comparison shopper's goods, specialty goods, amusements\nand numerous services for less than a citywide market. And they also provide locations for small businessmen with\na city-wide market who cannot operate in the downtown area. The predominant purpose of all these functions is\nretail trade.\nBusiness A-1 Districts-Neighborhood Center Mixed Use. These districts serve as the commercial heart of\ntheir neighborhood, are of modest scale and pedestrian orientation, and seek to preserve and restore the historic\narchitecture and urban pattern of the city. The emphasis is on neighborhood goods and services rather than\ncomparison shopping, with a preference for smaller pedestrian-oriented, storefront retail, dinning, and other\nappropriate uses. They are intended as mixed-use districts with a mixture of ground floor retail, small offices, and\nupper story residential dwellings. Buildings are oriented to the street, parking requirements are reduced and\nparking maximums established to encourage walkability and community over automotive-related sprawl. New\ndevelopment is required by form requirements and design guidelines to conform to the neighborhood context, to\nimprove the retail character of the street as a neighborhood center, and to promote the health, safety and well\nbeing of residents by reducing sources of public nuisance and encouraging physical activity and community\ninteraction and involvement.\nBusiness A-2 Districts-Villag Center Mixed Use. These districts serve distinct mixed-use communities\nwoven into the larger tapestry of New Haven. Parking is reduced and density is increased to encourage\ndevelopment of neglected or vacant buildings into pedestrian-oriented storefront retail, dining, and other\nappropriate uses. Upper story residential dwellings are encouraged along commercial strips and ground floor\nresidential dwellings are encouraged on side streets. Height limits are maintained to prevent over-development,\nbut the district otherwise does not restrict property owners' ability to employ a range of architectural styles.\nBusiness B Districts-Automotive Sales. These districts follow a deliberate policy which recognizes the\nimportance of automotive sales to the city and further recognizes that such sales can perform their function in the\nbest and most integrated manner by concentration in certain areas of the city. Establishments for the sale of new\nvehicles, and for the sale of large numbers of used vehicles, are concentrated in these areas, from which non-\nrelated uses are excluded in order to assure the maximum development of automobile sales and related uses.\nBusiness C Districts-Marine. These districts exist to separate out certain waterfront areas which have-and\nare encouraged to be-a mix of water-dependent public access, recreational boating, public and private marinas,\ncommercial and recreational fishing, community based, water related activities and waterfront residential\nenvironments.\nNew Haven, Connecticut, Zoning\nCreated: 2021-04-06 13:10:00 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 27)\nPage 71 of 211\n"}, {"page": "72", "text": "Business D District-Central Business. This district comprises the main downtown section of the city, known\nin planning terms as the Central Business District (CBD). Here are concentrated activities that have primarily a\ncitywide and regional function: large stores offering comparison shopper's goods, specialty stores, business\nservices, banks, offices, theaters, hotels and government buildings. Land use is intensive and this intensity of uses\nis one of the main determinants of the vitality of the Central Business District. It is the purpose of these regulations\nto encourage such intensity of use and to exclude activities which have a negative effect upon the proper\nfunctioning of the downtown area.\nBusiness D-1 Districts-Central Business/Residential. These districts include appropriate downtown areas\nwhich have concentrations of historic structures suitable for both residential and commercial use. This district\nconcentrates residential uses at high density mixed with activities that have both a city-wide and district-wide\nfunction: small stores offering comparison shopper's goods, specialty stores, business services, offices and\nentertainment uses. The use of land is intensive, but respects the historic character of existing historic structures.\nIt is the purpose of these regulations to encourage preservation of existing historic structures, conversion of\nexisting structures to residential use, high intensity of use, and to exclude activities that have a negative effect\nupon the proper functioning of National Register Historic Districts or of the larger downtown.\nBusiness D-2 Districts-Central Business/Medical. This district Includes appropriate areas in and around the\ncity's hospitals and medical centers having high density medical institutional uses including hospitals, clinical,\nlaboratory or bioscience research space, patient care medical offices, and supportive accessory uses, with\npedestrian-friendly ground floor retail uses in some buildings. The district allows intensive use of land for such uses\nsubject to site plan approval to further the city's policy of encouraging dense development of institutional uses\nwithin concentrated areas in and around the Central Business District while maintaining a human-scale\nstreetscape. It is the purpose of these regulations to allow such intensity of hospital, medical, research and medical\ninstitutional uses in combination with street-level retail uses encouraging pedestrian connections between the\nmedical areas and adjacent neighborhoods and business districts, and to exclude uses which are incompatible with\nor would have a negative effect upon the functioning of hospital, medical and research and medical institutional\nuses.\nBusiness D-3 Districts-Central Business/Mixed-Use. These districts in the urban core are reserved for\nintensive development, including multi-story and mid and high rise buildings. They provide for mixed uses,\nincluding hospital outpatient clinics, other medical clinics, biotechnology research centers, high and medium\ndensity residences, offices, and commercial uses, including retail shops and restaurants. These districts also\nconnect the city's central business and medical and educational districts with each other and with the city's\ntransportation center at Union Station. The Central Business/Mixed Use districts are pedestrian, bicycle and transit\nfriendly. Uses on the ground floors of nonresidential and mixed use buildings that face public rights-of-way in\nthese districts should include retail and active uses that are in part or in whole transparent from sidewalks and\nstreets.\nBusiness E Districts-Wholesale and Distribution. These districts furnish goods and services that are mainly\nused in support of retail trade for the city and the region. The principal activities located here are wholesaling,\nwarehousing, transportation, heavy business services, distribution, and some incidental processing. Such functions\nare generally located in such a position that they can support the Central Business Districts and at the same time\nconcentrate their heavy traffic requirements near the main arteries for movement of goods and services.\nCommercial Gateway Districts. The purpose of the Commercial Gateway District (CGD) is to encourage the\ndevelopment of a complementary mixture of appropriately intensive commercial and higher-density residential\nland uses that serve as strong gateways to Downtown. CGDs are intended to be pedestrian-friendly, livable, urban\nneighborhoods that link to Downtown and provide a transition to surrounding lower-density residential uses.\nSpecifically, regulations for CGDs seek to foster the revitalization of historic commercial corridors; encourage\nprivate investment; encourage the development of safe, efficient, user-friendly pedestrian, bike and transit\nsystems; and, improve the functional and visual quality of development.\nCreated: 2021-04-06 13:09:57 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 27)\nPage 72 of 211\n"}, {"page": "73", "text": "CGDs are intended to spur innovative and sustainable development of complementary, transit-supportive\nresidential and commercial uses. The scale and density enable housing for households with diverse incomes, and\nemployment opportunities. New development will be designed to foster street-level activity through land use,\nsite\nand building layout, and the provision of pedestrian amenities and improvements that create an inviting, safe and\nvibrant sense of place. Parking will be sufficient to accommodate residents and employers but will not detract\nfrom transit use or the pedestrian realm.\nThe following sub-district of the CGD zone is established to enable unique design standards within this\ndistinct CGD zone.\nCGD-Whalley Ave.: This sub-district extends from the intersection of Howe Street and Whalley Avenue\nnorth along Whalley Avenue to the intersection of Pendleton Street and Whalley Avenue. It includes all parcels in\nthe specified corridor that abut Whalley Avenue and those between Whalley Avenue and Goffe Street as shown on\nthe Zoning Map. In 2019, Whalley Ave, is a wide boulevard dominated by automobiles and automobile-centric\nuses. It is the intent and vision of this sub-district to create a continuous building wall with diverse uses, and to\nimprove the public realm for pedestrians, bike and transit users through redevelopment and infill.\nIndustry L Districts-Ligh Industry. These districts, in common with other business and industrial districts,\nare regulated by a set of performance standards prescribing upper limits for nuisance factors such as noise and\nsmoke. Industries are permitted which keep within those limits, as well as business uses which generally support\nand are integrated with other uses in such districts. Further development of residences is prohibited from these\ndistricts and also from Industry H and Business E Districts, in order to conserve the supply of heavy commercial and\nindustrial land and to prevent residences from being established under strongly adverse conditions. Industry L\nDistricts are characterized in general by less intensive development and fewer outdoor uses than Industry H\nDistricts.\nIndustry M Districts-Light Industry/Marine. These districts are regulated by a series of land use controls and\nperformance measures in areas of the city with both waterfront and industrial characteristics with limited freight\ntransportation connections and/or located in close proximity to a residential neighborhood. Uses allowed within\nthe district are both marine and light industrial in nature.\nIndustry H Districts-Heavy Industry. These districts have many regulations similar to those in Industry L\nDistricts. They are apt. however, to be more intensively developed and to contain older and heavier industries.\nThese districts also contain vacant industrial land with a high potential for development. Fewer business uses are\ncontained in these districts than in Industry L Districts. Less restriction is placed upon outdoor uses, although such\nuses must conform to the performance standards which apply to other industries. Certain uses, with established\nfunctions in the economy but having a well-known nuisance potential, are permitted only in Industry H Districts\nand there only by special exception.\n(Ord.

In order to promote, protect and preserve the health, safety and general welfare\nof the people of the City of New Haven, it is hereby declared to be in the public interest that the\naccumulation, collection, transportation, processing, and disposal of solid waste be regulated. The City\nof New Haven is authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 22a-208a to regulate, through zoning, land usage for\nsolid waste disposal.\nSolid waste facilities are disproportionately concentrated in New Haven, particularly in the IH district,\nadjacent to residential neighborhoods, public recreation areas, food establishments, and small\nbusinesses. Concentrations of waste facilities can attract and generate many problems for\ncommunities, including objectionable noise, odor, litter and traffic. Diesel fumes and dust can degrade\nair quality and aggravate allergies and other health problems existing in the affected communities. The\nproblem is compounded by the increasingly-regional nature of these facilities, and the trend towards\nlarger and larger facilities. Accordingly, it is the policy of the City that the burden of fulfilling the need\nfor solid waste facilities shall not fall disproportionately on any community and that the construction of\nnew solid waste facilities as defined in section 46(h)(2) a through i hereof shall not be permitted within\nthe limits of the City of New Haven.\n(2) Definitions.\na.\nSOLID WASTE.

These districts exist to distinguish and preserve areas of the city which are unique\nfor their historical and architectural values and which therefore promote the educational, cultural, and general\nwelfare of the public through their continued existence. Towards this end, a historic district commission has been\nestablished to regulate the manner in which a building or structure may be erected, altered, arranged, restored,\nmoved or demolished within an historic district. Any such action requires the approval of said commission. (See\nCity of New Haven ordinance entitled An Ordinance to Establish an Historic District and an Historic District\nCommission for the City of New Haven, effective June 11, 1970.) Such values as are present in so designated areas\nare not readily classified within existing district regulations and are accordingly given a distinct classification in\naddition to the existing district classifications so as best to serve the interests of the city and the region.\nIntent. It is the intent of this ordinance to safeguard the heritage of the city, to stabilize and improve\nproperty values in such districts, foster civic beauty, promote the educational, cultural, economic, and general\nwelfare of the City of New Haven through the preservation and protection of the distinctive characteristics of\nbuildings, places, and districts, associated with the history of or indicative of a period or style of architecture of\nhistoric interest within the City of New Haven, and to provide that modification shall remain in harmony with the\ngeneral purpose and intent of the ordinances.

SITE REQUIREMENTS\nSection 60. Stormwater management plans.\n(a)\nPurpose and authority. Increased development without proper consideration of stormwater impacts can be a\nsignificant source of pollution to Long Island Sound, its tributaries, and other waters of the state. The state's\nwater resources are valuable natural, economic, recreational, cultural, and aesthetic resources. The\nprotection and preservation of these waters is in the public interest and is essential to the health, welfare,\nand safety of the citizens of the City of New Haven. It is, therefore, the purpose of this ordinance to protect\nand preserve the waters within New Haven from nonpoint sources of pollution through the proper\nmanagement of stormwater flows and minimization of inputs of suspended solid, pathogens, toxic\ncontaminants, nitrogen, and floatable debris to these flows.\n(b) Definitions.\nAquifer: Geologic formation, group of formations, or part of a formation that contains sufficient saturated,\npermeable materials to yield significant quantities of water to wells and springs.\nBMPs-best management practices: Techniques or structural devices that are effective practical ways of\npreventing or reducing pollution.\nFirst inch of rain: The first inch of rainfall during a single event.\nGroundwater: Water found beneath the ground surface that completely fills the open spaces between\nparticles of sediment and within rock formations.\nImpervious surface: Material or structure on, above, or below the ground that does not allow precipitation or\nsurface water to penetrate directly into the soil.\nSediment: Solid material, either mineral or organic, that is in suspension, is transported, or has been moved\nfrom its site or origin by erosion.\nSite: A single parcel, together with any adjacent waters, which is the subject of an application for zoning\napproval, coastal site plan review, or an inland wetlands permit.\nTrash hood: Feature in a catch basin which traps debris such as litter and keeps it from being discharged from\nthe catch basin.\nUrban stormwater runoff: Precipitation that falls onto the surfaces of roofs, streets, parking lots, roads, and\nthe grounds of developed areas. Urban precipitation is not absorbed by the ground or retained in its surface, but\ncollects and runs off, carrying a wide variety of pollutants such as oil-based contaminants, heavy metals (copper\nand lead), nutrients, and bacteria.\n(c)\nApplication requirements. A stormwater management plan shall be included as a part of any application for\nzoning approval (including but not limited to special permit and special exception), coastal site plan review,\nor an inland wetlands permit where:\n1Editor's note(s)-Ord.

Where there is difficulty or unreasonable hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of\nthe zoning ordinance, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall have power in a specific case to vary the\napplication of any provision of the ordinance, if such variance will be in harmony with the general\npurpose and intent of the ordinance and if the public health, safety and general welfare will be served\nand substantial justice done.\n(2)\nSpecial treatment of usevariances. It is recognized that variances of the use regulations in the zoning\nordinance present special problems not occurring in the case of variances of other types, and that the\ncourts have carefully defined the scope of the board's powers with respect to use variances. Therefore,\nthe board shall not grant any use variance under paragraph (1) above unless:\na.\nThe zoning regulations allow no reasonable use to be made of the property in question for\nreasons peculiar to the property and not applicable to the area as a whole;\nb.\nThe use proposed is the minimum variance necessary in order to allow a reasonable use of the\nproperty; and\nC.\nThe use will not impair the essential character of the area or the objectives of the comprehensive\nplan of the City.\n(3)\nConditions.

The development and execution of a comprehensive zoning\nordinance is based upon the division of the city into districts, within which the use of land and structures and\nthe bulk and location of structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however,\nthat there are certain uses and features which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be distinctly\nclassified or regulated in a particular district or districts, without consideration, in each case, of the impact of\nsuch uses and features upon neighboring uses and the surrounding area, compared with the public need for\nthem at particular locations.

The zoning enforcement officer shall be kept informed by the City\nClerk of pending petitions.\n(2)\nIn passing upon any such petition, the City Plan Commission shall take into account the various factors\nfavoring and disfavoring a change, such as, but not limited to, the following:\na.\nErrors in the existing ordinance, changes that have taken place in the city and in patterns of\nconstruction and land use, the supply of land and its peculiar suitability for various purposes, the\neffect of a map change on the surrounding area, the purposes of zoning and the comprehensive\nplan of the City of New Haven;\nb.\nWhether some other method or procedure under the zoning ordinance is more appropriate; and\nC.\nIn the case of a map change, the size of the area involved. As a general policy, the City Plan\nCommission shall not consider favorably any petition which would result in a total contiguous\narea (separated only by streets, and excluding the area of streets) of less than two acres in the\ncase of a residence district, less than one acre in the case of a Business District, or less than four\nacres in the case of an Industrial District.\n(e)\nSpecial permits-Statement of purpose. The development and execution of a comprehensive zoning\nordinance is based upon the division of the city into districts, within which the use of land and structures and\nthe bulk and location of structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however,\nthat there are certain uses and features which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be distinctly\nclassified or regulated in a particular district or districts, without consideration, in each case, of the impact of\nsuch uses and features upon neighboring uses and the surrounding area, compared with the public need for\nthem at particular locations. Such uses and features are therefore treated as special permits.\n(1)\nSpecial permit defined. A land use permitted when the City Plan Commission finds that the standards\nfor the use as contained within this Ordinance have been met. Only those uses designated as needing a\nspecial permit in section 42: Use Table and in Table 1: Permitted Uses in Residential Districts may be\npermitted by special permit.\n(2) Finding required. Special permits shall be granted only where the City Plan Commission finds that the\nproposed use or feature or the proposed extension or substantial alteration of an existing use or\nfeature is in accord with the public convenience and welfare after taking into account, where\nappropriate:\na.\nBurden of proof. A special permit shall not be considered an entitlement, and shall be granted by\nthe Commission only after the applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission\nthat all ordinance requirements are met.\nCreated: 2021-04-06 13:10:01 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 27)\nPage 194 of 211\n"}, {"page": "195", "text": "b.\nOrdinance compliance.
