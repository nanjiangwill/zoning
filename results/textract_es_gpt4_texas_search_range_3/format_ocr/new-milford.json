For the purposes of these regulations, the designation of any building, structure,\ngroup of structures or natural feature or site, as a historical structural or site, by any local,\nstate or federal agency, shall be prima facie evidence that the same is a town landmark.\nSection 090-030\nPermitted Uses\nThe Zoning Commission may permit any use or combination of uses in a Town\nLandmark District which would be permitted in any Residential Zone (including the\nMulti-Family Residential Zone) or in any B-1 Zone in the Town of New Milford,\nprovided that the Commission finds that such a use would be beneficial to and consistent\nwith the orderly development of the town.\nSection 090-040\nApplication Requirements\n1.

Guidelines for Applying Standards for Rehabilitation\nRehabilitation means the process of returning a property to a state of utility, through\nrepair or alteration, which makes possible an efficient contemporary use while preserving\nthose portions and features of the property which are significant to its historic,\narchitectural and cultural values.\na. Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property,\nwhich requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or site and its\nenvironment, or to use a property for its originally intended purpose.\nb. The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building structure or site and\nits environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic\nmaterials or distinctive architectural features should be avoided, when possible.\nC.\nAll buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of their own\ntime. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to create an earlier\nappearance shall be discouraged.\nd. Changes, which may have taken place in the course of time, are evidence of the\nhistory and development of a building, structure or site and its environment.\nThese changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this\nsignificance shall be recognized and respected.\ne. Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship, which\ncharacterize a building, structure or site, shall be treated with sensitivity.\nf. Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired, rather than replaced,\nwherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should\nmatch the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other\nvisual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be\nbased on accurate duplications of features, rather than on conjectural designs or\nthe availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or\nstructures.\ng. The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means\npossible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic\nbuilding materials shall not be undertaken.\nh. Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological\nresources affected by or adjacent to any project.\nNew Milford Zoning Regulations\n- 81 -\nJune 20, 2018\n"}, {"page": "82", "text": "i.\nContemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not\nbe discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant\nhistorical, architectural or cultural material, and such design is compatible with\nthe size, scale, color, material and character of the property, neighborhood or\nenvironment.\nj.
