You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Single-family Residential 2\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-2\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: max building height, max height, area and bulk requirements, dimensional requirements, lot and building requirements, area requirements, height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input.

The masonry guidelines set forth in this chapter are intended to provide a minimum\nstandard for the exterior construction of certain buildings.\n(A) Calculating masonry percentage. Where this chapter specifies a minimum percentage of masonry construction, that\npercentage shall be calculated by considering the entire surface area of the specified wall(s) less any and all glazing,\nwindows, and doors. The percentage shall be calculated from the remaining surface area after subtracting the area of any\nand all glazing, windows, and doors.\n(B) Structures inherent to specific zoning designations. The percentage of masonry required on a structure shall be\ngoverned by the masonry requirements for the zoning designation that the structure is specifically inherent to, i.e., the\nmasonry requirements for a single-family residential home built in a non-residential zoning designation shall be governed by\nthe requirements for the residential zoning designation, not the non-residential designation.\n(C) Placement of required masonry. Upon determination of the minimum required amount of masonry construction, the\ndesigner may at the designer's discretion design the structure such that any of the exterior walls are constructed with a\npercentage of masonry, provided the sum of the masonry on all of the exterior walls is equal to the total required percentage\nof masonry as calculated.\n(D) Exemptions. The following structures are exempt from the masonry requirements of this chapter:\n(1) Accessory structures 200 square feet or less; or accessory structures not visible from a public right-of-way;\n(2) Any building that is situated 350 feet or more from the public right-of-way(s) that border the parcel;\n(3) Temporary portable classrooms installed on public school grounds;\n(4) Manufactured homes; modular homes; and recreational vehicles.\n(E) Variances.\n(1) Exceptions to this section requirements may be considered by the City Council, as applicable, based only on the\nfollowing:\n(a) Architectural design and creativity;\n(b) Compatibility with surrounding developed properties;\n(c) Other extenuating circumstances.\n(2) In granting any variance, the City Council shall determine that a literal enforcement of the regulations will create an\nunnecessary hardship or practical difficulty on the applicant; that the situation causing the unnecessary hardship or practical\ndifficulty is unique to the affected property and is not self-imposed; that the variance will not injure and will be wholly\ncompatible with the use and permitted development of adjacent properties; and that the granting of the variance will be in\nharmony with the spirit and purpose of the ordinance.\n\n\nNEW PAGE 71\n(F) Nonconforming buildings.\n(1) Where a lawful building exists at the effective date of the adoption or amendment of this section and said building\ncould not be built under the terms of this section, it may continue so long as it remains lawful, subject to the following\nprovisions:\n(a) Such a building may not be enlarged by more than 25% of its existing foundation footprint unless the entire\nbuilding is brought into conformity with the masonry requirements of this chapter.\n(b) The exterior walls of such a building may not be modified, altered, or enlarged in a way which increases its\nnonconformity unless the modification, alteration, or enlargement is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.\n(2) Should a nonconforming building be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50% of its replacement cost\nat\nthe time of destruction, it may be rebuilt to the same footprint exempt from the masonry requirements provided a building\npermit for the reconstruction is secured within 90 days of the destruction of the original structure.\n(Ord. 15-0818B, passed 8-18-2015)\nZONING DISTRICTS\n\u00a7 155.145 ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS AND BOUNDARIES.\nFor the purpose of regulating and restricting the use of land and the erection, construction, reconstruction, altering, moving\nor use of buildings and structures, the city is divided into zoning districts, as follows:\n(Ord. 09-0721, passed 7-21-2009)\n\u00a7 155.146 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.\nThe location and boundaries of the various zoning districts are shown on the official zoning map. The zoning official will\npromptly make any changes to the map as directed by the City Council. The provisions of an ordinance establishing a\ndistrict, amending a district classification, or amending a district boundary shall control over any conflicting information\nshown on the official zoning map.
