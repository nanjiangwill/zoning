You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Mobile home-manufactured housing\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MH\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: max building height, max height, area and bulk requirements, dimensional requirements, lot and building requirements, area requirements, height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed!

Description: This district is primarily intended for multifamily dwellings consisting of duplexes, townhouses, row houses, apartments, and\nother similar medium density designs, along with related religious, educational, and recreational facilities normally required to provide the basic\nelements of a balanced and attractive neighborhood. The purpose of the medium density residential district is to provide for a higher density\nresidential district with a more diverse mixture of residential and associated land uses. In order to accommodate higher densities, a greater use of\nopen space and recreational areas should be incorporated into developments in this district. Projects in this district are primarily intended for\nlocation along or near arterial streets to accommodate the higher traffic generation of uses in the district. These areas are intended to be separated\nand protected from the encroachment of land use activities which do not perform a function necessary to sustain the residential environment.\nInternal stability, attractiveness, order, efficiency, security, and the maintenance of property values are encouraged by the provision of adequate\nlight, air and open space for dwellings and related facilities and through consideration of the proper functional relationship of these various\nelements.
