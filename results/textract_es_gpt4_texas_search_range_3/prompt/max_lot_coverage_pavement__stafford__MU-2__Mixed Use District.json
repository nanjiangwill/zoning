You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Mixed Use District\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MU-2\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage_pavement\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: lot coverage by impervious surfaces, lot coverage, impervious surface, coverage, maximum imperv. coverage, maximum impervious coverage. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer.

District MU-2 is established to accommodate mixed uses through the strict enforcement of\nperformance standards that will encourage quality development and redevelopment of large scale mixed\ncommercial, light industrial and residential uses on lands that are currently undeveloped, or are candidates\nfor redevelopment, located in the city.\n(b) Application and procedure. An application for a District MU-2 shall be made to the planning and zoning\ncommission in the same manner that an application for any amendment to the ordinance is made and shall\nbe processed according to the procedure in this section. As in the instance of new subdivision platting, a pre-\nplanning conference is required as set out in City of Stafford's Subdivision Ordinance preparatory to the\nfiling of the application for a District MU-2. The city council, after recommendation by the planning and\nzoning commission and after public hearing and proper notices to all parties affected, may authorize the\ncreation of a MU-2 on sites of 100 acres of more.\n(c) Procedure for establishing standards. In approving the development plan and the ordinance establishing the\nDistrict MU-2, the city council shall after recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, specify\nsuch maximum off-street parking and loading standards within the limits of those specified in the districts\nfor the specified usage involved as is appropriate for the development. The city council shall, after\nrecommendation of the planning and zoning commission establish the standards for height, yards, signs,\nbuilding space, site coverage, access, screening walls, landscaping, building area, open space, pedestrian\nways, public or private streets or alleys to be observed in the District MU-2 and such standards shall be\nspecified in the ordinance establishing the district.\n(d) Development schedule.\n(1) An application for a District MU-2 shall be filed with the planning and zoning commission and be\naccompanied by a development schedule indicating the approximate date on which construction is\nexpected to begin and the rate of anticipated development to completion. The development schedule, if\nadopted and approved by the city council, shall become part of the development plan and shall be\nadhered to by the owner, developer, his successors and assigns in interest.\n(2) The building official shall report annually to the planning and zoning commission, the actual\ndevelopment accomplished in the District MU-2 as compared with the development schedule.\n(3) The planning and zoning commission, if in its opinion, the owner or owners of property are failing or\nhave failed to meet the approved schedule, may, with city council approval, initiate proceedings under\nthis section to amend the zoning map or the District MU-2 by removing all or part of the District MU-2\nfrom the zoning district map and placing the area involved in another appropriate zoning district. Upon\nthe recommendation of the planning and zoning commission and good cause shown by the owner and\ndeveloper, the city council may also extend the development schedule or adopt such new development\nschedules as may be indicated by the facts and conditions of the case.\nabout:blank\n180/286\n\n\nNEW PAGE 181\n6/2/23, 8:58 AM\nStafford, TX Code of Ordinances\n(e) Development plan required. An application for a District MU-2 shall include and be accompanied by a\ndevelopment plan which shall become a part of the amending ordinance and shall be referenced on the\nzoning district map. Changes in the development plan shall be considered the same as changes in the zoning\ndistrict map and shall be processed as required in this section except that changes of detail which do not\nalter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property and which do not alter the\nuses permitted or increase the density, floor area ratio, height or coverage of the site, or which do not\ndecrease the off-street parking ratio, or reduce the yards provided at the boundary of the site, as indicated\non the approved development plan or are subdivisions of land in accordance with the city's subdivision\nordinance, may be authorized by the planning and zoning commission. Any applicant may appeal the\ndecision of the planning and zoning commission to the city council for review and decision as to whether an\namendment to the District MU-2 ordinance shall be required. The development plan shall include:\n(1) A plat, prepared by a registered surveyor or engineer, showing proposed public or private street or alley;\nbuilding sites or building lots; any area proposed for dedication or reserved as parks or parkways;\nplaygrounds; utility easements; school sites; street widening, street changes, and the points of ingress\nand egress from existing public streets and defining boundaries and topography with a contour interval\nof not less than two feet, or spot grades where the relief is limited.\n(2) Where multiple types of land use are proposed, a land use plan delineating the specific areas to be\ndevoted to various uses shall be required.\n(3) Where building complexes are proposed, a site plan showing the location of each building and the\nminimum distance between buildings, and between buildings and property line, street line and/or alley\nline shall be submitted. For buildings more than one story in height, except single-family and two family\nresidences, elevations and/or prospective drawings may be required in order that the relationship of the\nbuildings to adjacent property, open spaces and to other features of the development plan may be\ndetermined. Such drawings need only indicate the heights, number of floors, and exposures for access,\nlight and air.\n(4) Where off-street loading is required, a plan indicating the arrangement and provisions shall be\nsubmitted. Such a plan may be presented as a ratio of off-street parking and off-street loading area to\nbuilding area when accompanied by a typical example indicating the feasibility of the arrangement\nproposed and the areas where the example would be applied are dimensioned on the drawing of the\nentire site. Any special traffic regulation facilities proposed or required to assure the safe function of the\ncirculation plan shall also be shown.\n(5) A designation of the maximum building coverage of the site shall be indicated upon the site land.\n(6) Screening and landscaping plans shall be required where such treatment is essential to the proper\narrangement of the development in relation to adjacent property. Such plan shall, when required,\ninclude screening walls, ornamental planting, playgrounds, wooded areas to be retained, lawn and\ngardens, if such are determined to be necessary by the planning and zoning commission.\n(7) Any or all of the required features may be incorporated on a single drawing if such drawing is clear and\ncapable of evaluation by the city planning and zoning commission and interpretation by the building\nofficial.\n(8)\nabout:blank\n181/286\n\n\nNEW PAGE 182\n6/2/23, 8:58 AM\nStafford, TX Code of Ordinances\nEvery District MU-2 approved under the provisions of this section shall be considered as an amendment to the\nordinance as applicable to the property involved.
