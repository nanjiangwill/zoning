Buffer yards shall be required according to Table 6 below to provide a separation between land uses\nof different categories to eliminate or minimize, to the extent practicable, potential nuisances from\nlitter, noise, glare, signs, unsightly buildings, and parking areas, to provide spacing to reduce adverse\nimpacts from noise or odor, or danger from fire or explosion, and to enhance aesthetics and the\nvisual image of the city.\nb. Responsibility for buffer yards. Buffer yards shall be required as set forth in Table 6 of subsection (d)\nof this section when:\n1.\nThe main use of a lot is changed to a different category of use, and the new category of use is\ndifferent than the category of the main use of an adjacent lot; or\n2.\nabout:blank\n217/286\nCELL (1, 1): \nNumber of Parking Spaces\nCELL (1, 2): \nNumber of Trees\nCELL (2, 1): \n1-10\nCELL (2, 2): \n1\nCELL (3, 1): \n11-20\nCELL (3, 2): \n2\nCELL (4, 1): \n21-30\nCELL (4, 2): \n3\nCELL (5, 1): \n31-39\nCELL (5, 2): \n4\nCELL (6, 1): \n40+\nCELL (6, 2): \nMinimum 162 square foot landscape area for the\nfirst 40 spaces (4 trees) + minimum 25 square feet\nlandscape area and one tree for each additional\n20 spaces or fraction thereof\n\n\nNEW PAGE 218\n6/2/23, 8:58 AM\nStafford, TX Code of Ordinances\nA lot is developed for an industrial use and such lot is adjacent to a lot, developed or undeveloped, that is designated\nfor single-family or multifamily use. The owner of the lot upon which the main use is changed, or upon which an\nindustrial use is developed as above provided, shall establish and maintain the buffer yard in accordance with this\nsection if buffer yard has not already been established.\nC. Screening of buffer yards. A masonry screening wall of not less than eight feet in height shall be\nerected between light industrial type uses and any other use and continuously maintained at the\nperimeter of the required buffer yard and no portion of such buffer yard shall be located outside of\nsuch screening. Provided, however, no screening shall be required in a buffer yard separating the\nfronts of two front yards, unless the required buffer yard is in the front yard of a multifamily\nresidential use.\nd. Landscaping of buffer yards. To further minimize noise, drainage hazards, glare, or other potential\nincompatibilities between the different categories of uses, at least 20 percent of any required buffer\nyard shall be landscaped, with a pervious surface, which 20 percent landscaped area shall be located\nimmediately adjacent to the required screening wall that is adjacent to the use that is of the lesser\nintensity of the two uses. The remainder of the buffer yard shall not be developed or constructed\nupon except for on-site parking, provided the buffer yard and parking facilities within it meet all\napplicable performance standards and landscaping provisions of this section.\nTable 6.
