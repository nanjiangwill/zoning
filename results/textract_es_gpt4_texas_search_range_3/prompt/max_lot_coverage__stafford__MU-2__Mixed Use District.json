You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Mixed Use District\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MU-2\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: max lot coverage, building coverage, lot coverage, pervious surface, building area as % of lot, coverage, maximum lot coverage. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer.

An application for a District MU-2 shall be made to the planning and zoning\ncommission in the same manner that an application for any amendment to the ordinance is made and shall\nbe processed according to the procedure in this section. As in the instance of new subdivision platting, a pre-\nplanning conference is required as set out in City of Stafford's Subdivision Ordinance preparatory to the\nfiling of the application for a District MU-2. The city council, after recommendation by the planning and\nzoning commission and after public hearing and proper notices to all parties affected, may authorize the\ncreation of a MU-2 on sites of 100 acres of more.\n(c) Procedure for establishing standards. In approving the development plan and the ordinance establishing the\nDistrict MU-2, the city council shall after recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, specify\nsuch maximum off-street parking and loading standards within the limits of those specified in the districts\nfor the specified usage involved as is appropriate for the development. The city council shall, after\nrecommendation of the planning and zoning commission establish the standards for height, yards, signs,\nbuilding space, site coverage, access, screening walls, landscaping, building area, open space, pedestrian\nways, public or private streets or alleys to be observed in the District MU-2 and such standards shall be\nspecified in the ordinance establishing the district.\n(d) Development schedule.\n(1) An application for a District MU-2 shall be filed with the planning and zoning commission and be\naccompanied by a development schedule indicating the approximate date on which construction is\nexpected to begin and the rate of anticipated development to completion.

Upon\nthe recommendation of the planning and zoning commission and good cause shown by the owner and\ndeveloper, the city council may also extend the development schedule or adopt such new development\nschedules as may be indicated by the facts and conditions of the case.\nabout:blank\n180/286\n\n\nNEW PAGE 181\n6/2/23, 8:58 AM\nStafford, TX Code of Ordinances\n(e) Development plan required.

Any applicant may appeal the\ndecision of the planning and zoning commission to the city council for review and decision as to whether an\namendment to the District MU-2 ordinance shall be required. The development plan shall include:\n(1) A plat, prepared by a registered surveyor or engineer, showing proposed public or private street or alley;\nbuilding sites or building lots; any area proposed for dedication or reserved as parks or parkways;\nplaygrounds; utility easements; school sites; street widening, street changes, and the points of ingress\nand egress from existing public streets and defining boundaries and topography with a contour interval\nof not less than two feet, or spot grades where the relief is limited.\n(2) Where multiple types of land use are proposed, a land use plan delineating the specific areas to be\ndevoted to various uses shall be required.\n(3) Where building complexes are proposed, a site plan showing the location of each building and the\nminimum distance between buildings, and between buildings and property line, street line and/or alley\nline shall be submitted. For buildings more than one story in height, except single-family and two family\nresidences, elevations and/or prospective drawings may be required in order that the relationship of the\nbuildings to adjacent property, open spaces and to other features of the development plan may be\ndetermined. Such drawings need only indicate the heights, number of floors, and exposures for access,\nlight and air.\n(4) Where off-street loading is required, a plan indicating the arrangement and provisions shall be\nsubmitted. Such a plan may be presented as a ratio of off-street parking and off-street loading area to\nbuilding area when accompanied by a typical example indicating the feasibility of the arrangement\nproposed and the areas where the example would be applied are dimensioned on the drawing of the\nentire site. Any special traffic regulation facilities proposed or required to assure the safe function of the\ncirculation plan shall also be shown.\n(5) A designation of the maximum building coverage of the site shall be indicated upon the site land.\n(6) Screening and landscaping plans shall be required where such treatment is essential to the proper\narrangement of the development in relation to adjacent property.

The owner of the lot upon which the main use is changed, or upon which an\nindustrial use is developed as above provided, shall establish and maintain the buffer yard in accordance with this\nsection if buffer yard has not already been established.\nC. Screening of buffer yards. A masonry screening wall of not less than eight feet in height shall be\nerected between light industrial type uses and any other use and continuously maintained at the\nperimeter of the required buffer yard and no portion of such buffer yard shall be located outside of\nsuch screening. Provided, however, no screening shall be required in a buffer yard separating the\nfronts of two front yards, unless the required buffer yard is in the front yard of a multifamily\nresidential use.\nd. Landscaping of buffer yards. To further minimize noise, drainage hazards, glare, or other potential\nincompatibilities between the different categories of uses, at least 20 percent of any required buffer\nyard shall be landscaped, with a pervious surface, which 20 percent landscaped area shall be located\nimmediately adjacent to the required screening wall that is adjacent to the use that is of the lesser\nintensity of the two uses. The remainder of the buffer yard shall not be developed or constructed\nupon except for on-site parking, provided the buffer yard and parking facilities within it meet all\napplicable performance standards and landscaping provisions of this section.\nTable 6.

The preservation of existing vegetation within the landscape buffer may be used to meet the\nrequirements of this section; provided the vegetation is preserved in accordance with subsection\n(i)(12) of this section.\nb. In addition to the tree and shrub planting standards trees and shrubs in esplanades shall be planted\naccording to the following requirements:\n1.
