You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Mixed Use District\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MU-2\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, single family residence, single family, single-family, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input.

An application for a District MU-2 shall be made to the planning and zoning\ncommission in the same manner that an application for any amendment to the ordinance is made and shall\nbe processed according to the procedure in this section. As in the instance of new subdivision platting, a pre-\nplanning conference is required as set out in City of Stafford's Subdivision Ordinance preparatory to the\nfiling of the application for a District MU-2.

Any applicant may appeal the\ndecision of the planning and zoning commission to the city council for review and decision as to whether an\namendment to the District MU-2 ordinance shall be required. The development plan shall include:\n(1) A plat, prepared by a registered surveyor or engineer, showing proposed public or private street or alley;\nbuilding sites or building lots; any area proposed for dedication or reserved as parks or parkways;\nplaygrounds; utility easements; school sites; street widening, street changes, and the points of ingress\nand egress from existing public streets and defining boundaries and topography with a contour interval\nof not less than two feet, or spot grades where the relief is limited.\n(2) Where multiple types of land use are proposed, a land use plan delineating the specific areas to be\ndevoted to various uses shall be required.\n(3) Where building complexes are proposed, a site plan showing the location of each building and the\nminimum distance between buildings, and between buildings and property line, street line and/or alley\nline shall be submitted. For buildings more than one story in height, except single-family and two family\nresidences, elevations and/or prospective drawings may be required in order that the relationship of the\nbuildings to adjacent property, open spaces and to other features of the development plan may be\ndetermined. Such drawings need only indicate the heights, number of floors, and exposures for access,\nlight and air.\n(4) Where off-street loading is required, a plan indicating the arrangement and provisions shall be\nsubmitted.

Any special traffic regulation facilities proposed or required to assure the safe function of the\ncirculation plan shall also be shown.\n(5) A designation of the maximum building coverage of the site shall be indicated upon the site land.\n(6) Screening and landscaping plans shall be required where such treatment is essential to the proper\narrangement of the development in relation to adjacent property. Such plan shall, when required,\ninclude screening walls, ornamental planting, playgrounds, wooded areas to be retained, lawn and\ngardens, if such are determined to be necessary by the planning and zoning commission.\n(7) Any or all of the required features may be incorporated on a single drawing if such drawing is clear and\ncapable of evaluation by the city planning and zoning commission and interpretation by the building\nofficial.\n(8)\nabout:blank\n181/286\n\n\nNEW PAGE 182\n6/2/23, 8:58 AM\nStafford, TX Code of Ordinances\nEvery District MU-2 approved under the provisions of this section shall be considered as an amendment to the\nordinance as applicable to the property involved.
