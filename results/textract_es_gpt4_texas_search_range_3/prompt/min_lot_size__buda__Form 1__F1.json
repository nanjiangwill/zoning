You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"F1\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"Form 1\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: min lot size, min lot coverage, min parcel size, min lot and building, area and bulk, min dimensional, min lot area, lot area, min area, min lot area, min lot and area, min lot, min lot requirements, min parcel area, lot size, lot and building, dimensional, min lot, lot requirements, lot and building requirements, area requirements, area and bulk requirements, dimensional requirements. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. For min_lot_size in residential districts, we are only\ninterested in the answer as it pertains to single-family homes.\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted.

As recommended in both the Downtown Plan and Comprehensive Plan, the Downtown\nNode development should be compatible with the existing character of downtown. Infill\ndevelopment should help create a continuous retail edge along Main Street. The scale should\nreflect that of the historic Main Street and Old Town. The character of the historic\nneighborhood adjacent to Main Street should be preserved. Access should promote a park-once-\nand-walk environment, with parking along all of Main Street and a pedestrian friendly\nenvironment.\n2.\nRegulating Plan. The Regulating Plan serves as the zoning map for the development of the\nDowntown Node. Regulations in 2.08.03. Form District Standards are applied by Form District,\nas shown on the Regulating Plan.
