You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Single-family Residential 2\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-2\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"floor_to_area_ratio\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: . Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer.

The masonry guidelines set forth in this chapter are intended to provide a minimum\nstandard for the exterior construction of certain buildings.\n(A) Calculating masonry percentage. Where this chapter specifies a minimum percentage of masonry construction, that\npercentage shall be calculated by considering the entire surface area of the specified wall(s) less any and all glazing,\nwindows, and doors. The percentage shall be calculated from the remaining surface area after subtracting the area of any\nand all glazing, windows, and doors.\n(B) Structures inherent to specific zoning designations. The percentage of masonry required on a structure shall be\ngoverned by the masonry requirements for the zoning designation that the structure is specifically inherent to, i.e., the\nmasonry requirements for a single-family residential home built in a non-residential zoning designation shall be governed by\nthe requirements for the residential zoning designation, not the non-residential designation.\n(C) Placement of required masonry. Upon determination of the minimum required amount of masonry construction, the\ndesigner may at the designer's discretion design the structure such that any of the exterior walls are constructed with a\npercentage of masonry, provided the sum of the masonry on all of the exterior walls is equal to the total required percentage\nof masonry as calculated.\n(D) Exemptions.
