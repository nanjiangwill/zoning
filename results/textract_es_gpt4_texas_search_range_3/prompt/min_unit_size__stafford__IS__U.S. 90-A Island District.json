You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"U.S. 90-A Island District\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"IS\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. For min_unit_size in residential districts, we are only\ninterested in the answer as it pertains to single-family homes.\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted.

This area is unique due to its location, linear orientation, and the configuration and size of\nproperties. For these reasons it warrants special standards. The purpose of this district is to encourage reinvestment,\nredevelopment, and/or new development as a means to create a distinct focal point for the community and region. The\nstandards of this district offer increased flexibility in recognition of its development constraints and incentives by way\nof floor area bonuses for vertical mixed use, centralized and preferably structured parking, as well as property\nassembly. The standards of this district are designed to encourage an enhanced development quality. Ultimately, the\nvision of this district is one of an urban character distinguished by increased development intensity.\n( Ord.

When calculating the required number of off-street parking spaces, fractions of\nless than one-half shall be disregarded, and fractions of one-half or more shall be counted as one space. Where\nparking requirements are based on building floor area, the floor area calculations shall be based on the gross leasable\nfloor area. A parking analysis may be required by the zoning administrator to determine adequate parking for a site.\n(c) Dimensions. Required parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with the following standards:\n(1) Standard automobile parking spaces shall be a minimum of nine feet wide by 18 feet long.\n(2) Compact automobile parking spaces shall be a minimum of eight feet wide by 16 feet long.\n(3) Up to 30 percent of the required parking spaces may be designated for use by compact automobiles.\n(4) Handicapped parking shall be provided in accordance with the American Disabilities Act, 42 USC 12101 et\nseq., and may be credited to the required parking ratios provided herein.\n(d) Location of nonresidential parking spaces.\n(1) In Districts MU, MU-1, RCLM, and RCT, required off-street parking may be provided on a separate lot\nfrom the lot upon which the main use is conducted, provided such lot is within 300 feet of the main\nbuilding for which such parking is intended, and provided said lot is dedicated to parking use by an\ninstrument filed with the zoning administrator and consolidated with the main use under one certificate\nof occupancy. Two or more owners may join together in the provision of required parking hereunder,\nprovided such joined parking meets the requirements for both individual uses.\n(2) For mixed use developments on street parking credit may be given in the following manner:\na. The amount of off-street parking required shall be reduced by the following credit provided for on-\nstreet parking: One off-street parking space credit for every two on-street spaces up to four credits,\nthereafter one space credit for each on-street parking space.\nb. On-street parking shall follow the established configuration of existing on-street parking, except that\n45 degree diagonal parking may be allowed with the approval of the director of public works, taking\ninto account traffic flows and street design, with the parking spaces designed in accord with city\nstandards. The following shall constitute an on-street parking space:\n1. Parallel parking, each 24 feet of uninterrupted curb.\n2. Forty-five degree diagonal, each 17 feet of uninterrupted curb.\n3. Curb space must be contiguous to the lot which contains the use which requires the parking.\nC. Parking spaces may not be counted that are within 25 feet measured along the curb of any corner or\nintersection of an alley or street, nor within ten feet of an intersection of a street and driveway, as\nmeasured from the bottom of the apron wing, nor any other parking configuration that violates any\nlaw or standard of city or the State of Texas.\nd. On-street parking spaces credited for a specific use shall not be used exclusively by that use, but shall\nbe available for general public use at all times. No signage or actions limiting general public use of\non-street spaces shall be permitted.\n(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board of adjustment shall be authorized to grant special exceptions\nfrom the terms of this subsection to allow the joint use by two or more property owners of parking areas\nfor a mixed use development with a total number of spaces that is less than that required for both\nindividual uses, if it can be established by the applicants therefor that:\nabout:blank\n100/286\n\n\nNEW PAGE 101\n6/2/23,8:58 AM\nStafford, TX Code of Ordinances\na. Differences of uses by the applicants dictate that the hours of peak parking for each such use are\nsignificantly varied so as not to impede availability of parking;\nb. The permanent nature of the development supporting each such use would not reasonably be\nanticipated to alter the hours of each such use's period of peak parking demand;\nC. Such special exception would not be contrary to public interest; and\nd. The spirit of the ordinance would be observed and substantial justice done.\n(4) No off-street parking or loading space shall be located, either in whole or in part, within any fire lane\nrequired by any ordinance of the city or within aisles, driveways, or maneuvering areas necessary to\nprovide reasonable access to any parking space.\n(e) Enlargement of uses.\n(1) Whenever a use which is in existence on the date of enactment of this chapter, or any amendment\nhereto, is changed by enlarging the gross leasable floor area, the number of employees, number of\ndwelling units, seating capacity, or otherwise changed to create a need for an increase of ten percent or\nmore in the number of existing parking spaces based upon the applicable parking standard or standards\nprovided herein, such spaces shall be provided on the basis of the enlargement or change.\n(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever a building or use existing prior to the effective date of this\nchapter, or amendment hereto, is enlarged by 50 percent or more in gross leasable floor area, parking\nshall be provided as set forth herein for the totality of the use or structure.\n(f) Parking prohibitions in District SFR and District SFR-5. In District SFR and District SFR-5, no truck exceeding\none and one-half-ton capacity, no bus, recreational vehicle, trailer, watercraft, motor home, or mobile home\nshall be parked or stored on a lot in front or on the side of the main building or on an abutting street or alley\nfor more than 48 hours during any given week, from Monday through the following Sunday.\n(g) Schedule of parking regulations.
