In this division, COMMUNICATION TOWER means a structure 40 feet or more in height that supports\none or more communication antennas, including self-supporting lattice towers, guyed towers or monopole towers. If a\ncommunication tower is not mounted on a building, the height is measured from the grade adjacent to the base of the tower.\nIf a communication tower is mounted on a building, the height is measured from the area of the building where the base of\nthe tower is mounted. COMMUNICATION TOWER does not include a support structure for an antenna servingpolice, fire,\nor another emergency service provider, nor does it include a utility structure such as a water tank or power line support\ntower upon which antennas are located if the antennas do not extend more than ten feet above the highest point of the utility\nstructure.\n(b) General requirements:\n1. The zoning districts within which communication towers may be located are shown in the Use Table in \u00a7\n155.096.\n2. A communication tower shall not be located closer to any residential district boundary line or residential dwelling\nthan a distance equal to twice the height of the tower. This distance shall be measured as the shortest possible distance in\na\nstraight line from the tower to the closest point of the residential district boundary line or the residential dwelling.\n3. No communication tower, support building, foundation, support wires or other appurtenances shall be located\nwithin any required front, side, or rear setback area.\n4. A building permit is required to erect a communication tower or to install an antenna on a communication tower.\nCommunication towers and antennas must meet or exceed the current federal, state and local standards and regulations.\n5. Communication towers shall be equipped with safeguards to prevent unauthorized access. Safeguards can\ninclude devices recommended by the tower manufacturer, fencing, walls, climbing guards, or other security devices.\n6. Collocation is greatly encouraged by the city. All new communication towers over 50 feet in height shall be\nconstructed to support antennas for at least two carriers.\n7. Support buildings and storage areas shall be screened from public view by a wall, opaque fencing, or\nlandscaping, shall meet all applicable front, side and rear yard setback requirements, and shall use exterior colors and\nmaterials that are compatible with nearby structures.\n8. No signs other than those required by law shall be mounted on a communication tower, support building, or\nassociated wall or fence.\n(c) Specific use permit; factors. If construction of a communication tower requires a specific use permit, the Zoning\nCommission shall consider the following factors, in addition to the factors described in \u00a7 155.040:\n1. The city may not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services;\n2. The city may not regulate in a manner that prohibits or has the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal\nwireless services;\n3. The city must act on applications within a reasonable period of time;\n4. The city must make any denial of an application in writing, and supported by substantial evidence in the minutes\nof the meeting; and\n5. The city may not base a decision directly or indirectly on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions.\n(Ord. 08-347, passed - -2008; Ord. 2015-02-17-04, passed 2-17-2015)\nPROPERTY DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\n\u00a7 155.110 TABLE OF PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.\n(A) The property development standards table of this section provides a summary of the development standards that\napply

Lot size or lot area refers to the amount of horizontal land area within lot lines.\n(B) No building permit or development approval shall be issued for a lot that does not meet the minimum lot size\nrequirements of this chapter, with the following exceptions.\n(1) Lot size reduction for public purpose. When an existing lot is reduced as a result of conveyance to a federal, state or\nlocal government for a public purpose and the remaining area is at least 75% of the required minimum lot size for the district\nin which it is located, the remaining lot shall be deemed to be in compliance with the minimum lot size standards of this\nchapter.\n(2) Utility facilities. Utility facilities using land or an unoccupied building requiring less than 1,000 square feet of site\narea are exempt from the minimum lot size requirements of all districts.\n(3) Single-family dwelling exemptions. The minimum lot size requirements of this chapter shall not be interpreted as\nprohibiting the construction of a single-family residential dwelling unit in a lot that was legally platted or recorded prior to the\neffective date of this chapter, provided it is a permitted use in the applicable zoning district.\n(Ord. 08-347, passed - -2008)\n\u00a7 155.112 SETBACKS.\n(A) Generally. Under this chapter, a setback refers to the unobstructed, unoccupied open space between a structure and\nthe property line of the lot on which the structure is located. Setbacks shall be unobstructed from the ground to the sky and\nmeasured as the horizontal distance between a property line and the furthermost projection of the structure, except as\nprovided

In this division, COMMUNICATION TOWER means a structure 40 feet or more in height that supports\none or more communication antennas, including self-supporting lattice towers, guyed towers or monopole towers. If a\ncommunication tower is not mounted on a building, the height is measured from the grade adjacent to the base of the tower.\nIf a communication tower is mounted on a building, the height is measured from the area of the building where the base of\nthe tower is mounted. COMMUNICATION TOWER does not include a support structure for an antenna servingpolice, fire,\nor another emergency service provider, nor does it include a utility structure such as a water tank or power line support\ntower upon which antennas are located if the antennas do not extend more than ten feet above the highest point of the utility\nstructure.\n(b) General requirements:\n1. The zoning districts within which communication towers may be located are shown in the Use Table in \u00a7\n155.096.\n2. A communication tower shall not be located closer to any residential district boundary line or residential dwelling\nthan a distance equal to twice the height of the tower. This distance shall be measured as the shortest possible distance in\na\nstraight line from the tower to the closest point of the residential district boundary line or the residential dwelling.\n3. No communication tower, support building, foundation, support wires or other appurtenances shall be located\nwithin any required front, side, or rear setback area.\n4. A building permit is required to erect a communication tower or to install an antenna on a communication tower.\nCommunication towers and antennas must meet or exceed the current federal, state and local standards and regulations.\n5. Communication towers shall be equipped with safeguards to prevent unauthorized access. Safeguards can\ninclude devices recommended by the tower manufacturer, fencing, walls, climbing guards, or other security devices.\n6. Collocation is greatly encouraged by the city. All new communication towers over 50 feet in height shall be\nconstructed to support antennas for at least two carriers.\n7. Support buildings and storage areas shall be screened from public view by a wall, opaque fencing, or\nlandscaping, shall meet all applicable front, side and rear yard setback requirements, and shall use exterior colors and\nmaterials that are compatible with nearby structures.\n8. No signs other than those required by law shall be mounted on a communication tower, support building, or\nassociated wall or fence.\n(c) Specific use permit; factors. If construction of a communication tower requires a specific use permit, the Zoning\nCommission shall consider the following factors, in addition to the factors described in \u00a7 155.040:\n1. The city may not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services;\n2. The city may not regulate in a manner that prohibits or has the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal\nwireless services;\n3. The city must act on applications within a reasonable period of time;\n4. The city must make any denial of an application in writing, and supported by substantial evidence in the minutes\nof the meeting; and\n5. The city may not base a decision directly or indirectly on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions.\n(Ord. 08-347, passed - -2008; Ord. 2015-02-17-04, passed 2-17-2015)\nPROPERTY
