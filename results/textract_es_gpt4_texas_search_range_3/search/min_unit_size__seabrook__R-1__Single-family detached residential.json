Description: This district is primarily intended for multifamily dwellings consisting of duplexes, townhouses, row houses, apartments, and\nother similar medium density designs, along with related religious, educational, and recreational facilities normally required to provide the basic\nelements of a balanced and attractive neighborhood. The purpose of the medium density residential district is to provide for a higher density\nresidential district with a more diverse mixture of residential and associated land uses. In order to accommodate higher densities, a greater use of\nopen space and recreational areas should be incorporated into developments in this district. Projects in this district are primarily intended for\nlocation along or near arterial streets to accommodate the higher traffic generation of uses in the district. These areas are intended to be separated\nand protected from the encroachment of land use activities which do not perform a function necessary to sustain the residential environment.\nInternal stability, attractiveness, order, efficiency, security, and the maintenance of property values are encouraged by the provision of adequate\nlight, air and open space for dwellings and related facilities and through consideration of the proper functional relationship of these various\nelements. The regulatory provisions of this district are aimed at achieving the specific goals and objectives identified in parts 4.0 and 5.2 of\nComprehensive Master Plan 2030.\n3.05.02.
