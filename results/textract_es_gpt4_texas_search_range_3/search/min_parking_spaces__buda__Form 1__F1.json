Reflection of historic character and pedestrian accessibility within the node should\nbe emphasized.\n2.\nRegulating Plan.

Form District Standards are applied by Form\nDistrict, as shown on the Regulating Plan. Interpretation of district boundaries (see 2.02.01. E)\napplies to the Regulating Plan. When two Form Districts are present within a single property,\n:2.08-3\n\nNEW PAGE 60\nthe intent is to approach the proposed or existing road frontage.\nFigure 12.

As recommended in both the Downtown Plan and Comprehensive Plan, the Downtown\nNode development should be compatible with the existing character of downtown. Infill\ndevelopment should help create a continuous retail edge along Main Street. The scale should\nreflect that of the historic Main Street and Old Town. The character of the historic\nneighborhood adjacent to Main Street should be preserved. Access should promote a park-once-\nand-walk environment, with parking along all of Main Street and a pedestrian friendly\nenvironment.\n2.\nRegulating Plan.
