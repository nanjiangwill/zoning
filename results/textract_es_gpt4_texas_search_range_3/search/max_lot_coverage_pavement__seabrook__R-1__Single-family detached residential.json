A new development shall be defined as any new project built on a raw or\notherwise vacant tract or tracts of land, not associated with an existing structure. A structure shall be deemed to have lost its nonconformity as\ndetermined by appendix A, article 9.\nIt is the intent of this section to establish minimum standards for the provision, installation, and maintenance of landscape plantings in order to\nprovide for the orderly, safe, and environmentally sound development of land located within the corporate limits of Seabrook, thereby promoting the\nhealth, safety, and general welfare of the community as provided by law.\nThe regulations contained herein are necessary to enhance the community's aesthetic, environmental, and ecological qualities, as well as to\nbenefit safety in parking and pedestrian areas.\nThrough the use of landscaping, it is possible to improve the appearance of all areas by incorporating open space into development in ways that\nharmonize and enhance the natural and built environment. It is possible to improve environmental quality through the numerous beneficial effects\nof landscaping, including:\nA. The improvement of air and water quality through such natural processes as photosynthesis and mineral uptake.\nB. The use of trees and other plants to reduce erosion by the binding of soil particles with their roots thus holding the soil together\nagainst the effects of wind and water. When development increases the amount of impervious surface on a site, it greatly increases\nwater flow across exposed soils, causing serious water pollution problems. Vegetation slows this process by acting as a sponge,\ngradually releasing runoff. This improves water quality and reduces the need for engineered drainage solutions.\nC. Vegetation reduces and/or reverses air, noise, heat, and chemical pollution through the biological filtering capacities of trees and other\nvegetation.\nD. Landscaping reduces the increase in air temperatures caused by paved surfaces and automobiles through the process of transpiration\nassociated with plant material.\nVegetation also helps promote energy conservation through the creation of shade, reducing heat gain in or on buildings or paved areas.\nThe use of vegetation also enhances the safety of parking lots and pedestrian paths through the application of landscaping provisions which guide\nthe circulation of cars and people. Proper use helps ensure that a driver's vision is unobstructed. The regulations contained in this section of the\nordinance are aimed at achieving the goals, objectives, and policies, contained in the comprehensive master plan.\n7.01.02 Definitions: All related definitions are found in article 1, section 1.10 of appendix A.\n7.01.03 General applicability: Unless otherwise provided herein, this article shall apply to the following:\nA.
