Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"FRINGE COMMERCIAL\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"B-2\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If FRINGE COMMERCIAL\n(B-2) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor FRINGE COMMERCIAL (B-2). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"FRINGE COMMERCIAL (B-2)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"FRINGE COMMERCIAL\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Uses appropriate\nin the HR-CC district include live-work units, flex space, and low-intensity neighborhood-serving\nestablishments such as healthcare, assisted living, elder care, child care, and recreation facilities.\nProperty proposed for rezoning to an HR-CC district shall include no less than 5 contiguous acres.\nThe district may be expanded to include additional parcels of land SO long as such parcels: (i) are\ncontiguous to the district, and (ii) are the same, or part of the same, tracts or parcels of land that\nwere identified in Mapping Our Community's Future for more intensive uses. The development\nof an HR-CC district may include the recombination of existing lots and/or the subdivision of new\nlots that meet the density and dimensional standards outlined in Article XII.\nPage #6\n\n\nNEW PAGE 7\nArt. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\nSection 15-137 Manufacturing Districts Established. (AMENDED 6/22/82; 2/4/86)\n(1)\nThe M-1 and M-2 districts are hereby created to accomplish the purposes and serve\nthe objectives set forth in this subsection. Part of Article XI contains performance standards that place\nlimitations on the characteristics of uses located in the districts created by this section.\n(a)\nM-1 LIGHT MANUFACTURING This zone is designed to accommodate a\nlimited range of industrial activities and a wide range of commercial uses\nincluding wholesaling, storage, mail-order, auto related, and office and retail\nin conjunction with industrial or wholesaling uses. Permitted industrial uses\ninclude enterprises engaged in manufacturing, processing, creating, repairing,\nrenovating, painting, cleaning and assembly where all operations are\ncontained inside a fully enclosed building. The performance standards for the\nM-1 zone located in Part I of Article XI are more restrictive than those in the\nM-2 district.\n(b)\nM-2 GENERAL MANUFACTURING This district is designed to accommodate\nthe widest range of industrial uses. Business operations may be conducted\nwithin and outside a fully enclosed building. The performance standards for\nthis zone are less restrictive than those in the M-1 district.\n(2)\nThere is also established a watershed light industrial (WM-3) zoning district. The\npurpose of this district is to allow areas within the University Lake Watershed that have been zoned\nM-1 prior to the effective date of this subdivision to continue to be used and developed for light\nindustrial and related purposes, subject to certain restrictions designed to protect the watershed.\nConsistent with the purpose of this zone, this district shall be confined to that area zoned M-1 on the\neffective date of this subsection (12/7/1983); this area shall not be expanded and no new WM-3 areas\nshall be designated. For the purposes of this section, changes to make WM-3 zoning uniform on lots\nthat were depicted as entirely within the M-1 zoning at the time of its establishment, but that were\nlater depicted as being bisected by the zoning boundary, will not be considered an expansion of the\ndistrict or the creation of new WM-3 areas. (AMENDED 12/7/83; 06/27/17)\n(3)\nThere is also established a Planned Industrial Development (PID) zoning district. The\npurpose of this district is to provide for the possibility of well-planned and tightly controlled industrial\ndevelopment in areas that are suitable for such development but that are not deemed appropriate for\nM-1 or M-2 zoning because of the less restricted types of development that may occur in such zones.\n(AMENDED 6/22/82; 12/7/83)\n(a)\nNo area less than twenty contiguous acres may be zoned as a Planned\nIndustrial Development district, and then only upon a request submitted by or\non behalf of the owner or owners of all the property intended to be covered by\nsuch zone.\nPage #7\n\n\nNEW PAGE 8\nArt. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\n(b)\nAs indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses (Section 15-146) a planned\nindustrial development (use classification 30.000) is the only permissible use\nin a PID zone.\n(c)\nSubject to subdivision (2) of this subsection, and consistent with the\nrestrictions contained in the definition of a planned industrial development\n[see Subdivision 15-15], land within a PID zone may be used in a manner that\nwould be permissible if the land were zoned M-1, except that (i) the only\npermissible uses are those described in the 2.130 and 4.100 classifications and\n(ii) the performance standards (Article XI, Part I) applicable to 4.100 uses in\nbusiness zones shall govern uses in a planned industrial development.\nSection 15-138 Public Facilities District Established.\nThere is hereby created a Public Facilities (P-F) zoning district. Within this district, those\nuses indicated as permissible in the Table of Permissible Uses may be developed, but only if such\ndevelopments are owned and operated by the United States, the State of North Carolina, Orange\nCounty, the Town of Carrboro, or any agency, department, or subdivision of the foregoing\ngovernments.\nSection 15-139 Planned Unit Development District Established.\n(1)\nThere are hereby established sixty different Planned Unit Development (PUD) zoning\ndistricts as described in this section. Each PUD zoning district is designed to combine the\ncharacteristics of at least two and possibly three zoning districts. (AMENDED 2/24/87)\n(a)\nOne element of each PUD district shall be the residential element. Here there\nare six possibilities, each one corresponding to one of the following residential\ndistricts identified in Section 15-135: R-20, R-15, R-10, R-7.5, R-3, or\nR- S.I.R. Within that portion of the PUD zone that is developed for purposes\npermissible in a residential district, all development must be in accordance\nwith the regulations applicable to the residential zoning district to which the\nparticular PUD zoning district corresponds.\n(b)\nA second element of each PUD district shall be the commercial element. Here\nthere are five possibilities, each one corresponding to either the B-1(g), B-2,\nB-3, O, or O/A zoning districts established by Section 15-136. Within that\nportion of a PUD district that is developed for purposes permissible in a\ncommercial district, all development must be in accordance with the\nregulations applicable to the commercial district to which the PUD district\ncorresponds. (AMENDED 2/04/97)\n(c)\nA manufacturing/processing element may be a third element of any PUD\ndistrict. Here there are two alternatives. The first is that uses permitted within\nthe M-1 district would be permitted within the PUD district. The second\nalternative is that uses permitted only within the M-1 or M-2 zoning districts\nPage #8\n\n\nNEW PAGE 9\nArt. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\nwould not be permitted. If an M-1 element is included, then within that portion\nof the PUD district that is developed for purposes permissible in an M-1\ndistrict, all development must be in accordance with the regulations applicable\nto the M-1 district.\nThe sixty different PUD zoning districts are derived from the various combinations of possible\nalternatives within each of the three elements -- residential, commercial, manufacturing/processing.\nFor example, there is an R-20/B-1(g)/M-1 district, an R-20/B-2/M-1 district, an R-20/B-2 district, an\nR-15/B-1(g)/M-1 district, etc. (AMENDED 2/04/97)\n(2)\nNo area of less than twenty-five contiguous acres may be zoned as a Planned Unit\nDevelopment district, and then only upon the request of the owner or owners of all of the property\nintended to be covered by such zone.\n(3)\nAs indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses (Section 15-146), a planned unit\ndevelopment (use classification 28.000) is the only permissible use in a PUD zone, and planned unit\ndevelopments are permissible only in such zones.\nSection 15-140 Residential High Density and Commercial Overlay District. (AMENDED\n2/4/86)\nThere is hereby created a Residential High Density and Commercial Overlay (RHDC) zoning\ndistrict. The purpose of this district is to provide for the redevelopment of deteriorating commercial\nand manufacturing areas in a manner that is consistent with commercial development goals of the\ntown, namely, for compact, compressed town center growth, for a substantial increase in residential\nopportunities near the town center, and for mixed use development in the downtown. Property that\nlies within this overlay district may be developed in accordance with either the regulations applicable\nto the underlying district or the following regulations:\n(1)\nTo take advantage of provisions applicable to the RHDC overlay district, lots must\ncontain at least one and one half acres of contiguous land under single ownership.\n(2)\nUses permissible shall be those permissible within either the R-2 district or the B-1(c)\ndistrict, or both, except that subdivisions other than architecturally integrated\nsubdivisions shall not be allowed.\n(3)\nResidential density shall be determined as if the property were zoned R-2.\n(4)\nTwenty percent of the lot area shall remain as usable open space (see Section 15-198),\nexcept that where the development seeks to provide interior open space or indoor hard\ncourt, pool, or other active recreation facilities in excess of the basic requirement set\nforth in Article XIII, the permit-issuing authority may reduce the open space\nrequirement to reflect the quality and amount of such facilities. The developer may\nsubstitute grassed areas, lawn, gardens, and shrubbed space for wooded space in\nmeeting the requirements of 15-198(b)(3).\nPage #9\n\nNEW PAGE 10\nArt.

For purposes of this subsection, the\nphrase \"within the development\" means within the area covered by the\nspecial use permit-A issued for the mixed use development as well as any\nadjacent property that is or was owned by the developer of the mixed use\nproject and that is conveyed to a non-profit agency and developed for\naffordable housing as described herein, even if such other area is not located\nwith the Town of Carrboro.\n(4)\nThe permissible residential density within the mixed use development shall\nbe calculated as if the development were zoned R-3, except that the density\nshall be calculated as if the property were zoned R-2 if the developer\nconveys at least ten percent of the land within the development to a non-\nprofit agency and constructs on that land affordable housing as described in\nsubsection (c)(3) above. For purposes of this subsection, if land that is not\nlocated within the Town of Carrboro is regarded as \"within the\ndevelopment\" as that phrase is defined in subsection (c)(3) above, then such\narea shall be considered part of the development for purposes of calculating\nthe permissible residential density under this subsection.\n(5)\nSubject to the other provisions of this subsection, the dimensional and other\nrequirements of this chapter applicable to the R-3 district shall apply to a\nmixed use development permitted under this section. However, the\nmaximum height of buildings within the mixed use development, shall be\nfour stories, except that a fifth story shall be permitted if the developer\nconveys at least ten percent of the land within the development to a non-\nprofit agency and constructs on that land of affordable housing as described\nin subsection (c)(3) above. Notwithstanding other provisions of this\nchapter, any parking levels that are constructed underneath a building\nwithin a mixed use development and that are at least in substantial part\nconstructed below the ground service levels shall not be regarded as\n\"stories\" for purposes of the height limitations established herein.\n(6)\nPermissible uses within the commercial component of the mixed use shall\nbe those listed in the following use classifications within the Table of\nPermissible Uses: (i) use classification 3.100; (ii) use classifications 2.110,\n2.112, 2.120, 2.130, 2.150, 2.210, 2.220, provided that such uses do not\ncomprise more than fifty percent of the total commercial space within the\nPage #11\n\n\nNEW PAGE 12\nArt.
