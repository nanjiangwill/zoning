Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Entry Corridor Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"EC\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Entry Corridor Overlay\n(EC) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Entry Corridor Overlay (EC). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Entry Corridor Overlay (EC)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Entry Corridor Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

This performance measure may be achieved by any suitable\ncombination of building design, building materials, and construction standards SO as to\nreduce the interior noise levels from potential overhead aircraft flights. Prior to the issuance\nof a residential use building permit in the A-ED Zone, construction methods and materials\nbeing used to construct the residential use will be reviewed to make sure they achieve at\nleast a 30 dB noise reduction.\nSee Appendix C, page 248, for the A-ED and A-RE map.\n124\n\n\nNEW PAGE 149\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\nF) A-RE Airport Runway Exclusion District.\n1) Purpose.\nThe intent of the Airport Runway Exclusion District (A-RE) is to reduce high density\ndevelopment in zones with high aircraft possibilities and where a crash could result in\ncatastrophic loss of life, structure, and property.

For all of the runways, current and future, the end of\nthe runway shall be determined by the Airport Authority and the center line of the trapezoid\nprotection zone shall be in line with the centerline of the runway.
