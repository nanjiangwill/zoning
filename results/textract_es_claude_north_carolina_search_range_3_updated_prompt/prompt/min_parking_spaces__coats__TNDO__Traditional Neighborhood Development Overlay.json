Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"TNDO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay\n(TNDO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay (TNDO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay (TNDO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

Unless provided otherwise, a clear view at each corner of an\nintersection shall be maintained by establishing an unobstructed \"sight triangle\". The\nextent of the required sight triangle varies according to the speed limit of streets\nforming the intersection. For streets signed for greater than 35 MPH, the area to be\nclear of view obstructions at un-signalized intersections is the triangular area formed\nby the point of intersection of street right-of-way lines and a point located along each\nright-of-way line at a distance of 35 feet from the point of intersection. For\nintersecting streets signed for 35 MPH or less, the area to be clear of view\nobstructions at un-signalized intersections is the triangular area formed by the point of\nintersection of street right-of-way lines and a point located along each right-of-way\nline at a distance of 25 feet from the point of intersection.\nSite Triangle Illustration for Streets Signed for 35 MPH or less:\n25 ft\nsight line\narea\n25 ft\nStreet Right-of-Way\n2.11-2 No Obstruction in Sight Triangle.

The limitations of this section may be modified in the\ninstances noted below, SO long as adequate visibility is maintained relative to\nintended speed limit:\n(A.) existing natural grades;\n(B.) trees trimmed such that no limbs or foliage extend into the area between 30 and 96\ninches above the level of the adjacent intersection;\n(C.) fire hydrants, public utility poles, street markers, government signs, electrical\njunction boxes, and traffic control devices;\n(D.) buildings located in the Main Street (MS) District, or the mixed-use center of the\nTraditional Neighborhood Overlay (TNDO) District;\n(E.) the approved and intentional use of traffic calming techniques to reduce speed; these\ninclude, but are not limited to: a series of hill crests, neck-downs, intersection\ndiverters, and curb bulbs.\n2.12 Building Separation\nAll detached principal structures in all districts shall preserve a minimum building\nseparation of 10 feet, except for Urban Workplace, Shop-front Commercial, and Attached\nHouse Lot/Building Types in the Main Street (MS) District, Mixed-Use (MU) Districts,\nor the mixed-use center of the Traditional Neighborhood Overlay (TNDO) District. All\ndetached accessory structures in all districts shall maintain a minimum building\nseparation of eight (8) feet. All separations are as measured from the closest point(s) of\nroof overhang.\n2.13\nPermitted Accessory Uses and Fixtures in All Districts\n2.13-1 Accessory uses and Structures. Accessory uses and structures related and incidental\nto residential principal structure(s) on the lot shall be setback a minimum of 7.5 feet\nbeyond the front and/or side street facing fa\u00e7ade(s) of the conditioned space, and\nsetback a minimum of four (4) feet from interior side and rear lot line(s). If the\naccessory structure exceeds the height of the principal structure, it must meet the\nminimum setback for principle structures on interior side and/or rear lot line(s).\n2.13-2 Fences and Walls. Fences and walls meeting the requirements of sections 2.10-2 and\n2.10-3 are permitted in all districts in accordance with the following specifications:\n(A.) A zoning permit issued by the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator shall\nbe required for all fences and walls.
