Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"General Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"B-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If General Business\n(B-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor General Business (B-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"General Business (B-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"General Business\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

HOME OCCUPATIONS\n2901. Purpose.\nThe home occupation regulations are established in order to preserve the neighborhoods and to prevent the intrusion of commercial ventures into residential\ndistricts.\n(Ord. of 12-19-11(6))\n2902. - Standards for home occupations.\nThe purpose of the home occupation regulations is to protect the character of the surrounding residential neighborhood, while recognizing that traditional\nworkplaces are no longer necessary in all situations due to changing technology, computerization, networking, and the changing job market. These regulations are\nintended to recognize this trend and allow home occupations that are located and conducted in such a manner that the existence of the home occupation is not\ndetectable outside of the dwelling unit or accessory building. The home occupation use shall be clearly subordinate and incidental to the residential use of the\nproperty.\nA. Classes of Home Occupation.\n1. Minor Home Occupations. Home occupations that have little or no impact on the surrounding residential area, such as:\na. Personal home business and professional offices; a service-oriented business use.\nb. Home craft businesses, including (but not limited to) artists, sculptors, and dressmakers.\nC. Instructional services including music, art, dance, voice, and tutoring.\nd. Day-care for six or fewer individuals, whether for adults or children.\n57 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\n\n\nNEW PAGE 58\nCarteret County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n2. Major Home Occupations. Home occupations that have or might have a noticeable impact on the surrounding residential area and, therefore, are\npermitted only by special use permit, such as:\na. Day-care for seven or more individuals, whether adults or children.\nb. Professional services, including (but not limited to) medical, dental, or physical therapy facilities, barbers, beauticians, and photographers.\nC. Bed-and-breakfast residence.\nB. General Regulations for All Home Occupations.\n1. No more than 25 percent of the gross area of such residence may be used for the home occupation (bed-and-breakfast and day-care uses are\nexempt from this provision) and no more than 400 square feet of the residence may be used for the home occupation. No more than 600 square feet\nof either an attached garage or detached accessory building, but not both, may be used for the home occupation. Due to its nature, day-care may be\nconducted throughout the residence.\n2. No use shall require either internal or external alterations or involve construction features or use of electrical or mechanical equipment that would\nresult in a lower fire rating of the structure.\n3. Except for drop-off activities, the use may increase vehicular traffic flow and parking by no more than two additional vehicles at a time.\n4. In no way shall the appearance of the structure be altered or the occupation within the residence be conducted in a manner which would cause the\npremises to differ from its residential character either by the use of colors, materials, construction, lighting, signs, or by the emission of sounds,\nnoise, vibration, dust, smell, smoke, glare, electrical interference, or any other hazard or nuisance to any greater extent than experienced in an\naverage residential neighborhood.\n5. No exterior storage, display, use, or activity of any kind related to the home occupation.\n6. There shall be no commodities sold or services rendered that require receipt or delivery of merchandise, goods, or equipment other than by\npassenger motor vehicle, parcel delivery service, or U.S. mail service. No deliveries by tractor/trailer trucks are permitted.\n7. Storage of combustible or flammable matter, accumulation of rubbish, wastepaper, cartons, or boxes, in excess of normal home activities is\nprohibited.\n8. The repair, detailing, and/or painting of automobiles, trucks, recreational vehicles, trailers, motorcycles and/or boats are prohibited.\nC. Specific Standards for Minor Home Occupations.\n1. Clients or customers will not be present on the site on a regularly-scheduled basis and shall not exceed ten per week, on average, except that\ninstructional services are limited to a maximum of five students at any one time in one day.\n2. No signage identifying the minor home occupation is permitted in a residential district.\n3. Retail sales on the premises shall be prohibited, except for products or goods produced or fabricated on the premises as part of the home\noccupation.\n4. No minor home occupation shall have more than one employee that is not a resident of the household, except that, upon notification to the planning\ndirector or designee, there may be a second employee who does not live in the home on the site for up to 30 days a year.\nD.
