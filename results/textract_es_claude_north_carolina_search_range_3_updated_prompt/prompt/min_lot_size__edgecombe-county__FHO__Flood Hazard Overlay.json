Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Flood Hazard Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"FHO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Flood Hazard Overlay\n(FHO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Flood Hazard Overlay (FHO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Flood Hazard Overlay (FHO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Flood Hazard Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft).

The maximum flag lot size in areas with public sewer shall be one acre.\n4. The maximum flag lot size without public sewer shall be three acres.\n5. The 'flagpole' portion of the lot is not used to calculate area, width, depth, coverage, and\nsetbacks of the lot or to provide off-street parking.\n6. The \"pole,\" arm,\" or \"pan handle\" portion of a flag lot shall maintain a minimum width of at\nleast 25 feet;\n7. The maximum flagpole length shall be 300 feet;\n8. The minimum separation between the 'flagpole' portion of the lot and that of another flag\nlot shall be 150 feet;\n9. Where public sewer is available, occupied buildings on the flag lot shall have a gravity\nservice line, or the sewer pump requirements shall be noted on the plat; and\n10.\nUse of a single driveway to serve an adjoining flag lot or to serve a flag lot and an\nadjoining conventional lot is encouraged. In the case of a driveway shared with a\nconventional lot, the preferred location for the driveway is on the flagpole portion of the\nflag lot, with the conventional lot granted an access easement over the flagpole.\nD.\nDOUBLE AND REVERSE FRONTAGE LOTS\n1. Double frontage (or \"through\" lots) shall be prohibited except where essential to provide\nseparation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific\nchallenges of topography and orientation.\n2. In cases where a double frontage lot abuts a thoroughfare or boulevard street, access to\nthe lot shall be provided from the street with the lowest average daily trips. This\nrequirement may be waived by the Zoning Administrator in cases where compliance with\nthis standard will likely result in dramatic increases in traffic within residential areas.\n3.\nA double frontage lot shall include an easement of at least ten feet in width across the rear\nof the lot which shall prohibit access to the abutting street.\nE.\nDRAINAGE AND FLOOD PREVENTION\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage\n475\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n\n\nNEW PAGE 476\nARTICLE 6.
