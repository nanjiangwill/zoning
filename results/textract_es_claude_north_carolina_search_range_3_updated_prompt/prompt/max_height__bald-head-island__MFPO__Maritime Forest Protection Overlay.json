Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Maritime Forest Protection Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MFPO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Maritime Forest Protection Overlay\n(MFPO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Maritime Forest Protection Overlay (MFPO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Maritime Forest Protection Overlay (MFPO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Maritime Forest Protection Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Planned development 3 district is established as a district in which the principal\nuse of land is residential but with some offices allowed and bed and breakfast without commercial restaurant facilities.\n(e) PD-3C planned development 3 commercial district. Planned development 3 commercial district is established as a\ndistrict in which the principal use of land is for mixed use which includes residential uses, commercial services, offices,\nmarina and marina related uses, club facilities, transient inn uses and leisure activities and their attendant uses.\nFurthermore, it is the intent of this district to encourage the construction and continued use of land necessary for the\nembarkation and debarkation of ferry passengers.\n(f) PD-4 planned development 4 district. Planned development 4 district is established as a district in which the principal\nuse of the land is for single-family residential dwellings on large lots, leisure activities and the protection of the natural\nenvironment.\n(g) MFPO maritime forest protection overlay district. The specifications and standards of this district were established in\norder to permit development that is compatible with the environmentally sensitive nature of the Bald Head Island and Middle\nIsland maritime forests, and to preserve land in a natural state where such land is considered to be a vital link in the local\ngroundwater replenishment cycle and where the destruction of natural vegetation could have a harmful effect on the stability\nof the soil and its resistance to erosion. More specifically, the maritime forest protection overlay district is designed to protect\nnatural features and functions of the area in the interest of health, safety and general welfare of the residents and visitors to\nBald Head Island and Middle Island. Such features include, but are not limited to, saltspray sheer zone vegetation, forest\nwetlands, relic dunes, and dune ridges.\n\n\nNEW PAGE 22\n(1) Applicability. The provisions of this district shall, to the extent permitted by the law, apply to those areas within the\ncorporate limits of the village that may be, from time to time, designated on the official map or maps designating certain\nareas thereon as maritime forest protection overlay district adopted by the village. This overlay district is intended to provide\nadditional protection to the maritime forest, while allowing all uses contained in the PD district, in which the overlay occurs,\nto be allowed. The golf course from the fairways, tees, and greens to adjacent rights-of-way or lot lines are expected from\nthis overlay district.\n(2) Performance standards. The following performance standards apply to all uses within the maritime forest protection\noverlay district. These performance standards are in addition to or over and above the requirements of the applicable zoning\ndistrict.\na. Prestaking or preconstruction lot clearing. Some clearing of understory trees and shrubs may be required to prepare\na site for sale or survey or to stake the proposed building site. Permission to clear such understory, trees and shrubs shall\nnot be required by the building inspector, but shall be limited to such vegetation with a three-inch caliper at four feet above\ngrade.\nb. Lot alteration. No alteration of a lot or building site shall occur prior to the issuance of a building permit.

Soil disturbing activities and site alteration shall not exceed the minimum\nnecessary to provide for the location of the principal use structure, any accessory use improvements, driveway access, and\nutility service improvements. No specimen tree (a 24-inch diameter trunk at four feet above ground level) shall be removed\nunless construction is impractical without the removal of such tree.\nC. Construction containment. The area of construction shall be limited to five feet outside of the perimeter of structure\nconstruction and two feet outside of a driveway referred to in this chapter as \"limit of construction.\" A lay down yard for\nconstruction material must be shown on plans submitted for approval as well as the limits of construction. Both of these\nareas shall be surrounded by a construction fence which shall be maintained until all construction is completed. Movement\nof construction equipment or placement of material outside of this containment is prohibited.\nd. Wetland buffer. Natural wetlands and ponds shall not be filled. No paved area or any part of a ground absorption\nwastewater treatment system shall be located within 20 feet of any stream, pond, or wetland. Pilings for a residence may be\nplaced in the wetlands boundary as long as no fill is placed in the wetlands. For lots platted before April 1, 1991, fill is\nallowed to the extent permitted by applicable regulatory agency, only if the property is unbuildable or unaccessible without\nthe fill permit. Open decking or boardwalks may be built over wetlands where approved by the local GAMA permit officers\nand division of coastal management or other appropriate governmental agency or authority.\ne. Off-street parking, driveways and carports. Parking areas on a lot shall be located under the principal structure\nwhenever possible. All off-street parking improvements and driveways shall be designed to minimize impervious lot\ncoverage. Driveway widths shall be limited to ten feet.\nf. Clearing and pavement width for roads, streets, and culs-de-sac.\n1. The total combined width of paved area within a right-of-way for a road or street shall not exceed 22 feet.\n2.
