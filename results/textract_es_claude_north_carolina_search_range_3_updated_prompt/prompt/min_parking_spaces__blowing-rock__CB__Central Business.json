Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Central Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CB\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Central Business\n(CB) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Central Business (CB). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Central Business (CB)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Central Business\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

Combination Uses. When a combination use comprises two or more principal\nuses that require different types of permits (zoning or special use), then the permit authorizing\nthe combination use shall be:\na) A special use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a special use permit.\nb) A zoning permit in all other cases.\nThis is indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses by the designation Z and S in each of the columns\nadjacent to the 29.000 classification.\n16-10.10.1. Subject to Section 16-10.10.2 when a combination use in an R-6 or R-10 zoning\ndistrict consists of a residential subdivision and a multi-family development, the total density\npermissible on the lot shall be determined by having the developer indicate on the plans the\nportion of the total lot that will be developed for each purpose and calculating the density\nfor each portion as if it were a separate lot.\n16-10.10.2. Notwithstanding Section 16-12.2.2 whenever a combination use consists of a\nstandard residential subdivision and a multi-family development, and the subdivided portion\nof the tract contains lots that exceed the minimum lot size requirements set forth in Section\n16-181, but that do not exceed an average of 30,000 square feet, then the density of the\nportion of the tract developed for multi-family purposes may be increased beyond the\npermissible density calculated in accordance with Section 16-10.10.1. The increase in density\nshall be determined as follows:\na) The minimum lot size requirement for the applicable zoning district shall be subtracted\nfrom each lot that exceeds the minimum lot size, and the remainders totaled.\nb) The sum derived from the calculation in subdivision (1) shall be divided by the minimum\nlot size requirement. Fractions shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.\nc)\nThe product of the calculation in subdivision (2) shall yield the number of additional multi-\nfamily dwelling units that may be located within the portion of tract developed for multi-\nfamily purposes.\n10-5\n\n\nNEW PAGE 100\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n16-10.10.3. When a residential use is combined with a non-residential use in a business\ndistrict, the lot must have at least the minimum square footage required for the residential\nuse alone.\n16-10.10.4. When two principal uses are combined, the total amount of parking required for\nthe combination use shall be determined by cumulating the amount of parking required for\neach individual principal use according to the relative amount of space occupied by that use.\nSection 16-10.11. More Specific Use Controls. Whenever a development could fall within more\nthan one use classification in the Table of Permissible Uses, the classification that most closely\nand most specifically describes the development controls. For example, a small doctor's office\nor clinic clearly falls within the 3.110 classification (Office and service operations conducted\nentirely indoors and designed to attract customers or clients to the premises). However,\nclassification 3.130, \"Physicians and dentists offices and clinics occupying not more than 10,000\nsquare feet of gross floor area\" more specifically covers this use and therefore is controlling.\nSection 16-10.12. Short-Term Rentals. The Board finds that short-term rentals (STRs) are an\nappropriate use given the residential/resort character of Blowing Rock's planning jurisdiction,\nprovided that specific controls are in place to regulate parking, trash, noise, tenant safety, and\nother related effects thereby protecting neighborhood property values, and the health, safety,\nand the general welfare of Town citizens and visitors.\nShort-term rentals are defined as the rental, lease, or offer to make available, any attached or\ndetached residential dwelling unit, or portion thereof, by way of a rental agreement, lease,\nlicense, or any other means, (whether oral or written) for compensation or consideration, for a\nduration that is less than 28 consecutive days. The following standards shall apply to all short-\nterm rentals with the Town's planning jurisdiction:\na) A zoning permit must be initially obtained for a change in use for each dwelling unit that is to\nbe rented for a period of less than 28 days. The permit is not valid until a satisfactory\ninspection is completed.\nb) A local contact person or management company contact information must be clearly posted\non the interior of the dwelling unit, and the person/company shall be available to respond to\ncomplaints or emergencies within one (1) hour.\nc) Sufficient off-street parking must be provided for each bedroom to be rented. The parking\nspace must meet the minimum dimensional requirements in Section 16-20.6. Short-term\nrental units that exist on July 1, 2018, are grandfathered with respect to parking, but each\nbedroom added after this date requires an additional parking space.\nd) Adequate trash and recycling containers must be provided. If collection containers are kept\nin an enclosure bin, the bin must meet minimum design standards defined in the Town Code\n(ex. Placed within 6 to 12 feet of the edge of the street, opaque screening at least four feet\nhigh, etc.).\ne) The dwelling unit must be equipped with operable smoke detectors and carbon monoxide\ndetectors consistent with the NC Building Code.\nf)\nThe 911 address must be posted on the front of the house or dwelling unit with 3.5-inch\nreflective numbers (6-inch reflective number if commercial or multi-family) or on the\n10-6\n\n\nNEW PAGE 101\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nproperty according to Section 7-17 of the Town Code. The 911 address must be clearly posted\non the interior of the dwelling unit to notify tenants in case of emergency.\n16-10.12.1. In addition to those areas zoned to allow short-term rentals (CB, TC, GB, OI), there\nare other areas where short-term rentals are permissible including Chetola Resort and Royals\nOaks Condominiums (Overlay District). There are other properties that were previously\noperating short-term rentals or had permitted vested rights through Watauga or Caldwell\nCounty prior to being annexed or added to the Extraterritorial Jurisdiction. These properties\nhave a legal nonconforming status that provides the opportunity for short-term rental. Each\nproperty owner that applies for a zoning permit for short-term rental use in areas not\npermitted by right or listed herein must provide historical documentation that the\nnonconformity has been legally obtained or a vested right has been legally established under\nNCGS 160D-108.\n10-7\n\nNEW PAGE 102\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n10-8\n\nNEW PAGE 219\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nArticle 20 - Parking\nSection 16-20.1. Number of Parking Spaces Required. All developments in all zoning districts\nshall provide a sufficient number of parking spaces to accommodate the number of vehicles that\nordinarily are likely to be attracted to the development in question.\n16-20.1.1. The presumptions established by this article are that:\na) a development must comply with the parking standards set forth in 16-20.1.5 to satisfy\nthe requirement stated in Section 16-20.1, and\nb) any development that does meet these standards is in compliance. However, the Table\nof Parking Requirements is only intended to establish a presumption and should be flexibly\nadministered in accordance with Section 16-20.4.\n16-20.1.2. Uses in the Table of Parking Requirements [subsection (F)], are indicated by a\nnumerical reference keyed to the Table of Permissible Uses, Section 16-146. When\ndetermination of the number of parking spaces required by this table results in a requirement\nof a fractional space, any fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded, while a fraction in\nexcess of one-half shall be counted as one parking space.\n16-20.1.3. Whenever a building is constructed with the intention that it be used in whole or\nin part for use classification 2.210, 2.220, 3.120, or 3.220, the building shall be constructed\non the lot in such a manner that sufficient usable space remain on the lot to add the additional\nparking spaces that would be required to convert the use of the building entirely to use\nclassification 2.110, 2.210, 3.110, or 3.210. In addition, whenever a developer proposes to\nconstruct a building to be used for purposes that require a lesser number of parking spaces\nthan other uses to which the building might well be put at some future date, the\nadministrator shall inform the developer (and keep a record of such notification) that\nsufficient space should be left on the lot to add parking spaces at a later time if required.\n16-20.1.4. The Board recognizes that the Table of Parking Requirements set forth herein\ncannot and does not cover every possible situation that may arise. Therefore, in cases not\nspecifically covered, the permit-issuing authority is authorized to determine the parking\nrequirements using this table as a guide.\n20-1\n\n\nNEW PAGE 220\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n16-20.2.

For all other changes in use, no additional parking is required.\n16-20.3.2. A one-time addition of bathrooms, storage or equipment areas less than 250\nsquare feet is not required to provide additional parking.\n16-20.3.3. Short-term rentals that legally exist on or before July 1, 2018 are grandfathered\nwith respect to required parking. If any dwelling unit is expanded to add a bedroom that will\nbe used for short-term rentals, the owner must provide an off-street parking space that\nmeets the dimensional requirements of the Land Use Code.\nSection 16-20.4. Flexibility in Administration Required. The Board recognizes that, due to the\nparticularities of any given development, the inflexible application of the parking standards set\nforth in herein may result in a development either with inadequate parking spaces or parking\nspace far in excess of its needs. The former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking\nviolations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots. The latter\nsituation results in a waste of money as well as a waste of space that could more desirably be\nused for valuable development or environmentally useful open space. Therefore, as suggested in\nSection 16-20.1, the permit-issuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive\nrequirements of 16-20.2 and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever it finds\nthat such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in Section 16-20.1.\n16-20.4.1. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the permit-issuing authority may\nallow deviations from the parking requirements set forth in 16-20.1.5 when it finds that:\na) A residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly; or\nb) A business is primarily oriented toward walk-in trade.\n16-20.4.2. Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the\npresumptive parking requirements set forth in 16-20.2 it shall enter on the face of the permit\nthe parking requirement that it imposes and the reasons for allowing or requiring the\ndeviation.\n16-20.4.3. If the permit-issuing authority concludes, based upon information it receives in the\nconsideration of a specific development proposal, that the presumption established by\nSubsection 16-16-20.2 for a particular use classification is erroneous, it shall initiate a request\nfor an amendment to the Table of Parking Requirements in accordance with the procedures\nset forth in Article 20.\nSection 16-20.5. Payment of Fee in Lieu of Providing Required Parking Spaces. With respect to\nproperties within the TC, CB and O-I districts that are developed for commercial purposes, the\npermit-issuing authority may authorize the developer to forego the construction of parking\nspaces otherwise required on the developer's property pursuant to the provisions of this Article\nfor commercial uses if:\na) the permit-issuing authority finds that the parking needs of such development can be met by\npublic parking facilities that are located or expected to be constructed within a reasonable\ntime within reasonable proximity to the proposed development, and\nb)\nthe developer pays to the Town for each such space that is not constructed a fee in lieu of\nproviding that space in an amount determined as provided herein. This fee shall be paid\n20-8\n\n\nNEW PAGE 227\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nbefore an occupancy permit is issued to the development, unless the permit- issuing authority\nby condition establishes another time.\n16-20.5.1. The amount of the fee authorized by this section shall be determined by estimating\nthe cost of providing a paved parking space (including land and improvement costs) that\nmeets the requirements of this Article. This determination shall be made annually and the\nfee shall be included in the Miscellaneous Fees and Charges Schedule adopted by the Board\nof Commissioners.\n16-20.5.2. Any fees collected in accordance with this section shall be reserved and used\nexclusively to meet the purposes for which they have been obtained as specified above in\nSection 16-20.5.\n16-20.5.3. Any fee, or monetary contribution for development or a development approval\nnot specifically authorized by law, shall be returned plus interest of six percent (6%) per\nannum to the person who made the payment or as directed by a court if the person making\nthe payment is no longer in existence. (NCGS 160D-106)\nSection 16-20.6. Parking Space Dimensions. Each parking space shall contain a rectangular area\nat least nineteen feet long and nine feet wide. Lines demarcating parking spaces may be drawn\nat various angles in relation to curbs or aisles, so long as the parking spaces so created contain\nwithin them the rectangular area required by this section.\nWherever parking areas consist of spaces set aside for parallel parking, the dimensions of such\nparking spaces shall be not less than twenty-two feet by nine feet.\nSection 16-20.7. Required Widths of Parking Area Aisles and Driveways. Parking area aisle\nwidths shall conform to the following table, which varies the width requirement according to the\nangle of parking.\n16-20.7.1. Driveways shall be not less than ten feet in width for one way traffic and eighteen\nfeet in width for two-way traffic, except that ten feet wide driveways are permissible for two-\nway traffic when:\na) the driveway is less than fifty feet in length;\nb) it provides access to not more than six spaces; and\nc) sufficient turning space is provided so that vehicles need not back into a public street.\n16-20.7.2. Shared single-family driveways less than 75 feet in length, where permissible, may\nbe 10 feet in width for that portion of the driveway which is shared. If the shared portion of\nthe driveway is 75 feet or greater, the minimum width shall be 18 feet for the shared portion.\n16-20.7.3.

General Design Requirements. Unless no other practicable alternative is\navailable, vehicle accommodation areas shall be designed so that, without resorting to\nextraordinary movements, vehicles may exit such areas without backing onto a public street. This\nrequirement does not apply to parking areas consisting of driveways that serve one or two\ndwelling units although; backing onto arterial streets is discouraged.\n16-20.8.1. Vehicle accommodation areas of all developments shall be designed so that\nsanitation, emergency, and other public service vehicles can serve such developments\nwithout the necessity of backing unreasonable distances or making other dangerous or\nhazardous turning movements.\n16-20.8.2. Every vehicle accommodation area shall be designed so that vehicles cannot\nextend beyond the perimeter of such area onto adjacent properties or public rights-of-way.\nSuch areas shall also be designed so that vehicles do not extend over sidewalks or tend to\nbump against or damage any wall, vegetation, or other obstruction.\n16-20.8.3. Circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can proceed safely without\nposing a danger to pedestrians or other vehicles and without interfering with parking areas.\nSection 16-20.9. Vehicle Accommodation Area Surfaces. Vehicle accommodation areas that\ninclude lanes for drive-in windows or contain parking areas that are required to have more than\nten parking spaces and that are used regularly at least five days per week shall be graded and\nsurfaced with asphalt, concrete or other material that will provide equivalent protection against\npotholes, erosion, and dust. Driveways serving only 1 dwelling unit need not be paved.\nSpecifications for surfaces meeting the standard set forth in this subsection are contained in\nAppendix D.\n16-20.9.1. Vehicle accommodation areas that are not provided with the type of surface\nspecified in subsection (A) shall be graded and surfaced with crushed stone, gravel, or other\nsuitable material (as provided in the specifications set forth in Appendix D) to provide a\nsurface that is stable and will help to reduce dust and erosion. The perimeter of such parking\nareas shall be defined by bricks, stones, railroad ties, or other similar devices. In addition,\nwhenever such a vehicle accommodation area abuts a paved street, the driveway leading\nfrom such street to such area (or, if there is no driveway, the portion of the vehicle\naccommodation area that opens onto such streets), shall be paved as provided in subsection\n(A) for a distance of fifteen feet back from the edge of the paved street.\n16-20.9.2. The requirement of this Section shall not apply to driveways or turnouts serving\nonly single-family residences, duplexes, multi-family residences consisting of two dwelling\nunits, or other uses that are required to have only one or two parking spaces.\n16-20.9.3. Parking spaces in areas surfaced in accordance with Section 16-20.8 shall be\nappropriately demarcated with painted lines or other markings. Parking spaces in areas\nsurfaced in accordance with subsection 16-20.8.1 shall be demarcated whenever practicable.\nNotwithstanding the provisions of Article 8, all paved parking areas shall comply with this\nsubsection within six months after the effective date of this chapter.\n16-20.9.4. Vehicle accommodation areas shall be properly maintained in all respects. In\nparticular, and without limiting the foregoing, vehicle accommodation area surfaces shall be\n20-10\n\n\n Output:"}]}
