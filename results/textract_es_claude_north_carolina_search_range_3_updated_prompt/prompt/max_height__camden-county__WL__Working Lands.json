Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Working Lands\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"WL\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Working Lands\n(WL) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Working Lands (WL). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Working Lands (WL)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Working Lands\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

The\nWL\ndistrict is primarily intended to preserve and protect bona fide farms\nand resource lands for current or future agricultural use as well as to\nprotect the rural character of the area. One of the primary tools for\ncharacter protection is the requirement to configure residential\nsubdivisions of more than five lots as conservation subdivisions. The\nWorking\nconservation subdivision approach seeks to minimize the visibility of\nnew residential development from adjacent roadways through proper\nplacement and screening, and allows farmers to capture a portion of\nthe land's development potential while continuing to farm.\nLands\nConservation subdivisions allow a portion of a tract or site to be\ndeveloped with single-family detached homes while the balance of the\nsite is left as conservation or agricultural land. The district also\naccommodates a wide range of agricultural and agricultural-related\nuses like \"agri-tourism\" as well as service and support uses to the rural\ncommunity, including day care, educational uses, public safety\nfacilities, parks, and utility features.\nB.\nDimensional Requirements\nCamden County\n3-14\nLast Updated:\nUnified Development Ordinance\nAugust 1, 2022\nCELL (1, 1):
