Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Mixed Use\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MU-2\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Mixed Use\n(MU-2) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Mixed Use (MU-2). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Mixed Use (MU-2)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Mixed Use\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 74\nArticle 4 Zoning Districts\n4.5 Commercial Zoning Districts\n4.5.4.\nSpecial Standards in the MU-2 Zoning District\nD.\nOpen Space\nOpen space requirements for the residential portion of a multifamily or mixed commercial-residential\nproject shall be the same and conform to the requirements for multifamily developments in the MR-\n4-12\nCELL (1, 1):\nUse\nCELL (1, 2):\nDistrict\nCELL (1, 3):\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 4):\nMinimum\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 5):\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 6):\nMinimum\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 7):\nCELL (1, 8):\nYard\n(ft.)\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (2, 1):\nCELL (2, 2):\nCELL (2, 3):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 4):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 5):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 6):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 7):\nFront\nCELL (2, 8):\nRear\nCELL (2, 9):\nSide\nCELL (3, 1):\nAll residential, except\nCELL (3, 2):\nMU-2\nCELL (3, 3):\n60\nCELL (3, 4):\n60\nCELL (3, 5):\n6,000\nCELL (3, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (3, 7):\n25\u00b3\nCELL (3, 8):\n63\nCELL (3, 9):\n51,2\nCELL (4, 1):\nmultifamily\nCELL (4, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (4, 3):\n75\nCELL (4, 4):\n75\nCELL (4, 5):\n7,500\nCELL (4, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (4, 7):\n253\nCELL (4, 8):\n253\nCELL (4, 9):\n102\nCELL (5, 1):\nMultifamily/ Mixed\nCELL (5, 2):\nMU-2\nCELL (5, 3):\n100\nCELL (5, 4):\n150\nCELL (5, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (5, 6):\n15,000\nCELL (5, 7):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 8):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 9):\nCELL (6, 1):\ncommercial- residential\nCELL (6, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (6, 3):\n100\nCELL (6, 4):\n100\nCELL (6, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (6, 6):\n7,000\nCELL (6, 7):\nCELL (6, 8):\nCELL (6, 9):\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"CELL (2, 5):\\nWith\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 5):\\n6,000\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (2, 6):\\nWithout\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 6):\\n10,000\" 74]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"For district MU-2, the section provides the information for min_unit_size.

Preservation of\nopen space in developing areas serves a variety of purposes, including meeting the\nrecreational needs of residents, improving the aesthetic character of the community,\nreducing stormwater runoff, improving stormwater runoff water quality, and enhancing\nair quality. The standards set forth below establish regulations for open space.\n21.2 Open Space.\nAlthough open space can be agricultural or natural in character, sub-urban open space is\ntypically planned and developed as part of a development. The following standards are\nhereby established for open space, with the exception of the Main Street (MS) District\nwhich shall be exempt from the requirements of this section.\n21.2-1 Open space land area requirements. Open space shall be provided in accordance with\nthe following table 21.1 for:\n(A.) new residential development containing eight or more units,\n(B.) redevelopment or additional development that adds eight or more residential units,\n(C.) initial non-residential or mixed-use development greater than 0.6 acres, and\n(D.) re-development or additional development that adds 25 percent more non-residential\nor mixed-use floor area on a site that exceeds 0.6 acres within any 36-consecutive\nmonth period.\nTABLE 21.1\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 21 - Page 1\nCELL (1, 1): \nZONING DISTRICT\nCELL (1, 2): \nREQUIRED OPEN SPACE\nCELL (2, 1): \nResidential Uses/Districts.\nCELL (2, 2): \nSingle-family/and/or duplex subdivisions:\n5.0% of total subdivision project site area.\nOther residential: the greatest of 500 square\nfeet of open space per dwelling unit or 9% of\ntotal project site area.\nCELL (3, 1): \nAll other districts, excluding \"MS\" which\nis exempt from these requirements\nCELL (3, 2): \n7.5% of total project site area\n\nNEW PAGE 432\n21.2-2 Land designated as future open space. Regardless of the requirements and\nexemptions of this subsection, any portion of the site of the proposed development\nthat is designated as future open space or greenway in the Plan referenced in Section\n1.5 of this Ordinance, adopted by the Town of Chadbourn, as amended from time to\ntime, shall be reserved for open space. This area may be counted toward the total\namount of open space required for the development.\nIf the total amount of land designated as future open space or greenway is less than\nthe total amount of open space required for the development by Table 21.1, then the\ndeveloper shall provide additional open space to meet the requirement of Table 21.1.\nIf the amount of land designated as future open space or greenway exceeds the total\namount of open space required by Table 21.1, then the developer must provide the\nopen space designated in the official adopted plan.\nAs compensation for any open space dedication associated with implementing any\nofficial adopted plan above that requirement listed in Table 21.1, the developer is\neligible for a density bonus of one dwelling unit per each 4,356 square feet of land\narea in excess of that required in Table 21.1 or 500 square feet of non-residential\ngross floor area per each 2,178 square feet of land area in excess of that required in\nTable 21.1, up to a maximum of a fifteen (15%) percent increase above the maximum\ndensity or intensity allowed in the applicable zoning district. The density bonus in\nthe proposed development is limited to additional yield that can be configured with\nless than a ten (10%) percent reduction in(s) in lot area and/or setback dimensions\nspecified in Article 8.\n21.2-3 Minimum open space area. Individual areas designated as open space areas shall not\ncontain less than 500 square feet, although smaller areas may be approved by the\nPlanning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator if the intent of this Ordinance is\ndetermined to be met through the provision of bus/transit stops and/or mail kiosk.\n21.2-4 Improvement of open space. With the exception of Natural and Agricultural Open\nSpace, open space shall be planned and improved, accessible and usable by persons\nliving nearby. Improved shall mean cleared of underbrush and debris and shall\ncontain four or more of the following improvements: landscaping, walls/fences,\nwalks, statues, fountains, demarked ball fields, and/or playground equipment. Walls\nand fences shall be made of brick, stone, wrought iron, decorative aluminum or wood\nand shall not exceed 3.5 ft. in height with the following exceptions: fences used in\nconjunction with ball fields, tennis courts, swimming pools, and/or playgrounds.\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 21 - Page 2\n\n\nNEW PAGE 433\n21.2-5 Design and location. In major subdivisions and multi-building developments in all\nzoning districts, except Agricultural, open space shall be integrated into the design of\nthe site. In subdivisions where 50% or more of the lots are less than 0.75 acre in size,\nopen space shall be located within 1/4 mile of at least 90% of the building lots, as\nmeasured along the rights-of-way of streets providing access between the two. In\nsubdivisions where 50% or more of the lots are 0.75 acre or more in size, open space\nshall be located within 1/2 mile of at least 90% of the building lots, as measured along\nthe rights-of-way of streets providing access between the two.\n21.2-6 Focal point. Open space features shall provide focal points for the neighborhood. A\ncentral square or green, for example, may comprise a majority of the open space.\nThere shall be a variety of features provided in accessible open space within new\nneighborhoods SO that open space serves the needs of multiple age groups.\n21.2-7 Types of open space. Open space types include Squares, Parks, Forecourts, Plazas,\nGreenways, and Natural and Agricultural. Standards for these open space types are\nset forth below:\n(A.) Squares\nSquares are areas for passive recreational use. Squares shall be bounded by streets on\neither a minimum of three sides or 56% of their perimeter.\nSquares shall be used in high-density environments where residents have little yard\nspace. Squares are used to bring a natural landscape into a high-density environment.\nAs such, not more than 25% of a square should be impervious surface coverage.\nHardscaping shall be of an enhanced decorative finish to improve aesthetic impact for\npersons viewing and/or visiting the Square (example brick pavers or decorative\nconcrete edges instead of solid asphalt ribbon or broom finished concrete for\nwalkways).\nMin size: 500 sq. feet, unless approved per Section 21.2-3 of this Ordinance.\nMax Size: 4 acres\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 21 - Page 3\n\n\n Output:"}]}
