Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Highway Commercial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"HC\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Highway Commercial\n(HC) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Highway Commercial (HC). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Highway Commercial (HC)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Highway Commercial\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text.

The district\nhas been developed to protect the continuance of our rural areas and their customary development patterns\nand uses to prevent sacrificing environmentally sensitive landforms, natural vistas and scenic features.\n5.1.2: General Residential (GR)\nThe General Residential District is coded to permit the development of lower density single-family housing.\nSuch development has traditionally been found along the lakefront and in conventional subdivisions. For\ndevelopments located within a Watershed Overlay District see Section 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 for additional\nrequirements. The High Impervious Cover Option in the Lake Norman Overlay District as detailed in Section\n5.2.1 (B) (3) cannot be utilized in this District.\n5.1.3: Neighborhood Residential (NR)\nThe Neighborhood Residential (NR) district is coded to preserve a mixture of residential uses at medium\ndensities, along with schools and other civic uses normally found in a residential area. The street and open\nspace designs in these areas are used to create compatibility along frontages that encourage pedestrian\ninteraction and discourage high automobile speeds.\n5.1.4: Neighborhood Mixed Use (NMX)\nThe Neighborhood Mixed Use (NMX) district is coded to provide a mix of commercial and residential activities\nat the function center of neighborhoods. Small-scale multi-family developments may be allowed subject to a\nconditional zoning change. The NMX District should also encourage infill and redevelopment in established\nportions of the community and to serve as a transition between adjacent developed single-family uses and\nhigher-intensity non-residential uses.\n5.1.5: Waterfront Mixed Use (WMX)\nThe Waterfront Mixed Use (WMX) District is coded to allow for a mix of land uses in certain areas that is in\nproximity to Lake Norman, one of the region's most valuable natural resources and a focal point of Town\nactivity. The WMX District is established to assure quality development along the lake through four (4) main\nobjectives:\n1. To protect public access to the lake.\n2. To provide quality public spaces.\n3. To effect quality design and a variety of built forms that result in a pedestrian scale as well as\nunique architecture.\n4. To encourage a mix of uses that fosters a sense of community.\n5.1.6: Town Center (TC)\nThe Town Center district is coded to encourage the redevelopment and expansion of the traditional town\ncenter. This center is intended to serve as the civic, cultural, and governmental hub of activity for the Cornelius\ncommunity. Town Center minimum building heights are established along main corridors to ensure proper\nspatial definition and encourage strong pedestrian spaces. Transitions from Neighborhood Residential areas\nshould be accomplished through architectural design and streetscape treatment. Individual buildings are\nencouraged to be mixed vertically with street level commercial and upper level residential.\nLIUS\nTOWN OF CORNELIUS LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE\n5 - 1\n1/17/2023\n\n\nNEW PAGE 60\nCHAPTER 5 : ZONING & USE REGULATIONS\n5.1.7: Village Center (VC)\nThe Village Center district is coded to encourage the development of large-scale mixed-use districts that\ncompliment and serve the daily needs of adjoining neighborhoods and are supported by existing and planned\ntransportation networks constructed to support the traffic demands of both the auto and the pedestrian.\nBuilding heights ensure proper spatial definition, encourage strong pedestrian spaces and promote mixed use\nwithin buildings. Parking requirements may be satisfied using on-street parking, shared rear-lot parking areas\nor small scale parking lots adjacent to buildings. Buildings in the village center should have similar massing,\nvolume, frontage, scale, and architectural features. Transitions from residential areas should be accomplished\nthrough proper street design.\n5.1.8: Traditional Neighborhood (TN) - REPEALED June 7, 1999\nThe TN District exists on the current zoning map, but was repealed effective June 7, 1999 and the Code\nprovisions of the district have been consolidated into the Neighborhood Residential and Neighborhood Mixed\nUse Districts.\n5.1.9: Highway Commercial (HC)\nThe Highway Commercial district is coded to provide for the location of auto-oriented and auto-dependent\nuses and/or those uses which have a definable market area which extends beyond the scale of the\nNeighborhood, Village or Town Center. The intent of these provisions is to facilitate convenient access,\nminimize traffic congestion and reduce visual clutter along certain designated commercial corridors in the\nvicinity of the I-77 Exit 28 interchange and Statesville Road (US 21).\n5.1.10: Corporate Office (CO)\nThe Corporate Office District is coded to promote the establishment and operation of office uses with limited\ncommercial and limited residential activities. These districts, in some instances, may serve as transitions\nbetween residential districts and other commercial districts, and they shall provide business centers that\nprovide office uses at increased intensities to promote economic development. The district allows sufficient\nheight to make parking decks a more feasible option and it is hoped the use of height for density will facilitate\ngreater preservation of open space and natural features on these sites. The principal means of ingress and\negress for uses in the districts shall be along collector roads, minor arterials and/or major arterials.\n5.1.11: Business Campus (BC)\nThe Business Campus district is coded to permit the development of campus-style developments that may\ninclude corporate office parks, supporting commercial, and light industrial uses. Because of the presence of a\nhigh number of employees, these developments should be designed in a manner that is pedestrian friendly.\nBusiness Campus districts should consist of institutions of varying types and coordinated office developments.\nThe Business Campus will also function in support of transit opportunities allowing workers and visitors access\nto the facility by permitting the use of parking decks and bus stops.\n5.1.12: Industrial Campus (IC)\nIndustrial Campus districts are coded to permit the development of light industries. Such developments are\ntypically too large in scale to fit within a neighborhood environment and should be buffered from surrounding\nneighborhood uses.\nTOWN OF CORNELIUS LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE\n5 - 2\n1/17/2023\n\n\nNEW PAGE 61\nCHAPTER 5 ZONING & USE REGULATIONS\nSECTION 5.2: OVERLAY DISTRICTS\n5.2.1: Lake Norman Overlay (LN-O)\nIn order to address a moderate to high land use intensity pattern, single-family residential uses are allowed at\na maximum of two (2) dwelling units per acre or 21,780 square feet excluding street right-of-way.
