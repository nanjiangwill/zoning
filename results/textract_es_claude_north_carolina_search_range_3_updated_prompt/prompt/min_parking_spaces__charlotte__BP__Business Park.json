Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Business Park\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"BP\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Business Park\n(BP) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Business Park (BP). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Business Park (BP)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Business Park\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

Additional development\nrequirements for the BP district are specified below:\n(a)\nMinimum required open space. At least 20 percent of every project in the\nbusiness park district must be devoted to permanent open space. This area\nmust be used for landscaping, lawns, screening, or buffer areas. It may\nnot contain any parking or loading areas, outdoor storage, trash handling,\nor utility or service areas. The area devoted to the minimum project edge\nrequirement may be counted toward this requirement.\n(b)\nUtility lines underground. All utility lines such as electric, telephone,\nCATV, or other similar lines must be installed underground, unless the\nfollowing criteria are met:\n(i)\nThe power lines existed above ground at the time of first approval\nof a plat or development plan by the local government, whether or\nnot the power lines are subsequently relocated during construction\nof the subdivision or development plan.\n(ii)\nThe power lines are located outside the boundaries of the parcel of\nland that contains the subdivision or property covered by the\ndevelopment plan.\nThis requirement applies to lines serving individual sites as well as to\nsecurity and street lighting within the project. However, distribution lines\nwhich serve the entire site may be located above ground. All utility boxes,\ntransformers, meters, and similar structures must be screened from public\nview.\n(c)\nOutdoor storage is permitted. Outdoor storage is permitted as an\naccessory use on any individual lot. Any such storage must be completely\nscreened from adjoining development within and without the site as well\nas from the general public. The screening must be effective at the time\nthat it is installed, even if plant materials are used for all or part of the\nscreening. Access through the screening for vehicles is permitted, but is\nlimited to one 30-foot wide location per-street frontage. All setbacks and\nyards must be observed for outside storage areas. In no case may the\namount of land area devoted to outside storage exceed 20 percent of the\nlot area.\n(d)\nCovenants required. The developer of any business park project must\nestablish restrictive covenants for the entire project area. The restrictive\ncovenants must be submitted to show compliance, but will not be\nreviewed as to form, legality, or methods of enforcement. Those\n9-127\n\n\n Output:"}]}
