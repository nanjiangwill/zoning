Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Village Infill\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"VI-O\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Village Infill\n(VI-O) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Village Infill (VI-O). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Village Infill (VI-O)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Village Infill\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

DESCRIPTION\nThe Village Infill Planning Area comprises Davidson's traditional, residential\nneighborhoods and provides for infill development surrounding the historic town\ncenter. Streets, sidewalks and greenways in the Village Infill Planning Area must be\ninterconnected. A range of housing types is encouraged: For Master Plan projects on\nlots over three acres a mix of at least two different building types is encouraged.\nAdditionally, small retail establishments are permitted on corner lots, with restrictions.\nThis encourages the provision of small-scale retail and service uses for surrounding\nresidential areas. Buildings are restricted in size to promote a local orientation, to be\npedestrian-oriented, to be compatible with the scale of surrounding residences, and to\nlimit any adverse impacts on residential development.\nB.

In front of the building line the maximum height of retaining walls is\nthree feet. Taller retaining walls may be tiered, with a minimum two foot separation\nbetween walls.\nE\nLoading/Service Areas, Mechanical Equipment and Utilities:\n1.\nLoading facilities, loading docks, service doors, and other service areas shall not be\nlocated along a primary street-facing fa\u00e7ade, nor visible from a park or public open\nspace.\n2.\nMechanical equipment (except small items such as fans and vents), utility meters,\nstorage areas, solid waste containers (including dumpsters, compactors, recycling\ncontainers, and solid waste and recycling handling areas), transformers, generators,\nHVAC units and similar features, or other utility hardware on the building, roof, or\nground shall be screened from public view with materials similar to the structure;\nOR they shall be so located as not to be visible from a primary fronting public street.\nIn certain cases, screening using natural materials may be preferable. See Section 9\nfor landscape screening requirements. Note: Natural screening alternatives must be\napproved by the Planning Director in consultation with the Arborist.\n3. Screening is not required for electronic vehicle charging stations.\n4. Off-street parking shall not be located forward of the front fa\u00e7ade of the building\nunless on a corner lot. On a corner lot, parking may not be located in front of the\nfacade on the primary street. See Section 8 for more information on parking.\n5.\nUnderground Utilities: All utilities must be underground from the point of\nconnection. See Davidson Municipal Code for right-of-way restrictions.\nF.\nEncroachments: Certain structures shall be permitted to encroach within the minimum\nrequired setbacks established in the respective planning areas in Section 2 as specified\nbelow:\n1.\nHedges, garden walls, or fences may encroach within minimum required setbacks up\nto the property lines.\n2. Cornices may encroach up to two feet within any required minimum setback.\n3. Detached house, attached house, and townhouse building types may have:\na.\nRear decks that encroach up to eight feet into the rear setback.\nb.\nBalconies, stairs, stoops, open porches, bay windows, and awnings that\nencroach up to five feet into the minimum front setback area of the lot.\nC.\nOutdoor swimming pools that encroach to within five feet of any side or rear\nproperty line.\n4. Ramps for handicap accessibility and fire escapes required by the North Carolina\nState Building Code may encroach within any required minimum setback, but may\nnot be closer than three feet to any property line.\n5.\nRequired street lighting and any landscape lighting may encroach into a minimum\nrequired setback.\nG. Development Plans with Multiple Buildings\n1.\nIn order to encourage pedestrian activity, buildings should be grouped together\n4-4\nDAVIDSON PLANNING ORDINANCE\n07.01.21\n\n\nNEW PAGE 128\nSite & Building Design Standards 4.3 General Site Design Requirements\nor attached along the primary fronting street or along an internal network of\ninterconnecting streets.\n2. Building sites should be clustered in order to minimize their impact on the landscape\nand preserve views and historical features.\nH. Public Spaces\nPublic spaces are required or encouraged in mixed-use, commercial, or employment nodes\nbased upon the requirements of the specific planning area. The design and location of urban\nopen space on a site is important factor in a successful pedestrian environment. To ensure\nthat the open space is well-used, it is essential to locate and design it carefully in accordance\nwith the following general standards:\nUrban open spaces shall be fronted by streets and buildings to encourage its use\nand its safety.\nThe space shall be located where it is visible and easily accessible from homes and\npublic areas (building entrances, streets, sidewalks).\nThe space should be located to take views and sun exposure into account.\nThe space shall be well-buffered from moving cars so that users can enjoy and relax\nin the space.\nThe space shall be visible from streets or internal drives, but should not be wholly\nexposed to them.\nThe space shall be partially enclosed with building walls, freestanding walls,\nlandscaping, raised planters, or on-street parking to help buffer it and create a\ncomfortable \"outdoor room.\"\nSee Section 7, Parks and Open Space, for additional information.\nI. Exceptions\nExceptions from the site and building design standards established in this section may be\napproved by the Planning Director to preserve mature trees and natural features.\n4.3.2 GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPMENT OR REDEVELOPMENT IN EXISTING BUILDINGS\nThis section is intended to ensure the compatibility of infill development and redevelopment\nto surrounding neighborhoods and shall apply to new construction and the expansion of\nexisting buildings. As a means to provide guidance for the design of buildings that integrate\nwell into the context of Davidson, this section identifies the following key features necessary\nto ensure compatibility. When developing in the Village Infill Planning Area, in addition to\nthe standards below, see Section 2 for development in the Village Infill Overlay District.\nD. Street Frontage: Street trees should be preserved.\nE.\nRhythm of Development along the Street: Established building rhythms along\nstreet frontages should be continued. Larger buildings can be integrated into\nsmaller-scale neighbohrhoods by creating repetitive bays with facade articulation.\nF. Building Orientation: Main entrances, and other primary building fa\u00e7ade elements\nshould be oriented toward the street. Courtyard buildings should orient main\nentrances toward courtyards that open to the street and serve as a semi-public\nextension of the public realm.\nG. Front Setback Patterns: Established building setback patterns should be continued\nTown of Davidson, NC\nDAVIDSON PLANNING ORDINANCE\n4-5\n\n\nNEW PAGE 129\nSite\n&\nBuilding\nDesign Standards | 4.4 General Building Design Requirements\nas practical. Deep front setbacks can compromise the pedestrian realm.\nH. Building Form: Massing, proportion, scale, setbacks, spaces between buildings, and\ntheir relative positions should be used to integrate new development into existing\nstreetscapes.\nI.\nDensity: Density should increase closer to mixed use and commercial nodes.\nJ.\nBuilding Design: Buildings should be designed to respect the existing built\nenvironment, but not be explicit reproduction of past historical styles.\n4.4 GENERAL BUILDING DESIGN REQUIREMENTS\nThis section shall apply to all buildings, excluding the detached house, and accessory\nstructure building types. For requirements for these building types see Specific Building Type\nRequirements, Section 4.5.\n4.4.1 STANDARDS\nThe design of buildings should be complementary with prevalent architectural features\nof the surrounding neighborhood, especially in areas where patterns established by\nrecurring architectural features are well-documented and valued.\nA. Building Height\n1. Building height, as established in each respective planning area in Section 2, is\nmeasured as the number of stories in a building. A story is a habitable level in a\nbuilding.\n2. The following elements shall not be calculated as stories:\na. Under-roof areas less than seven feet clear height with dormers.\nb. Unoccupied residential attics less than seven feet above the leaves.\nC.\nRaised basements less than four feet exposed at the lowest grade at the front\nfa\u00e7ade.\nd. Mezzanines\n3.\nBuilding height is measured from the finished floor elevation of the fa\u00e7ade facing the\nstreet to the ridgeline or the highest point of the roof (where there is no ridgeline),\nexcluding chimneys and basements, excepting raised basements described above.\nUnless specifically stated elsewhere in this ordinance, the height requirements\nestablished in this ordinance shall not apply to:\na.\nBuilding elements (such as church spires, belfries, cupolas, domes, parapets, etc.)\nwhich are not intended for human occupancy;\nb. Mechanical penthouses which are set back at least 20 feet from the front\nelevation of the building.\n4.\nThis ordinance requires buildings, excluding detached and attached house building\ntypes, to be at least two stories. The following exceptions are permitted:\n4-6\nDAVIDSON PLANNING ORDINANCE\n07.01.21\n\n\n Output:"}]}
