Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Highway Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"HB\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Highway Business\n(HB) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Highway Business (HB). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Highway Business (HB)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Highway Business\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft).

In the General Business, Highway\nBusiness, or Industrial districts, no fence shall exceed 10 feet in height.\nNo fence shall be built nor shall any vegetation be grown that significantly impairs vision within ten feet\nof a street or highway right-of-way.\n152.140 SCREENING AND BUFFER REQUIREMENTS\nMulti-family, commercial, and industrial uses may be required by the Planning Board to provide a buffer\nand/or screening as defined in this chapter. If existing vegetation is equal to or above the requirements\nof this chapter, additional vegetation may not be required.\nBuffers shall be required for solid waste collection dumpsters, which are (i) located on sites used for\nmulti-family residential, commercial, or industrial purposes and (ii) abutting a residence, residentially\nzoned lot, or street right-of-way shall be screened from the view of adjoined residences, residentially\nzoned lots, or street rights-of-way. Such screening may consist of natural vegetation, fences, walls, or\nberms and shall be installed, located, or constructed so as to create an effective screen.\nBuffers shall be required for multi-family residential uses when three (3) or more multi-family\nresidential dwelling units are proposed to be located directly abutting a property which is used for\nsingle-family residential purposes.\n152.141 FRONT YARD SETBACKS FOR DWELLINGS\nIf the average setback of existing dwellings on lots located immediately adjacent to and on both sides of\nthe vacant lot, or within 100 feet, whichever is closer, is less than the minimum required front yard\ndepth, then the Zoning Administrator or his/her designee may grant an exception to the front yard\nsetback requirement. In no manner shall the vacant lot owner's front yard be less than 50% its original\nrequired front yard depth setback according to its zoning classification. In the event that the vacant lot\nowner desires a greater reduction in the front yard setback than the exception allows, the owner may\nrequest a variance from the Board of Adjustment.\n152.142 MINIMUM LOT SIZE\nNo yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this chapter shall be reduced in dimension or area below\nthe minimum requirements set forth herein. Yards or lots created after the effective date of this chapter\nshall meet at least the minimum requirements established by this chapter, unless otherwise stated.\n152.143 NUMBER OF PRINCIPAL BUILDINGS PER LOCATION\nEvery principal building hereafter erected, established or moved shall be located on a separate lot and in\nno case shall there be more than one principal building on a lot.

It shall be unlawful to camp on any\nrights-of-way, environmental sensitive areas, beaches, or government property.\n152.145 SETBACK REQUIREMENTS EXCLUDE FENCES AND RETAINING WALLS\nThe setback requirements of these regulations shall not prohibit any necessary retaining wall or prohibit\nany wall or fence.
