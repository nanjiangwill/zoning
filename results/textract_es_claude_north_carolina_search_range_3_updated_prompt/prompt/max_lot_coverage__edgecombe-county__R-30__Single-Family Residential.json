Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Single-Family Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-30\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Single-Family Residential\n(R-30) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Single-Family Residential (R-30). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Single-Family Residential (R-30)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Single-Family Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage refers solely to the maximum lot coverage of buildings for primary use and all accessory structures. Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

The building area coverage shall be the dimensional standards of the applicable zoning District (i.e., R-7500, C-LD, etc.). However, the\ndeveloped area may be increased as a result of utilizing exceptional design and/or best management practices as provided in Section 6.1,\nDesign Flexibility.

Buildings\nhave a wide range of sizes and heights, based on their function. The district also accommodates the\nancillary service uses necessary to support the predominant office and institutional development but is\nnot intended as a retail district. Retail, personal service, and other commercial uses permitted as\naccessory to an office or institutional use should not occupy more than ten percent of the floor area\nand should be configured to minimize visibility from off-site areas. The OI district also serves as a\ntransition area between higher intensity commercial uses and nearby lower density single-family\nresidential neighborhoods. In order to maintain compatibility with surrounding uses and ensure a high\nquality of development, all activities shall comply with the standards in Article 6.

LAND USES\n$4.3. Principal Use Standards\n1. An application for the establishment of a solar energy conversion use shall include a map\nshowing a radius of five nautical miles from the center of the use with any airport\noperations highlighted.\n2. Written notification of the intention to request a solar energy conversion use permit shall\nbe provided by the applicant to North Carolina Commanders Council for consideration of\npotential impacts to low altitude military flight paths. Notice shall be provided at 30 days\nprior to the hearing for a special use permit or 45 days prior to construction in cases where\na special use permit is not required. Notification shall include the location of the use (i.e., a\nmap, coordinates, address, or parcel ID), the proposed technology (i.e., roof-mounted PV,\nground-mounted fixed PV, tracked PV, solar thermal, etc.), and the size of the use in acres.\nProof of delivery of notification and date of delivery shall be submitted with permit\napplication.\nG.\nSOLAR GLARE HAZARD TO AVIATION ANALYSIS\n1. The applicant shall prepare an analysis of the glare hazard from the solar energy conversion\nuse in accordance with the latest version of the Solar Glare Hazard Analysis Tool (SGHAT).\n2.\nThe full report for each flight path and observation point, as well as the contact information\nfor the Zoning Administrator, shall be sent to the following authorities by the applicant at\nleast 30 days prior to the hearing for a special use permit or 45 days prior to construction in\ncases where a special use permit is not required:\ni. The appropriate airport operations official at the airport in the National Plan of\nIntegrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) within five nautical miles of the proposed solar\nenergy conversion use;\nii. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Airport District Office (ADO) with oversight\nof North Carolina; and\niii. The appropriate airport operations official at any airport not in the NPIAS, including\nmilitary airports, within five nautical miles within five nautical miles of the proposed\nsolar energy conversion use.\n3. Proof of delivery of notification and date of delivery shall be submitted with permit\napplication.\n4. Any applicable design changes (e.g., module tilt, module reflectivity, etc.) after initial\nsubmittal shall be rerun in the SGHAT tool and a new report shall be sent without undue\ndelay to the parties identified above for accurate records of the as-built system.\nH.\nSOLAR ENERGY CONVERSION USE REQUIREMENTS\nThese requirements are in addition to height, setback, aviation notification and applicable\ndistrict standards.\n1. SITE PLAN\nA site plan shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator demonstrating compliance with:\ni. All applicable setback and height limitations;\nii. Applicable zoning district requirements such as lot coverage;\niii. Applicable solar requirements in these standards; and\niv. Notification of intent to relevant utility.\n2. VISIBILITY\ni. A solar energy conversion use shall be surrounded by a type C opaque buffer regardless\nof the district it is located in.\nii. Signage shall be limited solely to security and safety signage.\niii. Any exterior lighting shall be limited to security lighting and shall be motion sensor\ncontrolled.\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage\n273\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n\n\n Output:"}]}
