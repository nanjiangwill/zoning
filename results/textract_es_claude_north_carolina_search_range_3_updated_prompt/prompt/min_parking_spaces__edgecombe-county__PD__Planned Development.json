Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Planned Development\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"PD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Planned Development\n(PD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Planned Development (PD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Planned Development (PD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Planned Development\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

LAND USES\n$4.2. Principal Uses\n$4.2. PRINCIPAL USES\n4.2.1. PRINCIPAL USE TABLE\nA.\nTABLE STRUCTURE\n1. GENERALLY\nTable 4.2.1, Principal Use Table, lists use categories, principal use types and indicates\nwhether the principal use type is permitted by-right, by a special use permit, or is prohibited\nin a particular zoning district. It also includes a reference to any applicable use standards\nthat apply to a particular principal use.\n2. USE CLASSIFICATIONS\ni.\nIndividual principal uses in the principal use table are organized into one of the\nfollowing five different use classifications, based upon their characteristics: Agricultural;\nCommercial; Industrial; Institutional; and Residential.\nii. Use classifications are more generally described in Section $4.7, Unlisted Uses.\n3. USE CATEGORIES\ni. Each of the five use classifications includes a series of use categories. Use categories\nare groupings of similar use types that are grouped based on similar purposes or\nfunctional characteristics.\nii.\nIndividual use types listed in the table of principal use types are listed in alphabetical\norder by use category.\niii. Use categories are more generally described in Section $4.7, Unlisted Uses.\n4. USE STANDARDS\nThe right-most column of the table includes a reference to any applicable use standards\nassociated with a particular use type. Unless otherwise stated in the standards, a use\nstandard applies to a particular use regardless of the zoning district where it is located.\nB.\nUSES PERMITTED BY RIGHT\n1. A \"P\" in a cell of the principal use table indicates that the specific use type is permitted by-\nright in the corresponding zoning district, subject to compliance with any referenced use\nstandards and any other applicable standards in this Ordinance.\n2. By-right uses require issuance of a zoning compliance permit or building permit prior to\nestablishment and may also require approval of a site plan (see Section 2.3.19, Site Plan).\nC.\nUSES PERMITTED BY SPECIAL USE PERMIT\nAn \"S\" in a cell of the principal use table indicates that the specific use type is permitted in the\ncorresponding zoning district only upon approval of a special use permit in accordance with\nSection 2.3.20, Special Use Permit. Special uses must also comply with any referenced use\nstandards and any other applicable standards in this Ordinance.\nD.\nUSES ALLOWED IN A PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT\n1. An \"A\" in a cell of the principal use table indicates that the specific use type is allowable in a\nplanned development district, provided the specific use type is included in the list of\npotential use types in the master plan or terms and conditions document approved as part\nof the zoning map amendment establishing the planned development district.\n2. Allowed uses are subject to any referenced use standards identified in the principal use\ntable.\n3. If a use type is listed as prohibited in a planned development district in the summary use\ntable, it shall not be included in a master plan or terms and conditions document.\nE.\nUSES NOT PERMITTED\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage\n229\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n\n\nNEW PAGE 230\nARTICLE 4. LAND USES\n$4.2. Principal Uses\nAn \".\" symbol in a cell of the summary use table indicates that the specific use type is not\npermitted in the corresponding zoning district.\nF.\nCHANGE OF USE\n1. Several of the provisions in this Ordinance are applied at the time of a change in use. For\nthe purposes of this Ordinance, each of the following shall constitute a \"change in use:\"\ni.\nWhen an existing principal use is replaced by a new principal use that is of a different\nuse classification, use category, or use type designation (see Section $4.7, Unlisted\nUses);\nii. When an existing principal use that is conducted entirely indoors becomes conducted\nentirely outdoors, or vice versa;\niii. When an existing use type that is a nonconfoming use changes to a different use type\nthat is also nonconforming, regardless of whether the newer nonconforming use is\nmore intense than the prior nonconforming use;\niv. Any change in an existing use or development site that triggers the application of a\ndiffering set of building code requirements, such as the switch from residential\nrequirements to non-residential or combined use requirements;\nV. When an existing principal use intensifies or expands (with or without a shift in the use\ntype) in a manner that increases the average daily trips associated with the use by 100\npercent or more; and\nvi. If a combined or multiple principal use is changed in ways where the mixture of use\ntypes changes or where the relative proportion of floor area devoted to one of the\nexisting use types is modified to the extent that the total minimum off-street parking\nstandards for the entire development are changed.\n2. Conversion from one use type to the same use type under the same or a different owner is\nnot a change in use. Additions or expansions of an existing use may require the need for\ncompliance with development or design standards in this Ordinance.\n3. Changes of use type within a planned development district do not constitute a change in\nuse provided the new use types is identified in the planned development terms and\nconditions document. The addition of a new or unlisted use types within a planned\ndevelopment shall require an amendment to the planned development district.\n4.\nAddition or conversion of secondary uses or the operation of a temporary use does not\nconstitute a change in principal use.\nG.\nCOMBINATION OR MULTIPLE PRINCIPAL USES\nDevelopments with combination or multiple principal uses, such as shopping centers, shall:\n1. Incorporate only those use types allowed in the applicable zoning district;\n2. Comply with all the use standards that apply to each use type in the development; and\n3. Comply with the required method of establishment for the use type identified in Table 4.2.1,\nPrincipal Use Table.\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage\n230\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n\n\nNEW PAGE 231\nARTICLE 4.

STREETSCAPE BUFFERS\nA.\nPURPOSE AND INTENT\nStreetscape buffers are proposed to soften the view of development from the arterial and\ncollector street rights-of-way, and are intended to:\n1. Enhance pedestrian orientation and encourage pedestrian travel;\n2. Address urban heat islands by providing shade for streets and sidewalks;\n3. Provide shade on pavement;\n4. Support property values by enhancing the aesthetic character of the community; and\n5. Provide habitat for flora and fauna.\nB.\nAPPLICABILITY\n1. The standards in this section shall apply to all lot lines bounded by the following features,\nwhether existing or identified in the County's adopted policy guidance.\ni. Collector streets; and\nii. Arterial streets.\n2. In cases where a future street is planned but its approximate location is not indicated on an\nadopted or approved County map or plan, streetscape buffering shall not be required on\nlots abutting the future street alignment.\nC.\nEXEMPTION\n1. Streetscape buffers are not required along lot lines abutting the following features:\ni. Driveways, private drives, or alleys;\nii. Lot lines abutting platted street rights-of-way that are or have remained unopened for\nat least 15 years; or\niii. Lot frontages where the entirety of the lot frontage is within a required sight distance\ntriangle.\n2. Development providing street trees in accordance with Section 6.5.11, Street Trees, is not\nrequired to provide streetscape buffers.\nD.\nREQUIRED PLANT MATERIAL\nStreetscape buffers shall be configured in one of the following three ways (see Figure 6.5.10,\nStreetscape Buffer Configuration):\n1. Three canopy trees for every 100 linear feet of lot frontage; or\n2. Two canopy trees and two understory trees for every 100 linear feet of lot frontage; or\n3. Four understory trees for every 100 linear feet, where overhead utilities are present.\nE.\nPLACEMENT\n1. Vegetation required as part of a streetscape buffer shall be located outside the street right-\nof-way.\n2. Canopy trees shall be located within ten feet of the right-of-way edge.\n3. Understory trees shall be located within five feet of the right-of-way edge.\n4. An alternative location may be approved by the Zoning Administrator in cases where\nunderground utilities, drainage easements, topography, or other obstructions make\nplacement of streetscape buffer vegetation in accordance with these standards impractical.\nF.\nPROHIBITED FEATURES\nOff-street parking, off-street loading, merchandise display, or outdoor storage shall not take\nplace within a required streetscape buffer.\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage\n393\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n\nNEW PAGE 394\nARTICLE 6.
