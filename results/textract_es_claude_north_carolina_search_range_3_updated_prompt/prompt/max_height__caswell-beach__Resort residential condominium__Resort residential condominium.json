Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Resort residential condominium\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"Resort residential condominium\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Resort residential condominium\n(Resort residential condominium) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Resort residential condominium (Resort residential condominium). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Resort residential condominium (Resort residential condominium)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Resort residential condominium\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

The minimum lot area requirements, in thousands of\nsquare feet, is indicated by the numerical identification of each district.\n(C) Multi-family residential district (R-20MF). The purpose of the R-20MF multi-family district is to provide for low density\napartment development in areas which would be unsuited for multi-family use on a higher density.

The official zoning map shall be kept in the office of the Town Clerk and made available to the\npublic in read only format.
