Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Heavy Industry Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"HIO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Heavy Industry Overlay\n(HIO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Heavy Industry Overlay (HIO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Heavy Industry Overlay (HIO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Heavy Industry Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

Conditional zoning affords a degree of certainty in\nland use decisions not possible when rezoning to a Primary General Use District.\nAdditional standards and regulations, mutually agreed upon in writing by the Town of\nCoats and the petitioner, may be attached to a proposed development to ensure\ncompatibility with the surrounding uses and with applicable adopted plans in\naccordance with the requirements of this section.\n5.4-2 Conditional zoning districts.\nConditional zoning is available for any of the Primary General Use or Overlay\nDistrict classifications enumerated in Article 8 of this Ordinance, except for those that\nrequire a site-specific development plan as part of the application (e.g., Traditional\nNeighborhood Development (TNDO) Overlay District, Heavy Industry (HIO)\nOverlay District). The conditional zoning designation shall be indicated on all zoning\nmaps and other official documents with the suffix, \"(CZ)\" and enumerated to\nreference the ordinance on record of the approval (e.g. \"MU-1(CZ-2021-01), Ord.\n#2021-99\").\n5.4-3 General requirements.\nThe following provisions shall apply in the administration of conditional zoning:\n(A) A conditional zoning application shall be considered only upon request of the\nowner of the affected property or a duly authorized representative of the property\nowner demonstrated by written, signed and notarized documentation.\n(B) Applicant shall meet with representatives of the surrounding property owners and\nof the surrounding neighborhood(s) to discuss the proposed development, and include\na report of any such meetings in accordance with Section 5.3-1(B) of this Article to\nthe Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator.\n(C) All standards and requirements of the corresponding Primary General Use District\nshall be met, except to the extent that the conditions imposed by the conditional\nzoning are more restrictive than the general use standards.\n(D) No uses shall be permitted except those enumerated in the ordinance adopting the\nconditional zoning.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 5 - Page 9\n\n\nNEW PAGE 92\n(E) The conditions agreed upon pursuant to the Conditional Zoning approval shall be\nstated in the adopting ordinance and may limit the uses which are permitted on the\nproperty. By way of illustration and not limitation, conditions may specify location on\nthe property of the proposed structure(s), the number of dwelling units, the location\nand extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways, and access streets,\nthe location and extent of buffer areas and other special purpose areas, the timing of\ndevelopment, the height of structures, the location and extent of rights-of-way and\nother areas to be dedicated for public purposes, and other such matters as may be\nidentified as appropriate for the proposed development.\n(F) Minor modifications to the approved Conditional Zoning ordinance may be\napproved by the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator per authorization\nunder G.S. 160D-703(b). The minor modifications authorized herein are intended to\nprovide relief where conditions established by the Conditional Zoning ordinance\ncreate a hardship based upon a unique physical attribute of the property itself or some\nother factor unique to the property which was not known at the time of ordinance\nadoption and which has subsequently rendered the property difficult or impossible to\nuse due to the condition(s) imposed by the zoning. The permit holder shall bear the\nburden of proof to secure the modification(s). Such modifications shall be limited to\nthe following:\n1. A deviation of up to ten percent or 24 inches, whichever is greater, from the\napproved setback, provided that the conditions for approving a deviation from\nthe required setback established by Article 14 (Flexible Development\nStandards) of this Ordinance are met.\n2. A reduction of up to 25 percent in the number of parking spaces required for\nthe use provided that the proposed development is located within 1/2 mile of\neither the Main Street District (MS) or the Mixed Use (MU-1 and MU-2) and\non-street parking is available.\n3. Any other minor modification in accordance with the limitations and\nprocedures prescribed in this Ordinance, unless restricted by G.S. 160D-\n703(b), or the Conditional Zoning ordinance adopted pursuant to this section\nspecifies otherwise.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 5 - Page 10\n\n\nNEW PAGE 93\nAny other modifications must be approved by the Board of Commissioners as an\namendment to the Conditional Zoning ordinance, and may be referred to the Planning\nBoard or Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator as appropriate. The\nPlanning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator shall in every case have the discretion\nto decline to exercise the power to approve or deny modifications as provided for\nherein, and may require the applicant to seek an amendment to the Conditional\nZoning ordinance.\n(G) Any violation of a provision of a Conditional Zoning ordinance shall be treated\nthe same as any other violation of this Ordinance and shall be subject to the same\nremedies and penalties as any other such violation.\n(H) If for any reason any provision of a Conditional Zoning ordinance is found to be\nillegal or invalid, or if the applicant should fail to accept any condition, the entire\nConditional Zoning ordinance shall be null and void, and the property shall revert to\nits previous zoning classification without further action by the Board of\nCommissioners.\n(I) If no formal action (e.g. construction plan submittal, permit application, etc.) has\nbeen taken to begin the development of the property in accordance with the\nConditional Zoning ordinance within 24 months of its approval by Board of\nCommissioners, or no vested right has been obtained, then the property shall revert to\nits previous zoning classification, or the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision\nAdministrator may initiate appropriate action to rezone the affected property to any\nother classification deemed consistent with \"The Plan\" referenced in Article 1 of this\nOrdinance, including subsequent amendments adopted by the Board of\nCommissioners of the Town of Coats and other applicable adopted plans.\n(J) If the use or uses commenced pursuant to a Conditional Zoning ordinance adopted\npursuant to this section are abandoned or discontinued or no vested right has been\nobtained then the property shall revert to its previous zoning classification, or the\nPlanning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator may initiate appropriate action to\nrezone the affected property to any other classification deemed consistent with \"The\nPlan\" referenced in Article 1 of this Ordinance, including subsequent amendments\nadopted by the Board of Commissioners of the Town of Coats and other applicable\nadopted plans.\n(K) No variances or special use permits may be issued for developments on property\nthat is subject to a Conditional Zoning ordinance.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 5 - Page 11\n\nNEW PAGE 253\nmaintenance purposes.
