Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Uptown Mixed Use District\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"UMUD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Uptown Mixed Use District\n(UMUD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Uptown Mixed Use District (UMUD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Uptown Mixed Use District (UMUD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Uptown Mixed Use District\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

These uses provide substantial non-office employment base\nas well as meeting certain needs in the community for industrial type goods and\nservices. There are however, some industrial facilities, which have either lost\ntheir utility or impact negatively on nearby residential areas, which must be\naddressed. Therefore, in accordance with the adopted Central Area Plan, this\ndistrict is intended to encourage and permit the continuation of a significant non-\noffice employment base, to enable the development of new industrial uses\ncompatible with the objectives of the Central Area Plan, and to restrict those\nindustrial uses, which do or would not foster those objectives.\n(2)\nThe UI district is intended for use in special areas of the community.
