Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Historic\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"Historic\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Historic\n(Historic) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Historic (Historic).

No. 2007-02-3a, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3; Ord. No. 2007-04-11/0-4, 1; Ord. No. 2020-10-28/0-10, \u00a7 8)\n3.5.2 Office/Institutional-4\n(a) Purpose and intent.\nThe purpose and intent of the office/institutional-4 district (OI-4) is to establish procedural and substantive standards for the town council's review and approval of development on large tracts of land\nwhere the predominant use is to be college, university, hospital, clinics, public cultural facilities, and related functions.\nThe objective of this section and the OI-4 district is to allow for growth and development while protecting the larger community, nearby neighborhoods, and the environment from impacts accompanying\nmajor new development. A key feature of this district is the preparation of a development plan that would allow the property owner, immediate neighbors, and the larger community to understand\nspecifically what levels of development are being proposed, and what impacts would likely accompany the development, so that mitigation measures can be designed and implemented.\n(b) Overview of Development Review Procedures.\nProcedures in this zoning district are designed to facilitate:\nArticulation of development plans that involve multiple buildings in multiple locations over an extended time period on a given tract of land, as defined in a development plan;\nIdentification of total infrastructure needs for such proposed development as specified in a development plan and cumulative impacts resulting from full development as specified in a\n10 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\n\nNEW PAGE 11\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\ndevelopment plan; and\nProvision of measures to mitigate the negative impacts, including off-site construction of parking decks as described in subsection (d)(2), phased in a manner appropriate with the pace of\nconstruction.\nTo this end, owners of property zoned OI-4 are encouraged to prepare detailed development plans, as described below, for review and approval by the town council. For buildings that are included in an\napproved development plan, site development permits for individual buildings are to be issued by the town manager, following a determination by the town manager that such individual building plans are\ngenerally consistent with the town council-approved development plan.\nFor development proposed within an OI-4 zoning district that is not included in a town council-approved development plan, but is a minor modification according to the provisions of subsection (j) of this\nsection, the town manager may approve a change to the development plan and issue a site development permit. For development proposed within an OI-4 zoning district that is not included in a town\ncouncil-approved development plan and that cannot be considered a minor modification to the plan according to subsection (j) of this section, such development shall be considered to be a special use, and\nsubject to the special use permit procedural requirements of section 4.5 of this appendix. In the alternative, the applicant may apply to the town council for an amendment to the development plan.\nOnce a property is zoned office/institutional-4, all regulations, standards, and procedures prescribed for the previously-applicable zoning district shall apply until (1) a development plan is approved; or\n(2) six (6) months have elapsed, whichever comes first.\n(c) Concept plan review. Prior to submittal of a development plan or modification of development plan, a concept plan review shall be conducted by the Town Council. It is the intent of the\nconceptual development plan process to provide an opportunity for the Town Council, Town Manager and citizens to review and evaluate the impact of the proposed development on the\ncharacter of the area in which it is proposed to be located.\n(1) Submittal requirements. Applications for conceptual development plan review shall be filed with the Town Manager. The Town Manager shall prescribe the form(s) on which information shall\nbe submitted. Application submittal requirements shall include the following:\nA. Descriptions of proposed development with building locations, building sizes, parking arrangements, and description of building heights with consideration of impact on adjacent areas.\n(d) Development Plan.\nA development plan shall address issues such as general location and size of new facilities, parking, utilities, stormwater management, impervious surface, and access/circulation. A development plan\nshall identify the general location, size, and proposed uses of buildings. A development plan shall project anticipated impacts on streets, water and sewer facilities, stormwater runoff, air quality, noise, and\nlighting.\n(1) Submittal requirements. Application submittal requirements shall include the following:\nA. Specific descriptions of proposed development with building locations, building sizes, parking arrangements, and description of building heights with consideration of impact on adjacent\nareas.\nB. Analysis of impacts resulting from proposed development, along with options to mitigate impacts relating to:\nTransportation management (traffic, transit, parking, bikes, pedestrians, air quality);\nStormwater management analysis (quantity and quality); and\nNoise and lighting analysis.\nIndividual effects must be evaluated in the context of the whole development plan and not in isolation. Impacts shall be evaluated in accordance with guidelines endorsed for use by the town\ncouncil.\nC. Preliminary timetable and sequencing schedule for building construction and for related mitigation measures.\n(2) Off-site components. Mitigation measures involving construction of parking decks may need to be developed outside the boundaries of the development plan. Notwithstanding any other\nprovision of this Land Use Management Ordinance, a parking deck proposed to mitigate impacts of a development plan, and approved by the town council as part of a development plan, may\nbe located on a site not within the boundaries of an OI-4 zoning district. Any such facility shall be reviewed as a site development permit according to the provisions of subsection (i)(2) of this\nsection.\n(e) Permitted uses and development intensities.\nPermitted uses shall be identical with uses listed in the use matrix (section 3.7) as being permitted in OI-3, except that place of assembly shall be considered to be a permitted use and not a special use.\nThe maximum floor area allowed shall be as provided in a development plan that is approved by the town council. Special restrictions apply in perimeter transition areas (see subsection (g)).\nFor purposes of calculating compliance with a specified maximum floor area, the following land uses shall not be counted as floor area: new residential development (including Dwellings and residence\nhalls), and new public cultural facilities.\n(f) Standards.\nDevelopment in the OI-4 zoning district shall be designed in a manner that provides a mix of uses which are integrated, interrelated and linked by pedestrian ways, bikeways, and other transportation\nsystems. Development plans shall, as practical and consistent with applicable laws and regulations, include measures to encourage reduction of automobile use and promote alternative modes of\ntransportation; to mitigate adverse environmental impacts; to promote conservation of non-renewable energy resources; and to achieve visual continuity in the siting and scale of buildings. Specifically, a\ndevelopment plan shall address the following:\n(1) Noise: Noise levels from development proposed in the development plan shall not exceed those allowed by the Town of Chapel Hill Noise Ordinance.\n(2) Environment: Development proposed in the development plan shall minimize impacts on natural site features, and be accompanied by measures to mitigate those impacts.\n(3) Transportation: Development proposed in the development plan shall be accompanied by measures to mitigate transportation impacts that are caused by the development.\n(4) Stormwater management: Development proposed in the development plan shall be accompanied by measures to mitigate stormwater impacts (quantity and quality) that are caused by the\ndevelopment.\n(5) Public utilities: There shall be a general demonstration that water, sewer, and other needed utilities can be made available to accommodate development proposed in the development plan.\n(6) Historic districts: The provisions of section 3.6.2 of this appendix shall apply to any development proposed within one of Chapel Hill's Historic Districts.\n(g) Perimeter transition areas.\nA development plan shall designate a perimeter transition area establishing appropriate standards at borders of the development plan, necessary to minimize impacts of development proposed in\nthe development plan on adjacent property, to be approved by the town council as part of the development plan.

If the application is denied,\nthe Town manager shall specify the grounds for finding that it is inconsistent or in violation and refer the applicant to the special use permit process described in section 4.5 of this appendix.\nAlternatively, the applicant may modify the site development permit application or apply for a major modification to the development agreement. Provided, under no circumstances shall a\nchange in floor area of less than one thousand (1,000) square feet or fewer than ten (10) parking spaces be deemed either a minor or major modification of the development agreement nor\nrequire approval or modification of an individual site development permit; such changes shall be reported by the applicant to the town manager.\n(3)\nExpiration, abandonment, revocation or development agreement. The term of any development agreement shall be set forth in the agreement. The development agreement shall also contain\nspecific provisions relative to default or termination of the agreement.\n(4) Periodic review and amendment of the development agreement. The town manager shall at least every twelve (12) months conduct a review of the development agreement at which time the\napplicant or its successors in interest must demonstrate good faith compliance with the terms of the development agreement. The town manager shall promptly report the results of this\nreview to the town council. If, as a result of this periodic review, the town council finds and determines that the applicant or its successors in interest has committed a material breach of the\nterms or conditions of the agreement, the town manager shall serve notice in writing, within a reasonable time not to exceed thirty (30) working days after the periodic review, upon the\napplicant or its successors in interest setting forth with reasonable particularity the nature of the breach and the evidence supporting the finding and determination, and providing the\napplicant or their successors in interest a reasonable time in which to cure the material breach. If the applicant or its successors in interest fail to cure the material breach within the time\ngiven, then the town council unilaterally may terminate or modify the development agreement pursuant to NCGS 160D-1008; provided, the notice of termination or modification may be\nappealed to the board of adjustment in the manner provided by 160D-405. Thereafter the applicant or its successors in interest may pursue any other rights and remedies available at law or\nin equity. If the town council elects to unilaterally modify the agreement, the applicant or its successors in interest may elect for the development agreement to be terminated rather than\naccede to the development agreement with the modifications unilaterally made by the town council.\n3.5.7.

An application is considered filed when it has been submitted, deemed complete by the town manager, and the requisite application fee has been received by the\nTown.\nThe town manager or the commission may impose such reasonable conditions on the approval of an application as will ensure that the spirit and intent of this article are achieved. An\napplication for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the demolition of a building or structure within the historic district may not be denied.

The maximum period of delay authorized by this section shall be reduced by the commission\nwhere it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use of or return from such property by virtue of the delay. During such period the\ncommission may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building. If the commission finds that the building has no particular\nsignificance or value toward maintaining the character of the historic district, it shall waive all or part of such period and authorize earlier demolition or removal.

If the commission denies an application for a certificate of appropriateness, a new application affecting the same property may be accepted by the town manager\nonly if substantial change, with respect to the reasons for its denial, is made in plans for the proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or moving.\n(9) A certificate of appropriateness shall be valid for three hundred sixty-five (365) calendar days from date of issuance, or, in the case of a certificate for demolition, from the effective date. If the\nauthorized work has not commenced within that period, has not been extended by the commission, or has been discontinued for more than three hundred sixty-five (365) calendar days from\nthe date of issuance, such certificate of appropriateness shall expire and the applicant shall be required to reapply and obtain a new certificate of appropriateness before commencing further\nwork.\n24 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\n\n Output:"}]}
