Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-15\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential\n(R-15) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Residential (R-15). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential (R-15)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

For every two feet of decrease or increase in elevation as determined\nby a licensed North Carolina Surveyor between the two elevations, one foot of setback\nmay be deducted from the front setback requirements of this chapter.\n16-12.4.8. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, a parking deck that has\nneither a wall nor a roof may be located within the required setback area between the\nbuilding and the street. An open, protective barrier not more than 42 inches high located\naround the perimeter of the parking deck shall not be considered a wall for the purposes of\nthis section.\n16-12.4.9. Whenever a lot in a residential zoning district is bordered by more than one public\nstreet, the applicable street setback shall only apply to the lot line bordering the primary\nstreet. A street setback of twenty (20) feet shall apply to the lot line(s) bordering streets\nother than the primary street.\n16-12.4.10. The individual lots within a Townhouse development, whether for residential or\nnon-residential use, shall not be required to meet the building setback requirements,\nminimum lot sizes, or minimum lot widths as specified in herein, provided the overall zoning\nlot containing the Townhouse development meets such standards.\nSection 16-12.5. Setback Requirements from Historic Trails. The Town hereby recognizes the\nexistence of three historic trails known as the Lonesome Pine Trail, the Glen Burney Trail, and the\nThunderhole Trail. No building, fence, structure, or other encumbrance shall be permitted within\n15 feet of the centerline of any such trail. The approximate location of those trails are delineated\non a map located in the Planning and Inspections Office.\nSection 16-12.6. Central Business and Town Center District Setbacks, Building Height, Open\nSpace, and Green Space Requirements. Lots developed in the Central Business District and Town\nCenter District shall meet the following standards pertaining to setbacks, building heights, open\nspace and green space areas, and other development criteria:\n16-12.6.1. Setbacks. For purposes of this section, primary streets shall be Main Street, Sunset\nDrive, and Hwy 221. Where a lot or property is bordered by more than one primary street,\nMain Street shall be the primary street. In such case, other streets shall be considered side\nstreets.\n16-12.6.1.1. All buildings may be rebuilt to the existing building footprint. This option\nmay only be applied if, prior to the development or removal of the building, a survey is\nperformed by a licensed North Carolina Surveyor to accurately determine the existing\nfootprint.\n12-6\n\n\nNEW PAGE 128\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n16-12.6.1.2. If a proposed building is not built back to an existing footprint, or\ndevelopment is on vacant property, the following setback requirements apply.\n16-12.6.1.2.1. Primary and side street setback(s) shall be the lesser of:\n(a) 15% of the average lot depth, or\n(b) 15 feet\n16-12.6.1.2.2. A building may encroach into the required primary street setback along\n50% of the lot width. However, no building may encroach closer than ten (10) feet from\nthe back of the sidewalk. When a building is permitted to encroach into the required\nprimary street setback, the displaced open/green space area must be placed within the\nfront 1/3 of the lot.\n16-12.6.1.3. In Sections 16-12.6.1.2.1 and 16-6.1.2.2 above, the setback shall be\nmeasured from the back of the public sidewalk. For the purposes of this subsection,\npublic sidewalks are typically located within five (5) feet of the edge of the public street.\nThe area between the buildings and the sidewalk shall be open space.\n16-12.6.1.4. Side lot and rear boundary setbacks will be a minimum of five (5) feet.\nCommon walls (i.e. zero (0) setbacks) are not allowed. Where an alley is not required by\nSection 16-12.6.7 \"Alleys\", green space is required in the areas between buildings and the\nside and rear property lines.\n16-12.6.1.5. Lots that are one (1) acre or greater in size shall have 15-foot side and rear\nlot boundary setbacks.\n16-12.6.2. Open Space/Green Space. For purposes of this section, open space is defined as\nthe gross land area not covered by a building.\n16-12.6.2.1. Within the open space area, a minimum of 75% of the open space at the\nfront of the building, must be planted green space with an emphasis on large, over-story,\nshade trees. Planted green space shall be defined as areas with grass, herbaceous ground\ncover, shrubbery, and drip line areas of mature, shade trees. Massive areas of mulch,\nvoid of vegetation, shall not be considered green space.\n16-12.6.2.2. One (1) over-story tree, as defined in Appendix E, Section 10(c), page 41, shall\nbe planted for every 300 square feet of required green space.\n16-12.6.3. Tree Protection. All existing trees eight (8) inches in diameter at breast height\n(dbh) and greater shall be retained to the extent reasonably practical. If saving such trees,\nespecially those located within the proposed building footprint, would cause undue hardship\non the developer, those trees may be removed through the approval of the Board of\nCommissioners. All proposed developments in the Central Business and Town Center Districts\nshall submit a site plan with a tree survey that locates all trees eight (8) inches dbh and\ngreater. The Board of Commissioners shall specifically approve the removal of any trees eight\n(8) inches dbh and greater during site plan approval. Any trees designated for protection\n12-7\n\n\nNEW PAGE 129\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nshall be replaced with a tree of similar species at least three (3) inches in diameter (measured\n6 inches above grade), if the tree dies or must be removed due to unforeseen construction\nactivities.\n16-12.6.4. Retaining Walls. All retaining walls shall be preserved and maintained. If the\nretaining wall is in poor structural condition, a new wall must be built back to replicate the\noriginal wall.\n16-12.6.4.1. New retaining walls in the Central Business and Town Center Districts that\nare adjacent to a street shall be made of natural, locally found stone. Cultured stone that\nhas the appearance of natural, locally found stone may be used as a substitute.\n16-12.6.4.2. The Board of Commissioners recognize the need for compliance with ADA\nrequirements and will consider such when reviewing a request for removal, or\nmodification, of existing retaining walls.\n16-12.6.5. Building Height. The following standards determine the applicable building\nheights for buildings in the Central Business and Town Center Districts.\n16-12.6.5.1. The maximum building height shall be limited to 30 feet, as measured from\nthe average elevation of the existing or proposed sidewalk along the primary street to the\nhighest point of the building or structure (Please refer to Appendix B for Diagram), Where\nan existing rock wall is located adjacent to an existing sidewalk, or where a property does\nnot border a primary street on any side, the maximum height shall be measured from the\naverage finished ground elevation adjacent to the primary entrance to the highest point\nof the building or structure.\n16-12.6.5.2. The maximum building height shall also be limited to no more than a 25%\nincrease above the average existing height of adjacent buildings, provided that at least\ntwo (2) stories shall be permitted. The average existing height shall be determined by the\naverage height of existing buildings located within 100 feet of the proposed building, on\nthe same side of the street, same block and use district. The lesser of a) 25% greater than\nthe average existing heights or b) 30 feet shall determine the maximum allowable building\nheight. Where the maximum building height is established, that maximum height shall\ngovern the entire structure.\n16-12.6.5.3. The maximum leave height shall be limited to 24 feet. The leave height shall\nbe the vertical distance measured from the sidewalk to the lowest point of the leave above\nthe primary entrance.\n16-12.6.5.4. The maximum building height and maximum leave height for any building\nlocated 50 feet or more from the back of the existing or proposed sidewalk adjacent to a\npublic street shall be measured from the average finished ground elevation adjacent to\nthe primary entrance. For purposes of this paragraph, the entire structure must be\nlocated at or beyond the 50-foot setback. If the building is located 50 feet or more from\nthe sidewalk, the leave height shall be the vertical distance measured from the adjacent\n12-8\n\nNEW PAGE 130\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\ngrade at the primary entrance to the lowest point of the leave above the primary entrance.\nMaximum building heights may exceed thirty (30) feet, and the maximum leave height\nmay exceed 24 feet, if the building is set back beyond the standard 15-foot setback. No\nbuilding height in the Central Business or Town Center may exceed forty (40) feet.\nAdditionally, no other building walls, measured from the average finished grade along the\nbase of the wall to the highest point of the structure may exceed 40 feet. The following\ntable shall be used to determine the maximum building height and leave height based on\nthe proposed building setback from any street:\n*measured from finished ground elevation adjacent to primary entrance to building\nWhere a building is permitted to encroach into the 15-foot setback as provided in Section\n16-12.6.1.2.1(b) the building height for that part of the building forward of the 15-foot\nsetback must be reduced one (1) foot for every one (1) foot of setback encroachment.\n16-12.6.6. Property Grades and Elevations. Property grade elevations shall be maintained\nas reasonably practical. The Board of Commissioners shall have the authority to determine if\nthe proposed grade elevations are consistent with the character of the Central Business and\nTown Center areas.\n12-9\nCELL (1, 1): \nSetback\nCELL (1, 2): \nMaximum Building\nHeight\nCELL (1, 3): \nMaximum Eave\nHeight\nCELL (2, 1): \n15\nCELL (2, 2): \n30\nCELL (2, 3): \n24\nCELL (3, 1): \n20\nCELL (3, 2): \n31\nCELL (3, 3): \n25\nCELL (4, 1): \n25\nCELL (4, 2): \n32\nCELL (4, 3): \n26\nCELL (5, 1): \n30\nCELL (5, 2): \n33\nCELL (5, 3): \n27\nCELL (6, 1): \n35\nCELL (6, 2): \n34\nCELL (6, 3): \n28\nCELL (7, 1): \n40\nCELL (7, 2): \n35\nCELL (7, 3): \n29\nCELL (8, 1): \n45\nCELL (8, 2): \n36\nCELL (8, 3): \n30\nCELL (9, 1): \n50\nCELL (9, 2): \n37*\nCELL (9, 3): \n31*\nCELL (10, 1): \n55\nCELL (10, 2): \n38*\nCELL (10, 3): \n32*\nCELL (11, 1): \n60\nCELL (11, 2): \n39*\nCELL (11, 3): \n33*\nCELL (12, 1): \n65\nCELL (12, 2): \n40*\nCELL (12, 3): \n34*\n\n\nNEW PAGE 131\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n16-12.6.7.

Alleys may be required in\ncertain situations through a Special Use permit.\n16-12.6.7. Building Height Limitations. Subject to the remaining provisions of this\nsection, the height of a building or structure in any residential district (R-15, R-10, R-6, or\nRMH), may not exceed 35 feet. Similarly, the leave height of a building or structure in the\nR-A district or any non-residential district (HMC, HSG, OI, or PGS) may not exceed 35 feet\nand the overall height of the building or structure shall not exceed 50 feet.\nIn the General Business District, the overall height of the building or structure shall not\nexceed 35 feet if the building meets the standard 20-foot street setback and 8-foot side\nand rear setbacks. The overall building height may be increased to 50 feet if the building\nmeets a street setback of 40 feet and side and rear setbacks of 16 feet.\n16-12.6.7.1. Subject to Section 16-12.6.7.2 the following features are exempt from the\ndistrict height limitations set forth in Section16-12.6.7.\na) Chimneys, church spires, elevator shafts, and similar structural appendages not\nintended as places of occupancy or storage;\nb) Flagpoles and similar devices;\nc) Heating and air conditioning equipment, solar collectors, and similar equipment,\nfixtures and devices.\n16-12.6.7.2. The features listed in Section 16-12.6.7.1 are exempt from the height\nlimitations set forth in Section 16-12.6.7, if they conform to the following requirements:\na) Not more than one-third of the total roof area may be consumed by such features.\nb) The features described in Section 16-12.6.7.1.c) above must be set back from the edge\nof the roof a minimum distance of one foot for every foot by which such features\nextend above the roof surface of the principal building to which they are attached.\nc) The permit-issuing authority may authorize or require that parapet walls be\nconstructed (up to a height not exceeding that of the features screened) to shield the\nfeatures listed in Section 16-12.6.7.1(a) & c) from view.\n16-12.6.8. The permit-issuing authority may authorize the construction of a building one or\nmore sides of which exceed the building height limitations set forth in Section 16-12.6.7 if it\nfinds that:\na) The height of the building measured at the front side does not exceed the building height\nlimitations set forth in section 16-12.6.7 and\nb) Other sides of the building exceed building height limitations because the building is\nconstructed on a severe grade, and\nc) The building is not in violation of the Mountain Ridge Protection Act of 1983.\n12-10\n\n\nNEW PAGE 132\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n16-12.6.9. With respect to developments in the non-residential zoning districts that require\na Special Use permit, the Board of Commissioners may authorize the construction of a\nbuilding one or more sides of which exceed the building height limitations set forth in section\n16-12.6.7 if it finds that:\na) It would be impractical to construct on the lot a building that suits the reasonable needs\nof the proposed use (such as a gymnasium, theater, etc.) without the height exception;\nand\nb) The building will be designed, located, and constructed so that it does not unreasonably\nobstruct the view of owners or occupants of other property and is not otherwise\nsubstantially out of character with the size, scale, and appearance of other buildings\nwithin the immediate neighborhood; and\nc) The building is not in violation of the Mountain Ridge Protection Act of 1983.\n16-12.6.10. Towers and antennas are allowed in all zoning districts to the extent authorized\nin Article 10 (Table of Permissible Uses), use classification 18.000, and Article 18.\nSection 16-12.7. Density on Lots Where Portion Dedicated to Town. Subject to the other\nprovisions of this section, if any portion of a tract lies within an area designated on any officially\nadopted Town plan as part of a proposed public park, greenway, or bikeway, and before the tract\nis developed, the owner of the tract, with the concurrence of the Town, dedicates to the Town\nthat portion of the tract so designated, then, when the remainder of the tract is developed for\nresidential purposes, the permissible density at which the remainder may be developed shall be\ncalculated in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n16-12.7.1. If the proposed use of the remainder is a single-family residential subdivision, the\ndeveloper need not set aside usable open space to the extent that an equivalent amount of\nland has previously been dedicated to the Town in accordance with Section 16-12.7.\n16-12.7.2. If the proposed use of the remainder is a multi-family project, then the permissible\ndensity at which the remainder may be developed shall be calculated by regarding the\ndedicated portion of the original lot as if it were still part of the lot proposed for development.\n16-12.7.3. If the portion of the tract that remains after dedication as provided in Section 16-\n12.7 is divided in such a way that the resultant parcels are intended for future subdivision or\ndevelopment, then each of the resultant parcels shall be entitled to its pro rata share of the\n\"density bonus\" provided for in herein.\nSection 16-12.8.

Table of Screening Requirements. The Table of Screening Requirements shall\nbe used to determine screening requirements between adjacent land uses.\nSection 16-22.6. Descriptions of Screens. The following three basic types of screens are hereby\nestablished and are used as the basis for the Table of Screening Requirements set forth in Section\n16-22.6.1. Opaque Screen, Type \"A\". A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of\nat least six feet, with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to a height of\nat least twenty feet. An opaque screen is intended to exclude completely all visual contact\nbetween uses and to create a strong impression of spatial separation. The opaque screen may\nbe composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing\nvegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on\n22-2\nCELL (1, 1): \nProposed\nLand Use\nClass\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nAdjacent Existing Land Use\nCELL (1, 4): \nAdjacent Existing Land Use\nCELL (1, 5): \nAdjacent Existing Land Use\nCELL (1, 6): \nAdjacent Zoning Type\n(For Vacant Property)\nCELL (1, 7): \nAdjacent Zoning Type\n(For Vacant Property)\nCELL (1, 8): \nAdjacent\nPublic or\nPrivate Street\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nI\nCELL (2, 3): \nII\nCELL (2, 4): \nIII\nCELL (2, 5): \nIV\nCELL (2, 6): \nResidential\nCELL (2, 7): \nNon-\nResidential\nCELL (2, 8): \nCELL (3, 1): \nII\nCELL (3, 2): \nA\nCELL (3, 3): \nB\nCELL (3, 4): \nB\nCELL (3, 5): \nC\nCELL (3, 6): \nA\nCELL (3, 7): \nC\nCELL (3, 8): \nB\nCELL (4, 1): \nIII\nCELL (4, 2): \nA\nCELL (4, 3): \nB\nCELL (4, 4): \nC\nCELL (4, 5): \nC\nCELL (4, 6): \nA\nCELL (4, 7): \nB\nCELL (4, 8): \nB\nCELL (5, 1): \nIV\nCELL (5, 2): \nA\nCELL (5, 3): \nA\nCELL (5, 4): \nA\nCELL (5, 5): \nA\nCELL (5, 6): \nA\nCELL (5, 7): \nA\nCELL (5, 8): \nA\n\n\nNEW PAGE 246\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nthe basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field\nobservation of existing vegetation. The opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all\nseasons of the year. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not\ncontain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet wide. The portion of\nintermittent visual obstructions may contain deciduous plants. Suggested planting patterns\nthat will achieve this standard are included in Appendix E.\n16-22.6.2. Semi-Opaque Screen, Type \"B\". A screen that is opaque from the ground to a\nheight of three feet, with intermittent visual obstruction from above the opaque portion to a\nheight of at least twenty feet. The semi-opaque screen is intended to partially block visual\ncontact between uses and to create a strong impression of the separation of spaces. The\nsemi-opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted\nvegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural\nvegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of\nthe subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. At maturity, the portion of\nintermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings\nmore than ten feet wide. The zone of intermittent visual obstruction may contain deciduous\nplants. Suggested planting patterns that will achieve this standard are shown in Appendix E.\n16-22.6.3. Broken Screen, Type \"C\". A screen composed of intermittent visual obstructions\nfrom the ground to a height of at least twenty feet. The broken screen is intended to create\nthe impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact\nbetween the spaces. It may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted\nvegetation or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural\nvegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of\nthe subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. The screen may contain\ndeciduous plants. Suggested planting patterns that will achieve this standard are included in\nAppendix E.\n16-22.7. Width of Landscaping Screen. Unless otherwise provided in this Land Use Code,\nthe\nminimum width of a landscaping screen shall conform to the following table. However, the\npermit-issuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of the\nfollowing table and may require either more intensive or less intensive screening whenever it\nfinds such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in Section 16-22.3 without\nimposing unnecessary costs on the developer.\n22-3\nCELL (1, 1): \nType of Screen\nCELL (1, 2): \nWidth - Front Lot\nLine\nCELL (1, 3): \nWidth - Side Lot\nLine\nCELL (1, 4): \nWidth - Rear Lot\nLine\nCELL (2, 1): \nOpaque Screen,\nType \"A\"\nCELL (2, 2): \n8 feet\nCELL (2, 3): \n16 feet\nCELL (2, 4): \n16 feet\nCELL (3, 1): \nSemi-Opaque Screen,\nType \"B\"\nCELL (3, 2): \n8 feet\nCELL (3, 3): \n16 feet\nCELL (3, 4): \n16 feet\nCELL (4, 1): \nBroken Screen,\nType \"C\"\nCELL (4, 2): \n8 feet\nCELL (4, 3): \n8 feet\nCELL (4, 4): \n8 feet\n\n\nNEW PAGE 247\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n16-22.6.8. Town Center and Central Business District Requirements. Street yard buffer area\nscreening/landscaping requirements shall be established using Section 16-12.6.b, 16-12.6.2, 16-\n12.6.2.1. The minimum width for landscape screening alongside and rear lot lines of properties\nless than one (1) acre (in TC or CB District) may be reduced to half of the required width for other\nzoning districts, except in cases where other screening widths are authorized by a specific special\nuse permit. (Ex: The table below requires a 16-foot wide screen along a side lot line, but in the\nTC or CB District a buffer 8 feet wide may be approved.)\nSection 16-22.9. Flexibility in Administration Required. The Board recognizes that because of\nthe wide variety of types of developments and the relationships between them, it is neither\npossible nor prudent to establish inflexible screening requirements. Therefore, as provided in\nSection 16-22.3, the permit-issuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive\nrequirements of Section 16-22.5 and may require either more intensive or less intensive\nscreening whenever it finds such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in\nSection 16-22.3 without imposing unnecessary costs on the developer.\n16-22.9.1. Without limiting the generality of this section, the permit-issuing authority may\nmodify the presumptive requirements for:\na) Commercial developments located adjacent to residential uses in business zoning\ndistricts;\nb) Commercial uses located adjacent to other commercial uses within the same zoning\ndistrict; and\nc) Uses located within planned unit developments.\n16-22.9.2. Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the\npresumptive requirements set forth in Section 16-22.5, it shall enter on the face of the permit\nthe screening requirement that it imposes to meet the standard set forth in Section 16-22.3\nand the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation.\n16-22.9.3. If the permit-issuing authority concludes, based upon information receives in\nconsideration of a specific development proposal, that a presumption established by Section\n16-22.5 is erroneous, it shall initiate a request for an amendment to the Table of Screening\nRequirements in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article 23.\n22-4\nCELL (1, 1): \nType of Screen\nCELL (1, 2): \nWidth - Front Lot\nLine\nCELL (1, 3): \nWidth - Side Lot\nLine\nCELL (1, 4): \nWidth - Rear Lot\nLine\nCELL (2, 1): \nOpaque Screen,\nType \"A\"\nCELL (2, 2): \n8 feet\nCELL (2, 3): \n16 feet (8 ft -\nCB/TC)\nCELL (2, 4): \n16 feet (8 ft -\nCB/TC)\nCELL (3, 1): \nSemi-Opaque Screen,\nType \"B\"\nCELL (3, 2): \n8 feet\nCELL (3, 3): \n8 feet (4 ft - CB/TC)\nCELL (3, 4): \n16 feet (8 ft -\nCB/TC)\nCELL (4, 1): \nBroken Screen,\nType \"C\"\nCELL (4, 2): \n8 feet\nCELL (4, 3): \n8 feet (4 ft - CB/TC)\nCELL (4, 4): \n8 feet (4 ft -\nCB/TC)\n\n\nNEW PAGE 248\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nSection 16-22.10. Combination Uses. In determining the screening requirements that apply\nbetween a combination use and another use, the permit-issuing authority shall proceed as if the\nprincipal uses that comprise the combination use were not combined and reach its determination\naccordingly, relying on the table set forth in Section 16-22.5, interpreted in the light of Section\n16-22.6.\nWhen two or more principal uses are combined to create a combination use, screening shall not\nbe required between the composite principal uses unless they are clearly separated physically,\nand screening is determined to be necessary to satisfy the standard set forth in Section 16-22.3.\n(For example, screening may be required in a residential combination use consisting of single-\nfamily and multi-family components.)\nSection 16-22.11. Maintenance of Screening and Landscape Plantings. Screening required by\nthis Article, including the shading provisions listed in Section 16-22.13, shall be maintained in\naccordance with these requirements.\n16-22.11.1. Landscaping shall not be installed or retained in any location that constitutes a\nhazard or infringement to the public health, safety, or welfare. Landscaping shall not obstruct\nthe view of motorists using any street, private driveway, parking aisles, or the approach to\nany street intersection so as to constitute a traffic hazard or a condition dangerous to the\npublic safety.\n16-22.11.2. Whenever any planting areas required by this Article are adjacent to parking or\nvehicular circulation areas, the planting areas shall be protected from vehicular intrusion or\ndamage by either concrete wheel stops, concrete/asphalt curbs or retaining walls.\n16-22.11.3. All landscaping planting areas shall be stabilized from soil erosion immediately\nupon planting and shall be maintained for the duration of the use.\n16-22.11.4. The owner is responsible for maintaining all required plant material in good\nhealth. Any dead, unhealthy, or missing plants must be replaced with vegetation that\nconforms to the initial planting standards of this Article within one planting season.\nSection 16-22.12. Silvicultural Standards. All silviculture operations shall be carried out in\naccordance with state approved best management practices for silviculture. All silviculture\nprojects shall maintain buffers in a natural state where indicated below:\na) An undisturbed buffer of a minimum 30 feet in width around the entire perimeter of any\nwetland, water body, or water course located on or adjacent to the project site;\nb) A buffer extending a minimum of 25 feet in width around the entire perimeter of the\nsilviculture project site, except at necessary points of ingress and egress; and\nc)\nA buffer a minimum of 50 feet in width along perimeter areas of the site which adjoin any\npublic road right-of-way, except at necessary points of ingress and egress, and except that\nmarketable timber may be removed from the innermost 25-foot strip of buffer provided\nselective logging techniques are used which will minimize understory destruction and\nprovided no ground disturbance occurs.\nSection 16-22.13.
