Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Heavy Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"HI\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Heavy Industrial\n(HI) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Heavy Industrial (HI). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Heavy Industrial (HI)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Heavy Industrial\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found.

HEAVY INDUSTRIAL (HI) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Heavy Industrial (HI) district is established to\naccommodate heavy manufacturing, assembly, fabrication,\nprocessing, distribution, storage, and research and\ndevelopment. The district accommodates large-scale\nindustrial uses including outdoor operations or storage with\nextensive movement of vehicles, materials, and goods, truck\ntraffic and greater potential for adverse environmental and\nvisual impacts on neighboring lands. The district also allows\nlimited forms of heavier commercial use types but residential\ndevelopment is prohibited (except for caretaker quarters as an\naccessory use). District standards are intended to prevent the\nestablishment of any use types that would interrupt industrial\noperations. District standards require that no land or structure\nbe used for any purpose that causes noxious or offensive\nodors, gas fumes, smoke, dust, vibration, or noise that\nsubstantially interferes with other nearby uses.\nB.

HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (HDR) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe High Density Residential (HDR) district is established to accommodate a wide\nrange of residential and institutional use types at high densities. The district allows\na wide range of housing types, including duplexes, triplexes, quadraplexes, upper-\nstory residential, single-family attached, and single-family detached dwellings. The\ndistrict also allows pocket neighborhoods and bungalow courts. As a means of\ncreating compact, functional neighborhoods, the district also allows a wide variety\nof\ninstitutional uses, including community centers, day care, schools, assisted living,\nreligious institutions, parks, and utilities. Mixed use development is also allowed in\nlocations where negative impacts can be minimized. Proximity and access to transit\nfacilities and alternative forms of transportation are vital in this district. Low density\ndevelopment comprised of uniform building types or styles is discouraged.\nB.
