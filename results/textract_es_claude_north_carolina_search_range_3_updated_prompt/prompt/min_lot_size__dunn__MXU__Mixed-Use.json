Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Mixed-Use\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MXU\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Mixed-Use\n(MXU) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Mixed-Use (MXU). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Mixed-Use (MXU)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Mixed-Use\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_lot_size is typically between 1,000 and 2,000,000 sq ft or 0.02 and 50 acres. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft).

Exemptions. Uses in the C-1 district are exempt from the minimum parking requirements of this Section.\n2. Tree Preservation.\na. The minimum number of parking spaces required shall be adjusted by the Administrator when it has\nbeen determined that the reductions are necessary to preserve a healthy tree or trees by establishing\na Tree Save Area (with a 12-inch or greater diameter at breast height) from being damaged or\nremoved, and where the site plan provides for the retention of said tree or trees. Up to 25% or five\n(5) spaces (whichever is greater) of the required parking may be reduced in this fashion.\nb.\nMinimum Dimensional Requirements of Tree Save Area: The extent of the Critical Root Zone (CRZ)\nof the tree or trees at the outer edges of the tree save area shall constitute the limits of construction\nfor the purposes of this sub-section. The CRZ is the circular area of ground surrounding a tree\nextending from the center of tree to the greater of:\n1.5 feet per caliper inch DBH (diameter at breast height) of the tree,\nThe dripline (furthest extent of tree canopy) of the tree, or\n3. 6 feet.\nC. Available Parking Reduction: The actual demand for parking on a particular site may vary based\non the development's context. In these cases, the Administrator may determine that the context\nis\nappropriate to reduce parking requirements. Examples of such cases are:\nA mixed-use development with uses that have peak occupancy at different\ntimes such that one parking space can be demonstrated to handle some parking\nneeds of multiple uses.\nCounting on-street parking spaces directly adjacent to the establishment.\nShared parking in a nearby lot that has empty spaces.\nA commitment to providing valet parking services.\nDemonstrating a likelihood that all required parking may not be needed and\ndeferring construction on a percentage of the parking spaces until after the\ndevelopment is complete, when it becomes clear whether or not the additional\ndeferred spaces are needed.\nThe following are the criteria the Administrator must use when determining the applicable parking\nreductions.\nCITY OF DUNN, NC\n6-10\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nADOPTION DATE: 04.11.2023\n\n\nNEW PAGE 99\nARTICLE 6\nGENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nE.\nSATELLITE & COMBINATION PARKING\nIf the off-street parking spaces required by this Section cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on\nwhich the principal use is located, such space may be provided on any land within 500 feet. Such\nmeasurement shall be taken from the edge of the parking area on the lot to the entryway of the remote parking\narea.\n1. Shared Satellite Parking: Upon approval by the Administrator, satellite parking facilities may be shared\nby two or more uses which do not share normal operating hours.\n2. Parking for Permitted Uses Only. If satellite parking is utilized to fulfill parking requirements, the owner\nor authorized agent for the land upon which such remote parking is located shall restrict the use of such\nparking area for parking only in connection with the use(s) or structure(s) for which such remote parking\nis provided.
