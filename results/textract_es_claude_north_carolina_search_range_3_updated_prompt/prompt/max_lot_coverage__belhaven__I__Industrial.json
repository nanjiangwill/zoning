Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"I\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Industrial\n(I) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Industrial (I). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Industrial (I)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Industrial\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage refers solely to the maximum lot coverage of buildings for primary use and all accessory structures. Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

A PD utilizes exceptional design and best management practices that result in\ndevelopment that is aesthetically pleasing, promotes environmental sensitivity and makes more efficient use of the land, resulting in increased\nopen space.\nB.

The building area coverage shall be the dimensional standards of the applicable zoning District (i.e., R-7500, C-LD, etc.). However, the\ndeveloped area may be increased as a result of utilizing exceptional design and/or best management practices as provided in Section 6.1,\nDesign Flexibility. The extent of the allowable increase will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Planning Director (minor site plans)\nor the Planning Board (major site plans) in relation to the extent of the successful use of exceptional design and best management practices\nin the project site plan.\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": null,\n    \"rationale\": \"The section does refer to building area coverage, following our definition of max_lot_coverage, but it not provide a specific number for I, thus the value is not included in the answer.\",\n    \"answer\": null\n\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 61\nTable 4-2-1 Table of Density and Dimensional Requirements\nCELL (1, 1):\nZoning District\nCELL (1, 2):\nMinimum Lot Area (Sq Ft.)\nCELL (1, 3):\nMinimum LotWidth (Ft) **\nCELL (1, 4):\nFront Yard Setback (Ft.)\nCELL (1, 5): Side Yard Setback (Ft.)\nCELL (1, 6):\nRear Yard Setback (Ft.)\nCELL (1, 7):\nMaximum Building Height (Ft)\nCELL (1, 8):\nMaximum Lot Coverage\nCELL (1, 9):\nDevelopment Standards\nCELL (2, 1):\nI\nCELL (2, 2):\nCELL (2, 3):\nCELL (2, 4):\nCELL (2, 5):\nCELL (2, 6):\nCELL (2, 7):\nCELL (2, 8):\nCELL (2, 9):\nCELL (3, 1):\nSingle-family dwelling\nCELL (3, 2):\n20,000*\nCELL (3, 3):\n85\nCELL (3, 4):\n30\nCELL (3, 5):\n10 a\nCELL (3, 6):\n25 g\nCELL (3, 7):\n40\nCELL (3, 8):\n40%\nCELL (3, 9):\nCELL (4, 1):\nXXXX\nCELL (4, 2):\nCELL (4, 3):\nCELL (4, 4):\nCELL (4, 5):\nCELL (4, 6):\nCELL (4, 7):\nCELL (4, 8):\nCELL (4, 9):\nCELL (5, 1):\nSingle-family dwelling\nCELL (5, 2):\n15,000\nCELL (5, 3):\n75\nCELL (5, 4):\n30\nCELL (5, 5):\n10 a\nCELL (5, 6):\n25 g\nCELL (5, 7):\n35\nCELL (5, 8):\n40%\nCELL (5, 9):\nCELL (6, 1):\nXXXX\nCELL (6, 2):\nCELL (6, 3):\nCELL (6, 4):\nCELL (6, 5):\nCELL (6, 6):\nCELL (6, 7):\nCELL (6, 8):\nCELL (6, 9):\nCELL (7, 1):\nSingle-family dwelling\nCELL (7, 2):\n12,000\nCELL (7, 3):\n65\nCELL (7, 4):\n25\nCELL (7, 5):\n10 a\nCELL (7, 6):\n25 g\nCELL (7, 7):\n35\nCELL (7, 8):\n40%\nCELL (7, 9):\nCELL (8, 1):\nXXXX\nCELL (8, 2):\nCELL (8, 3):\nCELL (8, 4):\nCELL (8, 5):\nCELL (8, 6):\nCELL (8, 7):\nCELL (8, 8):\nCELL (8, 9):\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": null,\n    \"rationale\": \"The section does not specify the maximum lot coverage is for buildings only, thus the value is not included in the answer.\",\n    \"answer\": null\n}\n\nInput:\nMulti-family building\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": null,\n    \"rationale\": \"The section does not provide a specific value for max_lot_coverage, and is not about single-family homes.\",\n    \"answer\": null\n}", "user_prompt": "Input: \n\n NEW PAGE 33\nb) Plans are required and must show:\ni)\nTopography including well drained site and adequate storm drainage facilities (including\nretention pond facilities, when applicable).\nii) Structures including location of signs, entrance, and buildings.\niii) Circulation including proposed points of access, ingress, and egress and parking layout.\niv) Buffering when adjacent to residential structures or when located in residential zones.\n(3)\nHome occupations\na) The use of the dwelling unit for the home occupation shall be clearly incidental and subordinate\nto its use for residential purposes by its occupants and not more than 25% of the floor area or\n400 square feet of the floor area, whichever amount is less, shall be used to conduct the home\noccupation.\nb)\nOne sign, not to exceed six square feet in area shall be permitted if it is non- illuminated and\nmounted flat against the wall of the principal building or in any yard at least ten feet from any\nright-of-way or property line.\nc) Only two (2) people other than those residing in the home shall be engaged in the occupation.\nd) Any need for parking generated by the conduct of such home occupation shall be met off the\nstreet and other than in any required yard.\ne)\nNo equipment or process shall be used in such home occupation which creates noise, vibration,\nglare, fumes, or electrical interference in any greater degree than may be produced from normal\nresidential activities.\nf) No equipment or process shall be used which creates visual or audible interference in any radio\nor television receivers off the premises.\ng) No home occupation shall be conducted that creates a private or public hazard.\nh) No display of products may be visible from the street or from an adjacent lot.\ni) The occupation shall not involve the retail sales of products, except that in an RA District, farm\nproducts raised and prepared on the premises may be sold;
