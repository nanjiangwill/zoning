Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential Main Street Transition\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"RMST\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential Main Street Transition\n(RMST) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Residential Main Street Transition (RMST). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential Main Street Transition (RMST)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential Main Street Transition\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

All dumpsters,\nloading docks, outdoor storage areas over 40 square feet, and utility structures must\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 11 - Page 7\n\n\nNEW PAGE 266\nbe screened if they are visible to adjacent public or private streets or any adjacent\nproperties. Screening of a dumpster shall not be required in the Industrial District,\nunless the dumpster is located within one hundred (100) feet of an existing non-\nindustrial land use. Screening options include:\n(A.) A single opaque material wall or fence with a minimum height of 6 feet.\n(B.)

Trees are required at the following rate:\n(A.) One large maturing tree required for every 80 linear feet of street frontage. If\noverhead utilities are present, planting of one small maturing tree for every 40 linear\nfeet of property abutting a street is required.\n(B.) Where the street abuts a parking lot over 3000 square feet in area and located within\n50 feet of the edge of the pavement, shrubs shall be planted at the rate of one\ndeciduous or evergreen shrub for every 5 linear feet of vehicular use area abutting the\nstreet in addition to the required street trees.
