Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential-Agriculture\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-A\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential-Agriculture\n(R-A) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Residential-Agriculture (R-A). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential-Agriculture (R-A)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential-Agriculture\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 74\nArticle 4 Zoning Districts\n4.5 Commercial Zoning Districts\n4.5.4.\nSpecial Standards in the R-A Zoning District\nD.\nOpen Space\nOpen space requirements for the residential portion of a multifamily or mixed commercial-residential\nproject shall be the same and conform to the requirements for multifamily developments in the MR-\n4-12\nCELL (1, 1):\nUse\nCELL (1, 2):\nDistrict\nCELL (1, 3):\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 4):\nMinimum\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 5):\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 6):\nMinimum\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 7):\nCELL (1, 8):\nYard\n(ft.)\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (2, 1):\nCELL (2, 2):\nCELL (2, 3):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 4):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 5):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 6):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 7):\nFront\nCELL (2, 8):\nRear\nCELL (2, 9):\nSide\nCELL (3, 1):\nAll residential, except\nCELL (3, 2):\nR-A\nCELL (3, 3):\n60\nCELL (3, 4):\n60\nCELL (3, 5):\n6,000\nCELL (3, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (3, 7):\n25\u00b3\nCELL (3, 8):\n63\nCELL (3, 9):\n51,2\nCELL (4, 1):\nmultifamily\nCELL (4, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (4, 3):\n75\nCELL (4, 4):\n75\nCELL (4, 5):\n7,500\nCELL (4, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (4, 7):\n253\nCELL (4, 8):\n253\nCELL (4, 9):\n102\nCELL (5, 1):\nMultifamily/ Mixed\nCELL (5, 2):\nR-A\nCELL (5, 3):\n100\nCELL (5, 4):\n150\nCELL (5, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (5, 6):\n15,000\nCELL (5, 7):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 8):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 9):\nCELL (6, 1):\ncommercial- residential\nCELL (6, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (6, 3):\n100\nCELL (6, 4):\n100\nCELL (6, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (6, 6):\n7,000\nCELL (6, 7):\nCELL (6, 8):\nCELL (6, 9):\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"CELL (2, 5):\\nWith\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 5):\\n6,000\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (2, 6):\\nWithout\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 6):\\n10,000\" 74]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"For district R-A, the section provides the information for min_unit_size.

No side of this sign may exceed four\nsquare feet in surface area. The sign may not be internally illuminated.\nSection 16-11.2 Perimeter Fences and Walls. For the purposes of this section, a fence or wall\nshall be defined as a structure used to delineate a boundary or used as a barrier or means of\nprotection, confinement, or screening. Furthermore, for the purposes of this section, a retaining\nwall is to be included within the meaning of a fence or wall.\n16-11.2.1 Fences and walls are permitted as an accessory use in all zoning districts, provided\nthat:\na) Except as expressly authorized by an applicable special use permit or otherwise required\nto comply with an applicable provision of the Blowing Rock Code, no fence or wall located\nwithin a required front yard setback area shall exceed four feet in height above grade.\nWhere there is no required front yard setback, no fence located forward of the actual\nbuilding line or within 25 feet of the front property line, whichever is less, shall exceed\nfour feet in height, above street grade.\nb)\nNo fence or wall, located within a side or rear yard setback, shall exceed six (6) feet in\nheight above grade, except as expressly authorized by an applicable Special Use permit\nor otherwise required to comply with an applicable provision of the Blowing Rock Code.\nNo other fence or retaining wall, outside of applicable setback areas, shall exceed 12 feet\nin height above grade, except as expressly authorized by an applicable Special Use permit\nor by authorization from the Blowing Rock Town Council. Retaining walls and/or retaining\nstructures exceeding five (5) feet in height, measured from the top of the footing, shall\nbe designed and constructed under the responsible charge of a NC registered professional\nengineer. The monitoring engineer shall submit a sealed report, including final approval,\non the retaining structure(s) construction to the Building Code Official.\nc) Columns or posts shall not extend more than 18 inches above the built height of the fence\nor wall.

No lot may be created that is so narrow or otherwise so\nirregularly shaped that it would be impracticable to construct on it a building that:\na) Could be used for purposes that are permissible in that zoning district; and\nb) Could satisfy any applicable setback requirements for that district.\n16-12.3.1. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing standard, the following minimum\nlot widths are required to satisfy the standard set forth in herein. The lot width shall be\nmeasured along a straight line connecting the points at which a line that demarcates the\nrequired setback from the street intersects with lot boundary lines at opposite sides of the\nlot.\n16-12.3.2. No lot created after the effective date of this chapter that is less than the\nrecommended width shall be entitled to a variance from any building setback requirement.\nSection 16-12.4. Building Setback Requirements. Subject to the other provisions of this section,\nno portion of any building or any sign may be located on any lot closer to any lot line or to the\nstreet right-of-way line or center line than is authorized in the table set forth below. If the street\nright-of-way line is readily determinable (by reference to a reworked map, set irons, or other\nmeans), the setback shall be measured from such right-of-way line. If the right-of-way is not so\ndeterminable, the setback shall be measured from the street centerline.
