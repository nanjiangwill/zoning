Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Mobile Home Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-15M\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Mobile Home Overlay\n(R-15M) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Mobile Home Overlay (R-15M). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Mobile Home Overlay (R-15M)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Mobile Home Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 11\n\nR-15M Zone\n\nCELL (2, 1):\nField\nCELL (2, 2):\nValue\nCELL (3, 1):\nmin_lot_size\nCELL (3, 2):\n123456 sq ft\nCELL (4, 1):\nApartment Area\nCELL (4, 2):\n10,000\n\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"CELL (3, 2):\\n123456 sq ft\", 11]],\n    \"rationale\": \"The cell that corresponds to the value for min_lot_size in this table has this answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"123456 sq ft\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 32\n\nSection 6.3 Industrial Area & Dimensional Requirements\n1 Public Sewer or Public Water\n2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\n3 For proposed warehouse/manufacturing uses 35%, for all other uses 25%, subject to\nCommission's authority to permit greater coverage based on landscape, architectural design\nand site development elements that exceed minimum standard of the Regulation\n4\nShall be in addition to requirements of 8.1.2 Landscaping and Buffers\n6-4\n\nCELL (1, 1):\nCELL (1, 2):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 3):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 4):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 5):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 6):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 7):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 8):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (1, 10):\nCELL (2, 1):\nZone\nCELL (2, 2):\nMin\nArea\nCELL (2, 3):\nMin\nWidth\nCELL (2, 4):\nMin\nDepth\nCELL (2, 5):\nMax\nStories\nCELL (2, 6):\nMax\nHeight\nCELL (2, 7):\nMax % Lot\nCoverage\nCELL (2, 8):\nMin\nFront\nYard\nCELL (2, 9):\nMin\nSide\nYard\nCELL (2, 10):\nMin\nRear\nYard\nCELL (3, 1):\nI\nCELL (3, 2):\n20,000\nsq. ft.\nCELL (3, 3):\n100'\nCELL (3, 4):\n100'\nCELL (3, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (3, 6):\n50'\nCELL (3, 7):\nN/A\nCELL (3, 8):\n25'\nCELL (3, 9):\n20'\nCELL (3, 10):\n20'\nCELL (4, 1):\nR-15M\nCELL (4, 2):\n40,000\nsq. ft. 1\nCELL (4, 3):\n150'\nCELL (4, 4):\n150'\nCELL (4, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (4, 6):\n50'\nCELL (4, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (4, 8):\n50'\nCELL (4, 9):\n20'\nCELL (4, 10):\n20'\nCELL (5, 1):\nR-15M\nCELL (5, 2):\n60,000\nsq. ft. 2\nCELL (5, 3):\n200'\nCELL (5, 4):\n200'\nCELL (5, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (5, 6):\n50'\nCELL (5, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (5, 8):\n50'\nCELL (5, 9):\n20'\nCELL (5, 10):\n20'4\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"1 Public Sewer or Public Water\", 32],\n        [\"2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\", 32],\n        [\"CELL (4, 2): \\n40,000\\nsq. ft.\", 32],\n        [\"CELL (5, 2): \\n60,000\\nsq. ft.\", 32]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"From this page we can infer that the value is conditional on the presence of a public sewer or water system, and there are two different values for the current zone, depending on that.\",\n    \"answer\": \"40,000 sq ft (if public water or sewer); 60,000 sq ft (otherwise)\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 66\n\nR-15M Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 123 sq ft, side length is 10 ft\n\nNEW PAGE 67\n\nR-15M Zone - Senior Active Overlay\n\nmin_lot_size is 1523 sq ft\n\nDKEWKWKDS Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 20,000 sq ft\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"min_lot_size is 123 sq ft\", 66]],\n    \"rationale\": \"The section titled R-15M says the answer explicitly.

In cases where a boundary line is located within a street or alley right-of-way, railroad or\nutility right-of-way or easement, canal, navigable or unnavigable water body, it will be\nconsidered to be in the center of the street or alley right-of-way, railroad or utility\neasement, canal or water body. If the actual location of the right-of-way, easement, canal\nor water body varies slightly from the location as shown on the map, then the actual\nlocation will control.\nB. Where a district boundary is shown to approximately coincide with a property line or city\nlimit line, the property line or city limit line will be considered to be the district\nboundary, unless otherwise indicated.\nC. In cases where a district boundary does not coincide or approximately coincide with any\nstreet or alley, railroad, water body or canal or property line, and no dimensions are\nshown, the location of the boundary will be determined by the use of the scale appearing\non the map.\n\n\nNEW PAGE 4\nZoning\n4\n\u00a7 154.007 BONA FIDE FARMS EXEMPT.\nIn accordance with NCGS 160D-903, this chapter shall in no way regulate, restrict,\nprohibit or otherwise deter any bona fide farm and its related uses, within any extraterritorial\njurisdiction established by this Town.\n\u00a7 154.008 ZONING DISTRICTS.\nFor the purposes of this chapter, the incorporated areas and extraterritorial jurisdiction of\nthe Town of Bogue as shown on the Official Zoning Map, are divided into Zoning Districts RA,\nR-20, R-15, R-15M, B-1, OI and IW.\nThe zoning districts available under the Town of Bogue Zoning Chapter shall be those set forth\nbelow:\n1.

R-15 (Residential District, 15,000 square foot minimum lot size): A residential district\nrequiring a minimum of 15,000 square feet per lot if water or sewer is available and a\nminimum of 20,000 square feet if no public services are available.\n4. R-15M (Residential District, 15,000 square foot minimum lot): If water or sewer is\navailable and a minimum of 20,000 square feet if no public services are available. This\ndistrict allows manufactured homes residential structures built as per Volume 1B of the\nNorth Carolina Building Code.\n5.\nB-1 (General Business District): A business district established for retailing of\nmerchandise and for conducting professional and business service.\n6. I-W (Industrial and Wholesale District): A district suited for the location of\nmanufacturing and other related uses which would be incompatible with business and\nresidential areas.\n7.\nOP (Office and Institutional District): A district established to provide office,\ninstitutional, and professional development complexes.\n\u00a7 154.009 ZONING AFFECTS EVERY BUILDING AND USE.\nNo building, structure or land may be used or occupied, and no building, structure or part\nthereof may be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, enlarged or structurally altered unless\n\n\nNEW PAGE 5\nZoning\n5\nin conformity with all the regulations of this chapter for the district in which it is located, except\nas otherwise provided by this chapter.\n\u00a7 154.010 ROUNDING OFF FRACTIONS.\nWhen a requirement of this chapter results in a fraction of a unit, a fraction of one-half or\nmore will be rounded off and considered a whole unit. Fractions of less than one-half will be\nrounded off to the nearest lower number of units. For example, when the determination of the\nnumber of dwelling units permitted on a lot results in a fraction of a dwelling unit, a fraction of\none-half or more will be considered a dwelling unit and a fraction of less than one-half will be\ndisregarded.\n\u00a7 154.011 LOTS DIVIDED BY ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.\nIn the event that a district boundary line on the Zoning Map divides a lot or tract of single\nownership, each part of the lot may only be used in conformity with the regulations established\nby this chapter for the district in which each part is located. Should the division prove to be an\nimpractical application and an unreasonable hardship, the lesser portion of the lot or tract will be\nregulated the same as the greater portion of the lot or tract; or in the case of an equally divided\nlot or tract, the more restrictive zoning designation applies.\n\u00a7 154.012 REDUCTION OF LOT AREA PROHIBITED.\nNo lot existing at the time of adoption of this chapter may be reduced in its dimensions or\narea below the minimum requirements of this chapter for the district in which it is located unless\nspecifically authorized by other provisions of this chapter.\n\u00a7 154.013 INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF THESE REGULATIONS.\nIn the interpretation and application of this chapter, the provisions of the chapter will be\nconstrued to be the minimum requirements adopted to promote the public health, safety, comfort,\nconvenience and general welfare.\n\u00a7 154.014 RELATION OF THIS CHAPTER TO OTHER ORDINANCES.\nIt\nis not intended that this chapter will in any way repeal, annul or interfere with the\nexisting provisions of any law or ordinance except the zoning ordinance which this chapter\nreplaces. In addition it is not intended that this chapter will in any way repeal, annul or interfere\nwith any rules, regulations or zoning permits which were legally adopted or issued under\nprevious ordinances for the use or development of land or structures.\n\u00a7 154.015 ZONING BOUNDARIES OVER SURFACE WATERS.\n\nNEW PAGE 6\nZoning\n6\nSince NCGS 160D-702(a), as amended, permits a town to regulate development over\nestuarine waters and over lands covered by navigable waters owned by the state pursuant to\nNCGS 146-12, within the bounds of that town, the zoning boundaries for waterfront parcels\nshall be extended linearly 400 feet waterward of the mean high water mark.
