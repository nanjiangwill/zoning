Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Historic\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"H\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Historic\n(H) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Historic (H). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Historic (H)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Historic\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text.

Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

If approved, the developer can cluster or group dwelling units on\npart of the tract and allow the remaining part of the lot to remain in open space. This is\nstrictly a method of transferring density. It does not allow any uses that are not\nspecifically listed in the zoning ordinance.\n1. Minimum size - No fewer than twelve (12) structures will comprise a cluster\ndevelopment.\n2. Site Plan - Any proposed project shall have a site plan that shows the following\ninformation:\na. The location of the buildings, streets, alleys, walks, parking areas, recreation\nareas, tree covers, and planting.\nb. Number and show the dimensions of all building sites, streets, and utility\neasements to be dedicated to the public.\nC. All areas on the site plan other than public streets, easements or private\nstreets, easements or private building sites shall be shown and designed as\ncommon areas.\n4. Landscape Plan - A landscape plan for all projects shall show all existing and proposed\nplant materials. The plan shall indicate the size and type of plants to be planted.\n5. Maximum Number of Lots - The maximum number of lots that may be created in a\ncluster development shall be calculated as follows:\na. From the gross area of land to be developed, subtract twenty (20) percent\nVillage of Alamance Zoning Ordinance\nPage 44\n\n\nNEW PAGE 47\nDraft #7\nZONING ORDINANCE\nChapter 5 Special Uses\nwhich represents the approximate area needed for roadways.\nb. Divide the remainder by the minimum lot area requirement for single-family\ndwellings of the zoning district where the development is located.\nThe result is the maximum number of lots that may be created in the development. The\ntwenty (20) percent factor shall be constant regardless of the actual amount of land\nused for the street system.\n6.\nMinimum Standard for Lots - A cluster development with approved utility systems,\nincluding wells and septic tank systems, shall be exempt from the minimum lot sizes\nspecified in the zoning ordinance except as required in herein. However, in no case shall\nthe lot size be less than sixty (60) percent of the minimum zoning lot size. Dimensional\nrequirements such as lot width, front, side, and rear yards may vary up to a minimum of\nsixty (60) percent of that which is allowed within each of the districts, but in no case\nshall they be less than 60% the required dimensions\n7. Peripheral Lots - The minimum size or the minimum standards of those peripheral lots\nwhich will be adjacent to undeveloped property in a single-family zone or developed as\nsingle-family houses shall be the same as the minimum size or the minimum standards\nrequired in the zoning district where the cluster development is located.\n8. Open Space Standards - At the discretion of the developers, a cluster development may\nutilize a range of lot sizes not in conflict with the minimum specified above in Paragraph\n6 above Minimum Standards for Lots, and provided further, that all land saved shall be\ndesignated as parks or open space. Such parks or open space may be deeded to the\nVillage of Alamance or held in corporate or common ownership by the owners of lots\nwithin the development.\nIn consideration of the purposes served by a cluster development, the title to such open\nspace areasas provided shall be preserved to the perpetual benefit of the public\ngenerally or the private properties in the development and shall be restricted against\nprivate ownership for any other purposes. Improvements clearly incidental to the\npurpose of these provisions may be made within the open space provided that the\nmaximum coverage ofsuch improvements shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of\nthe open space.\n9. Access to Open Space - All lots created within the development shall have direct access\nto all parks or open spaces as provided by means of public streets, dedicated walkways,\nfact of physical contiguity, other public lands, or lands in common ownership by all\nresidents.\nVillage of Alamance Zoning Ordinance\nPage 45\n\n\nNEW PAGE 48\nDraft #7\nZONING ORDINANCE\nChapter 5 Special Uses\n10. Open Space Provisions - Where the open space is to be deeded to a homeowners'\nassociation or other such group ownership, the developer shall file a declaration of\ncovenants and restrictions that will govern the open space and the association of\nnonprofit organizations. This declaration shall be submitted with preliminary plat\napproval and shall include but not be limited to the following:\na. The homeowners' association or the nonprofit organization shall be established\nbefore any lots are sold.\nb. Membership shall be mandatory for each lot buyer and any successive buyer.\nC.\nThe association shall provide for liability insurance, any taxes, and maintenance\nof all grounds and facilities.\nd. Any sums levied by the association that remain unpaid shall become a lien upon\nthe lot owner's property.\ne. If all or any portion of the property held by the association is to be disposed of or\nif the association is dissolved, all such property shall be deeded in fee simple\nabsolute title to the Village at no cost to the Village.\n11. Expiration - In any case where a cluster development has been approved and\nconstruction not begun within one hundred eighty (180) days, the approval shall\nautomatically terminate and be of no further effect provided, however, the Board of\nAdjustment may, upon good and sufficient cause shown, extend this period for one (1)\nyear upon written request of the applicant.\n12. Phased Development - A cluster development may be developed in phases provided\nthat:\n13. Review before submission to Board of Adjustment - A site plan committee composed of the\nMayor, Zoning Administrator, county building inspector, fire personnel and the Village\nengineer shall review the submissions for completeness and may make\nrecommendations to the applicant before the project is placed on the Board of\nAdjustment agenda.\nVillage of Alamance Zoning Ordinance\nPage 46\nCELL (1, 1): \na.
