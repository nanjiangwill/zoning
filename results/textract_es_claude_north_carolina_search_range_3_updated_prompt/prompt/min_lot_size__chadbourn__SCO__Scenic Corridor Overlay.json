Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Scenic Corridor Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"SCO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Scenic Corridor Overlay\n(SCO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Scenic Corridor Overlay (SCO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Scenic Corridor Overlay (SCO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Scenic Corridor Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Uses in this district\ninclude heavy commercial goods and services for motor vehicles, and some limited\nindustrial. Allowed building/lot type is Highway Commercial.\nThe Industrial District (IND) is established to provide locations for industrial uses that,\ndue to the scale of the buildings and/or the nature of the use, cannot be integrated into the\ncommunity. Uses within the Industrial District are buffered from adjacent uses. The\ndominant uses in this district are manufacturing and warehouse storage. Small scale\nmanufacturing and storage that is compatible with less intensive uses can and should be\nlocated in other non-residential or mixed-use districts. The Industrial District is reserved\nfor uses which require very large buildings and/or large parking and loading facilities.\nThe Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay District (TNDO) provides an\nalternative opportunity applicable only upon request for a Zoning Map Amendment for\nthe development of new neighborhoods and the revitalization or extension of existing\nneighborhoods. These neighborhoods are structured upon a fine network of\ninterconnecting pedestrian-oriented streets and other public spaces. Traditional\nNeighborhood Developments (TND's) provide a mixture of housing types and prices,\nprominently sited civic or community building(s), stores/offices/workplaces, and\nchurches to provide a balanced mix of activities. A Traditional Neighborhood\nDevelopment (TND) has a recognizable center and clearly defined edges; optimum size is\na quarter mile from center to edge. A TND is urban in form, is typically an extension of\nthe existing developed area of the Town and has an overall residential density of up to\neleven (11) dwelling units per acre. TNDO districts should have a significant portion of\nland dedicated to improved open spaces, and reserve un-improved open spaces where\nenvironmentally sensitive areas are located.\nThe Scenic Corridor Overlay District (SCO) is established to protect the pastoral scenes\nand open spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and visitors traveling the\nmajor entrance roads and gateways to the Town. The pastoral scenes and undeveloped\nproperty along the entrance roads and gateways contribute significantly to Chadbourn's\ncommunity character and sense of place. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District provides\ndevelopment options for the owners of the property abutting the entrance roads and\ngateways. The goal of this district is to protect the scenic value of the corridors through a\nmix of incentives and development standards. These standards will preserve the\nsuburban character of the Town by maintaining the sense of a suburban corridor in an\nurban environment; provide an aesthetically appealing experience for those traveling the\ncorridor; provide multi-modal transportation options for travel; and promote a safe\ntransportation corridor for motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians.\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 5\n\n\nNEW PAGE 137\nThe Heavy Industry Overlay District (HIO) is established to protect all environments\nfrom the negative impacts of certain activities and types of development. It is the intent\nof this district to provide and permit certain public and private heavy industrial uses and\nfacilities that incorporate hazardous materials and/or scientific technology, including\nwholesale, distribution, storage, processing, manufacturing and production. However, it\nis required that industries in this district take all necessary actions including but not\nlimited to installation of apparatus and technological equipment available to prevent\nnegative impacts on the environment and the community from the emissions of smoke,\ndust, fumes, noise and vibrations and other activities and/or products resulting from such\nhazardous industrial activities in accordance with federal, state and local regulations.\nThe Mini Farm Overlay District (MFO) permits buildings to be grouped on a site, parcel,\nor property in order to optimize the use of land and resources for both residential and\nagricultural purposes. By clustering development at a density no greater than one unit\nper developed acre, projects developed in accordance with these standards can obtain\ndensity bonuses while preserving unique natural features for agricultural use. The Mini\nFarm Overlay District mandates the dedication of both agricultural land and open space\nwith density bonuses provided as an incentive for adhering to the standards. It is the\nintent of this district to be used for new development in undeveloped outlying areas of the\nTown and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. Allowed building/lot type is Detached House.\nThe Manufactured Home Overlay District (MHO) is established to protect the standard of\nliving and neighborhood conditions. Established standards that will enable the use of\ninnovative manufactured homes with a higher aesthetic standard will invigorate these\ncommunities. Non-conforming manufactured home parks that have not received\napproval for continuation would be amortized over a period of time to allow the\nowner/operator to meet reasonable financial payback expectations in accordance with\naccepted practices in North Carolina. Existing parks could be limited to less fundamental\nstandards and specifications, while new parks are required to meet a higher standard.\nThese parks may be ideally suited for alternative designs such as Tiny House, Park\nModel and other styles of housing where installation standards are considered temporary.\nThe overlay could be expanded to apply to permanent installations of innovative\nmanufactured housing in subdivisions or parks in accordance with G.S. 160D-909.\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 6\n\n\nNEW PAGE 138\n8.4\nDistrict Development Standards and Permitted Uses Listed for Each District\nDevelopment standards are established for each of the following Primary General-Use\nDistricts to promote the orderly development of the Town of Chadbourn. The uses listed\nfor each district, are as specified in Table 8.1, Sections 1-3 appearing at the end of this\nArticle for each of the three categories of use listings as follows:\n1) Listed Use - Where a use is listed in a given district, the symbol \"L\" is entered in\nthe corresponding district column for the specific use.\n2) Use Listed with Additional Standards - Where a use requiring supplemental\nstandards and specifications in accordance with Section 10.1 of this Ordinance is\nlisted in a district, the symbol \"A\" is entered in the corresponding district column\nfor the specific use along with the reference number for the applicable\nsupplemental standard(s).\n3) Special Use - Where a use is listed in a given district, upon satisfaction of the\nrequirements established in Section 10.2 of this Ordinance, the symbol \"S\" is\nentered in the corresponding district column for the specific use.\nWhere a use is not listed within a given Primary General-Use District, such use shall not\nbe permitted.\n8.4-1 Agriculture District (AG)\n(A.) Intent. The Agriculture District (AG) is established to protect lands used for\nagricultural production, agriculturally based businesses and related activities.\nFarmland is a defining element of Chadbourn's identity and the protection of these\nlands aids in preserving the character of the Town until such time as new\ndevelopment is preferred by the Town. Listed uses are limited, with an emphasis\non uses that are agricultural in nature. Development density is very low to\nencourage preservation of agricultural lands while discouraging large lot\nresidential subdivision type development and excessive septic system utility. The\nAgriculture District can also be used to preserve open spaces.\n(B.) Listed Uses:\n(1.) Uses listed by right: See Table of Uses (Table 8.1) of this Article\n(2.) Uses listed with additional standards: See Table of Uses (Table 8.1) of this\nArticle and Article 10, Section 10.1\n(3.) Uses listed with conditions: See Table of Uses (Table 8.1) of this Article and\nArticle 10, Section 10.2\n(C.) Listed Building and Lot Types: Detached House\n(D.) Residential Density Limit, excluding Accessory Dwellings meeting the\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 7\n\nNEW PAGE 161\n(c.) Consistent build-to lines shall be established along all streets and public\nspace frontages; build-to lines determine the width and ratio of enclosure\nfor each public street or space. A minimum percentage build-out at the\nbuild-to line shall be established on the plan along all streets and public\nsquare frontages.\n(d.) Building and lot types shall comply with the descriptions provided in\nArticle 9.\n(e.) Large-scale, single use facilities (conference spaces, theaters, athletic\nfacilities, etc.) shall generally occur behind or above smaller scale uses of\npedestrian orientation. Such facilities may exceed maximum first floor\narea standards if SO sited.\n(4.) Open Space: The provision and design of open space shall comply with the\nrequirements set forth in Article 21.\n(5.) Driveways, Parking, Landscaping and Buffers: Driveways to individual lots\nshall be separated a minimum of 47 linear feet, measured at the right-of-way\nalong streets, within the TNDO. Parking shall comply with the requirements\nset forth in Article 12. Landscaping, including required buffers, shall comply\nwith the requirements set forth in Article 11.\n8.5-2 Scenic Corridor Overlay (SCO)\n(A.) Intent. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District (SCO) is established to protect the\npastoral scenes and open spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and\nvisitors traveling the major entrance roads and gateways to the Town. The pastoral\nscenes and undeveloped property along the entrance roads and gateways contribute\nsignificantly to Chadbourn's community character and sense of place. The Scenic\nCorridor Overlay District provides development options for the owners of the\nproperty abutting the entrance roads and gateways. The goal of this district is to\nprotect the scenic value of the corridors through a mix of incentives and\ndevelopment standards. These standards will preserve the suburban character of\nthe Town by maintaining the sense of a suburban corridor in an urban\nenvironment; provide an aesthetically appealing experience for those traveling the\ncorridor; provide multi-modal transportation options for travel; and promote a safe\ntransportation corridor for motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians.\n(B.) Types. Three (3) types of scenic corridors are hereby created:\n(1.) Suburban Scenic Corridor - A corridor along which development is limited,\nconsisting largely of fields, pastures, and scattered residential uses. The\nsuburban scenic corridor evokes a sense of traveling through an undeveloped\narea, with pastoral scenes and a sense of being removed from the urban\nenvironment.\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 30\n\n\nNEW PAGE 162\n(2.) Gateway Scenic Corridor - A corridor that serves as an entrance way to a\nplace that is unique and different from other communities in the area. The\ngateway corridor provides a sense of arrival to a place that is special and\ndifferent from the typical places. The gateway scenic corridor may be more\ndeveloped than the suburban scenic corridor, but the character of the\ndevelopment is such that those using the corridor are aware they are in a\nspecial place.\n(3.) Bypass Scenic Corridor - A corridor providing for buffering of the Bypass to\nprotect the traffic carrying capacity of the road and to provide for a pleasant\nexperience for motorists using the bypass. The bypass scenic corridor\nrequires an undeveloped setback from the bypass, promoting that the bypass\nthrough Chadbourn is unique and portrays the character of the community\nwhile enhancing the safety of motorists using the road.\n(C.) General Standards & Specifications:\n(1.) Development Pattern. Building placement, parking placement, building type,\nurban form, access, and lot arrangement shall be controlled by the lot and\nbuilding type standards (Article 9) for the lot and building types listed in the\nScenic Corridor Overlay District.\n(2.) Activities Listed in the Scenic Corridor. In order to preserve the aesthetic\nquality of the scenic corridors, uses and activities within the designated scenic\ncorridors shall be limited to the following:\n(a.) The scenic corridor easement may be used for passive recreation,\nagricultural uses, and equestrian uses. No other use shall be listed within\nthe scenic corridor easement.\n(b.) No building construction, parking, land disturbing activity, signs, tree\nremoval, lighting (other than street lighting provided by the Town of\nChadbourn and driveway or private road lighting provided that said\nlighting is provided by full cutoff fixtures), or other development activity\nshall occur within the scenic corridor easement except as follows:\n(i.) A bikeway, greenway, and/or other pedestrian/bicycle facility may be\nlocated within the scenic corridor easement.\n(ii.) Underground utilities and easements for underground utilities may be\nlocated within the scenic easement, provided that no above ground\ntransmission or other equipment is located within the scenic easement.\n(iii.) Buildings used primarily for agricultural and/or equestrian related\nactivities may be built in the scenic corridor easement upon approval\nby the Town Council as a Special Use. Parking shall be located\nbehind the building, shall not be located within the scenic easement,\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 31\n\n\nNEW PAGE 163\nand shall be buffered from the scenic corridor. The Town Council\nshall consider the following items in making the decision to allow\naforesaid buildings in the scenic easement:\n1. The building's visual impact on the scenic corridor;\n2. The building's size;\n3. The compatibility of the building's architecture with community\ncharacter and the purposes of the scenic corridor overlay district.\n(3.) Scenic Corridor Dimensions. The designated scenic corridors shall meet the\nfollowing dimensional standards:\n(a.) The width of the scenic easement within the Suburban Scenic Corridor\nshall be 10% of the lot depth but no more than 100 feet from the edge of\nthe public right-of-way. The Planning, Zoning & Subdivision\nAdministrator may require an additional scenic depth of up to 50 feet in\norder to preserve structures and/or vegetation deemed to be significant.\n(b.) The width of the scenic easement within the Gateway Scenic Corridor\nshall be 10% of the lot depth but no more than 50 feet from the edge of the\nhighway right-of-way. The Planning, Zoning & Subdivision\nAdministrator may require an additional depth of up to 25 feet in order to\npreserve structures and/or vegetation deemed to be significant.\n(c.) The width of the scenic easement within the Bypass Scenic Corridor shall\nbe 10% of the lot depth but no more than 75 feet from the edge of the\npublic right-of-way. The Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator\nmay require an additional depth of up to 25 feet in order to preserve\nstructures and/or vegetation deemed to be significant.\n(4.) Scenic Corridor Provisions. The following provisions shall govern\ndevelopment within a designated scenic corridor:\n(a.) The area within the scenic easement may be dedicated to the Town as a\nconservation easement, provided it meets the standards for such an\neasement as established by applicable state and federal standards.\n(b.) Development density shall be calculated for the entire property, including\nthe area within the scenic easement, with the exception that development\ndensity bonuses of up to 50 percent are given for the portion of the\nproperty within the scenic easement. In the event that the property owner\nprovides a scenic easement wider than required by this ordinance, the\ndensity bonus may be increased up to 75% for the area located within the\nscenic easement.\nFor example, the Jones family own a 10-acre property zoned Single-Family\nResidential (SFR). Two (2) acres of the property are within the Scenic\nCorridor Overlay. The density is calculated as follows:\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 32\n\n\nNEW PAGE 164\nBase density @ 3 units/acre X 10 acres = 30 units\n50% density bonus for 2 acres in scenic corridor easement\n50% of (2 acres X 3 units/acre) = 3-unit bonus\nTotal Density = 33units\nIf the Jones provide an easement wider than required, then they would receive a\n75% density bonus for the area within the easement:\nBase density @ 3units/acre X 10 acres = 30 units\n75% density bonus for 2 acres with wider easement\n75% of (2 acres X 3 units/acre) = 4.5-unit bonus\nTotal Density = 35 units\n(c.) Development may be clustered on the portion of the property located\noutside the scenic easement.\n(5.) Curb Cuts. There shall be a minimum separation of 500' between curb cuts\nin the suburban scenic corridors. This separation requirement may be waived\nby the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator if the width of the\nproperty frontage would preclude a second curb cut meeting this spacing\nrequirement.\n(6.) Lot Standards & Specifications. The lot type standards and building type\nstandard listed in the underlying district, as set forth in section 8.4 and further\ndescribed in Article 9, shall apply in the Scenic Corridor Overlay District.\n(D.) Open Space. The provision and design of open space shall comply with the\nrequirements set forth in Article 21. Land within the scenic easement may count\nfor up to 100% of the minimum open space required by Article 21 of this\nOrdinance.\n(E.) Parking & Landscaping. Parking shall comply with the requirements set forth in\nArticle 12. Landscaping shall comply with the requirements set forth in Article 11.\n(This space left blank intentionally.)\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 33\n\n\nNEW PAGE 165\n8.5-3 Heavy Industry Overlay (HIO)\n(A.) Intent. The Heavy Industry Overlay (HIO) District is established in accordance\nwith NCGS Reference: 130A-293 Local ordinances prohibiting hazardous waste\nfacilities to protect all environments from the negative impacts of certain activities\nand types of development. It is the intent of this district to provide and permit\ncertain public and private heavy industrial uses and facilities that incorporate\nhazardous materials and/or scientific technology, including wholesale, distribution,\nstorage, processing, manufacturing and production. However, it is required that\nindustries in this district take all necessary actions including but not limited to\ninstallation of apparatus and technological equipment available to prevent negative\nimpacts on the environment and the community from the emissions of smoke, dust,\nfumes, noise and vibrations and other activities and/or products resulting from\nsuch hazardous industrial activities in accordance with federal, state and local\nregulations. It is further intended that this section will:\n(1.) provide standards that will promote that such development will be designed,\narranged and constructed to protect the reservoirs and the lands of the Town\nof Chadbourn;\n(2.) provide standards that will promote that such development will have a\nminimum impact on the public schools within the Town's jurisdiction and\npublic health safety, and welfare; and\n(3.) through the zoning map amendment process; provide for careful\nconsideration in the location of such uses that, because of their inherent\nnature, extent, and external effects, require special care in control of their\ndesign and methods of operation in order to promote protection of the public\nsafety and welfare.\n(B.) Property shall be within an Industrial (IND) Zoning District to be eligible for\nconsideration for the Heavy Industry Overlay (HIO) District.\n(C.) Exempt Uses. For the purpose of this section, the following uses are exempt from\nthe provisions of this section:\n(1.) Medical Clinics having no-certificate-of need for in-patient care;\n(2.) Medical Facilities having no-certificate-of need for in-patient care;\n(3.) Doctor's Offices;\n(4.) Medical Labs;\n(5.) Dental Offices;\n(6.) Outpatient Facilities having no certificate-of-need for in-patient care; and\n(7.)
