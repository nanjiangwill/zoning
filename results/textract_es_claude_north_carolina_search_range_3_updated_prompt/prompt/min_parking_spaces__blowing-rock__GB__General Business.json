Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"General Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"GB\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If General Business\n(GB) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor General Business (GB). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"General Business (GB)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"General Business\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

Combination Uses. When a combination use comprises two or more principal\nuses that require different types of permits (zoning or special use), then the permit authorizing\nthe combination use shall be:\na) A special use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a special use permit.\nb) A zoning permit in all other cases.\nThis is indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses by the designation Z and S in each of the columns\nadjacent to the 29.000 classification.\n16-10.10.1. Subject to Section 16-10.10.2 when a combination use in an R-6 or R-10 zoning\ndistrict consists of a residential subdivision and a multi-family development, the total density\npermissible on the lot shall be determined by having the developer indicate on the plans the\nportion of the total lot that will be developed for each purpose and calculating the density\nfor each portion as if it were a separate lot.\n16-10.10.2. Notwithstanding Section 16-12.2.2 whenever a combination use consists of a\nstandard residential subdivision and a multi-family development, and the subdivided portion\nof the tract contains lots that exceed the minimum lot size requirements set forth in Section\n16-181, but that do not exceed an average of 30,000 square feet, then the density of the\nportion of the tract developed for multi-family purposes may be increased beyond the\npermissible density calculated in accordance with Section 16-10.10.1. The increase in density\nshall be determined as follows:\na) The minimum lot size requirement for the applicable zoning district shall be subtracted\nfrom each lot that exceeds the minimum lot size, and the remainders totaled.\nb) The sum derived from the calculation in subdivision (1) shall be divided by the minimum\nlot size requirement. Fractions shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.\nc)\nThe product of the calculation in subdivision (2) shall yield the number of additional multi-\nfamily dwelling units that may be located within the portion of tract developed for multi-\nfamily purposes.\n10-5\n\n\nNEW PAGE 100\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n16-10.10.3. When a residential use is combined with a non-residential use in a business\ndistrict, the lot must have at least the minimum square footage required for the residential\nuse alone.\n16-10.10.4. When two principal uses are combined, the total amount of parking required for\nthe combination use shall be determined by cumulating the amount of parking required for\neach individual principal use according to the relative amount of space occupied by that use.\nSection 16-10.11. More Specific Use Controls. Whenever a development could fall within more\nthan one use classification in the Table of Permissible Uses, the classification that most closely\nand most specifically describes the development controls. For example, a small doctor's office\nor clinic clearly falls within the 3.110 classification (Office and service operations conducted\nentirely indoors and designed to attract customers or clients to the premises). However,\nclassification 3.130, \"Physicians and dentists offices and clinics occupying not more than 10,000\nsquare feet of gross floor area\" more specifically covers this use and therefore is controlling.\nSection 16-10.12. Short-Term Rentals. The Board finds that short-term rentals (STRs) are an\nappropriate use given the residential/resort character of Blowing Rock's planning jurisdiction,\nprovided that specific controls are in place to regulate parking, trash, noise, tenant safety, and\nother related effects thereby protecting neighborhood property values, and the health, safety,\nand the general welfare of Town citizens and visitors.\nShort-term rentals are defined as the rental, lease, or offer to make available, any attached or\ndetached residential dwelling unit, or portion thereof, by way of a rental agreement, lease,\nlicense, or any other means, (whether oral or written) for compensation or consideration, for a\nduration that is less than 28 consecutive days. The following standards shall apply to all short-\nterm rentals with the Town's planning jurisdiction:\na) A zoning permit must be initially obtained for a change in use for each dwelling unit that is to\nbe rented for a period of less than 28 days. The permit is not valid until a satisfactory\ninspection is completed.\nb) A local contact person or management company contact information must be clearly posted\non the interior of the dwelling unit, and the person/company shall be available to respond to\ncomplaints or emergencies within one (1) hour.\nc) Sufficient off-street parking must be provided for each bedroom to be rented. The parking\nspace must meet the minimum dimensional requirements in Section 16-20.6. Short-term\nrental units that exist on July 1, 2018, are grandfathered with respect to parking, but each\nbedroom added after this date requires an additional parking space.\nd) Adequate trash and recycling containers must be provided. If collection containers are kept\nin an enclosure bin, the bin must meet minimum design standards defined in the Town Code\n(ex. Placed within 6 to 12 feet of the edge of the street, opaque screening at least four feet\nhigh, etc.).\ne) The dwelling unit must be equipped with operable smoke detectors and carbon monoxide\ndetectors consistent with the NC Building Code.\nf)\nThe 911 address must be posted on the front of the house or dwelling unit with 3.5-inch\nreflective numbers (6-inch reflective number if commercial or multi-family) or on the\n10-6\n\n\nNEW PAGE 101\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nproperty according to Section 7-17 of the Town Code. The 911 address must be clearly posted\non the interior of the dwelling unit to notify tenants in case of emergency.\n16-10.12.1. In addition to those areas zoned to allow short-term rentals (CB, TC, GB, OI), there\nare other areas where short-term rentals are permissible including Chetola Resort and Royals\nOaks Condominiums (Overlay District). There are other properties that were previously\noperating short-term rentals or had permitted vested rights through Watauga or Caldwell\nCounty prior to being annexed or added to the Extraterritorial Jurisdiction. These properties\nhave a legal nonconforming status that provides the opportunity for short-term rental. Each\nproperty owner that applies for a zoning permit for short-term rental use in areas not\npermitted by right or listed herein must provide historical documentation that the\nnonconformity has been legally obtained or a vested right has been legally established under\nNCGS 160D-108.\n10-7\n\nNEW PAGE 102\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n10-8\n\nNEW PAGE 183\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\na) Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant.\nb)\nStreet address, parcel identification number and / or legal description of the premises or\nproperty upon which the sign is to be located.\nc) Two blueprints or drawings of the sign plans with color designation, dimensions,\nmaterials, letter style, type of illumination, and method of construction. Master sign\nplans may require additional information.\nd) For a ground sign or column sign, a scaled drawing or survey showing property lines,\nexisting and proposed site improvements, the proposed sign location, and landscaping.\ne) For a wall, awning, window, or projecting sign, a scaled drawing showing the entire\nfacade, the proposed sign location, and any existing signs on the building.\nf) Name of the person, firm, or corporation that will be constructing and/or erecting the\nsign.\ng) Written consent of the owner of the building, structure, or land upon which the sign is to\nbe erected.\nh) When required, the application requesting an electrical permit for the proposed sign must\nbe attached to the sign application.\ni)\nSuch other supporting information that the Administrator may require to verify full\ncompliance with all applicable provisions of this Article.\n16-17.6.2. Each application for a sign permit or for approval of a master sign plan shall be\naccompanied by the applicable fees, as shall be established by the Town Council.\n16-17.6.3. In the case of a lot occupied or intended to be occupied by multiple tenants (for\nexample a shopping center), sign permits shall be issued in the name of the property owner\nor agent rather than in the name of the tenant requesting a particular sign.\n16-17.6.4. The Administrator may authorize and approve the display of a temporary sign\nwhen there is a legitimate delay, beyond the applicant's control, in the construction or\npreparation of a permanent sign for a business or property. The temporary sign may only be\ndisplayed for a period of 90 days, or until the new sign is erected, whichever is less. Temporary\nsigns approved pursuant to this Section shall meet the size and height standards for the\npermanent signs they are substituting for, and shall be composed of rigid material, other than\ncorrugated metal or other low-quality material.\nSection 16-17.7. Master Sign Plan. The intent of the Master Sign Plan is to promote a cohesive\nand consistent aesthetic theme for signage within multi-family and townhouse developments,\nplanned unit developments, and multi-occupant nonresidential developments.\n16-17.7.1. Master Sign Plan Contents. The following shall be contained in each Master Sign\nPlan application:\na) Type and location of each sign\nb) Permitted sign materials\nc) Permitted dimensions / area of each sign\nd) Permitted sign shapes\ne) Permitted font styles for lettering\nf) Permitted mounting method for wall and projecting signs (including bracket style)\ng) Permitted sign colors (not to exceed three different colors, which must be chosen from\n17-5\n\n\nNEW PAGE 184\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nthe Town's approved color chart)\n16-17.7.2. Effect of Master Sign Plan Approval. Following the approval of a Master Sign\nPlan, no sign shall be erected, placed, painted, or maintained on the subject property, except\nin conformance with such plan. All owners, tenants, subtenants, and purchasers of individual\nunits within the development shall comply with the approved plan. The provisions of the\nplan may be enforced in the same way as any other provision of this Article. In case of any\nconflict between the provisions of such a plan and any other provision of this Article, the\nmore restrictive provision shall apply.\n16-17.7.3. Amendments to Master Sign Plans. Following the initial approval of a Master Sign\nPlan, it may be amended only upon the application of all parties with ownership interest in\nthe property covered by the plan. If an amendment is secured which affects the permitted\nstyle, materials, or colors of signs, then all signage shall be updated to meet the new standard\nwithin 180 days of the approval of the amended plan, as applicable to each sign.\nSection 16-17.8. Computation of Sign Area. The surface area of a sign shall be computed by\nmeans of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will enclose\nthe writing, graphic, emblem, or other display on the face of the sign. The sign area shall include\nany material or color that is an essential part of the background of the display or that is used to\ndifferentiate the sign from the wall, structure, or backdrop against which the sign is placed. The\nsign area shall not include any supporting framework, bracing, decorative fencing, or wall that\notherwise meets the zoning and building regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself.\n16-17.8.1. If the sign consists of more than one section or module, all of the area, including\nthat between sections or modules, shall be included in the computation of the sign area.\n16-17.8.2. With respect to a two-sided, multi-sided, or three-dimensional sign, the sign\nsurface area shall be computed by including the total of all sides designed to attract attention\nor communicate information that can be seen at any one time by a person from one vantage\npoint. Without otherwise limiting the generality of the preceding statement, when two\nidentical sign faces are placed back-to-back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any\npoint at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are\nnot more than 36 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one\nof the faces.\nSection 16-17.9. Computation of Sign Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the\ndistance between the average grade of the land beneath the sign and the top of the highest\nattached component of the sign.\nSection 16-17.10. Signs Permitted in All Zoning Districts. The following signs are allowed in all\nzoning districts, subject to the standards outlined in this section and elsewhere in this Article,\nand do not require a permit, unless otherwise provided.\n16-17.10.1. Required Regulatory Signs. All signs required to be displayed pursuant to a law,\nrule, regulation, or other mandate carrying the force of law, enacted by a governmental entity\nhaving jurisdiction within the Town or its ETJ, shall be permitted to be displayed in the\nlocation and manner prescribed in the applicable law, rule, or regulation.\n17-6\n\n\nNEW PAGE 185\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n16-17.10.2.
