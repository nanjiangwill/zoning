Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Marine Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MB\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Marine Business\n(MB) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Marine Business (MB). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Marine Business (MB)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Marine Business\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found.

WATER USE DISTRICT (W-1)\n152.120 DISTRICT DESCRIPTION\nThe Water Use District (W-1) is established to provide for the safe and orderly use of public trust waters\nwithin the zoning jurisdiction of the Town. The Water Use District (W-1) is intended to provide for a\nwide range of activities and uses while protecting the public rights of access, health and safety.\n152.121 PERMITTED USES\n(a) Private bulkheads and piers which have received a permit under the North Carolina Coastal Area\nManagement Act.\n(a) Traditional water activities, such as bathing, fishing and boating.\n152.122 SPECIAL USES\n(a) Special events, such as boat races, regattas, water ski ishows, boat parades, and historic\nreenactments.\n(b) Commercial marinas only in the Marine Business District as regulated by sections 152.071 TO\n152.072.\n152.123 MOORING OF BOATS\n(a) The unattended mooring of vessels within the zoning jurisdiction of the Town for periods longer\nthan seven days is prohibited subject to those allowed in section 152.123(b). The occupancy of\nvessels within the zoning jurisdiction of the Town for longer than seven days is prohibited.\nThe mooring of boats within public trust waters creates safety hazards for boat traffic and can\ninterfere with public rights access to, and use of, navigable waters and public resources. The\nlong- term occupancy of moored vessels within the public trust waters is a hazard to water\nquality and public health. All temporarily moored boats must be lighted between sunset and\nsunrise.\n(b) Permanent, privately owned moorings are hazardous to navigation, increase congestion of the\npublic trust waters, and create potential water quality degradation. Therefore, no privately\nowned permanent mooring shall be allowed.\nARTICLE XIV. REGULATIONS\n152.130 APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS\nThe regulations set forth in this chapter affect all land, every building or structure and every use of the\nland and/or building within all the areas that are zoned by the Town.\n152.131 NEW USES OR CONSTRUCTION\nAfter the effective date of this chapter, all new construction and use of land shall conform to the use\nand dimensional requirements for the district in which it is to be located.\nAdopted 3/13/2023\n18\n\nNEW PAGE 43\n(6) Construction signs.

Display of such signs shall be limited to a period of two years, unless the signs are\npermanent with advertising restricted to the name of the subdivision only and are\ndedicated to and accepted by the county, a municipal government or a lawfully\nestablished homeowners' or community association responsible for the maintenance of\ncommonly-owned properties of the development.\n(8) Window signs. Window signs shall be placed only inside a public or commercial building and\nshall not exceed 25 percent of the glass area of the pane upon which the sign is placed.\n152.233 PRINCIPAL USE SIGNS\n(1) Principal use signs may be indirectly illuminated only.\n(2) If suspended from a canopy, the principal use sign must be at least seven feet above the\nsidewalk level.\n(3) Principal use signs shall have a maximum surface area of two square feet for each one linear\nfoot of street frontage, but in no case exceeding a total of 200 square feet in sign area per lot.\n(4) Freestanding signs shall be limited to two per lot, per business, neither of which shall be located\nin any side yard or within ten feet of a side property line.\n(5) Freestanding signs meeting state building code provisions will be allowable.\nARTICLE XX. BUFFERS\n152.240 REQUIRED\nIn order to lessen the impact of incompatible land use, a visual buffer of six feet or more in height shall\nbe provided and maintained to separate those uses which are deemed to have a negative effect on\nresidential or other areas. When new business or industrial construction will abut an existing residential\ndistrict or use, a buffer strip with a visual buffer shall be provided and maintained by the business\nor\nindustrial use. In addition, when new residential construction will abut an existing business or industrial\nuse, the buffer strip and visual buffer shall be provided by the residential developer. This buffer strip\nshall be part of the lot and shall be maintained by the lot owner or the homeowners' association, in the\ncase of commonly-owned land.\n152.241 DEFINITIONS\nThe following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to\nthem in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:\nAdopted 3/13/2023\n41\n\n\nNEW PAGE 44\nBuffers means solid, decorative, visual obstructions used to shield objectionable uses or use accessories\nfrom public view.\n152.242 REQUIREMENTS\n(1) Buffers shall consist of:\na.
