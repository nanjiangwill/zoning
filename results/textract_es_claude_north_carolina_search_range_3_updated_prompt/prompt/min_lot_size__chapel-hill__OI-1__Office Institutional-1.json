Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Office Institutional-1\n(OI-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Office Institutional-1 (OI-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Office Institutional-1 (OI-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Office Institutional-1\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Non-residential uses that are permitted as a CZ** in Table 3.7-1: Use Matrix must be proposed and reviewed as a component of a development in a\nResidential-Community Priority-Conditional Zoning District (R-CP-CZD) application. Such uses shall not represent more than twenty-five (25) percent of the total floor area of the proposed\ndevelopment. Floor area restrictions shall not apply to non-residential uses that are accessory uses to an allowable residential use.\n( Ord. No. 2022-11-16/0-3, 4)\n3.5 Special districts.\nSpecial districts have been created to deal with unique, location-specific situations where special standards and procedures are appropriate. The following special districts are defined below: mixed use\ndistricts, office/institutional-4 district, traditional neighborhood development district, and transit oriented development district.\n3.5.1 Mixed Use Districts.\nPurpose statement: The mixed use districts are intended to provide for the coordinated development of office, commercial, and residential uses and their necessary support functions in the vicinity of\nkey highway intersections and transit corridors in Chapel Hill. They are designed to facilitate stated public policies to encourage design which emphasizes lively, people oriented environments and\ncompatible, visually interesting development. This district provides areas where moderate scale mixed use centers can locate with an emphasis on development of a balance of residential, office and\ncommercial uses.\nIt is further intended that the mixed use districts shall encourage development within which mutually supporting residential, commercial and office uses are scaled, balanced and located to reduce\ngeneral traffic congestion by providing housing close to principal destinations, and convenient pedestrian and bicycle circulation systems and mass transit to further reduce the need for private\nautomobile usage. Mixed use districts are intended to encourage development that allows multiple destinations to be achieved with a single trip. These standards encourage a design such that uses\nwithin a mixed use district are arranged in a manner that encourages internal vehicular trip capture and the development patterns that encourage walking, transit and bicycling as alternatives to\nautomotive travel.\nWhen such districts adjoin residential development or residential zoning districts, it is intended that arrangement of buildings, uses, open space, and vehicular or pedestrian and bicycle access shall be\nsuch as to provide appropriate transition and reduce potentially adverse effects.\n(a) Establishment and intent of mixed use districts.\nThree mixed use (MU) districts are hereby established. The boundaries of the mixed use districts are as shown on the official zoning atlas. The districts are identified as Mixed Use-OI-1 (MU-OI-1),\nMixed Use-R-1 (MU-R-1), and Mixed Use-Village (MU-V).\nIt is the intent of the Town of Chapel Hill to reserve the MU-OI-1 and MU-R-1 designations and regulations for areas already so zoned as of September 2002 and to reserve MU-V for areas already so\nzoned as of October 2020. The policy of the town is to grant no further rezonings to MU-OI-1, MU-R-1, or to MU-V and to reserve future mixed-use village zoning designations for MU-V-CZD.\n(b) Permitted uses and development intensities-Mixed Use-Village (MU-V).\n(1) The uses permitted in the MU-V districts include the following:\nA. Vertical mixed use buildings, or\nB. Uses listed in subsection (2), below, which are mixed horizontally. Uses are considered to be \"mixed horizontally' where:\n1. Such uses comprise not less than the minimum, and not more than the maximum, percentage of floor area prescribed in subsection (b)(2)A, below; and\n2. Uses within a land use category set forth below, are located not further than eight hundred (800) feet from the uses located within another land use category; and\n3. The uses within separate land use categories, as set forth below, are linked by a continuous system of sidewalks or trails. Sidewalks or trails shall be considered \"continuous\" if they are\ninterrupted only by street intersections, but shall not be considered \"continuous\" if interrupted by natural or man-made barriers to pedestrian and bicycle movement or by a street\nconsisting of more than two (2) lanes of traffic, unless a pedestrian and bicycle island is provided.\n(2) Land use categories.\nA. An MU-V shall include office, commercial, and residential uses as described below. The mix of floor area within a proposed development shall contain at least twenty-five (25) percent of\nthe floor area devoted to residential uses and at least twenty-five (25) percent of the floor area devoted to office/commercial uses.\nB. For purposes of this section:\n1. Uses within the \"Residential\" land use category include the following:\nDwelling units, single-family,\nDwelling units, two-family with accessory apartments,\nDwelling units, duplex,\nDwelling units, multifamily, three to seven dwelling units,\nDwelling units, multifamily, over seven dwelling units,\n2. Uses within the \"Non-Residential\" land use category include the following:\nBusiness, office-type,\nChild/adult day care facility (See section 3.6),\nClinic,\nCollege or university,\nFine arts educational institution,\nHotel or motel,\nResearch activities,\nBank,\nBarber shop/beauty salon,\nBusiness-convenience,\nBusiness-general,\n7 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\n\nNEW PAGE 8\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nBusiness-wholesale,\nManufacturing, light,\nPersonal services,\nPublic service facility,\nPublishing and/or printing,\nRecreation facility: Commercial.\n3.\nUses not enumerated above shall not be considered to be within a residential or non-residential land use category within the meaning of this section.\n(c) Dimensional Restrictions.\n(1) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this section, regulations governing the dimensions of lots and buildings are hereby established as shown in Table 3.8-1.\n(2) Permitted density shall not exceed fifteen (15) dwelling units per acre for MU-V collector and MU-V local and twenty (20) du/are for MU-v arterial. Permitted intensity and impervious surface\nrestrictions shall be as established n section 3.8 Table 3.8-1 unless development rights are transferred pursuant to section 3.9.2 of this appendix. The frontage and setback requirements shall\nnot apply to parks and open space.\n(d) Mixed Use Development Design Standards-MU-V\n(1) All design standards specified article 5 of this appendix and in the town's design guidelines in effect at the time a proposal is being reviewed shall apply to the design of development\nproposed as a mixed use development as defined by this article along with the provisions of subsections (2) through (5), below.\n(2) Any application for mixed use development shall include a concept plan as provided in section 4.3 and a special use permit as provided in section 4.6 of this appendix. The special use permit\nshall include a phasing plan that specifies the stages of development build out. The phasing plan shall identify the sequence of development for the land uses shown on the special use permit.\nThe phasing plan information may be prepared as a plan, a table, or a report. It shall include general phasing of internal and external traffic circulation systems, amenities, and utility\nimprovements that will be constructed concurrent with the land use development. Land use development scheduling shall include a general indication of size, either in square footage or\nacres. The plan shall also indicate the expected impact of the development on existing or proposed public facilities, including but not limited to, streets, transit, schools, water and sewer\nsystems, and public safety. The applicant shall provide assurances that all the use categories will be constructed and that the project will, in fact, result in a mixed use development satisfying\nthe purpose section of this district. The applicant shall include all of the required use categories (residential, commercial, and office uses) in the first phase of the project.\n(3) Outparcels are hereby defined as development or parcels of land generally located at the perimeter boundary of a mixed use development. All plans for outparcels within a mixed use\ndevelopment proposal shall include a set of design criteria for the outparcel(s). These design criteria shall be prepared to maintain visual compatibility and overall design compatibility with the\nentire development. The criteria shall address the location, form, scale, materials and colors of structures as they relate to the design concept of the entire development, and shall be\nconsistent with the design guidelines.\n(4) Off-street parking requirements shall be fifty (50) percent of the minimum parking requirements listed in the parking and loading standards (section 5.9 of this appendix).

Dimensional standards for parking and loading\nmay be varied by the town manager.\n(5) The applicant shall provide a bus stop consistent with the design criteria of sections 21-7 and 21-28.1 of the town Code of Ordinances. Such stops shall be located within one-half (1/2) of a mile\nof all dwelling units or office buildings. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 21-7 of the town Code of Ordinances, a resolution of the town council shall not be required prior to the\ndesignation of bus stops. Instead, this section only requires that bus stops be indicated on the subdivision plat or site plan. Different locations may be designated by resolution(s) of the town\ncouncil following approval of the mixed use development.\n(6) Buffers are not required between different uses or use categories within the MU-V District.\n(e) Permitted Uses and Development Intensities-Mixed Use-OI-1.\n(1) The uses permitted in the mixed use OI-1 zone, except in situations described in subsection (2) below, are single and two-family dwellings, and those other non-residential uses listed in\nsection 3.7 as permitted in the OI-1 zone, except that \"Medical Aircraft Hangar\" is not permitted. The land use intensity ratios, setbacks, and height limitations that apply in the mixed use zone,\nexcept in situations described in subsection (2) below, are those that apply to the OI-1 zone, as set forth in section 3.8.\n(2) If development of property in a mixed use-OI-1 zone is proposed, and the proposal meets all of the following thresholds, then the set of permitted use and intensity regulations described in\nsubsection (3) shall apply.

The town encourages cluster developments as defined in Appendix A [Definitions]. Cluster developments, as defined in Appendix A [Definitions], require modification of lot size\nstandards; individual lots may be somewhat smaller but the sum of reductions in lot area becomes common recreation area for the benefit of all residents of the cluster development. The\nrecreation area is increased and the intensity of development is controlled. Cluster developments also allow the developer greater design flexibility and will permit reasonable use of land with\ndifficult topography.\n(b) Approval requirements. The town council may approve a cluster development in any residential district, or the HR-L or HR-M Special Districts, if it finds that:\n(1) The tract proposed for cluster development is at least two (2) acres in size.\n(2) Public, separate, water supply and sewerage connections are available for every subdivided lot.\n(3)\nThe total number of lots proposed for the tract, excluding parcels of reserved recreation area, is not greater than the number determined by multiplying the total gross land area by the\nmaximum density established in section 3.8 for that zoning district.\n(4) The recreation area reserved within the tract shall conform to the recreation area standards of section 5.5.\n(5) The minimum amount of land reserved as recreation area shall be the sum of all reductions in minimum gross land area as a result of the cluster form of development, combined with the\nminimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5. Only the minimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5 may be dedicated outside the boundaries of the land being\nsubdivided as specified in section 5.5.2.\n(c)\nReductions in lot and setback requirements. For lots created as part of a cluster development, minimum gross land area, minimum lot width, and minimum setback requirements may be reduced\nas follows:\n(1) Minimum lot size requirements specified in section 3.8 may be reduced to five thousand, five hundred (5,500) square feet gross land area.\n(2) Minimum lot width requirements specified in section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to fifty (50) feet.\n(3) Minimum street setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the street lot line forms an exterior boundary of the cluster development.\n(4)\nMinimum interior setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to eight (8) feet except where the interior lot line\nforms a boundary of the cluster development.\n(5) Minimum solar setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the north lot line forms\na\nboundary of the cluster development.\n(d) Floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations. For lots created as part of a cluster development, floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations, as shown in Table 3.8-1, shall be\ncalculated using the gross land area of the lot or the minimum lot size for the zoning district, whichever is greater.\n(Ord.

This section promotes the public health, safety and welfare of the town by promoting housing of high quality located in neighborhoods throughout the community for households of\na\nvariety of income levels, ages and sizes in order to meet the town's goal of preserving and promoting a culturally and economically diverse population in our community.\nBased upon the review and consideration of reports and analyses of the housing supply in the town, the town finds and determines that the diversity of its housing stock has declined for many reasons\nincluding increasing property values and construction costs. The town recognizes the need to provide affordable housing to households of a broad range of income levels in order to maintain a diverse\npopulation and to provide housing for those who live or work in the town. Without intervention, the trend toward rising housing prices will result in an increasingly inadequate supply of affordable housing\nfor town residents and local employees, which will have a negative impact upon the ability of local employers to maintain an adequate local work force and will otherwise be detrimental to the public health,\nsafety and welfare of the town and its residents. Since the remaining land appropriate for new residential development within the town is limited, it is essential that a reasonable proportion of such land be\ndeveloped into housing units affordable to low- and moderate-income households and working families. The town finds and determines that additional market rate development would displace and\neliminate opportunities for additional affordable housing in the town unless the restrictions on use established by this section are included. This displacement would create the following threats to the\nhealth, safety, or the general welfare of the community:\nIncreases in travel time and distances for persons who provide services or are employed in the town, but who cannot find decent, affordable shelter, which in turn increases traffic congestion,\nreduces air and water quality, and has an adverse impact on public health resulting from excessive commuting; and\nAn imbalance in population diversity; and\nInconsistency with the vision for future development and the specific policies of the town's comprehensive plan.\nThe regulations set forth in this section further a key goal of the town's comprehensive plan: to create and preserve affordable housing opportunities. The regulations also support other goals of the\ntown including the reduction of traffic congestion and associated air pollution; and the prevention of sprawl through the maintenance of the urban services boundary. Documentation exists demonstrating\nthat the construction of residential dwelling units in Chapel Hill generates need for affordable housing for workers and families. These regulations are intended to provide a structure for cooperative\nparticipation by the public and private sectors in the production of affordable housing.\n3.10.1 Applicability and Minimum Project Size.\n(a) Single-family and two-family units. This section applies to all development that includes:\n(1) At least five (5) single-family dwelling units or two-family dwelling units; or\n(2) At least five (5) single-family lots; or\n(3) Two-family lots in which six (6) or more residential units are allowed by the Chapel Hill Land Use Management Ordinance, either individually or as part of the same subdivision.\n(b) Multifamily units. This section applies to all development that includes:\n(1) New development that creates at least five (5) multifamily dwelling units; or\n(2) Any vertical mixed use building that creates at least five (5) multifamily dwelling units; or\n(3) Renovation or reconstruction of an existing building that contains multifamily dwelling units, and that increases the number of dwelling units from the number of dwelling units in the original\nstructure by at least five (5); or\n(4) Any change in use of all or part of an existing building from a nonresidential use to a residential use that has at least five (5) dwelling units.\n3.10.2 Affordable Dwelling Units or Lots Required.\n(a) General requirement.
