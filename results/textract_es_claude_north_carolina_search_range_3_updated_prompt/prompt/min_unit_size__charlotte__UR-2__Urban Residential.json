Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Urban Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"UR-2\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Urban Residential\n(UR-2) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Urban Residential (UR-2). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Urban Residential (UR-2)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Urban Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 74\nArticle 4 Zoning Districts\n4.5 Commercial Zoning Districts\n4.5.4.\nSpecial Standards in the UR-2 Zoning District\nD.\nOpen Space\nOpen space requirements for the residential portion of a multifamily or mixed commercial-residential\nproject shall be the same and conform to the requirements for multifamily developments in the MR-\n4-12\nCELL (1, 1):\nUse\nCELL (1, 2):\nDistrict\nCELL (1, 3):\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 4):\nMinimum\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 5):\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 6):\nMinimum\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 7):\nCELL (1, 8):\nYard\n(ft.)\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (2, 1):\nCELL (2, 2):\nCELL (2, 3):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 4):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 5):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 6):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 7):\nFront\nCELL (2, 8):\nRear\nCELL (2, 9):\nSide\nCELL (3, 1):\nAll residential, except\nCELL (3, 2):\nUR-2\nCELL (3, 3):\n60\nCELL (3, 4):\n60\nCELL (3, 5):\n6,000\nCELL (3, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (3, 7):\n25\u00b3\nCELL (3, 8):\n63\nCELL (3, 9):\n51,2\nCELL (4, 1):\nmultifamily\nCELL (4, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (4, 3):\n75\nCELL (4, 4):\n75\nCELL (4, 5):\n7,500\nCELL (4, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (4, 7):\n253\nCELL (4, 8):\n253\nCELL (4, 9):\n102\nCELL (5, 1):\nMultifamily/ Mixed\nCELL (5, 2):\nUR-2\nCELL (5, 3):\n100\nCELL (5, 4):\n150\nCELL (5, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (5, 6):\n15,000\nCELL (5, 7):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 8):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 9):\nCELL (6, 1):\ncommercial- residential\nCELL (6, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (6, 3):\n100\nCELL (6, 4):\n100\nCELL (6, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (6, 6):\n7,000\nCELL (6, 7):\nCELL (6, 8):\nCELL (6, 9):\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"CELL (2, 5):\\nWith\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 5):\\n6,000\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (2, 6):\\nWithout\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 6):\\n10,000\" 74]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"For district UR-2, the section provides the information for min_unit_size.

Urban Residential Districts: location: purposes.\n(1)\nUrban areas are recognized as unique areas with many assets and opportunities. In order\nto foster the urban characteristics of these areas, development here should promote an\nenvironment of diverse uses at higher than normal density which encourages pedestrian\nactivities, needs and movement, while at the same time recognizing the limited supply of\nurban land. As such this requires special zoning classifications in order to implement the\ngoals and objectives of these vital areas of the community. Further it is necessary and\ndesirable to promote the residential nature of these areas through zoning classifications,\nwhich are intended to realize the growing opportunities for new infill development and\nredevelopment. Such residential development, properly located and developed, can\nenhance and support the overall mix of uses characteristic of urban areas. Therefore, the\npurpose of this Section is to establish the urban residential districts.\n(2)\nUrban residential districts are intended for use in special areas of the community and thus\nmay be considered for limited application. Generally, special plans or policy guides will\nbe used to determine applicability. The official Zoning Map of the City of Charlotte will\ndesignate urban residential district boundaries.\n(3)\nThese districts are designed to provide standards and incentives, which will promote the\ndevelopment or redevelopment of urban areas that contain a mix of land uses with a\npredominantly residential character. Emphasis is given to provisions, which will provide\nopportunities for imaginative new urban development compatible with the development\nobjectives of these areas. Accordingly, the development objectives are:\n(a)\nTo maximize residential development potentials in urban areas;\n(b)\nTo establish a predominantly residential character with residential neighborhoods;\n(c)\nTo provide for sufficient local retail and office uses to support residential areas;\n(d)\nTo protect all residential areas from inappropriate and intrusive uses;\n(e)\nTo maximize open space and other amenities within residential areas;\n(f)\nTo protect and enhance existing single family residential areas from uses which by\ntheir scale and characteristics may be inappropriate;\n(g)\nTo provide for the efficient utilization of scarce urban land; and\n(h)\nTo reward development projects through a density bonus system for including\nspecific development features which significantly further the overall goals for\nthese areas and which enhance the urban residential environment.\n9-45\n\n\nNEW PAGE 196\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 4 : URBAN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS\nSection 9.402. Urban Residential Districts: established.\nIn order to provide densities and other development standards which are compatible with urban\ncharacteristics, the following zoning classifications are established:\nSection 9.403. Urban Residential Districts: uses permitted by right.\n(1)\nUR-1: Uses permitted by right within the UR-1 district are detached, duplex, attached\ndwellings and group homes for up to 6 residents.\n(2)\nUR-2: Uses permitted by right within the UR-2 district are detached, duplex, triplex,\nquadraplex, attached, multi-family dwellings and group homes for up to 10 residents.\nBusiness or office uses are allowed but limited to those permitted in the B-1\nNeighborhood Business District, except that no drive-in windows or automotive sales,\nservice or repair are permitted. The maximum gross floor area of these business uses is 50\npercent of the ground floor area of the building in which they are located and any single\ntenant or use shall be limited to a maximum of 3,000 square feet. There is no restriction\nas to where within the structures these uses may be located.\n(Petition No. 2002-34, \u00a7 9.403(2), 4-15-02)\n(3)\nUR-3: Uses permitted by right within the UR-3 district are detached, duplex, triplex,\nquadraplex, attached, multi-family dwellings and group homes for up to 10 residents.\nBusiness or office uses limited to those permitted in B-1 neighborhood business districts\n9-46\nCELL (1, 1): \n(1)\nCELL (1, 2): \nUrban Residential-1 district (UR-1): The intent of this district is to protect and enhance\ndesignated single family areas and to encourage appropriate infill development within\nthese areas.\nCELL (2, 1): \n(2)\nCELL (2, 2): \nUrban Residential-2 district (UR-2): The intent of this district is to promote maximum\nopportunities for moderate density residential development.

Any such commercial uses will be limited in floor area to two times the size of\nthe building footprint, but there are no requirements as to where within the structure the\nuses may be located. Business or office uses are not permitted as free-standing uses but\nmay be combined with residential uses in the same structure.\n(4)\nUR-C: Uses permitted by right within the UR-C district are detached, duplex, triplex,\nquadraplex, attached, multi-family dwellings and free-standing nonresidential structures\nand group homes for up to 10 residents.
