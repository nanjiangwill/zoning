Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Planned Development\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"PD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Planned Development\n(PD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Planned Development (PD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Planned Development (PD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Planned Development\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

Planned Development\nA. Intent\nThe Planned Development (PD) option is intended to encourage the development of desirable and exceptional projects for both residential and\nnonresidential uses. This may include a mixture of uses not ordinarily permitted in a traditional development. Certain development privileges,\nthrough diversified land development standards in exchange for preplanning and exceptional design considerations, provide flexibility in\nutilizing new development concepts that are intended to:\ni. Encourage creative development that preserves natural and scenic features.\nii. Promote the efficient use of land resulting in infrastructure networks that maximize the allocation of fiscal and natural resources.\niii. To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes,\nwoodlands and wildlife habitat.\niv. To protect prime agricultural land and preserve farming as an economic activity.\nV. To permit clustering of houses and structures in a manner that will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility\neasements, necessary for development.\nvi. To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in development.\n20 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\n\nNEW PAGE 21\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nvii.

Any use not specifically listed in this chapter is expressly prohibited, unless the Planning Director determines in accordance with Section 9.7,\nWritten Interpretation, that the use is similar to a permitted individual use or permitted group of uses as listed in this Article. Where such similar\npermitted individual use or permitted group of uses is subject to a limited use standard contained in this Article or special use permit review, the\nproposed use shall also be subject to such standard or approval. The Planning Director shall not amend this chapter by adding to or eliminating\nany use standard for the proposed use.\nB. Where a use not listed is found by the Planning Director not to be similar to any other permitted individual use or permitted group of uses, the\nuse shall be permitted only following a text amendment in accordance with Section 3.7, Ordinance Text Amendment. The decision of the\nPlanning Director may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment.\nC. When considering the appropriate districts for a use not listed in the Permitted Use Table, the district intent statements (see Article 4, Zoning\nDistricts) shall be taken into consideration.\nD. Determination of an appropriate group of uses for a proposed use not currently listed shall be made by applying the following criteria.\n1. The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each use category.\n2. The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity.\n3. Relative amounts of sales from each activity.\n4. The customer type for each activity.\n5. The relative number of employees in each activity.\n6. Hours of operation.\n7. Building and site arrangement.\n8. Types of vehicles used and their parking requirements.\n9. The relative number of vehicle trips generated.\n10. Signs.\n11. How the use is advertised.\n12. The likely impact on surrounding properties.\n13. Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other activities on the site.\n( Ord. No. UDO-21-01, \u00a7 23, 5-17-21)\n5.2.2. Developments with Multiple Principal Uses\nA. When all principal uses of a development fall within one use category (see Section 5.1, Use Interpretation) the entire development shall be\nassigned to that use category.\nB. When the principal uses of a development fall within different group of uses or no group of uses, each principal use shall be classified in the\napplicable group of uses or treated as an individual use and each use shall be subject to all applicable regulations for that group of uses or\nindividual use.\nC. A development comprised of uses regulated by separate rows on the Permitted Use Table shall be reviewed using the most restrictive process\nfrom among the proposed uses.\nCommentary: If a proposed development includes a gas station, library and a restaurant, including outparcels, and one of those uses is only\npermitted with a special use permit in the district, then the entire development requires special use permit review.\nD. Where a use requiring approval as a limited use or a special use lies on a separate legal parcel, only the building containing the use and its\nseparate parcel shall be subject to review, not the entire project. However, where the separate legal parcel is an outparcel, the application shall\ndescribe the relationship of the outparcel to the remaining site.\nCommentary: For example, where a vehicle repair shop in a C-LD District (subject to special use review) is an outparcel within a larger retail\ndevelopment, the special use shall review the outparcel only - not the entire development. However, where a special use is proposed in a\nbuilding that contains a variety of other uses, the entire building and its associated parcel(s) of land shall require special use review.\nE. Multiple dwellings as principal uses on a single parcel shall be subject to Section 5.4.3.\n101 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\n\nNEW PAGE 102\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nOrd.
