Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Office and Institutional\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"O&I\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Office and Institutional\n(O&I) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Office and Institutional (O&I). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Office and Institutional (O&I)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Office and Institutional\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

This ordinance has been enacted pursuant to the Town's\npolice powers to regulate the public health, safety and general welfare of persons and property as authorized\nby Article 8 of Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes and N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 160A-381\net\nseq.\nPart 2 - Definitions\nGlare: The sensation produced by luminance within the visual field that is sufficiently greater than the\nluminance to which the eyes are adapted to cause annoyance, discomfort or loss in visual performance and\nvisibility. In addition, glare is also light emitting from a luminaire with an intensity great enough to reduce\na viewer's ability to see, and in extreme cases causing momentary blindness.\nLight Trespass: Any form of artificial illuminance emanating from a light fixture or illuminated sign that\npenetrates other property and creates a nuisance, as specified in Part 3. Light Trespass is also the shining\nof light produced by a luminaire beyond the boundaries of the property on which it is located.\nObjectionable Direct Glare Source: Glare resulting from excessive levels of illumination or insufficiently\nshielded light sources emanating from light fixtures in the field of view where the lens, lamp or reflector is\noffensively visible above a height of five (5) feet at a property line or a public roadway.\nOutdoor Light Fixture: An luminaire or electrically powered illuminating device containing a total light\nsource of more than 2000 initial lumens per fixture or any spot or flood luminaire with a reflector contained\nin the lamp component such as a parabolic aluminized reflector (PAR) lamp, of more than 1000 initial\nlumens, which is permanently installed outdoors, including but not limited to, devices used to illuminate\nany site, architectural structure, or sign. It is often an assembly that houses the light, lamp or lamps and\ncan include all or some of the following parts: a housing, a mounting bracket or pole socket, a lamp holder,\na ballast, a reflector or mirror, and/or a refractor or lens.\nShielded Light Fixture: A light fixture with cutoff optics that allows no direct light emissions above a\nvertical cutoff angle of 90 degrees above nadir (straight down at perfect vertical), through the light fixture's\nlowest light emitting part. Any structural part of the light fixture providing this cutoff angle must be\npermanently affixed.\nDirect Light or Glare: Light or Glare emitted directly from the lamp, off of the reflector or reflector diffuser,\nor through the refractor or diffuser lens, of a luminaire.\n44\n\nNEW PAGE 48\nFlood or Spotlight: Any light fixture or lamp that incorporates a reflector or a refractor to concentrate the\nlight output into a directed beam in a particular direction.\nFully shielded lights: outdoor light fixtures shielded or constructed SO that no light rays are emitted by the\ninstalled fixture at angles above the horizontal plane as certified by a photometric test report.\nHeight of Outdoor Light Fixture or Luminaire: The height of an outdoor light fixture or luminaire shall be\nthe vertical distance from the ground directly below the centerline of the luminaire to the lowest direct-\nlight-emitting part of the luminaire.\nIndirect Light: Direct light that has been reflected or has scattered off of other surfaces.\nLamp: The component of a luminaire that produces the actual light.\nLumen: A unit of luminous flux. One foot-candle is one lumen per square foot. For the purposes of this\nOrdinance, the lumen-output values shall be the INITIAL lumen output ratings of a lamp.\nLuminaire: This is a complete lighting system, and includes a lamp or lamps and a fixture. Luminaires\nnot conforming to this code that were in place at the time this code was voted into effect must be removed\nor changed within thirty (30) days of the date of execution of this Ordinance.\nOutdoor Lighting: The evening and/or night-time illumination of an outside area or object by any man-\nmade device located outdoors that produces light by any means.\nPart 3 - Regulations\nA. All Outdoor Lighting or Luminaires, whether for illuminating sites, landscaping, trees, walkways,\nparking areas, buildings, signs, and/or other structures, shall be fully shielded, shaded, directed downward,\ndesigned and directed away from the sky, as well as all adjacent property and uses; and further shall not\nshine upon the right of way of any public road or shine upon any body of water. Any Luminaire with a\nlamp or lamps rated at a total of MORE than 2000 lumens, and all Flood or Spot Light or Luminaires with\na lamp or lamps rated at a total of MORE than 1000 Lumens, shall not emit any direct light above a\nhorizontal plane through the lowest direct-light-emitting part of the Luminaire.\nB. Mounting Heights - The maximum height for Outdoor Light Fixtures shall be twenty-five (25) feet\nmeasured from final grade to the top of the Outdoor Light Fixture. For Outdoor Light Fixtures in the interior\nof development projects, the Planning Board for the Town of Bath may, subject to a public hearing and\nnotification of all property owners of record within 300 feet of the subject parcel, approve greater mounting\nheights when all of the following conditions are met:\na. Fewer luminaries will be required for the site; and\nb. The greater mounting height will not cause light trespass and/or glare beyond the property line for reasons\nof topography, screening, or similar circumstances; and\nC. The greater mounting height will contribute less artificial sky glow by reducing the intensity of the\nlighting beneath the light fixture.\nC. Modifications\nSubject to a public hearing and notification of all property owners of record within 300 feet of the subject\nparcel, the Board of Adjustment may grant a modification of the requirements of this Ordinance, except for\n45\n\n\n Output:"}]}
