Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"I\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Industrial\n(I) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Industrial (I). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Industrial (I)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Industrial\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

It is hereby found that an obstruction has a potential for endangering the lives and\nproperty of users of Bladen County Airports, and property or occupants of land in its vicinity;\nthat an obstruction may affect existing or future instrument approaches of Bladen County\nAirports; and that an obstruction may reduce the size of areas available for landing, take-off\nand maneuvering of aircrafts, thus tending to destroy or impair the unity of Bladen County\nAirports and the public investment therein.\nFurther, it is the intent and purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety, and general\nwelfare by regulating and restricting the development of structures for human occupancy within an area\nsurrounding airports within Bladen County to protect residents from harmful noise. Therefore, the\nAirport Overlay District is established, which includes Height restriction and Noise restriction zones\nwithin the overlay (see section 11 for definition of Overlay District).\n175 of 446\n3/9/24, 13:42\nCELL (1, 1): \nSide abutting a lot zone RA or R\nCELL (1, 2): \n250 ft.\nCELL (1, 3): \n250 ft.\nCELL (1, 4): \n250 ft.\nCELL (2, 1): \nSide abutting Street\nCELL (2, 2): \n75 ft.\nCELL (2, 3): \n75 ft.\nCELL (2, 4): \n75 ft.\nCELL (3, 1): \nRear\nCELL (3, 2): \n100 ft.\nCELL (3, 3): \n100 ft.\nCELL (3, 4): \n100 ft.\nCELL (4, 1): \nRear abutting a lot zones RA or R\nCELL (4, 2): \n150 ft.\nCELL (4, 3): \n150 ft.\nCELL (4, 4): \n150 ft.\nCELL (5, 1): \nMaximum Building Height\nCELL (5, 2): \n40 ft.\nCELL (5, 3): \n40 ft.\nCELL (5, 4): \n40 ft.\n\n\nNEW PAGE 176\nBladen County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(b) Permitted Principal Uses and Structures.\n(1) Shall be the same as those in the underlying zoning districts with the exception of the\nprovisions in Section 8.6(g). Noise Restrictions and the following:\nNo use may be made to land or water within any zone established by this section in such a\nmanner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication\nbetween the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights\nand others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of\nthe airport or otherwise in any way create a hazard or endanger the landing, takeoff, or\nmaneuvering of aircraft to use the airport.\n(c) Permitted Accessory Uses and Structures.
