Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-10\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential\n(R-10) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Residential (R-10). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential (R-10)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

For\nuses that exceed 10,000 square feet, a standard loading dock shall be provided.\nF. PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING REQUIREMENTS\nSubject to other standards outlined within this Ordinance, including Section 7.3\nBUFFERS, all required parking areas shall be required to adhere to the following\nadditional interior buffering requirements:\n1. For every ten (10) required parking spaces, there shall be an area within the\nparking lot four hundred (400) square feet in area either left in a natural vegetative\nstate or planted with trees and shrubs. Exception: medical facility parking lots\nmay be as obstruction free and conducive to water, ice and debris minimization\nand removal as practicable. Landscaping within parking areas, particularly, but\nnot limited to, independent internal vegetated islands that may interfere with\naccess is therefore not required.\n2. For commercial/industrial land uses that, due to their overall size, are required to\nprovide more than fifty (50) parking spaces to support the proposed land use, the\nTown of Cedar Point shall allow for a reduction in the number of required parking\nspaces based on the following incentive plan:\n(a)\nRequired Parking spaces may be reduced by ten (10) percent if there is an\nadditional one thousand (1,000) square feet of land area within the required\nparking lot dedicated as interior buffer space;\n(b)\nRequired parking spaces may be reduced by twenty (20) percent if there is\nan additional three thousand (3,000) square feet of land area within the\nrequired parking lot dedicated as interior buffering space;\n(c) Required parking spaces may be reduced by thirty (30) percent if there is an\nadditional five thousand (5,000) square feet of land area within the required\nparking lot dedicated as interior buffering space;\n(d)\nThese allowances shall be in addition to the mandatory buffering\nrequirements outlined within this section\n3. The maintenance and upkeep of all interior buffer areas shall be the responsibility\nof the property owner.\n4. Unless deemed improbable by the Cedar Point Planning Board, all interior buffer\nareas shall be used as bio-retention storm water devices not to be included as part\nof the overall storm water retention for the project.\n5.\nAt least fifty (50) percent of the trees planted shall be of a shade/canopy species\nas referenced in Appendix B and other vegetation that may be suitable for the area\nper Cedar Point Planning Board and other technical assistance personnel as\ndeemed necessary.\n6. In support of the above, the following standards shall apply to interior plantings:\n(a) All plantings shall be evenly distributed throughout the parking facility.\n(b) All interior plantings shall be curbed or otherwise physically protected.\nWhen practical, interior planting areas should be used as storm water\ndevices. This can be accomplished with inverted curb sections, grates,\npipes, etc.\n(c) Consecutive parking spaces shall incorporate landscape peninsulas no more\nPage\n185\n\n\nNEW PAGE 186\nthan fifteen (15) spaces apart and at least the ends of all parking rows.\nPeninsulas shall contain at least one hundred (100) square feet in area and\nat least eight (8) feet in width, measured from back of curb/barrier to back\nof curb/barrier.\n7. For every protected tree, as defined in Section 7.4, which is retained in a parking\nfacility and/or street yard in addition to the requirements of Sections 7.4.E and\n7.5.I., a reduction to the interior planting requirement fifteen percent (15%) may\nbe allowed. The reduction shall be limited to a maximum credit of four (4)\nprotected trees retained.\n8. When a parking facility is within fifty (50) feet of the public right-of-way a\nperimeter planted strip shall be installed, consisting of a buffer (three feet or less\nin height) incorporated into the street-yard.\n9. The Board of Commissioners may waive all or part of the requirements of this\nsection for any facility, which is limited to periodic or intermittent use for\nvehicular parking, such as parking lots for churches or recreational facilities,\nprovided the facility is completely covered by grass or otherwise presents a\nlandscaped effect.\n10. The Board of Commissioners may waive the requirements of this section for\ntemporary parking lots when determined that a waiver is necessary to relieve\nhardship and will not violate the purposes of this section. Any such waiver shall\nnot exceed one year.\n7.14\nPOSTING REQUIREMENTS FOR STRUCTURES\nA. PURPOSE AND INTENT\nIt is the general purpose and intent of this section to protect and promote the public\nhealth, safety, and general welfare by requiring the posting of the correct and current\n911-address on each structure or residence.\nB. APPLICABILITY\nAll new and existing residential and non-residential structures must meet the\nrequirements of this section.\nC.
