Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"R-1 Low Density Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If R-1 Low Density Residential\n(R-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor R-1 Low Density Residential (R-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"R-1 Low Density Residential (R-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"R-1 Low Density Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\"). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 165\n165/167\nCELL (1, 1):\nRestaurants (with drive through service)\nCELL (1, 2):\nOne (1) space for each four (4) seating\naccommodations, plus one (1) space for each\ntwo (2) employees on the shift of largest\nemployment; and Three (3) stacking spaces\nfor each drive through window.\nCELL (2, 1):\nSchool, Elementary and Middle (both public\nand private):\nCELL (2, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each classroom and\nadministrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee and one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (3, 1):\nSchool, High School (both public and private)\nCELL (3, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each fifteen (15)\nstudents for which the building was designed,\nplus one (1) parking space for each classroom\nand administrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee, plus one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (4, 1):\nShopping Centers, large and small\nCELL (4, 2):\nOne (1) space for each three hundred (300)\nsquare feet of gross floor area.\nCELL (5, 1):\nSingle Family, Duplex, Condominiums,\nManufactured Homes, and similar residential\nCELL (5, 2):\nTwo (2) spaces per dwelling unit\nCELL (6, 1):\nTerminals, Bus\nCELL (6, 2):\nOne (1) space for each employee and one (1)\nspace for each bus loading ramp and track.\nCELL (7, 1):\nStadiums, Theaters, and similar uses\ninvolving the assembling of persons:\nCELL (7, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each four (4) seats\nin the largest assembly room.

Specific provision are made for conditional uses\nwhich may be permitted in certain zones and the procedures for application are set out in Article\nIX, Section 9.05 of this ordinance.\nVariance: A variance is a relaxation of the terms of the zoning ordinance where such variance\nwill not be contrary to the public interest and where, owing to conditions peculiar to the property\nand not the result of the actions of the applicant, a literal enforcement of the ordinance would\nresult in unnecessary and undue hardship. In this ordinance a variance is authorized only for\nheight, area, and size of structure or size of yards and open spaces.

Yards or lots created after the effective\ndate of this ordinance shall meet at least the minimum requirements established by this ordinance.\nSECTION 4.06 - CLASSIFICATION OF ADDED TERRITORY\nAll territory not included under the provisions of this ordinance which are later added to the\nzoning jurisdiction of the town shall be considered to be in the R-1 Low Density Residential classification\nuntil otherwise notified.\nSECTION 4.07 - ONE PRINCIPAL BUILDING ON ANY LOT\nOnly one (1) principal building and its customary accessory buildings may be erected on any lot.\n12\n\n\nNEW PAGE 17\nSECTION 4.08 - LOT ACCESS REQUIREMENTS\nAll lots created after the passage of this ordinance must front on a publicly dedicated right-of-\nway. No structure requiring a building permit shall be erected on any lot which does not abut either a\npublic right-of-way or a private street or easement at least 20 feet in width which was recorded by the\nCounty Register of Deeds prior to the effective date of this ordinance.\nSECTION 4.09 - VISION CLEARANCE AT INTERSECTIONS\nOn a corner lot which abuts a state or town maintained right-of-way in any district no planting,\nstructure, fence, wall or other obstruction to vision more than three (3) feet in height shall be placed or\nmaintained within the triangular area formed by the intersection street right-of-way lines and a straight\nline connecting points on those street lines each of which twenty-five (25) feet distance from the point of\nintersection.\nSECTION 4.10 - WALLS AND FENCES\nThe setback requirements of these regulations shall not prohibit any necessary retaining wall or\nprohibit any wall or fence. However, within or abutting any residential district, no wall or fence shall\nexceed six (6) feet in height within a front or side yard and in any business or industrial district no fence\nshall exceed eight (8) feet in height.\nSECTION 4.11 - STRUCTURES EXCLUDED FROM HIGHT LIMITATIONS\nThe height limits of these regulations shall not apply to a church spire, belfry, cupola and dome or\nornamental tower not intended for human occupancy, monument, water tower, observation tower,\ntransmission tower, chimney, smoke stack, conveyor, flat pole, radio or television tower, mast or aerial,\nparapet wall not extended more than four (4) feet above the roof line of the building, and necessary\nmechanical appurtenances.\nSECTION 4.12 - REDUCTION OF FRONT YARD SETBACK REQUIREMENTS\nIn any residential district, where the average setback distance for existing buildings on all lots\nlocated wholly or partly within two hundred (200) feet of any lot, and within the same zoning district and\nfront on the same side of the same street as the lot, is less than the minimum setback required in the\nzoning district, the setback on that lot may be less than the required setback, but not less than the existing\naverage setback distance for all lots within the two hundred (200) feed in no case shall the setback be less\nthan fifteen (15) feet. When lots within two hundred (200) feet are vacant, those vacant lots shall be\nconsidered as having the minimum required setback for the purpose of computing an average setback\ndistance.\nSECTION 4.13 - PROPERTY LINES PROJECTED\nIn any district abutting Back Creek or Bath Creek, the property line or lot line shall be considered\nthe recorded line on the plat plus the imaginary extension of that property line from the point at which the\nproperty line touches the creek's high water mark, to the middle of the main channel.
