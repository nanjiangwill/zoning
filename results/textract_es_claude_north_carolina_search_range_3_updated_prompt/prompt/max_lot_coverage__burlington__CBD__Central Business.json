Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Central Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CBD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Central Business\n(CBD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Central Business (CBD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Central Business (CBD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Central Business\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text.

Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

CONVENTIONAL ZONING DISTRICT INTENT STATEMENTS\nA. RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS\nThe residential zoning districts are proposed to provide a comfortable, healthy, safe, and pleasant\nenvironment in which to live and recreate. More specifically, they are intended to:\n1. Provide appropriately located lands for residential development that are consistent with the goals,\nobjectives, and policies of the City's adopted policy guidance;\n2. Ensure adequate light, air, privacy, and open space areas for each dwelling, and protect residents\nfrom the negative effects of noise, excessive population density, traffic congestion, flooding, and other\nsignificant adverse environmental impacts;\n3. Protect residential areas from fires, explosions, toxic fumes and substances, and other public safety\nhazards;\n4. Provide for residential housing choice, affordability, and diversity with varying housing densities, types,\nand designs, including accessory dwelling units;\n5.\nProvide for safe and efficient vehicular access and circulation and promote bicycle-, and pedestrian-\nfriendly neighborhoods;\n6. Provide safe and efficient access to public transit facilities and alternative forms of transportation, like\ngreenways;\n7. Provide for public services and facilities needed to serve residential areas and accommodate public\nand very low intensity neighborhood-serving non-residential uses in the higher density residential\ndistricts while protecting residential areas from incompatible non-residential development;\n8. Create neighborhoods and preserve existing community character while accommodating new\ndevelopment and redevelopment consistent with the City's goals and objectives; and\n9.\nPreserve the unique character and historic resources of the traditional neighborhoods and the\ncommunity.\nB. BUSINESS ZONING DISTRICTS\nThe business zoning districts are intended to ensure a wide range of office, retail, service, industrial, and\nrelated uses necessary to meet resident and visitor needs, and more specifically to:\n1. Provide appropriately located lands for the full range of business uses needed by the City's residents,\nbusinesses, and workers, consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies in the City's adopted policy\nguidance;\n2. Strengthen the City's economic base, and provide employment opportunities close to home for\nresidents of the City and surrounding areas;\n3.\nCreate suitable environments for various types of business uses, and protect them from the adverse\neffects of incompatible uses;\n4.\nProvide safe and efficient access to alternative forms of transportation like public transit facilities,\nsidewalks, trails, and greenways;\n5. Preserve the unique character and historic resources of the downtown area while increasing\nopportunities for urban development in areas already well-served by infrastructure; and\n6. Minimize the impact of business development on residential districts and sensitive natural\nenvironments.\nC. SPECIAL ZONING DISTRICTS\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\nThe special zoning districts are intended to recognize those portions of the City's jurisdiction that are\nunique or that require special consideration in order to:\n1. Protect and preserve environmentally-sensitive lands;\n2. Accommodate various types of mixed-use development in ways that establish functioning\nneighborhoods where people can live, work, shop, and recreate without travelling extensive distances;\n3. Provide safe and efficient access to alternative forms of transportation like public transit facilities,\nsidewalks, trails, and greenways; and\n4.\nCreate appropriate amounts of flexibility to foster redevelopment, infill, downtown revitalization, and\neconomic opportunities for City residents.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \n3-9\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\n\nNEW PAGE 132\nCHAPTER 3 ZONING DISTRICTS\nSection 3.4 Central Business (CBD) District\n3.4. CENTRAL BUSINESS (CBD) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Central Business (CBD) District is established and intended to\nserve as the commercial and cultural heart of the City's jurisdiction.\nDevelopment in the CBD includes the highest average densities and\nbuilding heights in the City. Development is configured for an urban\ncontext, with buildings built to the street, ground floor uses that\nsupport pedestrian travel, and numerous civic gathering spaces and\ncultural attractions. The district is intended to accommodate a well-\nbalanced mix of uses (e.g., office, retail, service, high-density\nresidential, and entertainment), promote a strong pedestrian-\noriented environment (with a reduced need for off-street parking),\nand preserve and protect the downtown's historical and architectural\nscale and character. The district requires urban-style open space\n(greens, seating areas, plazas, pocket parks, roof gardens, etc.) to\nbe included as a part of new development. Low density residential\nlike single-family detached homes and most forms of industrial\ndevelopment are prohibited in the CBD district. New commercial,\nmixed-use, and multi-family developments in the district are subject\nto the design standards in CHAPTER 5. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.\nB.

GENERAL BUSINESS (GB) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe General Business (GB) district is the primary district intended to serve\nretail, business, and service uses in the City and is found along major\narterial streets, interstate interchanges, and on blocks surrounding the\ncentral business district. Development in the GB district tends to be\nautomobile oriented and comprised of a mix of individual buildings on\nindividual sites and multi-tenant or multi-building developments located\nnear major roadway intersections. In addition to commercial uses, the\ndistrict also accommodates wholesale sales, warehousing uses, and a very\nwide range of institutional uses. Limited forms of residential use are\nallowed, such as upper-story residential and multi-family development.\nUses in the district are subject to standards intended to ensure development\nis compatible with adjacent residential neighborhoods, ensure that the\ntraffic carrying capacity along the City's major roadways is not impaired due\nto unsafe turning movements, and that development is well landscaped and\naesthetically pleasing. In order to maintain compatibility with surrounding\nuses and ensure a high quality of development, all activities, including\nstorage shall be indoors or be fully screened from view from the street or\nfrom lands in lower-intensity zoning districts.\nB.
