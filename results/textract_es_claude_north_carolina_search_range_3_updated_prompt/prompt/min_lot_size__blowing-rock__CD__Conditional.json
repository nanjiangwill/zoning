Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Conditional\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Conditional\n(CD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Conditional (CD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Conditional (CD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Conditional\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Conditional zoning is intended to link map\namendments with a specific development plan and uses; therefore, the limitations\ncontained in Section 16-10.5 concerning the range of uses proposed shall not apply.\n16-9.6.2.3. Fair and Reasonable Conditions. The provisions of the Master plan shall\nreplace all conflicting development regulations set forth in this Chapter which would\notherwise apply to the development site. The Board of Commissioners may attach,\nreasonable and appropriate conditions including, but not limited to, the location, nature,\nhours of operation, and extent of the proposed use(s); provided, however, only those\nconditions mutually approved in writing by the Town and the applicant may be\nincorporated into the permit requirements for the conditional district. Conditions and\nsite-specific standards shall be limited to those that address conformance of the\ndevelopment and use of the site to the Land Use Code and officially adopted plans and\nthose standards and conditions that address the impacts reasonably expected to be\ngenerated by the development and use of the site.

Effect of Approval/Changes. The applicant may proceed with development only\nafter approval of the conditional district master plan by the Board of Commissioners, followed\nby approval of any necessary Site plans or subdivision plat, except that all subsequent\napprovals shall be completed by the Administrator. The development and use of all land\nwithin the conditional district shall be in keeping with the approved master plan and all\napplicable provisions therein.\n19-9.6.3.1. Final Approval by Stages. If so, reflected on the master plan, the Board of\nCommissioners may allow the staging of final development. Each phase of development\nshall adhere to all applicable provisions and standards of this section and the applicable\nCD master plan.\n16-9.6.3.2. Substantial Changes. Any substantial change to a master plan as noted below\nshall be reviewed by the Planning Board and approved or denied by the Board of\nCommissioners as an amended conditional district. The following changes to a CD master\nplan shall require approval by the Board of Commissioners:\na) Land area being added or removed from the conditional district.\nb) Modification of special performance criteria, design standards, or other requirements\nspecified by the enacting ordinance.\nc) A change in land use or development type beyond that permitted by the approved\nmaster plan.\nd) When there is introduction of a new vehicular access point to an existing street, road\nor thoroughfare not previously designated for access.\ne) When there is an increase in the total number of residential dwelling units originally\nauthorized by the approved master plan.\nf) When the total floor area of a commercial or industrial classification is increased more\nthan 10 percent beyond the total floor area last approved by Board of Commissioners.\n16-9.6.3.3. Additional Changes. All other changes to a CD Master plan shall receive\napproval by the Planning Board. However, if in the judgment of the Planning Board, the\nrequested changes alter the basic development concept of the CD, the Planning Board\nmay require concurrent approval by the Board of Commissioners.\n16-9.6.3.4. Rescission of Conditional Districts. The applicant shall secure a valid building\npermit or obtain approval of a site-specific development plan within a 12-month period\nfrom date of approval of the conditional district unless otherwise specified. If such project\nis not complete or a valid building permit or an approved site-specific development plan\nis not in place at the end of the 12-month period, the Administrator shall notify the\napplicant of such finding. Within sixty (60) calendar days of notification, the\nAdministrator shall make a recommendation concerning the rescission of the conditional\ndistrict to the Board of Commissioners. The Board of Commissioners may then rescind the\nconditional district or extend the life of the conditional district for a specified period of\ntime. The rescission of a conditional district shall follow the same procedure as used for\napproval.\n9-6\n\n\nNEW PAGE 95\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nArticle 10 - Permissible Uses\nSection 16-10.1. Table of Permissible Uses. The Table of Permissible Uses herein should be read\nin close conjunction with the definitions of terms set forth in Section 16-2 and the other\ninterpretative provisions set forth in this article.\nSection 16-10.2. Use of the Designations Z and S in Table of Permissible Uses.\n16-10.2.1. Subject to Section 16-10.3, when used in connection with a particular use in the\nTable of Permissible Uses herein, the letter \"Z\" means that the use is permissible in the\nindicated zone with a zoning permit issued by the administrator. The letter \"S\" means a\nspecial use permit must be obtained from the Board of Commissioners.\n16-10.2.3. Subject to Section 16-10.3, use of the designation \"ZS\" means that a zoning permit\nmust be obtained if the development is located on a lot of one acre or less while a special use\npermit, respectively, must be obtained for all developments on lots in excess of one acre.\n16-10.2.4. Use of the designation\" Z\" and \"S\" for combination uses is explained in Section 16-\n10.10.\nSection 16-10.3. Board of Commissioners Jurisdiction Over Uses Otherwise Permissible With a\nZoning Permit. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, whenever the Table of\nPermissible Uses (interpreted in the light of Section 16-10.2 and the other provisions of this\narticle) provides that a use in a non-residential zone is permissible with a zoning permit, a special\nuse permit shall be required if the administrator finds that the proposed use would have an\nextraordinary impact on neighboring properties or the general public. In making this\ndetermination, the administrator shall consider, among other factors, whether the use is\nproposed for an undeveloped or previously developed lot, whether the proposed use constitutes\na change from one principal use classification to another, whether the use is proposed for a site\nthat poses peculiar traffic or other hazards or difficulties, and whether the proposed use is\nsubstantially unique or is likely to have impacts that differ substantially from those presented by\nother uses that are permissible in the zoning district in question.\nSection 16-10.4. Zoning Administrator Jurisdiction Over Uses Otherwise Permissible with SUP.\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of this article, whenever the Table of Permissible Uses\n(interpreted in the light of Section 16-10.2 and other provisions of this article) provides that a use\nin the CB, GB, or OI zoning district is permissible with special use permit, only a zoning permit\nshall be required instead if the administrator determines that the new use involves no more than\na change from one business to another, that no new substantial construction is involved, and\nthat the change in use would have a negligible adverse impact on neighboring property and the\npublic health and safety.\nSection 16-10.5. Permissible Uses and Specific Exclusions. The presumption established by this\nchapter is that most legitimate uses of land are permissible within at least one zoning district in\nthe town's planning jurisdiction. Therefore, because the list of permissible uses set forth in\nherein, (Table of Permissible Uses) cannot be all-inclusive, those uses that are listed may be\ninterpreted to include other uses that have similar impacts to the listed uses.\n10-1\n\n\nNEW PAGE 96\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n16-10.5.1. Section 16-10.1 (Table of Permissible Uses) shall not be interpreted to allow a use\nin one zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to another specified\nuse that is permissible only in other zoning districts.\n16-10.5.2. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions, the following uses are\nspecifically prohibited in all districts:\na) Use of travel trailer as a residence.\nb) The use of any motor vehicle (as defined in Section 6-1 of the town Code), parked on a\nlot, as a structure in which, out of which or from which any goods are sold or stored, any\nservice is performed, or other business (as defined in Section 8-1 of the town Code) is\nconducted, except that retail sales of food products and goods manufactured, created or\nproduced by the seller shall not be prohibited by this subdivision. Notwithstanding any\nother provision of this chapter, situations that exist on the effective date of this chapter\nthat are in violation of this section shall not be regarded as lawful nonconforming\nsituations thirty days after the effective date of this chapter.\nc) The installation, erection, or use of a wind energy system, wind turbines, and/or\nassociated towers for wind energy conversion.\n16-10.5.3. Agricultural uses are exempt from zoning regulations in the town's ETJ as provided\nby NCGS 160D-903. Property used for bona fide farm purposes include the production and\nactivities relating or incidental to the production of crops, grains, fruits, vegetables,\nornamental and flowering plants, dairy, livestock, poultry, and all other forms of agriculture,\nas defined in NCGS 106-581.1.\nSection 16-10.6. Accessory Uses. The Table of Permissible Uses classifies different principal uses\naccording to their different impacts. Whenever an activity (which may or may not be separately\nlisted as a principal use in this table) is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and\nthe former use (i) constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that\ntakes place on a lot, or (ii) is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to\nit, then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on\nunderneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use. For example, a swimming\npool/tennis court complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a residential\nsubdivision or multifamily development and would be regarded as accessory to such principal\nuses.\n16-10.6.1. For purposes of interpreting section 16-10.4:\na) A use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial in\nand of itself or in relation to the principal use;\nb) To be \"commonly associated\" with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory use\nto be connected with such principal use more times than not, but only that the association\nof such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that\nthere is common acceptance of their relatedness.\n16-10.6.2. Without limiting the generality of section 16-10.6.1 the following activities are\nspecifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses so long as they satisfy the\ngeneral criteria set forth above:\n10-2\n\nNEW PAGE 114\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nZ = Zoning Permit required; S=Special Use Permit required;\nZ/S = Zoning permit if lot less than 1 acre, SUP if lot 1 acre and greater; Blank = Use not permitted.\n10-20\nCELL (1, 1): \nUses Description\nCELL (1, 2): \nR-A\nCELL (1, 3): \nR-15\nCELL (1, 4): \nR-10S\nCELL (1, 5): \nR-10D\nCELL (1, 6): \nR-10M\nCELL (1, 7): \nR-6S\nCELL (1, 8): \nR-6M\nCELL (1, 9): \nR-MH\nCELL (1, 10): \nCB\nCELL (1, 11): \nTC\nCELL (1, 12): \nGB\nCELL (1, 13): \nOI\nCELL (1, 14): \nHMC\nCELL (1, 15): \nHSG\nCELL (1, 16): \nPGS\nCELL (2, 1): \n14.120 Agricultural\noperations including\nlivestock, but excluding\ncommercial feed lots\nand commercial egg\nproduction.

Drainage, Erosion Control, Storm Water Management. To the extent\npracticable, all development shall conform to the natural contours of the land and natural and\npre-existing man-made drainage ways shall remain undisturbed.\nTo the extent practicable, lot boundaries shall be made to coincide with natural and pre-existing\nman-made drainage ways within subdivisions to avoid the creation of lots that can be built upon\nonly by altering such drainage ways.\n16-15\n\n\nNEW PAGE 165\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nSection 16-16.30. Development Must Drain Properly. All development shall be provided with a\ndrainage system that is adequate to prevent the undue retention of surface water on the\ndevelopment site. Surface water shall not be regarded as unduly retained if:\na) The retention results from a technique, practice or device deliberately installed as part of an\napproved sedimentation or storm water runoff control plan; or\nb) The retention is not substantially different in location or degree than that experienced by the\ndevelopment site in its pre-development stage, unless such retention presents a danger to\nhealth or safety.\n16-16.30.1. No surface water may be channeled or directed into a sanitary sewer.\n16-16.30.2. Whenever practicable, the drainage system of a development shall coordinate\nwith and connect to the drainage systems or drainage ways on surrounding properties or\nstreets.\n16-16.30.3. Use of drainage swales rather than curb and gutter and storm sewers in\nsubdivisions is provided for in Section 16-14.7. Private roads and access ways within\nunsubdivided developments shall utilize curb and gutter and storm drains to provide\nadequate drainage if the grade of such roads or access ways is too steep to provide drainage\nin another manner or if other sufficient reasons exist to require such construction.\n16-16.30.4. Construction specifications for drainage swales, curbs and gutters, and storm\ndrains are contained in Appendix C.\nSection 16-16.31. Storm Water Management. All developments shall be constructed\nand\nmaintained so that adjacent properties are not unreasonably burdened with surface waters as a\nresult of such developments. The requirements set forth herein are intended to assure\ncompliance with this standard.\n16-16.31.1. No development may be constructed or maintained so that such development\nunreasonably impedes the natural flow of water from higher adjacent properties across such\ndevelopment, thereby unreasonably causing substantial damage to such higher adjacent\nproperties; and\n16-16.31.2. No development may be constructed or maintained so that the surface waters\nfrom such development are unreasonably collected and channeled onto lower adjacent\nproperties at such locations or at such volumes as to cause substantial damage to such lower\nadjacent properties.\n16-16.31.3. The following requirements shall be complied with for all new construction or\ndevelopment in the Town. For the purposes of this subsection, a single-family residential\nsubdivision shall be considered a development and the requirements shall be applicable to\nsuch a development. The requirements, however, shall not apply to the construction of\nsingle-family houses on individual lots with less than 10,000 square feet of impervious\nsurface.\n16-16.31.3.1. Storm water on the property shall be controlled and released at a rate\nbetween 2.2 CFS (cubic feet per second) and 2.4 CFS per acre.\n16-16\n\n\nNEW PAGE 166\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n16-16.31.3.2. Construction or development sites shall contain a minimum storage area\nfor detention with controlled release of 9,100 cubic feet per acre of impervious surface\non the site plus 3,600 cubic feet per acre of area with vegetative cover. The entire site\nmust be considered when computing the required detention. For purposes of this\nsubsection, all buildings, drives, roads, and/or streets shall be considered impervious to a\ndistance three (3) feet beyond the ditch line on cuts and to the top of the slope on fill.\n16-16.31.3.3. All new culverts, including all culvert replacements, shall be sized for 6.8\ninches of rainfall per 24 hours and shall be based on run off resulting from maximum\ndensities permitted by zoning.\n16-16.31.3.4. All culverts, except those required for a controlled discharge, shall not be\nless than 18 inches in diameter when crossing streets, roadways and driveways.\n16-16.31.3.5.
