Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Conservation & Protection\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CP\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Conservation & Protection\n(CP) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Conservation & Protection (CP). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Conservation & Protection (CP)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Conservation & Protection\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

Failure to\nprovide or maintain off-street loading spaces when they are necessary to serve the development is a violation of this\nOrdinance.\nC.\nLocation\nThe placement of off-street loading facilities shall be in accordance with the applicable standards in Section 5.1.2,\nCommercial Design Standards, Section 5.1.3, Mixed-Use Design Standards, and Section 5.10, Screening.\nD.\nDimensional Standards for Loading Spaces\nWhen off-street loading spaces are provided, they shall comply with the following minimum requirements (see Figure\n5.6.9.D: Loading Space Configuration):\n1.\nExcept for loading spaces used by semi-tractor trailers, off-street loading spaces shall be at least 12 feet\nwide and at least 25 feet long.\n2.\nOff-street loading spaces used by semi-tractor trailers shall be at least 60 feet long.\n3.\nOverhead clearance for an off-street loading space shall be at least 14 feet.\nFIGURE 5.6.9.D: LOADING SPACE CONFIGURATION\nCELL (1, 1): \nLEGEND\nCELL (1, 2): \nC\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (2, 1): \nA\nLocation Option:\nRear Yard\nCELL (2, 2): \nA\nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (3, 1): \nB\nLocation Option:\nSide Yard\nCELL (3, 2): \nB\nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (3, 4): \nCELL (4, 1): \nC\nScreening Option:\nHedge\nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (4, 3): \nCELL (4, 4): \nG\nCELL (5, 1): \nD\nScreening Option:\nFence or Wall\nCELL (5, 2): \nCELL (5, 3): \nCELL (5, 4): \nCELL (6, 1): \nE\n12' Minimum Width\nCELL (6, 2): \nCELL (6, 3): \nCELL (6, 4): \nCELL (7, 1): \nF\n25' Minimum Depth;\n60\u00b0 Minimum Depth\nif used by\nSemi-tractor\nTrailers\nCELL (7, 2): \nCELL (7, 3): \nCELL (7, 4): \nCELL (8, 1): \nG\n14' Minimum\nClearance Height\nCELL (8, 2): \nCELL (8, 3): \nCELL (8, 4): \nCELL (9, 1): \nParking Lot\nCELL (9, 2): \nCELL (9, 3): \nCELL (9, 4): \nCELL (10, 1): \nLandscaping\nCELL (10, 2): \nCELL (10, 3): \nCELL (10, 4): \nCELL (11, 1): \nLot Line\nCELL (11, 2): \nCELL (11, 3): \nCELL (11, 4): \nCELL (1, 1): \nCamden County\nCELL (1, 2): \n5-34\nCELL (1, 3): \nLast Updated:\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nFebruary 4, 2019\n\n\nNEW PAGE 273\nARTICLE 151.5 Development Standards\n5.7 Access and Circulation\n5.7.1 Purpose and Intent\n5.7. ACCESS AND CIRCULATION\n5.7.1.\nPURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe purpose of this section is to ensure the safe and efficient movement of vehicles, bicyclists, pedestrian, and deliveries on\ndevelopment sites in the County. More specifically, these standards are intended to:\nA.\nProtect the health and safety of County residents and visitors;\nB.\nEnsure pedestrian accessibility is included in site planning;\nC.\nProtect the safety of motorists from traffic entering or exiting the street system; and\nD.\nEncourage alternative forms of transportation in the County.\n5.7.2.\nAPPLICABILITY\nA.\nGeneral\nUnless exempted in accordance with Section 5.7.3, Exemptions, or except where otherwise expressly stated, the\nstandards in this section apply to all new development in the County.\nB.\nExisting Development\nCompliance with these standards, to the maximum extent practicable, shall also apply to redevelopment of an existing\nstructure, building, or use when it is expanded, enlarged, or otherwise increased in intensity in an amount equivalent\nto or beyond 50 percent.\nC.\nConflict\nIn the event of conflict or overlap with the standards in this section and the standards in Chapter 6: Subdivisions and\nInfrastructure, the standards in Chapter 6 shall control.\n5.7.3.\nEXEMPTIONS\nThe following forms of development are exempted from the standards in this section:\nA.\nLots in the CP district;\nB.\nDevelopment of one single-family detached home on its own lot;\nC.\nDevelopment of a duplex; and\nD.\nDevelopment configured as a conservation subdivision shall be exempted from the following standards:\n1.\nSection 6.2.3.J, Development Entry Points; and\n2.\nSection 5.7.8, On-Site Pedestrian Walkways.\n5.7.4.\nSTREET CONFIGURATION\nDevelopment subject to the standards of this section that includes construction of, extension of, or connection to a public or\nprivate street shall also comply with the standards in Section 6.2.3, Streets.\n5.7.5.\nSIDEWALK CONFIGURATION\nDevelopment subject to the standards of this section that includes construction of, extension of, or connection to a public\nsidewalk shall also comply with the standards in Section 6.2.6, Sidewalks.\n5.7.6.\nVISIBILITY AT INTERSECTIONS\nA.\nVisibility at Intersections\nCorner lots and lots with driveways, alleys, or other methods of ingress/egress to a public or private street shall\ninclude sight distance triangles to ensure visibility for drivers and pedestrians moving through or in an intersection.\nRequired sight distance triangles shall be configured in accordance with the following standards (see Figure 5.7.6.A.3:\nSight Distance Triangles):\n1.\nRoadway Intersections\na.\nIntersections with State-maintained Roadways\n1.\nIn cases where a roadway intersects a state-maintained roadway, the required sight\ndistance triangle shall be an area between a point at the edge of the state-maintained\nroad right-of-way located 70 linear feet from the intersection and a second point at the\nedge of the opposing road right-of-way located ten feet from the intersection.\n2.\nNothing shall prohibit the NCDOT from requiring an alternative sight distance triangle\nconfiguration.\nb.\nIntersections with All Other Roadways\nCELL (1, 1): \nCamden County\nCELL (1, 2): \n5-35\nCELL (1, 3): \nLast Updated:\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL
