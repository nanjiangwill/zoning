Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"General Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"B-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If General Business\n(B-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor General Business (B-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"General Business (B-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"General Business\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

In no case shall a fence or wall over four feet (4') high be\nextended closer to the street right-of-way line or easement which parallels the front\nproperty line, than the front corner of the main building situated on the lot or twenty-five\nfeet (25') from said street right-of-way or easement. No fence may be constructed on or\ninto a public street right-of-way or easement. Side and rear yards may be enclosed by\nfences or walls six feet (6') high. Unless otherwise specified, metal fences shall not\nexceed four feet (4') in height and shall have a mesh smaller than five inches (5\").\nWooden or other privacy-type fences may not exceed six feet (6') in height. All fences\nin the historic district must be approved by the Historic Preservation Commission\n(BHPC).\n2) Only conforming nonresidential land uses with the exception of the TR District, may have\na solid or open fence or wall erected to a maximum height of ten feet (10') except as\nrequired by this Ordinance. An open fence or wall is one which has openings throughout\nand where clear vision is possible from one side to the other on a horizontal plane and\nsuch openings occupy fifty percent (50%) or more of the area of the fence or wall. A\nfence or wall which does not qualify as an open fence or open wall shall maintain a\nsetback at entrances and exits of the site to provide an adequate sight distance easement\nas depicted in subsection E-3 of this section.\n3)\nA fence or wall which does not qualify as an open fence or open wall shall maintain a\nsetback at entrances and exits of the site to provide an adequate sight distance easement.\nSuch easement shall be established as an isosceles triangle having legs thirty-five feet\n(35') in length on each corner side of the entrance or exit. The same sight distance\neasement shall be applied to the corners of nonresidential lots which are typified by a\nstreet intersection.\n4) The setback and yard requirements of this Ordinance shall not apply to a retaining wall\nnot more than five feet (5') high, as measured from the lowest ground elevation to the top\nof the wall. The Board of Adjustment (BOA) may permit a retaining wall greater than\nfive feet (5') high due to the topography of the lot if such wall is necessary.\nF) Screening/Buffering of Open Storage Areas.\nAny open storage area not enclosed within the confines of a building, such as boxes, crates,\ntrash piles, machinery, and merchandise with open display (windows) which result from the\ncommercial operation it is associated with, shall be enclosed or hidden from view along any\nproperty lines adjacent to a residential zone by a wall, fence, and/or screening/buffering in a\nmanner acceptable to the zoning administrator. This provision shall apply in any\nnonresidential use adjacent to a residential zone and all properties affected by this provision\nshall comply within three years after adoption of this Ordinance. In the TR and General\nBusiness (B-1) districts, there shall be no open storage as an accessory or other use.\nG) Location of Buffer Yards.\nBuffer yards should be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, extending to the lot's\nboundary line. Buffer yards may be located in whole or in part within any side yard, and rear\nyard setbacks. Buffer yards shall not be located on any portion of a public or private road\nright-of-way and/or utility easement unless written approval is obtained by the Town's Public\nWorks Department and/or the easement holder.\n183\n\n\nNEW PAGE 208\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\nH) Responsibility for Development of a Buffer Yard.\n1) The owner or developer of the permitted use of land shall be responsible for submitting\na\nbuffer yard plan to the Planning and Inspections Department as mandated in subsection\nM of this section. The owner or developer is also responsible for providing and\nmaintaining the required buffer yard and screening. If the replacement of screening\nmaterial becomes necessary to continue its effectiveness, the owner or developer\nis\nresponsible for such replacement.\n2) When screening for outdoor storage is required, the owner, developer, tenant, or occupant\nshall be required to submit a buffer yard plan to the Planning and Inspections Department\nand to install and maintain the required buffer yard and screening.\n3)\nThe owner of a subdivision or PUD may either submit a buffer yard plan for each lot or\none for the entire subdivision or PUD. Should one plan be submitted for the entire\nsubdivision or PUD, the owner or developer may either install the entire buffer yard at\nonce or install the buffer yard for each phase of construction in conjunction with the\nbuilding permit issuance for the phase.\nI) Maintenance of a Buffer Yard.\n1) Vegetation.\nThe property owner, developer, tenant, and occupant shall be jointly and severally\nresponsible for maintaining all vegetation required by this section in a healthy condition\nand as set forth in section N of this section.\n2) Fencing.\nNo fence shall have more than twenty percent (20%) of its surface area covered with\ndisfigured, racked or missing materials, or peeling paint. No fence shall be allowed to\nremain with bent or broken supports or be allowed to stand more than fifteen degrees\n(15\u00b0) away from the perpendicular. Support structures of the fence/wall, other than those\nused to enhance its appearance, shall be seen, if at all, by the use responsible for building\nand maintaining the buffer and not by the adjacent use. Replacement or repair of fencing\nshall occur upon written notification from the zoning administrator within a period of no\nmore than thirty successive days.\n3) Pruning.\nPruning shall follow the guidelines set in section 14 of this Ordinance and shall not\ncompromise the minimum height requirements at the time of the original planting.\nJ) Requirements for Refuse Collection Areas.\n1)\nScreening/buffering is required for all refuse collection areas designed for commercial\nuse. A location for refuse collection shall be shown on all site plans. An area specifically\ndesignated for recycling is strongly recommended and in some cases required per North\nCarolina General Statutes.\n2) If a refuse collection area is provided for unmanned uses (e.g. cemeteries or public or\nprivate utilities such as power, water, or communication facilities) which do not generate\na lot of refuse, the requirements of this section shall apply.\n3) Refuse collection areas shall be screened on three sides by an opaque fence or wall SO it\nis not visible from any surrounding properties or streets. In rare circumstances where site\nconditions support the refuse collection area(s) facing a right of way, the fourth side\nwould require screening/buffering in the form of an opaque gate (chain link fencing is\nprohibited). Collection areas shall be designed SO waste removal trucks can easily access\nthe waste containers.\n184\n\nNEW PAGE 209\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\n4) Refuse collection areas shall be set back at least five feet (5') from the side and rear\nproperty line and shall not be closer to any street right of way than the wall(s) of the\nprimary structure.\n5) Refuse collection areas shall be constructed to Town standards. If more than one\ncontainer is needed, the collection area shall be based on the detail multiplied by the\nnumber of containers needed.\n6) Refuse collection areas which serve restaurants or other such uses as determined\nnecessary, shall drain into the sanitary sewer through a grease trap or other approved\nmethod as deemed appropriate by the Town's Public Works Department.\n7) Any modifications to existing refuse collection areas shall comply with the requirements\nof this section.\n8) Due to the particularities of any given development, the Board of Commissioners (BOC)\nrecognizes the inflexible application of this section may result in a development which is\nunable to fully comply with the standards set forth herein. Therefore, the Town may grant\nflexibility when an existing development has insufficient land available, an unsafe\ncondition would be created, or other extenuating circumstances exist. Whenever\nflexibility is granted, the reasons for granting the flexibility shall be documented and the\nTown may impose specific conditions to any flexibility granted.\nK) Plant Materials Used in Buffer Yards.\nTrees and planting material shall follow the standards in section 14 of this Ordinance. A list\nof recommended shrubs and trees may be found in Appendix A of this Ordinance.\nRecommendations for buffer yard material, other than those listed in Appendix A, may be\nobtained from the town planner.\nL) Further Buffer Yard Requirements.\nThe following requirements shall be followed as well as the standards and requirements found\nin section 14 of this Ordinance:\n1) Seeding.\nAll buffer yard areas which are not landscaped shall be seeded or sodded with lawn or\nplanted with ground cover unless the lawn or ground cover is already established.\n2) Encroachment.\nAmong other things, buffer yards may not be encroached upon by vehicular areas (except\ncommon access drives), buildings, exterior storage, dumpsters, or mechanical equipment\nunless otherwise provided. Encroachment by storm water detention ponds may occur\nsubject to the approval of the Town of Beaufort. Any plant materials placed within storm\nwater storage areas shall be of a variety which will survive periodic flooding.\n3) \"Type C\" Screening/Buffering for Outdoor Storage.\nPrior to the installation of a \"type C\" screen/buffer yard for outdoor storage (requirements\nfor \"type C\" are in subsection C-3 of this section), a buffer yard plan to include the area\nof the storage area(s) and the specific type of fence and plantings shall be submitted to\nthe zoning administrator for approval. Plans submitted shall follow the guidelines set in\nsubsection M of this section.\nNo certificate of compliance for any new construction or new renovation shall be\napproved by the Town's Planning and Inspections Department until the required\nscreening/buffering is installed in accordance with the approved plan.\n4) Recreational Use.\n185\n\nNEW PAGE 261\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of
