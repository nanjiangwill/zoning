Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Planned Unit Development\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CD-PUD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Planned Unit Development\n(CD-PUD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Planned Unit Development (CD-PUD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Planned Unit Development (CD-PUD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Planned Unit Development\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft).

No use shall be permitted within a Conditional Zoning District except\npursuant to the conditions imposed as part of the approval. The permitted uses shall be limited to\nthose permitted in the corresponding Base Zoning District unless otherwise restricted in the\nconditions set forth in the approval of the Conditional Zoning District classification. Any use allowed\nin one Gateway District may be approved as a Conditional District in any other Gateway District.\n6.3.4 Applicable standards.\n(A) Base Zoning District standards apply. All standards and requirements that apply to the\ncorresponding Base Zoning District shall also apply to the Conditional Zoning District, except where\nallowed in division 6.3.6(B) and \u00a7 6.5.\n(B) No less restrictive than base district. Conditions imposed on a Conditional Zoning District\nmay be no less restrictive than the standards that apply to the corresponding Base Zoning District,\nexcept where allowed in division 6.3.6(B) and 6.5.\n(C) Stricter standards adopted. Existing conditions or limitations associated with an approved\nConditional Zoning District classification shall become null and void if future amendments to this\nordinance require stricter standards than those imposed under the Conditional Zoning District\nclassification.\n(D) Application of conditions. In cases where the ability to implement an approved Conditional\nZoning District condition is impossible or impractical (e.g., a condition requiring trees to be\npreserved when the trees have subsequently died due to natural causes), the Ordinance\nAdministrator shall enforce the condition in a way that most closely meets the condition's original\nintent.\n6.3.5 Parallel Conditional Districts established. Each Base Zoning District shall have a\ncorresponding \"parallel\" Conditional Zoning District. Conditional Zoning District classifications shall\nbe indicated on the Official Zoning Map by the suffix \"CD\" in front of the associated Base Zoning\nDistrict.\n6.3.6 Planned Unit Development District (CD-PUD).\n(A) General. The Planned Unit Development District (CD-PUD) is a special purpose\nConditional Zoning District that is established in order to accommodate a diverse mix of residential\nand nonresidential uses and structures that function as a cohesive, integrated, and unified\ndevelopment. This district encourages innovative development patterns by allowing flexibility in\npermitted uses, design, and layout requirements in conjunction with a concept plan. This district\nmay only be established through the process set forth in division 3.2.3, Conditional Zoning District\nClassification.\n(B) Planned unit development standards.\n(1) Minimum size. The minimum size for an application for Conditional Zoning District\nclassification to a CD-PUD district is 25 acres.\n(2) Permitted uses.

Open space connections must be retained in a\nnatural condition, with the exception of greenways that comply with the town's adopted standards,\nwhich are still allowed in these areas.\n(5) Density. The overall residential density of the PUD is established by the concept plan as\npart of the Conditional Zoning District classification.\n(6) Minimum lot size. Minimum lot sizes in each area of the PUD are established by the\nconcept plan as part of the Conditional Zoning District classification.\n(7) Minimum interior setbacks. Setback requirements within the PUD are established by\nthe concept plan as part of the Conditional Zoning District classification. While no minimum setback\nis required, if one is provided it must be at least five feet in width.\n(8) Minimum street setbacks. Minimum street (front yard) setbacks within the PUD are\nestablished by the concept plan as part of the Conditional Zoning District classification.\n(9) Maximum height. Within single-family residential portions of a PUD, the maximum\nheight limit is 35 feet. In nonresidential or mixed-use portions of a PUD, the maximum height limit is\ndetermined by the concept plan.\n(10) Open space and recreation facilities. A minimum of 20% of the gross area of the\nPUD must be dedicated to open space. No more than 50% of the dedicated open space may be\nused for active recreation purposes (i.e., soccer fields, tennis courts) and the like. At least 50% of\nthe passive recreation/natural areas must be usable and accessible (i.e., not wetlands, steep\nslopes, or other marginal lands).\n(11) Nonresidential areas. Nonresidential areas and adjacent residential areas must be\narranged in such a manner that convenient pedestrian access is provided between and within\nthose areas.\n(12) Parking and loading. Off-street parking and loading areas must be provided in\naccordance with Article 13.\n(13) Street design. Streets must be designed and located so that they are integrated into\nand provide continuation of the surrounding street network.

The Mixed-Use Districts allow for a mix of nonresidential and\nresidential uses within the same development or building. This type of development is intended to\nencourage the physical design characteristics of pedestrian oriented, storefront-style shopping\nstreets.\n6.5.2 Gateway Districts. The Butner Gateway consists of five Base Zoning Districts described\nin \u00a7 6.5 and three Conditional Zoning Districts described in \u00a7 6.6 within a specific area, the\nGateway, each of which allow a mix of uses. Using a hybrid of form based code and traditional land\nuse based code, these districts create a cohesive, integrated, and unified development consistent\nwith the town's Gateway Small Area Plan adopted December 3, 2015 and the town's current\nComprehensive Plan. The districts are allowed only within the Gateway Area. Before development\nin the Gateway Districts may occur, a concept plan must be reviewed and approved by Town\nCouncil in accordance with division 3.2.6. Uses allowed in each Gateway District are shown in\nTable 7-1, Table of Permitted Uses. Any property in the Gateway area can request a Conditional\nDistrict rezoning to allow a use allowed in another Gateway District.\n(A) Gateway Base Zoning Districts.\n(1) Central Avenue Mixed-Use District (CX).
