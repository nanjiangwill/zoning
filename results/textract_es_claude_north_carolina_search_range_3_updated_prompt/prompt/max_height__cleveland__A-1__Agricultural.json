Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Agricultural\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"A-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Agricultural\n(A-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Agricultural (A-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Agricultural (A-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Agricultural\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Any vegetation that constitutes part of a screen shall\nbe replaced in the event that it dies. Replacement shall be made within six (6) months of death\nof the plant. All screen materials shall be protected from damage by erosion, motor vehicles or\npedestrians which would reduce the effectiveness of the screen. (amended 12-14-09)\nSection 8. Relief to Screening and Buffer Requirements\nIn the event that the unusual topography or elevation of a development site or the location\nor size of the parcel to be developed would make strict adherence to the requirements of this\nsection serve no meaningful purpose or would make it physically impossible to install and\nmaintain the screen and buffer, the Planning Board may alter the requirements of Section 2\nprovided the spirit and intent of this article are maintained. Such an alteration may occur only at\nthe request of the developer, who shall submit a plan to the Planning Board showing existing site\nfeatures that would screen the proposed use and any additional screen materials the developer\nmay propose to have installed. The Planning Board shall have no authority to alter the screening\nand buffer requirements unless the developer demonstrates that existing site features and/or any\nadditional screening materials will screen the proposed use as effectively as the required screen.\n(amended 12-14-09)\nThe vacancy or non-use of an adjoining parcel shall not constitute grounds for providing\nrelief to the screening and buffer requirements contained in this ordinance. Neither shall the\ndesire of an owner to make more intensive use or greater economic use of the property be\ngrounds for reducing the screening/buffer requirements of Section 2 of this article.
