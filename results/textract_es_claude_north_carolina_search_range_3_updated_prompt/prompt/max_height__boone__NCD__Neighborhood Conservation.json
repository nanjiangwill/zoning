Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Neighborhood Conservation\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"NCD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Neighborhood Conservation\n(NCD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Neighborhood Conservation (NCD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Neighborhood Conservation (NCD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Neighborhood Conservation\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

When the intensity of the existing development already exceeds the limits\nestablished by Subsection 14.42.03(B), additional development is permitted up to\na size 10% greater than the existing structure, and likewise, an additional ten\npercent (10%) of impervious surface may be created.\n3. The limits on land disturbing activity created by Subsection 14.42.03(A) shall be\ncalculated as if no development on the property has yet taken place. In other\nwords, the Administrator shall exclude from the calculations of allowable land\ndisturbance that portion of the property upon which an impervious surface exists\nat the time this amendment is effective. For example, if a house with a 2,000 square\nfoot footprint and 2,000 square feet of driveway already exists on a three (3) acre\ntract, and the owner wishes to construct an addition, the Administrator will first\nadd the square footage of the house's footprint and the square footage of the\ndriveway to determine that there is already 4,000 square feet of impervious surface\non the property. This existing square footage of impervious surface will be\nsubtracted from the total land area of the property to calculate how much of the\nremaining property can be disturbed. In the example, the property will be viewed\nnot as a three (3) acre tract, but as a tract of two (2) acres, plus 39,560 square feet\n(an acre = 43,560 square feet, minus 4,000 square feet of existing impervious\n14-109\n\n\nNEW PAGE 260\nTown of Boone\nUnified Development Ordinance\nArticle 14 Zoning Districts Regulations\nsurface). The amount of allowable land disturbance to put in the addition ends up\nbeing 44,538 square feet.\nD. Persons developing property in the viewshed shall strive to reasonably site any\nstructures to be developed on the property in such way as to minimize their visual\nimpact from the major corridors. To this end, the Administrator may request a redesign\nof the development to accomplish this goal.\nE.\nPersons developing property in the viewshed shall strive to reasonably preserve and\nprotect foliage and trees on the property, without placing the construction in danger,\nwith a goal of minimizing the visual impact of the development from the major\ncorridors.\nF. All development in the viewshed shall include a plan for landscape buffering, using the\ntechniques and vegetation authorized in in Appendix C, Town of Boone Details and\nSpecifications Manual, in the line of sight from the major corridors, to reduce to the\nextent reasonably possible the visual impact of the development from the major\ncorridors. Such plans, in the case of the construction of a single-family home, need not\nbe \"formal\" or prepared by a landscape professional, but must be in writing sufficiently\ndetailed to allow the Administrator to know what is planned.\nG. All development along ridgelines must be designed in an effort to reasonably minimize\nthe visual impact of such development from the major corridors. To this end, the\nAdministrator may require a redesign of the development to accomplish this goal or\nmay require specific landscape buffering, such as trees and other plant material, to be\ninstalled. This requirement by the Administrator shall be considered an appealable\ndecision to the Board of Adjustment, and may be appealed in conformity with the\nprocedures of Article 6.\nH.
