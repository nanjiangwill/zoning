Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Airport Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"AO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Airport Overlay\n(AO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Airport Overlay (AO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is \nnot for the zone \"Airport Overlay (AO)\" but for other zones. \nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Airport Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

In order to carry out the provisions of this section, certain zones,\nwhich include all of the land lying within the approach zones, transitional zones, horizontal\nzones, and conical zones as they apply to a particular airport are established and defined on\nthe Zoning Map. An area located in more than one (1) of the following zones is considered to\nbe only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. Nothing in this Section shall be\nconstrued as prohibiting the growth, construction, or maintenance of any tree or structure to\na height that is below the limitations set forth in this Section. The various zones are hereby\nestablished and defined as follows:\n(1) Approach zone a (precision instrument runway). The inner edge of this approach zone\ncoincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone\nexpands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet\nfrom the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.\na. Height Restricted Area. Slopes fifty (50) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at\nthe end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a\n176 of 446\n3/9/24, 13:42\n\n\nNEW PAGE 177\nBladen County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nhorizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline; thence slopes\nupward forty (40) feet horizontally for each foot vertically to an additional horizontal\ndistance of 40,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.\n(2) Approach zone b (runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum as low as 3/4 mile non-\nprecision instrument). The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of\nthe primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly\nto a width of 4,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its\ncenterline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.\na. Height Restricted Area. Slopes upward thirty-four (34) feet horizontally for each foot\nvertically beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and\nextending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway\ncenterline.\n(3) Transitional zones. These zones are hereby established as the area beneath the\ntransitional surfaces. These surfaces extend outward and upward beginning 500 feet each\nside of the runway centerline at a slope of 7:1 to the primary surface. The runway\ncenterline extended at a slope of seven (7) feet horizontally for each foot vertically from\nthe sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and\nconical surfaces. Transitional zones for those portions of the precision approach zones,\nwhich project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of\n5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach zones and at 90-degree\nangles to the extended runway centerline.\na. Height Restricted Area. Slopes seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning\nat the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach\nsurface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation. In addition\nto the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven (7) feet outward for\neach foot upward beginning at the sides of and the same elevation as the approach\nsurface, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Where the precision\ninstrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are\nestablished height limits sloping seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning\nat the sides of and the same elevation as the approach surface and extending a\nhorizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90 degree angles to the extended\nrunway centerline from the edge of the approach surface.\n(4) Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is hereby established by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet\nradii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway, and connecting\nthe adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs.
