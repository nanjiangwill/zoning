Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"C-P Corporate Park\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"C-P\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If C-P Corporate Park\n(C-P) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor C-P Corporate Park (C-P). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"C-P Corporate Park (C-P)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"C-P Corporate Park\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft).

Such mixed-use development shall contain at\nleast one type of residential and at least one type of non-residential development. PUD zoning is intended\nto\npermit flexibility in the design, construction and processing of residential and non-residential\ndevelopments of a quality that could not be achieved under conventional zoning approaches. While the\nconventional zoning districts and the requirements of those districts set forth in the UDO are reasonable,\nthere may be circumstances in which it is in the community's best interest to allow unique and/or creative\ndesigns and techniques that:\nPromote the most appropriate use of a parcel\nAllow diversification of use\nFacilitate the adequate and economical provisions of streets, parks, open space, schools, storm\ndrainage and sewer and water utilities\nPreserve and utilize open space\nOffer recreational opportunities close to residential uses\nEnhance neighborhood appearance\n7-10\nTown of China Grove Unified Development Ordinance\n\n\nNEW PAGE 72\nCHAPTER 7: ZONING DISTRICTS AND PERMITTED USE TABLE\n7.14.2 Processing Procedure\nA PUD shall be considered a conditional zoning district and shall be processed in accordance with Section\n13.6 of this Ordinance.\n7.14.3 Permitted Uses\nA. The uses permitted in a PUD shall be the permitted uses as set forth in the approved Conditional Zoning.\nB. The Conditional Zoning application shall designate the proposed land use categories selected from\namong those eligible for consideration that are shown under the PUD column in the Permitted Use\nTable. No subsequent special use permit is required for any use included in the approved PUD\nConditional Zoning.\n7.14.4 Land Use Composition\nA. A PUD District shall consist of at least one residential use and one non-residential use listed in the\nPermitted Use Table.\n7.14.5 Design Standards\nA. The land uses within a PUD shall not be subject to any of the dimension and density provisions of\nChapter 7 except that a perimeter setback of 25 feet shall be maintained from existing development.\nB. PUD designs shall be subject to the recommended design elements for Chapter 5.
