Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Watershed\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"Watershed Districts\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Watershed\n(Watershed Districts) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Watershed (Watershed Districts). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Watershed (Watershed Districts)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Watershed\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Topographic survey:\n1. The grading plan shall be based upon a topographic survey prepared by a registered\nland surveyor of the tract that includes detailed information of both natural and\ncultural physical features prior to development.\n2.\nIn addition to showing physical features such as existing buildings, overhead and/or\nunderground utilities, roadways, walks, water or drainage features, the plan should\nalso indicate the location of existing vegetation, particularly historic and significant\ntrees being retained and protected and limits of vegetation if the tract is partially\nwooded.\n3. Contour lines shall be used to present the topography of the entire tract, including\nsufficient distance into adjoining properties to indicate continuity. The contour line\ninterval should be selected to appropriately convey the topographic information\nfor planning and controlling construction. Generally, a two (2) foot contour interval\nis sufficient. However, smaller intervals (0.5 - 1.0 ft.) may be used for flatter areas\nand larger intervals (5 - 10 ft.) for steeper terrain. Contour intervals may be no\ngreater than ten feet (10').\nI.\nBasic Survey Data Required:\n1.\nBoundary information (metes and bounds, legal description of the site if available),\nincluding all existing and proposed street rights-of-way.\n2.

Contour lines shall be used to present the existing and proposed topography of the\nentire tract, including sufficient distance into adjoining properties to indicate\ncontinuity. The contour line interval should be selected to accurately and\nappropriately convey the topographic information for planning and controlling\nconstruction. Generally, a two-foot (2') contour interval is sufficient. However,\nsmaller intervals (0.5 -1.0 ft.) may be used for flatter areas and larger intervals (5 -\n10 ft.) for steeper terrain. Contour intervals may be no greater than ten feet (10').\n2. Grades at corners of buildings, step landings, and first floor elevations.\n3. Finished grades at the edges of surfaced areas and at such interior points as\nnecessary to show the shaping of the area. A combination of proposed contours\nand spot evaluations may be used to convey this information.\n4.\nProposed roadway elevations by indicating proposed contours and spot elevations\nwhere necessary. Profiles, cross-sections, and spot elevations are to be used to\nestablish grading of paved areas such as roadways.\n5. Top-of-curb grades at all connecting walks, curb returns, and all catch basin\nlocations.\n6. Spot elevations along swale lines, by using arrows to show direction of flow. Slope\ngradients should also be shown.\n7. Top elevation of all storm and sanitary sewer manholes and other appurtenances.\n8. Lawn and earth grades can be shown by proposed contours and by spot elevations\nwhere necessary.\n9. The proposed location of stockpiled topsoil for future use in landscaped areas. To\navoid root compaction, the stockpile should be located outside root zones of the\nsignificant vegetation to be preserved.\n10. The storage locations of construction materials outside the root zones of significant\nvegetation to be preserved to avoid root compaction.\n11. The location of existing significant vegetation such as specimen trees or the canopy\nlimits of wooded areas intended for preservation.\n12.
