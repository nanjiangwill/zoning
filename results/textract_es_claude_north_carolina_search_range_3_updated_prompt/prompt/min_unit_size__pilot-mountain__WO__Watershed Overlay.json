Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Watershed Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"WO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Watershed Overlay\n(WO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Watershed Overlay (WO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is \nnot for the zone \"Watershed Overlay (WO)\" but for other zones. \nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Watershed Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft).

Purpose. The purpose of establishing supplementary requirements for development in\ndowntown Pilot Mountain is to protect and enhance the visual character of development and\nto preserve the unique streetscape of downtown by encouraging compatibility among\ndowntown structures. It is not the intent of this overlay district to eliminate architectural\nfreedom or discourage innovative design, but rather to complement the Town of Pilot\nMountain's Development Ordinance and development guidelines for Downtown.\n2.\nApplicability. Buildings within the Downtown Design Overlay (DDO) District exhibit design\nelements that contribute to the unique sense of character of downtown Pilot Mountain.\nSpecifically, buildings tend to have flat or low pitch roofs concealed by the front facade\nparapet, no front or side yard setback, large storefront windows on the street level floor and\nstrong horizontal separations between the first and any upper floors created by windows and/\nor changes in fa\u00e7ade materials.\nIn order to continue and, in some cases, recreate the historic development pattern of\ndowntown Pilot Mountain, the following standards shall apply to all new construction,\nadditions and substantial modifications to existing structures located within the Downtown\nDesign Overlay (DDO) District. For the purposes of this section substantial modification shall\nbe defined as any work which involves the alteration of the building's footprint, construction of\nadditional stories, changes in roof pitch, modification of building fenestration and entryways,\nmaterial changes to the building fa\u00e7ade, or painting.\n3. Exemptions. When in compliance with all other town ordinances, the following types of\nprojects are exempt from the standards of the Downtown Design Overlay (DDO) district:\na. Interior and exterior alterations of buildings that were originally designed and built for\nsingle-family residential use and continue to be used for single-family residential use.\nb. Underground construction which does not consist of any above ground components,\nincluding utility boxes, pipes, poles or similar appurtenant features;\nC. Conducting regular maintenance work on buildings, landscaping, or grounds,\n(including parking lots), which does not significantly alter the appearance or function\nof the building, landscaping or grounds;\nd. Interior remodeling work, which does not involve the alteration of any building\ncomponent that does not alter any exterior building component;\ne. Landscape maintenance and upkeep, excluding the replacement trees;\nf. Temporary uses and structures;\ng. Routine roof maintenance and repair, when using like materials; and\nh. Painting of murals on the side and/or rear fa\u00e7ade of buildings.\n4. Design Standards\n\nNEW PAGE 89\ntime to time by the Board of Commissioners to cover cost of advertising as required\nby this chapter.\nC. The proposed request for a minor or major watershed variance shall include a site\nplan, drawn to scale of at least one (1\") inch to forty (40') feet, indicating the property\nlines of the parcel upon which the use is proposed; any existing or proposed\nstructures; parking areas and other built-upon areas; surface water drainage. The site\nplan shall be neatly drawn and indicate north point, name and address of person who\nprepared the plan, date of the original drawing, and an accurate record of any later\nrevisions.\nd. The Ordinance Administrator shall notify in writing each local government having\njurisdiction in the watershed. Notice shall include a description of the variance being\nrequested. Local governments receiving notice of the variance request may submit\ncomments to the Ordinance Administrator prior to a decision by the Planning and\nZoning Board. Comments shall become a part of the record of proceedings of the\nPlanning and Zoning Board.\ne. The Planning and Zoning Board shall duly fulfill its requirements of public notification,\nevidentiary public hearing and quasi-judicial procedure as provided in this chapter and\nin the NC General Statutes for watershed variances, as for all other variances from\nthe zoning regulations of the Town.\nf. Proceedings of the Planning and Zoning Board. The Board shall keep records of\nthe proceedings, prepare a report containing findings of fact, conclusions of law and\nrecommended decision and forward the record to the Environmental Management\nCommission (which must approve all major watershed variances). A denial of a major\nwatershed variance by the Planning and Zoning Board need not go to the EMC for\nreview. One copy of any report forwarded to the EMC shall be kept on file by the\nClerk.\ng. Major Watershed Variances. If the Planning and Zoning Board decides in favor of\ngranting a major watershed variance, the Board shall prepare a preliminary record of\nthe hearing with all deliberate speed. The preliminary record of the hearing shall\ninclude:\ni. The variance application;\nii. The bearing notices;\niii. The evidence presented;\niv. Motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence and rulings, on them;\nV. Proposed findings and exceptions;\nvi. The proposed decision, including all conditions proposed to be added to the\npermit; and\nvii. The preliminary record shall be sent to the Environmental Management\nCommission for its review as follows:\nIf the Commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance\nqualifies as a major variance and that the property owner can secure no\nreasonable return from, nor make any practical use of the property unless the\nproposed variance is granted, and the variance, if granted, will not result in a\n\n\nNEW PAGE 90\nserious threat to the water supply, then the Commission shall approve the\nvariance with conditions and stipulations. The Commission shall prepare a\nCommission decision and send it to the Planning and Zoning Board. If the\nCommission approves the variance as proposed, the Board shall prepare a\nfinal decision granting the proposed variance. If the Commission approves the\nvariance with conditions and stipulations, the Board shall prepare a final\ndecision, including conditions and stipulations granting the proposed variance.\nIf the Commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance\nqualifies as a major watershed variance and that the property owner can\nsecure a reasonable return from or make a practical use of the property\nwithout the variance or the variance, if granted, will result in a serious threat to\nthe water supply, then the Commission shall deny approval of the variance as\nproposed. The Commission shall prepare a Commission decision and send it\nto the Planning and Zoning Board. The Board shall prepare a final decision\ndenying the variance as proposed.\n10. WSII-CA (O) Watershed II Critical Area (Overlay). The WSII-CA(O) is established as an\noverlay district to impose higher standards in the critical area because the risk of water\nquality degradation from pollution is greater than in the balance of the watershed, most of\nwhich lies within the extraterritorial boundary of the town. The regulations of this district are\nintended to promote higher developmental standards and not limit unnecessarily\ndevelopmental options. In order to maintain a predominantly undeveloped land use intensity\npattern, residential and non-residential uses shall be allowed at a maximum of one (1)\ndwelling unit per two (2) acres and six percent (6%) built-upon area respectively.\na. Limitations on Certain Permitted Uses\ni. Agriculture, provided that all agricultural activities will be encouraged to\nparticipate in the agricultural Cost Share Program and subject to the\nprovisions of the Food Security Act of 1985 and the Food, Agriculture,\nConservation and Trade Act of 1990. Agricultural activities conducted after\nJanuary 1, 1993 shall maintain a minimum ten-foot vegetative buffer, or\nequivalent control as determined by the Soil and Water Conservation\nCommission, along all perennial waters indicated on the most recent versions\nof U.S.G.S. 1:24,000 (7.5 minute) scale topographic maps or as determined\nby local governments studies. Animal operations greater than 100 animal units\nshall employ Best Management Practices (BMP's) by July 1, 1994\nrecommended by the Soil and Water Conservation Commission.\nii. Silviculture, subject to the provisions of the Forest Practices Guidelines\nRelated to Water Quality (15 N.C.A.C. 11.0101 - 11.0209).\niii. Residential development at one dwelling unit per two acres on a project-by-\nproject basis. For purposes of density calculations, total project acreage shall\nnot include any area within the designated right-of-way of any public or private\nstreet within the project, nor shall it include any area within the project donated\nor dedicated to the public, except for storm water control structures approved\nunder the high-density option. No residential lot shall be less than two acres,\nexcept within an approved cluster development.\nb. Prohibited Uses\n\n\nNEW PAGE 91\ni. Sanitary landfills are prohibited.\nii. No new chemical storage or new underground fuel storage tanks are allowed.\niii. The storage of toxic and hazardous materials is prohibited unless a spill\ncontainment plan is implemented.\niv. Sites for land application of sludge/residuals or petroleum-contaminated soils\nare prohibited.\nC. Development Applications. In addition to the standards for Site Plans, the following\nshall be contained on applications for development in the Watershed Overlay:\ni. Total impervious area;\nii. Location of perennial streams;\niii. Septic tank drainage field; and\niv. Sedimentation and erosion controls.\nd. Minimum Lot Area. 87,120 square feet (or two (2) acres) minimum lot area per\ndwelling unit. Because of the high likelihood of a septic tank, a potential buyer should\nfirst check with the Surry County Health Department to determine adequacy of the lot,\nas a larger lot could be required.\n11. WSII-BW (O) WSII-Balance of Watershed (Overlay). The WSII-BW (O) is established as an\noverlay district to impose lower standards in the balance of the watershed area because the\nrisk of water quality degradation from pollution is less than in the critical area of the\nwatershed. The regulations of this district will allow residential uses at a maximum of one (1)\ndwelling unit per acre and non-residential development at twelve percent (12%) built-upon\narea. Projects must minimize built-upon surface area, direct storm water away from surface\nwaters and incorporate Best Management Practices to minimize water quality impacts. Non-\ndischarging landfills and sludge applications sites are allowed.\na. Limitations on Certain Permitted Uses\ni. Agriculture, provided that all agricultural activities will be encouraged to\nparticipate in the agricultural Cost Share Program and subject to the\nprovisions of the Food Security Act of 1985 and the Food, Agriculture,\nConservation and Trade Act of 1990.\nii. Silviculture, subject to the provisions of the Forest Practices Guidelines\nRelated to Water Quality (15 N.C.A.C. 11.0101 - 11.0209).\niii.

No residential lot shall be less than one (1) acre, except within an\napproved cluster development.\nii. Non-residential and Multi-Family. Development may exceed the twelve\npercent (12%) built-upon area on a project-by-project basis in that up to five\npercent (5%) of the balance of the watershed (or 161 acres) may be\ndeveloped for non-residential and multi-family development to seventy percent\n(70%) built-upon area on a project-by-project basis.\nRecords for the 5/70 watershed provisions within the WSII-BW (O). The Ordinance\nAdministrator shall keep records of the town's utilization of the provisions that a maximum of\nfive percent (5%) of the balance of the watershed area may be developed with non-\nresidential development to a maximum of seventy percent (70%) built upon area. Records\nshall include the total acres of non-critical watershed area, total acres eligible to be\ndeveloped under this option, total acres approved for this development option, and individual\nrecords for each project with the following information: location, acres, site plan, use, storm\nwater management plan as applicable and inventory of hazardous materials as applicable.\n\nNEW PAGE 93\nARTICLE 10 SIGN REGULATIONS\n10.1 Purpose\n10.2 Applicability\n10.3 General Sign Standards\n10.4 Prohibited Signs\n10.5 Temporary Signs\n10.6 Permanent Signs\n10.1 Purpose\nThe purpose of this Article is to promote the effective and compatible use of signage within the Town of\nPilot Mountain.\n10.2 Applicability\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Article, it shall be unlawful for any person to place, erect, construct,\nenlarge, move, or replace any sign, without first having obtained a permit for such sign from the Ordinance\nAdministrator.\n10.3 General Sign Standards\n1.
