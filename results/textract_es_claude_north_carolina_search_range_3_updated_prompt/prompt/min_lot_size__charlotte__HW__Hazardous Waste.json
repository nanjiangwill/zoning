Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Hazardous Waste\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"HW\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Hazardous Waste\n(HW) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Hazardous Waste (HW). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Hazardous Waste (HW)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Hazardous Waste\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Purpose.\nThe purpose of the Neighborhood Services District (NS) is to encourage and accommodate the\ndevelopment and continued existence of mixed use districts, which provide a focus for\nneighborhood retail and service activities. This district provides for a variety of neighborhood-\noriented retail and service uses intermixed with high density residential uses. Residential uses on\nthe upper floor of commercial structures are strongly encouraged. Emphasis in the district is\nplaced upon creating a pedestrian scale urban environment with strong linkages to the\nneighborhood and access to transit.\nSection 11.502. Applicability.\nThe delineation of Neighborhood Services Districts will be done primarily through the area\nplanning process. This does not preclude, however, a private sector initiated rezoning petition to\nestablish a district. The following criteria must be considered for the establishment of the\nNeighborhood Services District:\n(1)\nThe district must be directly adjacent to or within a residential neighborhood.\n(2)\nThe proposed uses are intended to serve the surrounding neighborhood.\n(3)\nThe district must have frontage on a major or minor thoroughfare, unless an\napproved site plan provides otherwise.\n(4)\nThe district must have proximity to existing and future transit routes.\nSection 11.503. Uses permitted by right.\nThe intent of the Neighborhood Services District is to provide for uses that directly serve the\nneighborhood in which they are located. Uses allowed by right and under prescribed conditions\nin the B-1 district are allowed.\nSection 11.504.

If a\nside yard is provided, it shall be a minimum of 10 feet.\n(3)\nSide yard adjacent to residential district is 10 feet.\n(4)\nRear yard adjacent to nonresidential district is 10 feet.\n(5)\nRear yard adjacent to residential district is 20 feet.\n(6)\nScreening shall be provided next to a residential use or district as required in\nSection 12.303.\n(7)\nMaximum floor-area-ratio is 2.0. Any residential use incorporated into a\ncommercial or office structure will not be included in the floor-area-ratio\ncalculation. In addition, a commercial or office structure may receive an\nadditional .50 floor-area-ratio if a residential use is incorporated into the structure.\nIf a parking deck is constructed as part of the building, the allowable floor-area-\nratio may be increased by .50. The total maximum allowable floor-area-ratio in\nthis district is 3.0.\n(8)\nMaximum height is 60 feet in the district. However, the maximum height in the\ndistrict abutting property used or zoned for single family residential is 40 feet,\nexcept the height may exceed 40 feet if there is an increase in side and rear yards\nof one foot for every foot of building height over 40 feet up to the 60 feet\nmaximum.\nHeight requirements for other permitted structures are set forth in Section 12.108.\n(Petition No. 2014-098,$ 11.505(8), 11/17/2014)\n(9)\nThe NS district is exempt from the buffer regulations of Section 12.302, but must\nbe applicable screening requirement of Section 12.303.\n11 - 26\n\n\nNEW PAGE 519\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 6: HAZARDOUS WASTE DISTRICT\nSection 11.506.
