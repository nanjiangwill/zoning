Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"M-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Industrial\n(M-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Industrial (M-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Industrial (M-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Industrial\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft).

All parking spaces required in this chapter shall be setback at least five feet from any adjacent street\nright-of-way, and at least eight feet from the edge of the street when no right-of-way exists beyond the street. In no case shall the\nlocation of parking spaces obstruct the visibility of a sight triangle, nor shall they be allowed within any setback area unless granted\na variance by the Board of Adjustment.\n(2) Parking location in the Heritage District Overlay. Parking spaces shall be located to the side and/or rear of the associated\nbuildings they serve. Parking lots that serve as the principal use of a lot shall be exempt from this requirement; however, parking\nspaces should be setback a minimum of 15 feet so as not to be a dominant feature of the streetscape.\n(E) Designation of parking spaces. All parking spaces required in this chapter shall be marked or designated by painted lines or\nan equivalent in a paved parking lot, and by some permanent, fixed markers in unpaved lots.\n(F) Shared parking.\n(1) The owner or agent of a land use which requires off-street parking spaces in accordance with this section may be\npermitted to provide a portion of the required parking at an off-premises location (shared parking); provided, the owner or agent\ncan meet the following requirements.\n(a) In the C-2, C-1P and M-U Zoning Districts and where a mix of uses are incorporated into a minimum five-acre site, the\nrequired parking may be reduced by a maximum of 25% in recognition of shared parking that occurs in mixed use developments\nand then only on the approval of a conditional use permit.\n(b) All shared parking spaces shall be located within 400 feet of a public entrance of the principal structure incorporating the\nuse associated with the required parking, or within 400 feet of the lot on which the use associated with such parking is located if the\nuse is not within a principal building.\n(c) The shared area shall be located in a commercial zoning district.\n(d) The owner or agent requesting use of the shared parking provision shall provide written evidence that permission was\ngranted by the owner of the land to be used for shared parking. The written evidence shall specify the number of spaces provided\nin the shared parking area, and that the parking area meets the provisions of this chapter.\n(e) The owner or agent requesting the use of shared parking shall sign a statement accompanying the certificate of\ncompliance that the validity of the certificate is contingent upon the provision of the requisite number of parking spaces. Reduction\nof the number of required parking spaces or other violations of this section shall result in the revocation of the certificate of\ncompliance.\n(f) The shared parking area shall be identified with one sign that shall not exceed four square feet in area and four feet in\nheight.\n(2) In the C-2, C-1P and M-1 Zoning Districts and where a mix of uses are incorporated into a minimum of five feet from\nadjacent street right-of-way, and at least eight feet from the edge of the street when no right-of-way exists beyond the street. In no\ncase shall the location of parking spaces obstruct the visibility of a sight triangle.\n(G) Handicapped parking requirements. For all new and expanding developments which require new parking facilities,\nhandicapped parking shall be provided in accordance with requirements of the state's Building Code Volume I-C, as revised.\n(H) Driveways.\n(1) Driveways serving multi-family, commercial or industrial development shall be permitted in accordance with the standards\nof the state's Department of Transportation; provided, however, a commercial or industrial development shall be limited to no more\nthan two driveways on any one road and no more than three driveways total. Additional driveways may be permitted when\nreviewed by the Administrator and deemed that they are necessary to improve traffic movement, increase sight distances or for\nother safety reasons.\n(2) Developments shall share driveways with adjoining developments where possible. In addition, adjoining uses shall provide\nsafe and efficient access to neighboring parking areas so vehicular traffic and pedestrians can move directly to the adjoining use\nwithout first returning to the public right-of-way or street. Driveways as a means of the only ingress and egress shall be allowed in\nthe setback areas as determined in \u00a7 152.028 of this chapter.\n(I) Visibility at intersections. On a corner lot in any zoning district, no planting, structures, sign, fence, wall or obstruction to\nvision more than two and one-half feet in height measured from the centerline of the street shall be placed or maintained within the\ntriangular area formed by the intersecting street right-of-way lines and a straight line connecting points on said street right-of-way.\nThe sight triangle, as required by the state's Department of Transportation, is illustrated below; however, this sight triangle may be\nvaried by the Administrator on town and private streets as deemed necessary:\n(J) Parking of tractor trailers or semi-trailers for storage. At no time can a tractor trailer or semi-trailer be parked within view, with\nor without the truck or tractor, in any zoning district in the town for the purpose of storage of goods for retail, new or used.\nIndividual utility trailers may be used within the town as long as they are used for the specific purpose they were designed for.\n(Ord. passed 10-1-1990; Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 6-11-2007; Ord. passed 7-14-2008; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord.\npassed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 401)\n\u00a7 152.073 OFF-STREET LOADING AND UNLOADING SPACE REQUIRED.\n(A) Every lot on which a retail, service, trade, wholesale or industrial use is hereinafter established shall provide space as\n\nNEW PAGE 59\nindicated herein for the loading and unloading of vehicles off the street or public alley. Such space shall have access to an alley, or\nif there is no alley, to a street. For the purpose of this section, an off-street loading space shall have minimum dimensions of 12 feet\nby 40 feet.\n(B) Required space shall be considered as follows:\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 403)\nARCHITECTURAL DESIGN STANDARDS\n\u00a7 152.085 ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN STANDARDS.\nIt is the intent of this section to establish the architectural review standards of the previously adoptedTown of Banner Elk\nArchitectural Review Guidelines (1998). These standards shall apply to all new construction, expansions and/or additions of 50% of\nthe gross floor area of existing buildings or changes to exterior building facades for multifamily and non-residential development.\nSingle-family detached residential uses and individual duplexes are exempt from \u00a7\u00a7 152.085 through 152.090 of this chapter\n(unless \u00a7 152.089 of this chapter applies), as are changes considered maintenance and repairs to existing non-residential\nbuildings; maintenance and repair is defined as those changes that are considered upkeep and do not change the architectural\nappearance of the building. The architectural review standards shall hereby be incorporated as a reference to \u00a7\u00a7 152.085 through\n152.090 of this chapter, specifically with regard to illustrations.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 7-13-2015; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 500)\n\u00a7 152.086 SITE ASPECTS.\n(A) Relationship of a building to its site.\n(1) Building design shall be fitted to the natural contours of the site. Natural features of the site, such as rock outcroppings or\nnatural drainage ways shall be preserved.\n(2) On wooded sites, buildings shall be carefully situated to take advantage of the shade and energy conservation provided by\nthe trees.\n(3) The impression of buildings tucked into, rather than superimposed on, the natural landscape shall be created.\n(4) The view of the building from the street and surrounding areas shall be as important as the view available to the buildings\noccupants.\n(5) Buildings shall be located according to the natural characteristics of the site. In hilly terrain, clustering of buildings is\nencouraged as a strategy to avoid destroying sensitive natural areas.\n(6) Buildings shall be designed to harmonize with the existing topography, thereby minimizing land disruption.\n(7) Grading shall be held to a minimum and should complement natural land forms (such as smooth gradations or terracing).\n(8) Use of retaining walls over eight feet in height require design and certification by a state- registered engineer.\n(B) Relationships of the project to adjoining area.\n(1) Building projects shall not be designed as isolated units, but instead shall reflect the context of the adjoining properties.\n(2) Grading shall blend gently with contours of adjacent properties.\n(3) Buildings at the ends of streets, or at street corners, shall serve as visual \"terminals\". Serving to both unify and conclude\nthe architectural statement made on the street.\n(4) Proposed recreation areas or uses shall complement nearby existing uses. The extension of existing parks or recreation\nareas into a proposed development is a highly desirable design feature.\n(5) Buildings or projects located near or adjacent to a greenway shall provide safe and efficient pedestrian connection to that\ngreenway, and also to adjacent properties that might include pedestrian systems in the future.\n(6) Buffer zones shall separate and protect the greenway, while at the same time connect it to the building site.\n(7) Natural drainage patterns shall be preserved where possible. Changing the natural drainage areas will affect the drainage\nonto adjoining areas.\n(8) Innovative building and site design can capitalize on natural drainage ways and transform steep slopes into major site\namenities.\n(9) Design shall ensure that drainage occurs only in areas designed to serve a drainage function. Storm water should not flow\nover sidewalks, paths or streets.\nCELL (1, 1): \nRetail, service or trade business\nCELL (1, 2): \n1 space for each 5,000 sq. ft. of gross floor area\nCELL (2, 1): \nTruck terminals\nCELL (2, 2): \nSufficient space to accommodate the maximum number of\ntrucks to be stored or to be loaded or unloaded at the\nterminal at any one time\nCELL (3, 1): \nWholesale and industrial uses\nCELL (3, 2): \n1 space for each 10,000 sq. ft. of gross floor area\n\n\nNEW PAGE 60\n(C) Streetscape.\n(1) Scale is a major factor in creating a sense of community and a sense of place.\n(2) The ratio between the width of the street corridor (as measured between opposing building facades) and the height of the\n\"walls\" of that corridor (the foundation-to-eaves dimension) plays an important role in creating a human scale in the streetscape.\nThe most satisfactory ratio is generally a width that is two or three times the height of the defining walls or edges. If the width\nexceeds the height more than four times the sense of enclosure is diminished.\n(3) The town shall be focused on people rather than on vehicles. Streets shall be connections not separations.\n(4) Reference \"zones\" of \u00a7 6.3.1 of the Architectural Review Guidelines for explanation of zones and transition areas that shall\nbe addressed in the design of new streets.\nSubdivision in zones to experience transitions\n(5) Especially in the downtown area, and Heritage District Overlay, building faces shall have adequate setback from the street\nedge to allow for sidewalks where people may walk leisurely around meeting places. Public spaces between buildings (including\nroom for planting and street furniture) provide places for the pedestrian to rest and relax.\n(6) Between sidewalk and street, there shall be enough room to accommodate the planting of trees and shrubs (see \u00a7\u00a7\n152.130 through 152.137 and 152.150 through 152.170 of this chapter). The street will be enclosed, pedestrians will be separated\nfrom the cars and the view will be framed.\n(7) Street furniture should complement the overall site and landscape design. It shall reflect the natural mountain character of\nthe town, such as the use of wood and stone for benches, trash receptacles and the like.\n(D) Streets.\n(1) Difficult topography shall be avoided when locating and designing roads. For instance, roads are best placed along the\ncontours of a site if the site is hilly or steep. This minimizes fuel consumption and noise in automobiles and provides a more\ncomfortable access for pedestrians and bicycle riders. Consideration shall also be given to fire protection and emergency vehicles\nin order to facilitate access to any structure in case of any emergency.\n(2) Roadways shall focus attention on interesting views and should not interfere with natural drainage patterns.\n(3) The town uses the state's Department of Transportation Subdivision Roads Minimum Construction Standards to suggest\nparameters for new streets. These standards may need to be adjusted, especially in areas of difficult topography with steep slopes.\n(4) The site plan should incorporate a hierarchy of roadways and walkways that provide for safe, smooth and pleasant\nmovement of people and vehicles. Special attention shall be paid to points at which pedestrian, bicycle and automobile movements\nare in conflict. Clearly marked crosswalks or routing of pedestrian paths away from main automobile traffic areas can reduce\nhazards in these areas.\n(5) Whenever there is a design choice between access from the development to a street of a higher classification and access\nto a street of a lower classification, access should be to the street of lower classification.\n(6) On large streets, landscaped median islands are encouraged and crosswalks shall be included.\n(7) Trees, shrubs and other plants shall be planted along the streets in accordance with $$152.130 through 152.137 and\n152.150 through 152.170 of this chapter.\n(E) Sidewalks.\n(1) Building sites shall accommodate pedestrians and shall be centered around pedestrian traffic rather than vehicular traffic.\n(2) Access must be safe and convenient within a site. Sidewalks must be clearly separated from driving areas and must\nconnect buildings to each other, to parking areas and to adjacent pedestrian paths.\n(3) Handicapped accessibility along walkways at street/driveway intersections shall be provided whenever possible, per State\nBuilding Code specifications.\n(4) Sidewalk construction standards (including curb and gutter) shall follow the state'sDepartment of Transportation\nSubdivision Roads Minimum Construction Standards.\n(5) Walkways or sidewalks shall be provided along all public streets for commercial developments. Where intersections occur,\n\n\nNEW PAGE 61\npedestrian walkways shall be clearly marked with paint or contrasting surface material.\n(6) Sidewalks shall be designed to match the Town of Banner Elk Pedestrian Plan. Should it prove impractical or infeasible to\nconstruct on the property in question, then an equitable fee in lieu shall be paid to the Town of Banner Elk to be used in other areas\nof the Town's Pedestrian Plan. The fee shall be calculated by the linear footage of road frontage where the sidewalk should have\nbeen placed and the current rate to construct that amount of sidewalk shall be determined adequate by the Board of Adjustment.\n(7) The separation of sidewalks from the roadway for pedestrians safety will be achieved by:\n(a) Curbside planting strips;\n(b) Depressing or raising the walkway in relation to street level; and\n(c) Providing parking adjacent to the walkway (on-street parking) as an additional barrier.\n(8) Especially around areas with interesting natural features, sidewalks shall be curved, bending into adjoining lands, following\nthe natural contours.\n(9) Major commercial developments shall include a system for internal pedestrian movement. These internal walkways shall\nalso be linked with town-wide systems, particularly to greenways and parks.\n(10) Covered sidewalks are especially encouraged, as well as the development of public spaces with a pedestrian system like\ncourts and gardens.\n(11) Surfaces shall be constructed of brick when located within the Heritage District Overlay; other materials such as concrete\nmay be permitted in the other zoning districts.\n(12) Semi-pervious or pervious material as opposed to asphalt or concrete is especially desirable on sidewalks, to the extent\nthey do not diminish the accessibility of the pathway. If concrete is used, it should be textured or patterned with sections that shall\ninclude a brick pattern that matches the Banner Elk Pedestrian Plan.\n(F) Bicycles.\n(1) Bike lanes or sufficient room on the streets for bicyclists are very desirable. However, bike lanes do not have to parallel the\nstreet. Like sidewalks or walkways they should follow natural patterns.\n(2) Businesses and organizations should recognize the needs of cyclists who may bicycle to work. These cyclists need\nconvenient use of a bicycle rack.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 500)\n\u00a7 152.087 LIGHTING TRESPASS.\n(A) General.\n(1) Design and intensity of lighting shall be architecturally integrated with the building style, material and color. Lighting shall\nbe designed and located to ensure that excessive light spillage and glare, especially toward neighboring areas and motorists, are\navoided. All parking and street lighting provided shall be aimed downward and provide shield covers to direct light in such a\nmanner.\n(2) Down lighting shall be used to reinforce the circulation corridor. Pedestrian scale lights, such as ornamental poles, shall be\nused on sidewalks instead of street lights; street lights shall match existing town streetscape lights. Low light sources should be\nused on other walking paths and greenways.\n(B) Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or\nrequires a different meaning.\nFIXTURE. The assembly that holds the lamp (bulb) in the lighting system. It includes the elements designed to give light output\ncontrol, such as a reflector (mirror) or refractor (lens), the ballast, housing and the attachment parts.\nFLOODLIGHT. A luminaire or bulb which projects light in a specific direction in a wide beam, typically 100 degrees or more.\nFOOTCANDLE. The American unit used to measure the total amount of light cast upon a surface (illuminance). One footcandle\nis\nequivalent to the illuminance produced by a source of one candle at a distance of one foot. For example, the full moon produces\n.01 S. \"S\" are measured with a light meter.
