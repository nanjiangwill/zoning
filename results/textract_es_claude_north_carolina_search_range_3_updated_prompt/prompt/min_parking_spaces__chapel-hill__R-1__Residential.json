Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential\n(R-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Residential (R-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential (R-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

No. 2007-02-3a, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3; Ord. No. 2007-04-11/0-4, 1; Ord. No. 2020-10-28/0-10, \u00a7 8)\n3.5.2 Office/Institutional-4\n(a) Purpose and intent.\nThe purpose and intent of the office/institutional-4 district (OI-4) is to establish procedural and substantive standards for the town council's review and approval of development on large tracts of land\nwhere the predominant use is to be college, university, hospital, clinics, public cultural facilities, and related functions.\nThe objective of this section and the OI-4 district is to allow for growth and development while protecting the larger community, nearby neighborhoods, and the environment from impacts accompanying\nmajor new development. A key feature of this district is the preparation of a development plan that would allow the property owner, immediate neighbors, and the larger community to understand\nspecifically what levels of development are being proposed, and what impacts would likely accompany the development, so that mitigation measures can be designed and implemented.\n(b) Overview of Development Review Procedures.\nProcedures in this zoning district are designed to facilitate:\nArticulation of development plans that involve multiple buildings in multiple locations over an extended time period on a given tract of land, as defined in a development plan;\nIdentification of total infrastructure needs for such proposed development as specified in a development plan and cumulative impacts resulting from full development as specified in a\n10 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\n\nNEW PAGE 11\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\ndevelopment plan; and\nProvision of measures to mitigate the negative impacts, including off-site construction of parking decks as described in subsection (d)(2), phased in a manner appropriate with the pace of\nconstruction.\nTo this end, owners of property zoned OI-4 are encouraged to prepare detailed development plans, as described below, for review and approval by the town council. For buildings that are included in an\napproved development plan, site development permits for individual buildings are to be issued by the town manager, following a determination by the town manager that such individual building plans are\ngenerally consistent with the town council-approved development plan.\nFor development proposed within an OI-4 zoning district that is not included in a town council-approved development plan, but is a minor modification according to the provisions of subsection (j) of this\nsection, the town manager may approve a change to the development plan and issue a site development permit. For development proposed within an OI-4 zoning district that is not included in a town\ncouncil-approved development plan and that cannot be considered a minor modification to the plan according to subsection (j) of this section, such development shall be considered to be a special use, and\nsubject to the special use permit procedural requirements of section 4.5 of this appendix. In the alternative, the applicant may apply to the town council for an amendment to the development plan.\nOnce a property is zoned office/institutional-4, all regulations, standards, and procedures prescribed for the previously-applicable zoning district shall apply until (1) a development plan is approved; or\n(2) six (6) months have elapsed, whichever comes first.\n(c) Concept plan review. Prior to submittal of a development plan or modification of development plan, a concept plan review shall be conducted by the Town Council. It is the intent of the\nconceptual development plan process to provide an opportunity for the Town Council, Town Manager and citizens to review and evaluate the impact of the proposed development on the\ncharacter of the area in which it is proposed to be located.\n(1) Submittal requirements. Applications for conceptual development plan review shall be filed with the Town Manager. The Town Manager shall prescribe the form(s) on which information shall\nbe submitted. Application submittal requirements shall include the following:\nA. Descriptions of proposed development with building locations, building sizes, parking arrangements, and description of building heights with consideration of impact on adjacent areas.\n(d) Development Plan.\nA development plan shall address issues such as general location and size of new facilities, parking, utilities, stormwater management, impervious surface, and access/circulation. A development plan\nshall identify the general location, size, and proposed uses of buildings. A development plan shall project anticipated impacts on streets, water and sewer facilities, stormwater runoff, air quality, noise, and\nlighting.\n(1) Submittal requirements. Application submittal requirements shall include the following:\nA. Specific descriptions of proposed development with building locations, building sizes, parking arrangements, and description of building heights with consideration of impact on adjacent\nareas.\nB. Analysis of impacts resulting from proposed development, along with options to mitigate impacts relating to:\nTransportation management (traffic, transit, parking, bikes, pedestrians, air quality);\nStormwater management analysis (quantity and quality); and\nNoise and lighting analysis.\nIndividual effects must be evaluated in the context of the whole development plan and not in isolation. Impacts shall be evaluated in accordance with guidelines endorsed for use by the town\ncouncil.\nC. Preliminary timetable and sequencing schedule for building construction and for related mitigation measures.\n(2) Off-site components. Mitigation measures involving construction of parking decks may need to be developed outside the boundaries of the development plan. Notwithstanding any other\nprovision of this Land Use Management Ordinance, a parking deck proposed to mitigate impacts of a development plan, and approved by the town council as part of a development plan, may\nbe located on a site not within the boundaries of an OI-4 zoning district. Any such facility shall be reviewed as a site development permit according to the provisions of subsection (i)(2) of this\nsection.\n(e) Permitted uses and development intensities.\nPermitted uses shall be identical with uses listed in the use matrix (section 3.7) as being permitted in OI-3, except that place of assembly shall be considered to be a permitted use and not a special use.\nThe maximum floor area allowed shall be as provided in a development plan that is approved by the town council. Special restrictions apply in perimeter transition areas (see subsection (g)).\nFor purposes of calculating compliance with a specified maximum floor area, the following land uses shall not be counted as floor area: new residential development (including Dwellings and residence\nhalls), and new public cultural facilities.\n(f) Standards.\nDevelopment in the OI-4 zoning district shall be designed in a manner that provides a mix of uses which are integrated, interrelated and linked by pedestrian ways, bikeways, and other transportation\nsystems. Development plans shall, as practical and consistent with applicable laws and regulations, include measures to encourage reduction of automobile use and promote alternative modes of\ntransportation; to mitigate adverse environmental impacts; to promote conservation of non-renewable energy resources; and to achieve visual continuity in the siting and scale of buildings. Specifically, a\ndevelopment plan shall address the following:\n(1) Noise: Noise levels from development proposed in the development plan shall not exceed those allowed by the Town of Chapel Hill Noise Ordinance.\n(2) Environment: Development proposed in the development plan shall minimize impacts on natural site features, and be accompanied by measures to mitigate those impacts.\n(3) Transportation: Development proposed in the development plan shall be accompanied by measures to mitigate transportation impacts that are caused by the development.\n(4) Stormwater management: Development proposed in the development plan shall be accompanied by measures to mitigate stormwater impacts (quantity and quality) that are caused by the\ndevelopment.\n(5) Public utilities: There shall be a general demonstration that water, sewer, and other needed utilities can be made available to accommodate development proposed in the development plan.\n(6) Historic districts: The provisions of section 3.6.2 of this appendix shall apply to any development proposed within one of Chapel Hill's Historic Districts.\n(g) Perimeter transition areas.\nA development plan shall designate a perimeter transition area establishing appropriate standards at borders of the development plan, necessary to minimize impacts of development proposed in\nthe development plan on adjacent property, to be approved by the town council as part of the development plan. Standards shall address:\n(1) Screening mechanical equipment,\n(2) Exterior lighting,\n(3) Height limits,\n(4) Landscaping.\n(h) Procedures for approval of development plans.\n11 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\n\n Output:"}]}
