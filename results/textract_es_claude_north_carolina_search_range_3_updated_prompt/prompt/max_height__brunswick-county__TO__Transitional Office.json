Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Transitional Office\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"TO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Transitional Office\n(TO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Transitional Office (TO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Transitional Office (TO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Transitional Office\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Districts\nA. C-LD: Commercial-Low Density\nThis District is intended primarily to be used in outlying areas, adjacent to major thoroughfares, with yards and other provisions for reducing\nconflicts with adjacent residential uses, and with substantial setbacks to reduce marginal friction on adjacent major thoroughfares. Commercial\nuses in this District will serve the needs of residential neighborhoods for auto-dependent commercial facilities; and serve the needs of highway\noriented tourist business.\nB. N-C: Neighborhood-Commercial\nThe N-C, Neighborhood-Commercial District is primarily intended to accommodate very low intensity office, retail and personal service uses\nwithin and adjoining residential areas. The district is established to provide convenient locations for businesses which serve the needs of\nsurrounding residents, including low intensity office, retail, and personal service uses, without disrupting the character of the neighborhood.\nCompatibility with nearby residences is reflected in design standards for both site layout and buildings. In addition, uses in the N-C District will\nhave minimal infrastructure demands.\nC. C-I: Commercial-Intensive\nThe C-I District is intended for uses which require close access to major highways. Anticipated uses include those which are necessary to service\nmore intensive commercial and industrial districts, such as warehousing, storage, moving, service and repair, distribution, wholesaling,\nmarketing of specialty goods and light manufacturing plants.\n4.5.2. Permitted Uses in Commercial Districts\nOnly uses specifically listed in the use table in Section 5.2 as a permitted (\"P\"), permitted subject to limited use standards (\"L\"), or permitted subject\nto special use permit (\"SUP\") shall be permitted in Commercial districts.\n4.5.3. Development Standards\nA. Applicability\nThe following standards shall apply to all development within a Commercial zoning district.

RU-I: Industrial-Rural\n1. This District is intended to accommodate uses on lands which have not been in productive agricultural or farm use in the previous five year\nperiod. Also, this District is intended to be applied only on lands not anticipated to become urban or suburban by the Land Use Plan, and\nwhich are not wetlands or environmentally sensitive lands. This District is intended to provide areas for uses of open air or extensive rather\nthan intensive character such as:\ni. Agricultural industry;\nii.\nRepositories for waste products whose composition and features require they be removed from other Zoning Districts;\niii.\nChemical extraction or energy generation from crops or woods or the wastes of same, or conversion of crops, woods, and animals to\nvarious products of use to society; and\niv. Animal slaughtering and processing operations and even incineration of animal remains.\n2. This District is intended to be used in an extremely limited manner sufficient only to meet proven needs for such generally adverse uses.\n3. Such land uses require restriction of other uses such as residential, institutional, commercial, and manufacturing where there are\nconcentrations of persons likely at any given time.\nCommentary: The Sunny Point Military Ocean Terminal's buffer zone is an illustration of how man would be expected to be limited in\naccessibility or closeness to uses in this District.\nB.

Brunswick County has numerous waterways, marshes, Carolina Bays, pocosins, and other water courses that contribute to the County's\nscenic character and serve as a reminder of the important place these water courses hold in the County's history.\n2. The water courses are also an important natural resource and amenity to residents of and visitors to Brunswick County, and the scenic views\nassociated with these watercourses are an important attraction to residents and visitors to Brunswick County, which in large part is\neconomically dependent upon tourism.\n3.\nThe intent of the Viewshed Protection Overlay is to protect and enhance the scenic character of Brunswick County's riparian areas and water\ncourses, with the broader goal of ensuring the preservation of views from within these scenic areas as well as views of these areas from\nadjacent lands.\nB. Designation of Viewshed Protection Overlay\n1. A Viewshed Protection Overlay may only be established as a zoning map change in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.8,\nRezoning.\n2. The ordinance adopting the overlay district shall clearly designate the name and geographic limits of the watercourse to be protected (i.e.\ncan't just say Intercoastal Waterway, it must specify the extents of the district along the length of the watercourse).\n3. The following watercourses are designated (VS) Viewshed Protection Overlays:\nC. Applicability\n1. Generally, the requirements of this Viewshed Protection Overlay District apply to all structures within 300 feet of the normal high water line\nof a designated watercourse.\n2. However, the Planning Director may waive these requirements for structures related to an industrial use that is located in the RU-I or I-G\nzoning districts.\n3. These requirements shall not apply to water oriented commercial uses (see Section 5.1.4.)).\nD. Development Standards\n1. Portions of structures facing a protected watercourse that exceed 50 feet in height shall be set back a minimum of two feet for each\nadditional one foot in height above 50 feet.

With the exception of Water Oriented Commercial Uses (see Section 5.1.4.J), and permitted height obstructions (see Section 5.4.13.C) the\nmaximum height of any structure may not exceed 75 feet.\n4.8.8. WQP: Water Quality Protection\nA. Purpose and Intent\n1. It is the intent of Brunswick County to bolster those regulations of state and federal government as to the unique quality of the water of the\nLockwood Folly River associated with naturally occurring shellfish beds.\n2. The quality of these defined waters has been affected by such activities as forestry, farming, construction of roads, growth of towns, and\nrural and suburban residential development, as well as industrial processes associated with the fishing industry.\n3. Numerous types of water pollutants have been identified by state studies. No one or even several types or causes of such degradation have\nbeen determined as having more impact than any other.\n59 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\nCELL (1, 1): \nWatercourse\nCELL (1, 2): \nFrom\nCELL (1, 3): \nTo\nCELL (2, 1): \nName\nCELL (2, 2): \nLocation\nCELL (2, 3): \nLocation\nCELL (3, 1): \nIntracoastal Waterway (IWW)\nCELL (3, 2): \nBorder with New Hanover County\nCELL (3, 3): \nSouth Carolina State Line\nCELL (4, 1): \nLockwood Folly River\nCELL (4, 2): \nGenoes Point to Mullet Creek\nCELL (4, 3): \nTo and across the Intracoastal Water to\nSheep Island\nCELL (5, 1): \nTown Creek\nCELL (5, 2): \nUS Hwy 17\nCELL (5, 3): \nNC 133\nCELL (6, 1): \nShallotte River\nCELL (6, 2): \nUnincorporated Areas of Brunswick County\nCELL (6, 3): \n\n\nNEW PAGE 60\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n4. The intent of this Water Quality Protection District is to apply a set of regulations for water quality protection, to specifically described areas\nof land abutting a specifically described water area; which is encompassed by a line drawn to extend across the Lockwood Folly River from\nGenoe's Point to Mullet Creek, southly to and across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway.\nB. Applicability\n1. The requirements and standards of the WQP- Water Quality Protection Overlay shall apply to all lands shown on a special Zoning Overlay\nMap made a part of this District, whereby all land parcels of public record included are clearly shown. This District includes an area extending\n575' landward of the mean high water line, with any lot or parcel falling within such distance being included entirely within this overlay zone.\n2. Parcels smaller than one acre in size shall be exempt from the requirements of this Section.\n3. Such waters have been defined by the State as being those waters south from a line extending from Genoes Point to Mullet Creek, to and\nacross the Intracoastal Water to Sheep Island.\nC. Incorporation of Studies by Reference\n1. Among the specific studies establishing the WQP District have been the March, 1989 publication entitled \"Report on Coastal Resource Waters\n- Intensive Study,\" by the Division of Environmental Management, N.C. Department of Natural Resources and Community Development, and\nthe August, 1989, publication entitled \"Lockwood Folly River Basin Water Quality Evaluation Report.\" Those studies are included by reference.\n2. The State of North Carolina has concluded the quality of the waters within the boundaries of the District had so declined there could be no\nassurance the proposed regulations would result in the goal of these waters being open full seasons for shell fishing. The Environmental\nManagement Commission did, under N.C. Administrative Code, Subordinance 2B, Surface Water Standards, Monitoring, Section .0219, Water\nQuality Management Plans, sub-section (b) establish a defined area of the mouth of this river, as above described, to be protected by a\nWater Quality Management Plan with specific actions which became effective January 1, 1990, included herein by reference.\nD. Application Requirements\nApplications for all development meeting the applicability requirements in the paragraph above shall require an approved Sedimentation\nErosion Control Plan be filed.\nE. Development Standards\nAll development within a WQP- Water Quality Protection Overlay shall:\n1. Limit the built upon impervious area to no more than 25% of the lot;\n2. Provide a buffer zone of at least 30' from any wetland or water line;\n3. Limit any structures to being at least 75' from the mean high water line; and\n4. Comply with any additional standards imposed by State or Federal regulations.\n4.9 VOLUNTARY AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT PROGRAM\nCommentary: The Voluntary Agricultural District is not an overlay zoning district, and is not implemented in the same was as a zoning district would\nbe.\n4.9.1.

However, increases in height of up to 20% may be allowed by Board of Adjustment as part of\nthe special use permit approval with a certification by a registered engineer that the setbacks provide adequate fall area in case\nof a tower collapse.\n(5) Mitigation of an existing WTF (see paragraph 6 \"Mitigation\" on page 5-50). The maximum height of a new WTF arising from\nmitigation shall not exceed 125% of the height of the tallest WTF that is being mitigated.\n(b) Setbacks\n(1) Attached WTF: The building or structure to which the WTF will be attached shall maintain the normal setbacks of the district.\n(2) Freestanding Concealed WTF: In the N-C district and all residential districts, setbacks shall be determined according to the\nunderlying zoning district, plus an additional six inches for every one-foot of tower height. In all other districts, setbacks for WTFs\nshall be determined according to the underlying zoning district.\n(3) Freestanding Nonconcealed WTF: Setbacks for WTFs shall be determined according to the underlying zoning district, plus an\nadditional six inches of setback (on each side) for every one-foot of tower height. The Board of Adjustment may approve\nreductions to this setback requirement as a part of the special use permit approval with a certification by a registered engineer\nthat the resulting setbacks provide adequate fall area in case of a tower collapse.\n(4)\nMitigation of an existing WTF: A new WTF approved as mitigation shall not be required to meet setback requirements so long as\nthe new WTF is no closer to any property lines or dwelling units as the WTF being mitigated.\nCommentary: Refer to Section 4.3.3.B for the underlying zoning district setbacks for WTFs proposed in residential zoning districts. See\nSection 4.5.3.B for the underlying zoning district setbacks in commercial zoning districts. See Section 4.6.3.B for the underlying zoning\ndistrict setbacks in industrial zoning districts.\n(c) Buffers\n(1) A landscaped buffer shall surround the base of the WTF equipment compound. Existing trees and shrubs on the site should be\npreserved and may be used in lieu of required landscaping where approved by the Planning Director. Grading shall be minimized\nand limited only to the area necessary for the new WTF.\n(2) If the proposed WTF is the principal use of the property then landscaping per Section 6.2, Landscaping and Buffering, shall apply.\nAdditionally, when a freestanding nonconcealed WTF is located in a residential district, a buffer with opacity 0.8 (80%) shall be\nprovided around the WTF equipment compound.\n(3) If the proposed WTF is to be located in front of an existing structure on the same lot, a street buffer (see Section 6.3.2.A) shall also\nbe required.\niv. Aesthetics\n(a) Stealth attached WTFs, including feed lines and antennae, shall be designed so as to be compatible with the facade, roof, wall or\nstructure on which it is affixing so that it matches the existing structural design, color and texture.\n(b)\nFreestanding WTFs shall be designed so as to be compatible with neighboring structures and landscapes to the extent feasible with\nspecific design considerations as to height, scale, color and texture.\n(c) Commercial messages may not be displayed on any WTF.\n4. Application Requirements\nIn addition to all of the requirements of Section 3.2, Site Plan Review, and Section 3.5, Special Use Permit (if required), the following\ninformation must be supplied with the site plan and special exception permit (if required) application for WTFs:\n125 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\n\n Output:"}]}
