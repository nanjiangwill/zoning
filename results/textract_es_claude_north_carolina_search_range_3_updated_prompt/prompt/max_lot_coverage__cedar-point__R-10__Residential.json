Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-10\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential\n(R-10) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Residential (R-10). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential (R-10)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage refers solely to the maximum lot coverage of buildings for primary use and all accessory structures. Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

The Town Manager or\nhis/her designee shall utilize such professional criteria and technical assistance as\ndeemed necessary to maintain continual growth of plantings.\nF. LANDSCAPING FOR OTHER COMMERCIAL CHANGES\n1.\nFor changes in use, expansions to existing commercial principal structures, or for\nrenovations to existing commercial principal structures, Table 7.4-1 shall be\nutilized in calculating the minimum amount of landscaping required for the\nPage 136\n\n\nNEW PAGE 137\npreviously developed portions of the site. All newly developed portions of the site\nshall be subject to the full landscaping requirements of this section.\n2. When division of previously developed property occurs and a building permit for\nnew construction is requested for any newly created tract within two (2) years of\nthe effective date of the recordation, all parcels of the original tract shall be subject\nto the above provisions for expansions to existing structures or uses.\n3. For consecutive expansion occurring within a two-year period, the amount of the\nexpansions shall be summed and the maximum landscaping requirements for the\ntotal extent of the expansions shall be provided.\n4. Notwithstanding the above requirements, expansions to existing structures or uses\namounting to not more than a total increase of five hundred (500) square feet in\ngross floor area over a two-year period shall be exempted from meeting the street-\nyard and parking facility landscaping requirements.\n5.\nWhere the street yard depth requirement listed in Table 7.4-1 cannot be complied\nwith due the presence of an existing building not proposed for removal, only the\narea where the building exists is exempt from the requirement specified.\nPage\nI\n137\nCELL (1, 1): \nTable 7.4-1\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCommercial Change\nCELL (2, 2): \nTree\nPreservation\nCELL (2, 3): \nStreet Yard\nDepth\nCELL (2, 4): \nParking Facilities Landscaping\n(% of gross paved area of\nparking facility)\nCELL (3, 1): \nChange in use, 10-25% increase in gross\nfloor area or 5-20 new parking spaces as\nrequired by zoning ordinance, whichever is\nmore restrictive\nCELL (3, 2): \n15/acre\nCELL (3, 3): \n10 feet\nCELL (3, 4): \n4%\nCELL (4, 1): \n26-50% increase in gross floor area; or over\n10,000 sq. ft. increase in gross floor area; or\n21-50 new parking spaces as required by\nzoning ordinance, whichever is more\nrestrictive.\nCELL (4, 2): \n15/acre\nCELL (4, 3): \n12 feet\nCELL (4, 4): \n6%\nCELL (5, 1): \nGreater than 50% increase in gross floor\narea; or over 20,000 sq. ft. increase in gross\nfloor area; or more than 50 new parking\nspaces required by zoning ordinance,\nwhichever is more restrictive\nCELL (5, 2): \n15/acre\nCELL (5, 3): \n15 feet\nCELL (5, 4): \n8%\n\n\nNEW PAGE 138\nG.
