Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Industrial-Rural\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"RU-I\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Industrial-Rural\n(RU-I) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Industrial-Rural (RU-I). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Industrial-Rural (RU-I)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Industrial-Rural\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Planned Development is generally larger scale projects to ensure sufficient open space can be\nincorporated into the development design. The Planned Development option provides increased design flexibility with varied development and\nhousing types, provided certain enhancements are incorporated into the design of the project.\nB. Conventional Development\nConventional development is a pattern of development that conforms with standard dimensional requirements and typically provides a majority\nof property owners with substantial area on their own property.\nDEVELOPMENT TYPES\nCONVENTIONAL\nPLANNED DEVELOPMENT\nExample Lot Yield: 308 Lots\nExample Lot Yield: 308 Lots\n4.3.1. Planned Development\nA. Intent\nThe intent of a Planned Development (PD) is to promote quality development by providing flexibility in the mixture of uses and in meeting\ndimensional and other requirements of this Ordinance. A PD utilizes exceptional design and best management practices that result in\ndevelopment that is aesthetically pleasing, promotes environmental sensitivity and makes more efficient use of the land, resulting in increased\nopen space.\nB. Planned Development Approval\nPlanned Development projects shall be approved in accordance with the Planned Development approval process found in Section 3.3.3 and the\nsite plan requirements as outlined in Article 3.\nC. Development Intensity\nThe building area coverage and number of dwelling units in a project utilizing the PD development standards shall be calculated as follows:\n1. The building area coverage shall be the dimensional standards of the applicable zoning District (i.e., R-7500, C-LD, etc.). However, the\ndeveloped area may be increased as a result of utilizing exceptional design and/or best management practices as provided in Section 6.1,\nDesign Flexibility. The extent of the allowable increase will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Planning Director (minor site plans)\nor the Planning Board (major site plans) in relation to the extent of the successful use of exceptional design and best management practices\nin the project site plan.\n2. The allowable number of dwelling units in a project shall be determined by dividing the gross site area of the development project by the\nnumber of dwelling units (density) permitted in the underlying district.\nCommentary: For example, the density for R-6000 with water and sewer is 7.3. The allowable number of units for a PD project with 20 acres\nwith an underlying R-6000 district would be up to 143 units, provided all other requirements were satisfied.\n3. Increases in the number of dwelling units permitted in a project may be considered through the density bonus provisions in this article.\nCommentary: There is no guarantee that the maximum density can be achieved on a particular site due to consideration such as required\nopen space, site area devoted to easements or roadways, and other site specific issues.\nD. Uses Permitted within Planned Developments\nUses permitted in the underlying district are permitted in Planned Developments. For residential development, the type of dwellings proposed\n(e.g., single family, multi-family, cottage style, cluster, etc.) shall be approved in conjunction with the PD approval. Mixed use projects are\nencouraged within residential and commercial Planned Developments to reduce travel and maximize the use of land. In residential districts,\n43 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\nNEW PAGE 51\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nNotes:\n1\nIn cases where a Street Side Yard is required, the minimum interior side yard is equal to the One Yard dimension.\n2 Structures exceeding 30 feet or three stories in height shall provide at least three means of fire apparatus access. North Carolina\nBuilding Codes apply. Structures above 75 feet subject to Fire Marshal approval.\n3\nThe \"Total Side Yard\" requirement is the sum of both side yards, added together. The \"One Yard\" requirement is the smallest that one of\nthe yards has to be. In order to provide flexibility, side yard requirements are sometimes presented as \"One Yard\" and \"Total Side Yard.\"\nThis approach allows the owner or developer to move the house a little to one side of the lot or the other to preserve trees, add driveways,\nor other things. It also reduces the number of variances.\n4 Additional Building Height above the maximum up to 75 feet is allowed by right and above 75 feet with the Planning Board approval at\nthe following rates:\nNon-Viewshed Protection Overlay areas at a rate of one additional foot of height for every one foot of additional yard depth (front, rear,\nand sides);\nViewshed Protection Overlay (see Section 4.8.7) areas at a rate of one additional foot of height for every two foot of additional yard\ndepth (front, rear, and sides).\n(Ord.

Yards\nRequired front, rear, and side yards abutting streets may be used for parking shelters and lighting devices, provided that visibility across a\nrequired front yard or side yard abutting a street shall not be impeded between the heights of 3 feet and 8 feet, and provided further, no signs\nshall be permitted in any required yard. Where this District borders a Residential District, including across streets, walls shall be provided so that\nno lights from automotive or other sources on commercial premises shall shine into windows in the Residential District, and no rear or side\nservice areas on commercial premises shall be visible from the ground within Residential Districts. No structure (excluding fences or walls) shall\nbe erected nearer than six feet to any Residential District boundary.\n4.5.5. Residential Structures in Commercial Zoning Districts\nResidential development in a commercial district may be permitted as a primary use in accordance with the Use Table in Section 5.2, subject to the\nstandards and requirements applicable to the district in which it is located. Residential uses serving as an accessory structure or use to a\nnonresidential primary use shall comply with the standards set forth in Section 4.4.3, Accessory Structures and Uses.\nA.

Building Separation\nWhere more than one residential or mixed commercial-residential building is located upon a single lot, the building spacing provisions of Section\n4.13.5 shall apply.\nC. Multifamily and Mixed Commercial-Residential Buildings\nThe residential density shall be based only on that portion of the structure(s) dedicated to the residential use.\nCommentary: For example, if 75% of a mixed building is to be utilized for residential purposes then 75% of the lot area will be used in calculating\nthe residential density permitted.\nD. Open Space\nOpen space requirements for the residential portion of a multifamily or mixed commercial-residential project shall be the same and conform to\nthe requirements for multifamily developments in the MR-3200 district.\n4.5.6.
