Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Planned Development\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"PD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Planned Development\n(PD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Planned Development (PD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Planned Development (PD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Planned Development\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

SETBACKS FROM RIGHTS OF WAY\nI. PREVAILING STREET SETBACK\nWhere 50 percent or more of the lots in a recorded subdivision on the same side of the\nstreet as the lot in question are developed with less than the required street setbacks\nfor the zoning district where located, the average street setback of the two principal\nbuildings nearest that lot shall be observed as the required minimum street setback.\nII. FROM PLANNED BUT NOT COMPLETED STREETS\nWhere proposed street alignments are established in the County's adopted policy\nguidance, street setbacks shall be measured from the future or ultimate right-of-way\nline of the proposed street.\nIII. FROM PRIVATE STREETS\nStreet setbacks from private streets shall be measured from the edge of the platted\nprivate street right-of-way, platted private street easement, or from the centerline of the\nstreet if no right-of-way or easement is platted. When measuring from the centerline of\na private street, the minimum setback distance shall be increased by an amount equal\nto one-half of the minimum right-of-way width associated with a public street of the\nsame street classification in Section $6.4, Infrastructure.\n5. STREET SETBACKS ON FLAG LOTS\nStreet setbacks on flag lots are determined from the lot line at the end of the 'flagpole' lying\ngenerally parallel to the road to which the flagpole connects. The 'flagpole' portion of the\nlot shall not be used to calculate building setbacks.\n6. ZERO LOT LINE OPTION\nDevelopment comprised of single-family detached dwellings may be configured with zero\nlot lines in accordance with the following standards:\ni. The development shall be served by public sewer;\nii. The development includes at least ten contiguous lots;\niii. Zero setbacks are proposed only on lots bounded on both sides by lots located within\nthe development employing the zero-lot line option;\niv. The lot abutting a lot using a zero-lot line option includes a maintenance easement of at\nleast five feet if the adjacent structure is one-story tall and ten feet if the adjacent\nstructure is two or more stories in height;\nV. Only one of the two side lot lines is configured with the zero-lot line option; and\nvi. The side lot line on the opposite side of the lot is at least twice the minimum side\nsetback distance.\nD.\nYARDS\n1. The land area between a lot line and the boundary of a required setback is considered as a\nrequired yard.\n2. The location of front, side, street, or rear yards on irregularly shaped lots shall be\ndetermined by the Zoning Administrator. Wherever possible, the Zoning Administrator\nshall interpret these boundaries in ways that minimize nonconformities.\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage\n141\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n\nNEW PAGE 239\nARTICLE 4.
