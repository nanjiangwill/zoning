Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Agriculture\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"AG\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Agriculture\n(AG) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Agriculture (AG). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Agriculture (AG)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Agriculture\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

No unlicensed motor vehicle shall be permitted outside of any premises (i.e., on\nthe street).\n(3.) Vehicles described in paragraphs (1) and (2) are not permitted to be located\nwithin any established setback or any established side yards which abut a street or\nany required side yards as mandated by these regulations or any street right-of\nway. If stored in the rear yard, the vehicle(s) must be a minimum of five (5) feet\noff the rear property line.\n(4.) Vehicles described in paragraphs (1) and (2) are not permitted on vacant or\nundeveloped parcels.\n(5.) Vehicles described in paragraphs (1) and (2) are not permitted on public streets or\npublic right of way.\n12.4 Access\nAll parking, stacking, and loading facilities shall have paved vehicular access to a public\nstreet in accordance with Article 2, Section 2.17 of this Ordinance. Exception is made for\nsingle family residential dwellings in the AG district beyond the public road right-of-\nway.\n12.5\nUse for No Other Purpose\nLand used to provide required parking, stacking, and loading shall not be used for any\nother purposes, except for temporary events. Use of land designated for and providing\nparking, loading, and/or stacking for other purposes shall be considered a violation of this\nOrdinance and subject to the penalty provisions of Article 23.\n12.6\nRequirements for Change in Use\nIf a change in use causes an increase in the required number of off-street parking,\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 12 - Page 3\n\n\nNEW PAGE 306\nstacking, or loading spaces, such additional spaces shall be provided in accordance with\nthe requirements of this Ordinance; except that if the change in use would require an\nincrease of less than five percent (5%) in the required number of parking spaces or fewer\nthan five (5) spaces, no additional off-street parking shall be required.\n12.7\nAccessible Spaces\nAccessible spaces for the physically handicapped shall be provided as required by the\nNorth Carolina Building Code.\n12.8\nBicycle Parking\nAll non-residential uses, except agricultural and agricultural based businesses, and all\nmulti-family residential uses, including condos and townhomes with shared parking, shall\ninclude bicycle parking spaces in the amount, at a minimum, equal to 5% of the parking\nspaces required for automobiles. This area may be a designated parking space within\nthe\nparking lot near the building or an area outside the parking lot adjacent to the building.\nThe bike parking area must include bike rack(s) and/or locker(s).\n12.9\nOverflow Parking\nOff-street areas used for special event parking (to accommodate occasional overflow\nvolumes) may be used with pervious ground cover where such cover can sustain the\ntraffic and use volumes; but if not, these areas shall be constructed of any dust-free,\ncompacted, pervious ground cover where levels of use exceed the pervious material's\ncapability to maintain a dust free condition. The owner of the property shall be\nresponsible for the maintenance of such parking in a clean and dust-free condition. Grass\nand mulch are examples of pervious ground cover; gravel and pavement are examples of\nimpervious surfaces.\n12.10 Parking of Over Size Vehicles in Residential Districts\nIn order to maintain both safety and the visual appeal of residential areas, over size\nvehicles such as recreational vehicles (RV's), water craft and accessories, towing trailers,\nand commercial vehicles, as per Section 12.3-9, shall not be parked or stored on the street\nin residential districts. RV's shall be licensed motor vehicles in order to be occupied and\nremain on a lot for up to ninety (90) days, but not more than twice per year.\n12.11 Off-Street Parking Lots and Access Areas for Non-residential Development\nOff-street parking is required to meet the needs of the employees, clients, and/or\ncustomers of the principal use. Due to the potential for parking areas to use a large\npercentage of a development site, efforts should be made to accurately estimate the\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 12 - Page\n4\n\n\nNEW PAGE 307\nparking needs of the principal use. Strategies such as shared parking and remote parking\nshould be used to maximize the use of existing parking available in the area in which a\nuse is to be located. Parking areas shall be designed to minimize breaks in the pedestrian\nenvironment along the public street and create safe and comfortable passage for\npedestrians. The following standards shall therefore be met.\n12.11-1\nLocation of Parking Lots. Parking lots shall be placed behind buildings where\npractical; persons who wish to vary from this standard will have to appeal to the\nPlanning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator. Side of the building parking will be\npermitted only as indicated by Building Type and shall be measured along the build-\nto line. Off-street parking is not permitted in front of the primary building facade,\nexcept where specified in an adopted street section, detailed as a public plaza, or as\napproved by the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator as part of site plan\nreview and approval.\n12.11-2\nLimitation on Uninterrupted Areas of Parking. Uninterrupted areas of parking lot\nshall be limited in size. Large parking lots shall be broken by buildings and/or\nlandscape features. See Figure 12.11-2 below:\nFigure 12.11-2: Example of parking lot broken up by landscaping.\n12.11-3\nEnclosure of Parking Lots. Parking lots shall be enclosed by tree planting and/or\nbuilding walls(s). Plantings shall be in accordance with the provisions of Article 11,\nsee 11.6-4.
