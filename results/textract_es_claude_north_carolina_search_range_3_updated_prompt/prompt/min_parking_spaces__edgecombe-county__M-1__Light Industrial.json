Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Light Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"M-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Light Industrial\n(M-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Light Industrial (M-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Light Industrial (M-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Light Industrial\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

The buffer type is indicated by a letter corresponding to one of the\nthree buffer types described in Table 6.5.9.C, Perimeter Buffer Configuration.\nTABLE 6.5.9.D: BUFFER APPLICATION\nNOTES:\n[1] Development in PD district is subject to the perimeter buffer configurations proposed in the\napplicable planned development master plan.\n[2] A Type A or B perimeter buffer shall not be required when the lot line abuts unbuildable land within\na riparian buffer, a designated tree-save area, or other County-designated conservation area where\nexisting vegetation will not be removed.\n[3] In cases where a Type C perimeter buffer is required but the lot line abuts unbuildable land within a\nriparian buffer or other County-designated conservation area where existing vegetation will not be\nremoved, the required perimeter buffer width and amount of required landscaping material may be\nreduced by 50 percent (see Table 6.5.9.C, Perimeter Buffer Configuration).\n[4] Lot lines abutting arterial or collector street rights-of-way shall be subject to the standards in Section\n6.5.10, Streetscape Buffers.\n[5] A Type A buffer shall be provided along all lot lines bordering the County's jurisdiction.\nH.\nEXEMPTIONS\nUnified developments are subject to the standards in Section $6.14, Unified Developments.\nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nLAST AMENDED\nUnified Development Ordinance\nPage 392\n5.2.22\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (1, 6): \nCELL (1, 7): \nCELL (2, 1): \nZONING\nDISTRICT OF\nCELL (2, 2): \nZONING DISTRICT OF LAND ADJACENT TO PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT\nCELL (2, 3): \nZONING DISTRICT OF LAND ADJACENT TO PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT\nCELL (2, 4): \nZONING DISTRICT OF LAND ADJACENT TO PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT\n12/13/14/5/\nCELL (2, 5): \nZONING DISTRICT OF LAND ADJACENT TO PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT\nCELL (2, 6): \nZONING DISTRICT OF LAND ADJACENT TO PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT\nCELL (2, 7): \nZONING DISTRICT OF LAND ADJACENT TO PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT\nCELL (3, 1): \nDEVELOPING\nLAND\n/1/\nCELL (3, 2): \nAR-30\nCELL (3, 3): \nR-30 &\nR-20\nCELL (3, 4): \nR-10\nCELL (3, 5): \nOI &\nB-1\nCELL (3, 6): \nB-2 &\nM-1\nCELL (3, 7): \nM-2\nCELL (4, 1): \nAR-30\nCELL (4, 2): \nNone\nCELL (4, 3): \nNone\nCELL (4, 4): \nNone\nCELL (4, 5): \nA\nCELL (4, 6): \nB\nCELL (4, 7): \nB\nCELL (5, 1): \nR-30 & R-20\nCELL (5, 2): \nC\nCELL (5, 3): \nA\nCELL (5, 4): \nA\nCELL (5, 5): \nNone\nCELL (5, 6): \nA\nCELL (5, 7): \nA\nCELL (6, 1): \nR-10\nCELL (6, 2): \nC\nCELL (6, 3): \nB\nCELL (6, 4): \nA\nCELL (6, 5): \nNone\nCELL (6, 6): \nNone\nCELL (6, 7): \nA\nCELL (7, 1): \nOI & B-1\nCELL (7, 2): \nC\nCELL (7, 3): \nB\nCELL (7, 4): \nB\nCELL (7, 5): \nA\nCELL (7, 6): \nNone\nCELL (7, 7): \nNone\nCELL (8, 1): \nB-2 & M-1\nCELL (8, 2): \nC\nCELL (8, 3): \nC\nCELL (8, 4): \nB\nCELL (8, 5): \nA\nCELL (8, 6): \nNone\nCELL (8, 7): \nNone\nCELL (9, 1): \nM-2\nCELL (9, 2): \nC\nCELL (9, 3): \nC\nCELL (9, 4): \nC\nCELL (9, 5): \nB\nCELL (9, 6): \nA\nCELL (9, 7): \nNone\n\n\nNEW PAGE 393\nARTICLE 6. STANDARDS\n$6.5. Landscaping and Screening\n6.5.10. STREETSCAPE BUFFERS\nA.\nPURPOSE AND INTENT\nStreetscape buffers are proposed to soften the view of development from the arterial and\ncollector street rights-of-way, and are intended to:\n1. Enhance pedestrian orientation and encourage pedestrian travel;\n2. Address urban heat islands by providing shade for streets and sidewalks;\n3. Provide shade on pavement;\n4. Support property values by enhancing the aesthetic character of the community; and\n5. Provide habitat for flora and fauna.\nB.\nAPPLICABILITY\n1. The standards in this section shall apply to all lot lines bounded by the following features,\nwhether existing or identified in the County's adopted policy guidance.\ni. Collector streets; and\nii. Arterial streets.\n2. In cases where a future street is planned but its approximate location is not indicated on an\nadopted or approved County map or plan, streetscape buffering shall not be required on\nlots abutting the future street alignment.\nC.\nEXEMPTION\n1. Streetscape buffers are not required along lot lines abutting the following features:\ni. Driveways, private drives, or alleys;\nii. Lot lines abutting platted street rights-of-way that are or have remained unopened for\nat least 15 years; or\niii. Lot frontages where the entirety of the lot frontage is within a required sight distance\ntriangle.\n2. Development providing street trees in accordance with Section 6.5.11, Street Trees, is not\nrequired to provide streetscape buffers.\nD.\nREQUIRED PLANT MATERIAL\nStreetscape buffers shall be configured in one of the following three ways (see Figure 6.5.10,\nStreetscape Buffer Configuration):\n1. Three canopy trees for every 100 linear feet of lot frontage; or\n2. Two canopy trees and two understory trees for every 100 linear feet of lot frontage; or\n3. Four understory trees for every 100 linear feet, where overhead utilities are present.\nE.\nPLACEMENT\n1. Vegetation required as part of a streetscape buffer shall be located outside the street right-\nof-way.\n2. Canopy trees shall be located within ten feet of the right-of-way edge.\n3. Understory trees shall be located within five feet of the right-of-way edge.\n4. An alternative location may be approved by the Zoning Administrator in cases where\nunderground utilities, drainage easements, topography, or other obstructions make\nplacement of streetscape buffer vegetation in accordance with these standards impractical.\nF.\nPROHIBITED FEATURES\nOff-street parking, off-street loading, merchandise display, or outdoor storage shall not take\nplace within a required streetscape buffer.\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage\n393\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n\nNEW PAGE 394\nARTICLE 6.
