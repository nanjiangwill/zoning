Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Medium Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MI\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Medium Industrial\n(MI) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Medium Industrial (MI). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Medium Industrial (MI)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Medium Industrial\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft).

Typical activities taking place in\nthe district include bio-engineering, pharmaceuticals,\nprecision fabrication and assembly, and research and\ndevelopment. The district does not allow heavy industrial\nuses, residential uses, or retail, except as accessory uses.\nDistrict standards are intended to prevent the\nestablishment of any use types that would interrupt\nindustrial operations. District standards require that no\nland or structure be used for any purpose that causes\nnoxious or offensive odors, gas fumes, smoke, dust,\nvibration, or noise that substantially interferes with other\nnearby uses.\nB.

MIXED USE (MX) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Mixed Use (MX) district is intended to foster functional neighborhoods where City\nresidents and visitors can live, work, shop, and recreate without travelling large distances\nbetween differing uses. Buildings are built close to the sidewalk and served by public\ngathering areas that create places for people to congregate and interact. The district\nencourages a fine-grained network of streets and pedestrian ways that allow a wide\nfreedom of movement and choices in transportation mode, including public transit. Land\nuses are mixed (including both residential and non-residential) either in the same building\n(vertical integration) or on the same development site (horizontal integration), and are\nlocated in close proximity to one another. Mixed use districts are located on principal and\nminor arterials as well as collector streets. The district allows a wide variety of housing\ntypes to promote population density and to support nearby retail, dining, and entertainment\nestablishments. The district discourages the establishment of single-use, monolithic, and\nautomobile-oriented forms of development that require large areas of off-street parking.\nNOTES:\n(AMENDED 06.21.22 UDOTA-03-22)\n[1] Includes duplex, triplex, and quadriplex dwellings.\n[2] 10,000 for duplex buildings; 15,000 for triplex buildings; 20,000 for quadriplex buildings; and 5,400 for a single-family\nattached development plus an additional 1,600 square feet per single-family attached unit in the development.\n[3] This is a minimum development size, not a minimum lot area.\n[4] Development in the WPO is subject to Section 3.20.F, Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay (WPO) District.\n[5] Increased to 90% for lots in pocket neighborhoods and 80% for lots in bungalow courts.\n[6] Not applied to single-family attached lots but the entire development shall maintain a max. lot coverage of 50%.\n[7] Applied to entire development (not individual lots) when configured as a pocket neighborhood or bungalow court.\n[8] Standards applied to entire development, not individual lots.\n[9] Open space set-aside requirements applied to single-family detached subdivisions of six or more lots and developments\ncomprised of six or more duplex, triplex, or quadriplex buildings.
