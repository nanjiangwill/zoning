Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential-Agricultural\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-A-C\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential-Agricultural\n(R-A-C) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Residential-Agricultural (R-A-C). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential-Agricultural (R-A-C)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential-Agricultural\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

The purpose of the Planned Residential Conditional District (PR-CD) is to encourage the\ndevelopment of environments which provide certain development privileges in exchange for\npreplanning and design considerations. The PR-CD provides an alternative to conventional\nsubdivision design by promoting the conservation and creation of viable, connected open space\nand more flexible lot design options while minimizing development costs. The Planned Residential\nConditional District (PR-CD) provides flexibility in utilizing new development concepts, including\nthe incorporation of a limited amount of non-residential uses. In return for development\nflexibility, additional site plan information and development conditions may be required of the\ndeveloper to assist in evaluating the suitability of a proposed PR-CD. While maximum open space\npreservation and high-quality residential development is the primary goal of PR-CDs, open space\nwithin PR-CDs must balance the need for open space preservation with an increased need for\nintegration with surrounding developments through street connectivity and compatibility with\nadjacent and internal land uses.\n(B) Minimum Size. A PR-CD shall be located on a site containing at least five (5) contiguous acres.\n(C)\nabout:blank\n59/167\n\n\nNEW PAGE 60\n6/3/24, 7:55 PM\nDobson, NC Code of Ordinances\nPre-Application Conference Required. Prior to the formal submission of a proposed PR-CD, the petitioner or\ntheir representative shall attend a pre-application conference with the Town's planning staff concerning the\nproposed development of the site. The petitioner shall be required to produce a scaled sketch site plan\nshowing the existing cultural, historic, and physical features of the site for review by the planning staff as\nwell as conditions the developer proposes to incorporate into the development. Staff may ask for additional\ninformation such as the location of prime agricultural soils, historical structures, archeological/cultural\nelements, the depth of viewshed as seen from existing public rights-of-way, the location of \"unique\"\nfeatures on the site, and the location and general specifications of any existing and proposed water/sewer\ninfrastructure.\nThe Town's Planning Staff in consultation with other departments shall comment on the site plan within\n15 days. The official plan of the PR-CD shall be submitted for review by the Planning and Zoning Board and\nthe Board of Commissioners only after the completion of the pre-application conference and the written\nresponse.\n(D) Permitted Principal Uses. PR-CDs do not have any inherent permitted or conditional uses and\ndevelopment activities are only allowed through specific conditions approved by the Board of\nCommissioners; however PR-CDs are primarily intended for single-family developments. A\nmaximum of ten percent (10%) of the total land of the development may be utilized for non-\nresidential uses. The compatibility and appropriateness of any non-residential uses proposed\nshall be carefully considered. Those uses permitted and conditions approved by the Board of\nCommissioners shall be reflected on the Conditional Zoning District Supplement issued by the\nZoning Enforcement Officer.\n(E) Relationship to Other Applicable Regulations. A PR-CD shall be subject to all applicable standards,\nprocedures, and regulations of this Ordinance unless otherwise set forth in this section.\n(F) Maximum Density. Maximum residential density shall be calculated based on the existing zoning\ndistrict the proposed PR-CD is located in. All land proposed for non-residential development shall\nbe excluded from density calculations. If all of the PR-CD or a portion of the PR-CD is unable to be\nserved by public water and sewer, minimum lot sizes and maximum density shall be determined\nin consultation with the Surry County Health Department.\n(G) Development Standards. A PR-CD shall meet the following standards:\n(1) Outside Perimeter Lot Setback Requirements. Any lot which adjoins the outside boundary of\nthe PR-CD shall be considered an outside perimeter lot. Internal street refers to a street that\nis within the boundary of the PR-CD. Adjoining street is a street which is not located within the\nPR-CD but is adjacent to the outside boundary of the PR-CD. The following setbacks shall be\nrequired for outside perimeter lots:\n(a) Lots with Access on an Internal Street. Rear yard setback requirement of the existing\nzoning district in which the PR-CD is proposed shall be required.\nabout:blank\n60/167\n\nNEW PAGE 61\n6/3/24,7:55 PM\nabout:blank\n61/167\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nDobson, NC Code of Ordinances\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \n(b) Lots with Access on an Adjoining Street.
