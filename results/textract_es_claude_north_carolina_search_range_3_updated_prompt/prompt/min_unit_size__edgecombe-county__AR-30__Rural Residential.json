Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Rural Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"AR-30\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Rural Residential\n(AR-30) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Rural Residential (AR-30). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Rural Residential (AR-30)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Rural Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 74\nArticle 4 Zoning Districts\n4.5 Commercial Zoning Districts\n4.5.4.\nSpecial Standards in the AR-30 Zoning District\nD.\nOpen Space\nOpen space requirements for the residential portion of a multifamily or mixed commercial-residential\nproject shall be the same and conform to the requirements for multifamily developments in the MR-\n4-12\nCELL (1, 1):\nUse\nCELL (1, 2):\nDistrict\nCELL (1, 3):\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 4):\nMinimum\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 5):\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 6):\nMinimum\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 7):\nCELL (1, 8):\nYard\n(ft.)\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (2, 1):\nCELL (2, 2):\nCELL (2, 3):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 4):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 5):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 6):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 7):\nFront\nCELL (2, 8):\nRear\nCELL (2, 9):\nSide\nCELL (3, 1):\nAll residential, except\nCELL (3, 2):\nAR-30\nCELL (3, 3):\n60\nCELL (3, 4):\n60\nCELL (3, 5):\n6,000\nCELL (3, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (3, 7):\n25\u00b3\nCELL (3, 8):\n63\nCELL (3, 9):\n51,2\nCELL (4, 1):\nmultifamily\nCELL (4, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (4, 3):\n75\nCELL (4, 4):\n75\nCELL (4, 5):\n7,500\nCELL (4, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (4, 7):\n253\nCELL (4, 8):\n253\nCELL (4, 9):\n102\nCELL (5, 1):\nMultifamily/ Mixed\nCELL (5, 2):\nAR-30\nCELL (5, 3):\n100\nCELL (5, 4):\n150\nCELL (5, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (5, 6):\n15,000\nCELL (5, 7):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 8):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 9):\nCELL (6, 1):\ncommercial- residential\nCELL (6, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (6, 3):\n100\nCELL (6, 4):\n100\nCELL (6, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (6, 6):\n7,000\nCELL (6, 7):\nCELL (6, 8):\nCELL (6, 9):\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"CELL (2, 5):\\nWith\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 5):\\n6,000\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (2, 6):\\nWithout\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 6):\\n10,000\" 74]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"For district AR-30, the section provides the information for min_unit_size.

Dwellings located in a floodplain or flood prone area\nalso require issuance of a Floodplain Development Permit. During\nconstruction, the building must be inspected by County Building Inspectors\nas required by State law, and a Certificate of Occupancy must be issued\nbefore the home may be occupied. Applicants seeking to place a mobile or\nmanufactured home may be required to obtain a permit, and should\ncontact the County's Planning, Inspections, and E-911 Addressing\nDepartment at 252.641.7802 for more information.\nCELL (3, 1): \nDo I need permits to\nhave a home business?\nCELL (3, 2): \nYes, operating a home-based business (also called a \"home occupation\")\nrequires approval of a Zoning Compliance Permit issued by the County.

LAND USES\n$4.5. Secondary Uses\n$4.5. SECONDARY USES\n4.5.1. PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThis section authorizes the establishment of secondary uses and structures that are incidental and\nsubordinate to principal uses. The purpose of this section is to allow a broad range of secondary uses\nand structures, provided they comply with the standards set forth in this section in order to reduce\npotentially adverse impacts on surrounding lands.\n4.5.2. ORGANIZATION OF THESE STANDARDS\nThese provisions set out the configuration standards and allowable locations for secondary uses and\nstructures in the County's planning jurisdiction, and are generally organized into the following\nstructure:\nA.\nThe procedure for establishing a secondary use or structure;\nB.\nThe general standards applicable to all secondary uses and structures under this Ordinance;\nC.\nA summary table of common secondary uses and the zoning districts where they are permitted;\nand\nD.\nAdditional standards applied to specific secondary use types, where identified in the summary\ntable.\n4.5.3. PROCEDURE FOR ESTABLISHMENT\nA.\nSecondary uses or structures may be approved in conjunction with the approval of the principal\nuse or subsequently following the establishment of the principal use through the approval of\na\nzoning compliance permit or special use permit, as appropriate. Except as permitted in the AR-\n30 zoning district, no secondary use or structure shall be approved, established, or constructed\nbefore a principal use is approved in accordance with this Ordinance.\nB.\nApplications to establish a planned development district shall be supplemented by a site plan\nshowing proposed secondary uses or by a written list of proposed secondary uses included in\nthe terms and conditions documents.\nC.\nTable 4.5.5, Common Secondary Use Table, may not be inclusive of all possible secondary uses,\nand in the event a secondary use is proposed that is not listed in the table, the Zoning\nAdministrator shall consult Table 4.2.1, Principal Use Table, to determine if the proposed\nsecondary use corresponds to a listed principal use. Any permitted principal use in a zoning\ndistrict is also permitted as secondary use. In no instance shall a secondary use be permitted in\na zoning district where it is prohibited as a principal use.\nD.\nIn the event a proposed secondary use is not listed in Table 4.5.5, Common Secondary Use\nTable, and there is no corresponding principal use, the Zoning Administrator shall determine\nhow to treat the secondary use in accordance with Section $4.7, Unlisted Uses.\n4.5.4. GENERAL STANDARDS FOR ALL SECONDARY USES, STRUCTURES, AND\nOPEN AIR USES OF LAND\nA.\nPERMITTED SECONDARY USES, STRUCTURES, AND OPEN AIR USES OF\nLAND\nPermitted secondary uses, structures, and open air uses of land shall comply with the following:\n1.
