Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Commercial-Low Density\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"C-LD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Commercial-Low Density\n(C-LD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Commercial-Low Density (C-LD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Commercial-Low Density (C-LD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Commercial-Low Density\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

RU-I: Industrial-Rural\n1. This District is intended to accommodate uses on lands which have not been in productive agricultural or farm use in the previous five year\nperiod. Also, this District is intended to be applied only on lands not anticipated to become urban or suburban by the Land Use Plan, and\nwhich are not wetlands or environmentally sensitive lands. This District is intended to provide areas for uses of open air or extensive rather\nthan intensive character such as:\ni. Agricultural industry;\nii.\nRepositories for waste products whose composition and features require they be removed from other Zoning Districts;\niii.\nChemical extraction or energy generation from crops or woods or the wastes of same, or conversion of crops, woods, and animals to\nvarious products of use to society; and\niv. Animal slaughtering and processing operations and even incineration of animal remains.\n2. This District is intended to be used in an extremely limited manner sufficient only to meet proven needs for such generally adverse uses.\n3. Such land uses require restriction of other uses such as residential, institutional, commercial, and manufacturing where there are\nconcentrations of persons likely at any given time.\nCommentary: The Sunny Point Military Ocean Terminal's buffer zone is an illustration of how man would be expected to be limited in\naccessibility or closeness to uses in this District.\nB. I-G: Industrial-General\nThe I-G District is intended to provide locations for enterprises engaged in a broad range of manufacturing, processing, creating, repairing,\nrenovating, painting, cleaning, or assembly of goods, merchandise or equipment. Lands in this District are to be located on or near Major\nThoroughfares as identified in the Brunswick County Comprehensive Transportation Plan; to rail service; and to in-place infrastructure such as\nwater, sewer, and/or natural gas.\n(Ord.
