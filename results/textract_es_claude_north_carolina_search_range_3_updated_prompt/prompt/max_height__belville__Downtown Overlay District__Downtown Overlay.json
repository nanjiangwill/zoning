Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Downtown Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"Downtown Overlay District\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Downtown Overlay\n(Downtown Overlay District) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Downtown Overlay (Downtown Overlay District). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Downtown Overlay (Downtown Overlay District)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Downtown Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Such entrances shall be designed to convey their prominence on the\nfronting fa\u00e7ade. Use building massing, special architectural features, and changes\nin the roof line to emphasize building entrances. Additional entrances may be\noriented toward side or rear parking lots Service entrances for shipping and\nCornice\nreceiving shall be oriented away from the public street\nWindow\nHoods\n2.\nArchitectural Style: The building design\nstandards of this Article intentionally do not\nMasonry\nmandate a particular style and permit a wide\nWall\nvariety of architectural expressions\nRegularly\nHowever, when a design exhibits a known\nSpaced\nWindows\narchitectural style (i.e. Italianate) the details\nshall be primarily consistent with the local\nStorefront\ncoastal Carolina low country architectural\nCornice\nTransom\nstyle.\nMasonry\n3. Termination of Vistas: Important str\nPier\nvistas (such as along gateways and pr\nDisplay\nWindow\npedestrian streets) should terminate in\nBABS\nBana\nBulkhead\nprominent focal point, such as a building or\nother architectural or landscape feature.\n4. Compatibility: Adjacent buildings should relate in similarity of scale, bulk,\nheight, architectural style, and/or configuration.\n5. Proportions: Windows, doors, columns, leaves, parapets, and other building\ncomponents shall be proportional to the overall scale of the building. Windows\nshall be vertically proportioned wherever possible.\n6. Wall Materials: When two or more materials are used on a fa\u00e7ade, the heavie\nmaterial (i.e. brick) should be placed below the lighter material (i.e. siding) to\ngive the sense of support and grounding.\n13\n\n\nNEW PAGE 116\n7. Roof Pitch: Roof pitches less than 3:12 and flat roofs will require a\nparapet wall. A pitched roof shall be profiled by leaves a minimum of six\n(6) inches from the building face or with a gutter.\n8. Fa\u00e7ade Treatment: Architectural elements like windows and doors,\nbulkheads, masonry piers, transoms, cornice lines, window hoods,\nlawnings, canopies, and other similar details shall be used on all facades\nfacing public rights-of-way.\n9. Building Wall Offsets: Building wall offsets, including projections,\nrecesses,and changesin floor level shall be used in order to: add\narchitectural interest and variety; relieve the visual effect of a single, long\nwall; and subdivide the wall into human size proportions. Similarly,\nroofline offsets should be provided to lend architecturahterest and\nvariety to the massing of a building and to relieve the effect of a single,\nlong roof.\nB. Building Types\nThe building types outlined in this Section shall provide for the predominant form for\nnew development in the Downtown Overlay District. While it is anticipated that some\nnew building types will be introduced in this district, these variations should be based\nupon the types listed in this section.

Normal grade shall be\nconstrued to be the lower of: (1) existing grade prior to construction or (2) the newly established\ngrade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for\nthe purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be\ndetermined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal\ngrade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public\nstreet or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zone lot,\nwhichever is greater. Where the normal grade is below the normal grade of a public street, the\nsign base can be raised to the elevation of the normal grade of the street before the height\nlimitations are applied (surveyor's certificate required).\nSECTION 12.11\nCONSTRUCTION STANDARDS\nSection 12.11.1 Building, Safety, and Fire Codes\nAll signs permitted under this code shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with\napplicable building, safety, and fire codes.
