Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Office Institutional\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"OI\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Office Institutional\n(OI) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Office Institutional (OI). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Office Institutional (OI)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Office Institutional\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\"). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 165\n165/167\nCELL (1, 1):\nRestaurants (with drive through service)\nCELL (1, 2):\nOne (1) space for each four (4) seating\naccommodations, plus one (1) space for each\ntwo (2) employees on the shift of largest\nemployment; and Three (3) stacking spaces\nfor each drive through window.\nCELL (2, 1):\nSchool, Elementary and Middle (both public\nand private):\nCELL (2, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each classroom and\nadministrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee and one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (3, 1):\nSchool, High School (both public and private)\nCELL (3, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each fifteen (15)\nstudents for which the building was designed,\nplus one (1) parking space for each classroom\nand administrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee, plus one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (4, 1):\nShopping Centers, large and small\nCELL (4, 2):\nOne (1) space for each three hundred (300)\nsquare feet of gross floor area.\nCELL (5, 1):\nSingle Family, Duplex, Condominiums,\nManufactured Homes, and similar residential\nCELL (5, 2):\nTwo (2) spaces per dwelling unit\nCELL (6, 1):\nTerminals, Bus\nCELL (6, 2):\nOne (1) space for each employee and one (1)\nspace for each bus loading ramp and track.\nCELL (7, 1):\nStadiums, Theaters, and similar uses\ninvolving the assembling of persons:\nCELL (7, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each four (4) seats\nin the largest assembly room.

For purposes of this\nsubdivision, the \"odor threshold\" is defined as the minimum concentration in air of a gas,\nvapor, or particulate matter that can be detected by the olfactory systems of a panel of\nhealthy observers.\ne) Require for its operations a daily average of more than 200 gallons of water per employee.\nf) Create any electrical disturbance that adversely affects any operations or equipment other\nthan those of the creator of such disturbance, or otherwise causes, creates, or contributes\nto\nthe interference with electronic signals (including television and radio broadcasting\ntransmissions) to the extent that the operation of any equipment not owned by the creator\nof such disturbance is adversely affected.\nSection 16-10.10. Combination Uses. When a combination use comprises two or more principal\nuses that require different types of permits (zoning or special use), then the permit authorizing\nthe combination use shall be:\na) A special use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a special use permit.\nb) A zoning permit in all other cases.\nThis is indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses by the designation Z and S in each of the columns\nadjacent to the 29.000 classification.\n16-10.10.1. Subject to Section 16-10.10.2 when a combination use in an R-6 or R-10 zoning\ndistrict consists of a residential subdivision and a multi-family development, the total density\npermissible on the lot shall be determined by having the developer indicate on the plans the\nportion of the total lot that will be developed for each purpose and calculating the density\nfor each portion as if it were a separate lot.\n16-10.10.2. Notwithstanding Section 16-12.2.2 whenever a combination use consists of a\nstandard residential subdivision and a multi-family development, and the subdivided portion\nof the tract contains lots that exceed the minimum lot size requirements set forth in Section\n16-181, but that do not exceed an average of 30,000 square feet, then the density of the\nportion of the tract developed for multi-family purposes may be increased beyond the\npermissible density calculated in accordance with Section 16-10.10.1. The increase in density\nshall be determined as follows:\na) The minimum lot size requirement for the applicable zoning district shall be subtracted\nfrom each lot that exceeds the minimum lot size, and the remainders totaled.\nb) The sum derived from the calculation in subdivision (1) shall be divided by the minimum\nlot size requirement. Fractions shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.\nc)\nThe product of the calculation in subdivision (2) shall yield the number of additional multi-\nfamily dwelling units that may be located within the portion of tract developed for multi-\nfamily purposes.\n10-5\n\n\nNEW PAGE 100\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n16-10.10.3. When a residential use is combined with a non-residential use in a business\ndistrict, the lot must have at least the minimum square footage required for the residential\nuse alone.\n16-10.10.4. When two principal uses are combined, the total amount of parking required for\nthe combination use shall be determined by cumulating the amount of parking required for\neach individual principal use according to the relative amount of space occupied by that use.\nSection 16-10.11. More Specific Use Controls. Whenever a development could fall within more\nthan one use classification in the Table of Permissible Uses, the classification that most closely\nand most specifically describes the development controls. For example, a small doctor's office\nor clinic clearly falls within the 3.110 classification (Office and service operations conducted\nentirely indoors and designed to attract customers or clients to the premises). However,\nclassification 3.130, \"Physicians and dentists offices and clinics occupying not more than 10,000\nsquare feet of gross floor area\" more specifically covers this use and therefore is controlling.\nSection 16-10.12. Short-Term Rentals. The Board finds that short-term rentals (STRs) are an\nappropriate use given the residential/resort character of Blowing Rock's planning jurisdiction,\nprovided that specific controls are in place to regulate parking, trash, noise, tenant safety, and\nother related effects thereby protecting neighborhood property values, and the health, safety,\nand the general welfare of Town citizens and visitors.\nShort-term rentals are defined as the rental, lease, or offer to make available, any attached or\ndetached residential dwelling unit, or portion thereof, by way of a rental agreement, lease,\nlicense, or any other means, (whether oral or written) for compensation or consideration, for a\nduration that is less than 28 consecutive days. The following standards shall apply to all short-\nterm rentals with the Town's planning jurisdiction:\na) A zoning permit must be initially obtained for a change in use for each dwelling unit that is to\nbe rented for a period of less than 28 days. The permit is not valid until a satisfactory\ninspection is completed.\nb) A local contact person or management company contact information must be clearly posted\non the interior of the dwelling unit, and the person/company shall be available to respond to\ncomplaints or emergencies within one (1) hour.\nc) Sufficient off-street parking must be provided for each bedroom to be rented. The parking\nspace must meet the minimum dimensional requirements in Section 16-20.6. Short-term\nrental units that exist on July 1, 2018, are grandfathered with respect to parking, but each\nbedroom added after this date requires an additional parking space.\nd) Adequate trash and recycling containers must be provided. If collection containers are kept\nin an enclosure bin, the bin must meet minimum design standards defined in the Town Code\n(ex. Placed within 6 to 12 feet of the edge of the street, opaque screening at least four feet\nhigh, etc.).\ne) The dwelling unit must be equipped with operable smoke detectors and carbon monoxide\ndetectors consistent with the NC Building Code.\nf)\nThe 911 address must be posted on the front of the house or dwelling unit with 3.5-inch\nreflective numbers (6-inch reflective number if commercial or multi-family) or on the\n10-6\n\n\nNEW PAGE 101\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nproperty according to Section 7-17 of the Town Code. The 911 address must be clearly posted\non the interior of the dwelling unit to notify tenants in case of emergency.\n16-10.12.1. In addition to those areas zoned to allow short-term rentals (CB, TC, GB, OI), there\nare other areas where short-term rentals are permissible including Chetola Resort and Royals\nOaks Condominiums (Overlay District). There are other properties that were previously\noperating short-term rentals or had permitted vested rights through Watauga or Caldwell\nCounty prior to being annexed or added to the Extraterritorial Jurisdiction. These properties\nhave a legal nonconforming status that provides the opportunity for short-term rental. Each\nproperty owner that applies for a zoning permit for short-term rental use in areas not\npermitted by right or listed herein must provide historical documentation that the\nnonconformity has been legally obtained or a vested right has been legally established under\nNCGS 160D-108.\n10-7\n\nNEW PAGE 102\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n10-8\n\n\n Output:"}]}
