Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential Mobile Home\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-MH\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential Mobile Home\n(R-MH) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Residential Mobile Home (R-MH). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential Mobile Home (R-MH)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential Mobile Home\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_lot_size is typically between 1,000 and 2,000,000 sq ft or 0.02 and 50 acres. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 11\n\nR-MH Zone\n\nCELL (2, 1):\nField\nCELL (2, 2):\nValue\nCELL (3, 1):\nmin_lot_size\nCELL (3, 2):\n123456 sq ft\nCELL (4, 1):\nApartment Area\nCELL (4, 2):\n10,000\n\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"CELL (3, 2):\\n123456 sq ft\", 11]],\n    \"rationale\": \"The cell that corresponds to the value for min_lot_size in this table has this answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"123456 sq ft\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 32\n\nSection 6.3 Industrial Area & Dimensional Requirements\n1 Public Sewer or Public Water\n2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\n3 For proposed warehouse/manufacturing uses 35%, for all other uses 25%, subject to\nCommission's authority to permit greater coverage based on landscape, architectural design\nand site development elements that exceed minimum standard of the Regulation\n4\nShall be in addition to requirements of 8.1.2 Landscaping and Buffers\n6-4\n\nCELL (1, 1):\nCELL (1, 2):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 3):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 4):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 5):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 6):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 7):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 8):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (1, 10):\nCELL (2, 1):\nZone\nCELL (2, 2):\nMin\nArea\nCELL (2, 3):\nMin\nWidth\nCELL (2, 4):\nMin\nDepth\nCELL (2, 5):\nMax\nStories\nCELL (2, 6):\nMax\nHeight\nCELL (2, 7):\nMax % Lot\nCoverage\nCELL (2, 8):\nMin\nFront\nYard\nCELL (2, 9):\nMin\nSide\nYard\nCELL (2, 10):\nMin\nRear\nYard\nCELL (3, 1):\nI\nCELL (3, 2):\n20,000\nsq. ft.\nCELL (3, 3):\n100'\nCELL (3, 4):\n100'\nCELL (3, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (3, 6):\n50'\nCELL (3, 7):\nN/A\nCELL (3, 8):\n25'\nCELL (3, 9):\n20'\nCELL (3, 10):\n20'\nCELL (4, 1):\nR-MH\nCELL (4, 2):\n40,000\nsq. ft. 1\nCELL (4, 3):\n150'\nCELL (4, 4):\n150'\nCELL (4, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (4, 6):\n50'\nCELL (4, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (4, 8):\n50'\nCELL (4, 9):\n20'\nCELL (4, 10):\n20'\nCELL (5, 1):\nR-MH\nCELL (5, 2):\n60,000\nsq. ft. 2\nCELL (5, 3):\n200'\nCELL (5, 4):\n200'\nCELL (5, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (5, 6):\n50'\nCELL (5, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (5, 8):\n50'\nCELL (5, 9):\n20'\nCELL (5, 10):\n20'4\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"1 Public Sewer or Public Water\", 32],\n        [\"2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\", 32],\n        [\"CELL (4, 2): \\n40,000\\nsq. ft.\", 32],\n        [\"CELL (5, 2): \\n60,000\\nsq. ft.\", 32]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"From this page we can infer that the value is conditional on the presence of a public sewer or water system, and there are two different values for the current zone, depending on that.\",\n    \"answer\": \"40,000 sq ft (if public water or sewer); 60,000 sq ft (otherwise)\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 66\n\nR-MH Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 123 sq ft, side length is 10 ft\n\nNEW PAGE 67\n\nR-MH Zone - Senior Active Overlay\n\nmin_lot_size is 1523 sq ft\n\nDKEWKWKDS Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 20,000 sq ft\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"min_lot_size is 123 sq ft\", 66]],\n    \"rationale\": \"The section titled R-MH says the answer explicitly.

Therefore,\nthe Administrator may authorize deviations from the presumptive requirements for fence or\nwall design, placement, or height limitations whenever the Administrator finds that (1) such\ndeviations are necessary because of particular characteristics or circumstances associated\nwith a specific property or project; and (2) such deviations will not be detrimental to the\npublic welfare or contrary to the intent of these regulations. Whenever the Administrator\nallows or requires a deviation from the presumption requirements of this Section, that\ndeviation shall be noted on the face of the fence permit along with the reasons for allowing\nor requiring the deviation.
