Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential Main Street Transition\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"RMST\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential Main Street Transition\n(RMST) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Residential Main Street Transition (RMST). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential Main Street Transition (RMST)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential Main Street Transition\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft).

The intent\nof this district is to recognize that gradual transformation of existing development\nto high quality mixed density residential development is needed to support the\ncentral core of the Town. Higher density residential development allows a greater\nnumber of households to walk or bike, thus supporting businesses while reducing\nthe parking demand and providing environmental and health benefits. Allowed\nbuilding/lot types in these districts are the Detached House, Attached House, and\nMulti-Family Building. Streets in the Residential Main Street Transition District\nshould be interconnected, with streets and sidewalks providing a connection from\nChadbourn's Main Street and other mixed-use districts to the Single-Family\nResidential districts surrounding these neighborhoods. A range of housing types is\nencouraged. Criteria for the mix of building types establishes compatibility.\n(B.) Listed Uses:\n(1.)
