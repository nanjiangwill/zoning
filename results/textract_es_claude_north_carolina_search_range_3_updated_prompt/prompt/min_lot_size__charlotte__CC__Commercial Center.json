Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Commercial Center\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CC\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Commercial Center\n(CC) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Commercial Center (CC). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Commercial Center (CC)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Commercial Center\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Additional development\nrequirements for the BP district are specified below:\n(a)\nMinimum required open space. At least 20 percent of every project in the\nbusiness park district must be devoted to permanent open space. This area\nmust be used for landscaping, lawns, screening, or buffer areas. It may\nnot contain any parking or loading areas, outdoor storage, trash handling,\nor utility or service areas. The area devoted to the minimum project edge\nrequirement may be counted toward this requirement.\n(b)\nUtility lines underground. All utility lines such as electric, telephone,\nCATV, or other similar lines must be installed underground, unless the\nfollowing criteria are met:\n(i)\nThe power lines existed above ground at the time of first approval\nof a plat or development plan by the local government, whether or\nnot the power lines are subsequently relocated during construction\nof the subdivision or development plan.\n(ii)\nThe power lines are located outside the boundaries of the parcel of\nland that contains the subdivision or property covered by the\ndevelopment plan.\nThis requirement applies to lines serving individual sites as well as to\nsecurity and street lighting within the project. However, distribution lines\nwhich serve the entire site may be located above ground. All utility boxes,\ntransformers, meters, and similar structures must be screened from public\nview.\n(c)\nOutdoor storage is permitted. Outdoor storage is permitted as an\naccessory use on any individual lot. Any such storage must be completely\nscreened from adjoining development within and without the site as well\nas from the general public. The screening must be effective at the time\nthat it is installed, even if plant materials are used for all or part of the\nscreening. Access through the screening for vehicles is permitted, but is\nlimited to one 30-foot wide location per-street frontage. All setbacks and\nyards must be observed for outside storage areas. In no case may the\namount of land area devoted to outside storage exceed 20 percent of the\nlot area.\n(d)\nCovenants required. The developer of any business park project must\nestablish restrictive covenants for the entire project area. The restrictive\ncovenants must be submitted to show compliance, but will not be\nreviewed as to form, legality, or methods of enforcement. Those\n9-127\n\n\nNEW PAGE 278\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 8: BUSINESS DISTRICTS\ncovenants must, at a minimum, accomplish the following objectives:\ni.\nCreate a property owners association;\nii.\nProvide for maintenance of individual sites, common areas, open\nspaces, and private streets; and\niii.\nProvide for minimum development and operational standards for\neach site which require adherence to local ordinances and establish\nuniform landscaping, signage, site design, parking, and loading\nstandards. The covenants may include additional restrictions or\nrequirements at the discretion of the developer. However, the\nminimum standards of this ordinance must always be met.\n(e)\nProject edge. The protection of the project edge is essential to the proper\nintegration of a business park development into the community, especially\nwhen adjoining residential areas. The objective of the standards for the\nproject edge is to provide the appropriate separation, screening,\nlandscaping and transition between the development and the adjoining\nproperties.\nThe minimum project edge required around the perimeter of the site is 100\nfeet. However, if the abutting land is zoned and used for business,\nbusiness park, research or industrial purposes, or if the project adjoins the\nright-of-way of a railroad, Class I, or Class II thoroughfare, the minimum\nedge for that part of the project boundary may be reduced to 50 feet. The\nminimum project edge must remain undisturbed except that utility lines,\nstreets and driveways, may be installed in this area pursuant to specific\nsite plan approval. If the project edge does not contain sufficient\nvegetation to adequately screen and buffer, it must be revegetated or\nscreened according to a Class B buffer as per Table 12.302(b). (Petition\n2019-103,10-21-19)\n(f)\nStreet trees. Street trees must be planted along all public and private\nstreets within and abutting any business park development in accordance\nwith the standards and specifications of the Charlotte Street Tree Planting\nprogram and the Charlotte Tree Ordinance (City Code Chapter 21), which\nare adopted herein by reference.\n(g)\nProject entrance. The entrance or entrances to the project should receive\nspecial emphasis in design and construction. It should set the tone for the\ndevelopment within and should create an identity for the project at the\npublic street frontage. Special attention should be paid to signage,\nlandscaping, street configuration, future transit potential, and traffic\ncirculation. At a minimum, a divided street entrance must be used at the\nprincipal entrance to the site. Where internal streets are provided within a\nBP district, individual development sites shall be accessed only from\ninternal streets.\n9-128\n\nNEW PAGE 564\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 2: OFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING\n12 - 26\nCELL (1, 1): \n(2)\nCELL (1, 2): \nIn the event that the number of parking spaces required under Table 12.202\ncannot be placed on the parcel in accordance with these regulations without the\ndemolition of an existing structure or damage of significant trees on the site or in\nthe public right-of-way to accommodate a parking area, the Planning Director, in\nconsultation with Charlotte Department of Transportation, may authorize up to a\n25 percent reduction in the total number of parking spaces required on the lot.\nThe Planning Director may issue such an authorization only upon the request of\nthe applicant and only upon determining that the reduction in the number of\nrequired parking spaces will not unreasonably increase parking congestion along\npublic streets or in parking areas located on nearby lots.
