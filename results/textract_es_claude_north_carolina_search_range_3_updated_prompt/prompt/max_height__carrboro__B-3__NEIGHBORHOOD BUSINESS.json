Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESS\n(B-3) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESS (B-3).

At the same time, continued residential use\nof existing and nearby structures, and preservation of the existing character and\nappearance of this area is encouraged. Accordingly, however, whenever the use of\nthe land in this district is changed to commercial, it is intended and desired that\nexisting residential structures be converted and adapted to commercial use rather than\nnew buildings constructed, and to encourage this, the regulations for this district allow\ndevelopment at a lower density than is permitted in the B-1 districts and permit uses\nthat tend to generate minimal traffic. In this way, the B-2 district should provide a\nsmoother transition from the more intensively developed B-1 areas to residential\nareas. Any development within the B-2 district shall comply with the following\nrequirements: (AMENDED 9/06/88; 6/20/06).\na.\nTo the extent practicable, development shall otherwise retain, preserve and be\ncompatible with the residential character of the older homes within and\nimmediately adjacent to this district;\nb.\nTo the extent practicable, vehicle accommodation areas associated with uses\non lots in this district shall be located in the rear of buildings SO that parking\nareas are not readily visible from the streets; and\n(4)\nB-3 NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESS. This district is designed to accommodate\ncommercial needs arising at the neighborhood level, such as grocery stores, branch\nbanks, gas sales, and the like, as well as other commercial and office uses that are\nof such size and scale that they can compatibly coexist with adjoining residential\nneighborhoods. To insure compatibility between B-3 areas and the neighborhoods,\nno B-3 district shall be greater than five acres, and no areas shall be zoned B-3 if\nany portion of a pre-existing business district lies within one-half mile in any\ndirection.

Accordingly, the following conditional zoning districts may be established:\nR-20-CZ, R-15-CZ, R-10-CZ, R-7.5-CZ, R-3-CZ, R-2-CZ, R-R-CZ, R-S.I.R.-CZ, and\nR-S.I.R.-2-CZ\nB-1(C)-CZ, B-1(G)-CZ, B-2-CZ, B-3-CZ, B-3-T-CZ, B-4-CZ, CT-CZ, O-CZ, O/A-CZ,\nM-1-CZ, M-2-CZ, M-3-CZ (AMENDED 4/27/10; 6/23/15; 10/23/18)\nThere may also be established a HR-CC-CZ zoning district, pursuant to the purpose\nstatement and criteria described in Section 15-136.1.\n(b)\nThe conditional zoning districts authorized by this section may be applied to\nproperty only in response to a petition signed by all the owners of the property to be included\nwithin such district.\n(c)\nSubject to the provisions of subsections (k), (1), and (n), the uses permissible\nwithin a conditional zoning district authorized by this section, and the regulations applicable to\nproperty within such a district, shall be those uses that are permissible within and those\nregulations that are applicable to the conventional use zoning district to which the conditional\ndistrict corresponds, except as those uses and regulations are limited by conditions imposed\npursuant to subsection (f) of this section. For example, property that is rezoned to a B-2-CZ\ndistrict may be developed in the same manner as property that is zoned B-2, subject to any\nconditions imposed pursuant to subsection (d). (AMENDED 10/23/18)\n(1)\nProperty that is zoned B-4-CZ may be developed for use classifications\n1.231 (duplex, maximum 20% units > 3 bedrooms/dwelling unit), 1.241\n(two family apartment, maximum 20% units > 3 bedrooms/dwelling unit),\n1.321 (multi-family residences, maximum 20% units > bedrooms/dwelling\nunit and 1.331 (multi-family, maximum 20% units > 3 bedrooms/dwelling\nunit) 1 in addition to other uses permissible in the B-4 district, subject to a\nspecial use permit-A, and the following: (i) not more than 25% of the total\nland area covered in this district may be developed for such uses; and (ii)\nthe area developed for such uses shall have a minimum of 1,500 square\nfeet per dwelling unit (except that applicable density bonuses shall\napply).\nPage #17\n\n\nNEW PAGE 18\nArt.

IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\na.\nWill not substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property;\nand\nb.\nWill be in harmony with the area in which it is to be located. The manner\nin which a project is designed to accommodate additional building\nheight including, but not limited to, scale, architectural detailing,\ncompatibility with the existing built environment and with adopted\npolicy statements in support of vibrant and economically successful and\nsustainable, mixed-use, core commercial districts shall be among the\nissues that may be considered to make a finding that a project is or is\nnot in harmony with the area in which it is to be located.
