Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Commercial Periphery\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CPY\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Commercial Periphery\n(CPY) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Commercial Periphery (CPY). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Commercial Periphery (CPY)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Commercial Periphery\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 74\nArticle 4 Zoning Districts\n4.5 Commercial Zoning Districts\n4.5.4.\nSpecial Standards in the CPY Zoning District\nD.\nOpen Space\nOpen space requirements for the residential portion of a multifamily or mixed commercial-residential\nproject shall be the same and conform to the requirements for multifamily developments in the MR-\n4-12\nCELL (1, 1):\nUse\nCELL (1, 2):\nDistrict\nCELL (1, 3):\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 4):\nMinimum\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 5):\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 6):\nMinimum\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 7):\nCELL (1, 8):\nYard\n(ft.)\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (2, 1):\nCELL (2, 2):\nCELL (2, 3):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 4):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 5):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 6):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 7):\nFront\nCELL (2, 8):\nRear\nCELL (2, 9):\nSide\nCELL (3, 1):\nAll residential, except\nCELL (3, 2):\nCPY\nCELL (3, 3):\n60\nCELL (3, 4):\n60\nCELL (3, 5):\n6,000\nCELL (3, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (3, 7):\n25\u00b3\nCELL (3, 8):\n63\nCELL (3, 9):\n51,2\nCELL (4, 1):\nmultifamily\nCELL (4, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (4, 3):\n75\nCELL (4, 4):\n75\nCELL (4, 5):\n7,500\nCELL (4, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (4, 7):\n253\nCELL (4, 8):\n253\nCELL (4, 9):\n102\nCELL (5, 1):\nMultifamily/ Mixed\nCELL (5, 2):\nCPY\nCELL (5, 3):\n100\nCELL (5, 4):\n150\nCELL (5, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (5, 6):\n15,000\nCELL (5, 7):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 8):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 9):\nCELL (6, 1):\ncommercial- residential\nCELL (6, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (6, 3):\n100\nCELL (6, 4):\n100\nCELL (6, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (6, 6):\n7,000\nCELL (6, 7):\nCELL (6, 8):\nCELL (6, 9):\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"CELL (2, 5):\\nWith\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 5):\\n6,000\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (2, 6):\\nWithout\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 6):\\n10,000\" 74]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"For district CPY, the section provides the information for min_unit_size.

It also includes a reference to any\nspecific standards that may apply to a particular use type.\n2.\nUse types are organized by one of four (4) different use classifications (residential, institutional, commercial,\nor industrial), and all the rows within a particular use classification have the same color.\n3.\nWithin each use classification, use types are further organized by use category. See Section 18.4.2, Use\nClassifications, Categories, and Types, for more details on the use category organizing system.\nB.\nUses Permitted By Right. A \"P\" in a cell of the principal use table indicates that the specific use type is\npermitted by right in the corresponding zoning district, subject to compliance with any additional standards\nreferenced in the principal use table.\nC.\nUses Requiring Special Use Review. An \"S\" in a cell of the principal use table indicates that the specific use\ntype is permitted in the corresponding zoning district only upon approval of a special use permit in\naccordance with Section 18.2.4.R, Special Use Permit, and any additional standards referenced in the\nprincipal use table.\nD.\nProhibited Uses.\n1.\nA \".\" in a cell of the principal use table indicates that the specific use type is prohibited in the corresponding\nzoning district.\n2.\nThe following principal uses are prohibited throughout the Town's zoning jurisdiction in all zoning districts:\na.\nHazardous materials handling;\nb.\nOff-premise signage, including outdoor advertising or billboards;\n135 of 355\n4/13/24, 12:13\n\n\nNEW PAGE 136\nAtlantic Beach, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nC.\nHelicopter landing pads, or helicopter landings, except as part of an emergency;\nd.\nShooting range (whether indoors or outdoors);\ne.\nSingle-room occupancy dwelling units;\nf.\nExplosives and chemical manufacturing;\ng.\nLeather and leather products manufacturing involving tanning;\nh.\nIndustrial uses (light and heavy) exceeding twenty thousand (20,000) square feet in floor area; and\ni.\nSlaughter or rendering of animals, excluding seafood products.\nj.\nSelf-storage facilities.\nE.\nAdditional Standards.\n1.\nWhen a specific use type is permitted in a zoning district, there may be additional standards that are\napplicable. Such additional standards are referenced in the principal use table column titled \"Additional\nStandards.\" These standards shall apply to a specific use type regardless of the zoning district, unless\notherwise specified.\n2.\nIn addition, use types are also subject to any district standards listed in the applicable zoning district in\nArticle 18-3: Zoning Districts.\nF.\nUnlisted Uses.
