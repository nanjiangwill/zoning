Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-6\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential\n(R-6) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Residential (R-6). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential (R-6)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

A fence buffer shall be required on three sides of a lot or parcel where multi-\nfamily dwelling units are constructed unless the lot is adjacent to a vacant lot or the adjacent lot contains natural\nfeatures, such as a stream, which would lend itself as a natural buffer. The fence shall be a seven-foot wooden\nfence constructed in a manner SO as to make the fence opaque.\n(12) Drainage requirements. Stormwater run-off shall be retained on site to the maximum extent\nfeasible. Suggested methods for accomplishing this are through the use of porous asphalt or paving block for the\nparking lots, similar to \"turf stone\" or its equivalent. If impermeable asphalt or concrete is used for the parking\nlot surface, medians, perimeter strips or islands within the parking area must be used as collectors and reservoirs\nfor stormwater run-off. No water shall drain onto or across public streets or sidewalks or into adjacent property\nexcept into a drainage easement. Vegetated buffer strips shall be created, or where practicable, retained in their\nnatural state along the banks of all watercourses, waterbodies, or wetlands. The width of the buffer shall be\nsufficient to prevent erosion, trap the sediment in overland run-off, provide access to the waterbody, and allow\nfor periodic flooding without damage to structures.\n(Prior Code, \u00a7 62-8) (Ord. passed 6-13-1972; Ord. 7, passed 6-4-1985; Ord. passed 12-5-1989; Ord. passed\n2-21-1989; Ord. passed 8-4-2010)\n\u00a7 153.20 MANUFACTURED HOME ZONE.\nIn this zone, a building or land shall be used only for the following purposes.\n(A) Uses permitted.\n(1) Any use permitted in any Residential Zone, provided, however, any building erected in the\nManufactured Home Zone for residential purposes shall comply with all requirements of the R-6 Residential\nZone, except multi-family dwellings.
