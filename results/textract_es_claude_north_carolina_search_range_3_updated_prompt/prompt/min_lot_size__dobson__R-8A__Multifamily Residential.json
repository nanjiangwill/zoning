Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Multifamily Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-8A\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Multifamily Residential\n(R-8A) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Multifamily Residential (R-8A). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Multifamily Residential (R-8A)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Multifamily Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_lot_size is typically between 1,000 and 2,000,000 sq ft or 0.02 and 50 acres. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 11\n\nR-8A Zone\n\nCELL (2, 1):\nField\nCELL (2, 2):\nValue\nCELL (3, 1):\nmin_lot_size\nCELL (3, 2):\n123456 sq ft\nCELL (4, 1):\nApartment Area\nCELL (4, 2):\n10,000\n\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"CELL (3, 2):\\n123456 sq ft\", 11]],\n    \"rationale\": \"The cell that corresponds to the value for min_lot_size in this table has this answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"123456 sq ft\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 32\n\nSection 6.3 Industrial Area & Dimensional Requirements\n1 Public Sewer or Public Water\n2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\n3 For proposed warehouse/manufacturing uses 35%, for all other uses 25%, subject to\nCommission's authority to permit greater coverage based on landscape, architectural design\nand site development elements that exceed minimum standard of the Regulation\n4\nShall be in addition to requirements of 8.1.2 Landscaping and Buffers\n6-4\n\nCELL (1, 1):\nCELL (1, 2):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 3):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 4):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 5):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 6):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 7):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 8):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (1, 10):\nCELL (2, 1):\nZone\nCELL (2, 2):\nMin\nArea\nCELL (2, 3):\nMin\nWidth\nCELL (2, 4):\nMin\nDepth\nCELL (2, 5):\nMax\nStories\nCELL (2, 6):\nMax\nHeight\nCELL (2, 7):\nMax % Lot\nCoverage\nCELL (2, 8):\nMin\nFront\nYard\nCELL (2, 9):\nMin\nSide\nYard\nCELL (2, 10):\nMin\nRear\nYard\nCELL (3, 1):\nI\nCELL (3, 2):\n20,000\nsq. ft.\nCELL (3, 3):\n100'\nCELL (3, 4):\n100'\nCELL (3, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (3, 6):\n50'\nCELL (3, 7):\nN/A\nCELL (3, 8):\n25'\nCELL (3, 9):\n20'\nCELL (3, 10):\n20'\nCELL (4, 1):\nR-8A\nCELL (4, 2):\n40,000\nsq. ft. 1\nCELL (4, 3):\n150'\nCELL (4, 4):\n150'\nCELL (4, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (4, 6):\n50'\nCELL (4, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (4, 8):\n50'\nCELL (4, 9):\n20'\nCELL (4, 10):\n20'\nCELL (5, 1):\nR-8A\nCELL (5, 2):\n60,000\nsq. ft. 2\nCELL (5, 3):\n200'\nCELL (5, 4):\n200'\nCELL (5, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (5, 6):\n50'\nCELL (5, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (5, 8):\n50'\nCELL (5, 9):\n20'\nCELL (5, 10):\n20'4\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"1 Public Sewer or Public Water\", 32],\n        [\"2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\", 32],\n        [\"CELL (4, 2): \\n40,000\\nsq. ft.\", 32],\n        [\"CELL (5, 2): \\n60,000\\nsq. ft.\", 32]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"From this page we can infer that the value is conditional on the presence of a public sewer or water system, and there are two different values for the current zone, depending on that.\",\n    \"answer\": \"40,000 sq ft (if public water or sewer); 60,000 sq ft (otherwise)\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 66\n\nR-8A Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 123 sq ft, side length is 10 ft\n\nNEW PAGE 67\n\nR-8A Zone - Senior Active Overlay\n\nmin_lot_size is 1523 sq ft\n\nDKEWKWKDS Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 20,000 sq ft\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"min_lot_size is 123 sq ft\", 66]],\n    \"rationale\": \"The section titled R-8A says the answer explicitly.

General use zoning districts each have a corresponding\nconditional zoning district. Each district was formulated using goals and recommendations from the Town of\nDobson Land Use Plan.\nR-A Residential-Agricultural District\nThe intent of the R-A Residential-Agricultural District is to maintain a rural development\npattern in the extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) area where single-family housing will be\nseparated from one another by open field or wooded areas. The impact of one homeowner's\nactivities on his neighbor will be less than if the property owners were located side by side in a\nsubdivision. Consequently, the property owner may have more freedom to use his land as he\nsees fit.

Because development\nwill be on smaller lots than in the R-A District, more restrictions will be imposed on\nlandowners. Generally, these areas are not served by municipal water or sewer.\nR-15 Residential District\nThe intent of the R-15 Residential District is to provide a quiet, medium-density residential\nneighborhood inside the corporate limits that is served by both public water and sewer.\nR-8A Residential Multifamily District\nThe intent of the R-8A Multifamily Residential District is to provide areas for high density\nresidential development such as apartments and condominiums. It is expected that both\npublic water and sewer will be available within the corporate limits.\nR-MH Manufactured Home Residential District\nThe intent of the R-MH Manufactured Home Residential District is to insure that\nmanufactured home parks meet minimal development standards in order to protect the\nresidents of these parks as well as neighboring land owners.\nPR-CD Planned Residential Conditional District\nThe purpose of the PR-CD Planned Residential Conditional District is to encourage the\ndevelopment of environments which provide certain development privileges in exchange for\npreplanning and design considerations. The PR-CD provides an alternative to conventional\nsubdivision design by promoting the conservation and creation of viable, connected open\nspace and more flexible lot design options while minimizing development costs.\nO-I Office-Institution District\nThe intent of the Office-Institution District is to provide locations primarily for office and\ninstitutional development, although single-family dwellings are also permitted. Normally this\ndistrict provides a buffer between nonresidential and residential zoning districts.\nB-1 Central Business District\nThe intent of the B-1 Central Business District is to provide an area near the center of Dobson\nwhere compatible commercial and governmental uses may be established that do not infringe\non neighboring residential uses.\nB-2 Highway Business District\nabout:blank\n28/167\n\n\nNEW PAGE 29\n6/3/24, 7:55 PM\nDobson, NC Code of Ordinances\nThe intent of the B-2 Highway Business District is to provide areas along thoroughfares and\ncollector streets for commercial uses, particularly the sales of retail goods and provision of\nservices.\nL-I Light Industrial District\nThe intent of the L-I Light Industrial District is to provide sites for manufacturing,\nwarehousing, processing, and related uses whose operating characteristics limit their effects\non adjacent uses.\nH-I Heavy Industrial District\nThe intent of the H-1 Heavy Industrial District is to provide sites for industrial, processing, and\nrelated operations whose external effects could be detrimental to certain classes of uses. This\ndistrict shall normally be located so that traffic to and from the use has direct access to an\narterial street and shall not be located directly adjacent to residentially zoned land.\nTABLE OF

Some land uses are of such a\nnature and scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediate area and on the entire\ncommunity, which cannot be predetermined and controlled by the standards of a general use district. In\naddition, this process will ensure compatibility with the Town's Land Use Plan and other adopted plans. The\nreview process established in this Article provides for a specific review process subject to specific conditions\nwhich mitigate concerns with the proposed development and ensure compatibility of the use with the\nsurrounding community.\n8.2 - General Requirements.\nProperty may be placed in a conditional district only in response to a petition by the owners of all the\nproperty to be included. Specific conditions applicable to these districts may be proposed by the petitioner\nor the Town, but only those conditions mutually approved by the Town and the petitioner may be\nincorporated into approval and permit requirements.
