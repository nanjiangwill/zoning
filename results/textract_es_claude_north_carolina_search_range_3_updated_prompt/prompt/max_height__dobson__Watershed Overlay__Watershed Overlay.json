Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Watershed Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"Watershed Overlay\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Watershed Overlay\n(Watershed Overlay) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Watershed Overlay (Watershed Overlay). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Watershed Overlay (Watershed Overlay)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Watershed Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Perimeter lots within PR-CDs which are adjacent to existing\nsingle family zoning districts shall meet the minimum lot area and dimensional requirements\nof the underlying zoning district. Where perimeter lots in PR-CDs do not meet the minimum\nlot area and dimensional requirements of the surrounding zoning district, a minimum 30 foot\nbufferyard is required between these lots and the adjacent single family zoning district. The\nbufferyard shall contain a minimum of four (4) canopy trees, ten (10) understory trees, and 33\nshrubs per 100 linear feet. The planting material comprising the buffer shall be spread across\nthe width of buffer and not just planted in rows.

This bufferyard shall\nbe located on commonly owned land and shall be considered open space. Where any\nindividual lot in the PR-CD does not meet the dimensional and area requirements of the\nunderlying zoning district and abuts existing single family zoning, the aforementioned\nbufferyard shall be required along the entire length of the PR-CD that abuts the existing\ndevelopment.\n(F) Common Open Space.\n(1)\nabout:blank\n62/167\n\n\nNEW PAGE 63\n6/3/24, 7:55 PM\nDobson, NC Code of Ordinances\nArea.

Open space shall be held in common ownership by a homeowners association or accepted by\nthe Town as public open space.\n(2) Land within a floodway or floodway fringe, as defined by FEMA, may be used to provide not\nmore than 50% of the required open space.\n(3) To qualify as open space, land shall be usable for recreation purposes or shall provide visual,\naesthetic, or environmental amenities and may not be occupied by streets, drives, parking\nareas, or structures other than recreational structures. At least 30% of the gross area (unless\notherwise allowed by the Board of Commissioners) dedicated (for open space) must be\nsuitable for and designed to be used as active recreation space (for example, walking trails,\nball fields, playgrounds, and the like).\n(4) Letter of Credit for Maintenance of Open Space Required. Following inspection and approval\nof the construction and/or installation of all required recreational areas in each phase of the\ndevelopment, the developer shall submit a letter of credit issued in the Town's favor, for 100%\nof the annual maintenance cost of these facilities as agreed upon and approved by the Town\nManager and/or Zoning Enforcement Officer. Such letter of credit shall be renewed every 12\nmonths until such time as the developer ceases to have the controlling vote in the\nhomeowner's association, as recorded in the articles of incorporation of the homeowner's\nassociation, and the Town has received written notice thereof along with a copy of the names,\naddresses, and phone numbers of all duly elected members of the homeowner's association\nBoard of directors.\n(5) Access to Open Space. All property owners within the development shall have access to open\nspace by means of a public street or improved walkway located in an easement at least 15\nfeet in width.\n(6) Open Space Connectivity Requirements. Where practicable, areas of open space within a PR-\nCD shall be connected. Separate areas of active open space on site shall be connected by a\nsidewalk or pedestrian path consisting of an all weather surface. Open space in PR-CDs shall\nadjoin open space in neighboring parcels where practicable. If public parks or greenways are\npresent on adjacent sites, a pedestrian connection to these resources shall be made from the\nPR-CD.\n(7) Maintenance of Open Space. Maintenance of the open space, as shown on the approved plan,\nshall be required in perpetuity and shall be the responsibility of the homeowner's association.\n(8) Alternative Compliance. Alternative compliance measures may be proposed which vary from\nthe strict application of the above requirements in order to accommodate the unique\ncharacter of the site or to utilize innovative design.
