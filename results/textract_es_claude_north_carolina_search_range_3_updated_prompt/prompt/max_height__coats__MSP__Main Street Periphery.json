Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Main Street Periphery\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MSP\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Main Street Periphery\n(MSP) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Main Street Periphery (MSP). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Main Street Periphery (MSP)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Main Street Periphery\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

The standards\nand specifications set forth below are established to ensure that new development and\nconstruction is enduring and compatible with the character of the Town of Coats, that it\naccomplishes the purposes of this Ordinance, and that it achieves the goals identified in\n\"the Plan\" referenced in Article 1 of this Ordinance and other adopted and or approved\nplans.\n9.2\nDetached House Lot and Building Type\n9.2-1 Description. The detached house is the most prevalent building type in Coats. The\ndetached house building type is generally found in residential neighborhoods,\nalthough it may coexist with other, similarly scaled buildings in commercial or\nmixed-use areas. Where possible, structures should be designed to maintain a\nharmonious image of the neighborhood when viewed from a distance. Where\nappropriate and possible, structures shall be designed to terminate vistas. For\ndetached homes on large lots accessed by a private drive, building placement and site\nplanning shall be dictated by landscape features and landscape preservation. Within\nthe limits described below and unless the zoning district standards require greater\nmeasures, these regulations shall apply to all houses built in the Town of Coats.\nThe photographs of detached single-family houses in the Carolinas below are\nexamples for illustration purposes only and not intended to regulate lot/building\nstyles, patterns, or forms.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 1\n\n\nNEW PAGE 171\n9.2-2 Detached House Lot Type.\n(A.) Building Placement, Parking, and Vehicle Access.\n(1.) Along new streets:\n(a.) the front setback shall be measured behind street ROW;\n(b.) the rear setback shall be measured from the rear property line;\n(c.) the side setbacks on interior lots shall be measured from the side property\nline;\n(d.) the side setback on corner lots for the side of the building that faces the street\nshall be measured from the street ROW on a corner lot.\n(2.) Building placement may be further defined by zoning districts.\n(3.) Parking standards of Article 12 apply (see Section 12.3 and Table 12-1).\n(4.) Accessory structures, including detached garages, shall be located at least 5'\nbehind the primary structure.\n(5.) Only in the most exceptional circumstances having to do with extreme\ntopography or very special design composition may the rules of residential\nbuilding placement be varied.\n(6.) Grading shall provide for smooth grade transitions to avoid abrupt \"V\" ditches,\nswales and other disruptions to the landscape, particularly between buildings\nwhere open space enhancements for use by persons actively utilizing the\nlandscape and/or yard area. The use of either crawlspace and/or stem-wall\nconstruction techniques in detached residential structures, or professional\nlandscape design is required to meet this characteristic of site development.\n(7.) The maximum building coverage for the primary structure shall be 30% of the lot\narea.\n(8.) Driveways to individual lots shall be separated a minimum of 47 linear feet,\nmeasured at the right-of-way along streets, within the TNDO.\n(B.) Encroachment, Pedestrian Access, and Commercial Use Standards & Specifications.\n(1.) Primary pedestrian access into the building shall be from the street frontage line\nwith a concrete walkway connecting the edge of street or back of curb to base of\nstep for emergency response to primary residence. Walkways shall be built to\nsidewalk standard. Secondary access may be from parking areas.\n(2.) Balconies, stoops, stairs, open porches, bay windows, and awnings are permitted\nto encroach into the front setback area up to 8'.\n(3.) Mechanical equipment exceeding 16 square feet shall not encroach into any\nrequired setback.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 2\n\n\nNEW PAGE 172\n(4.) Commercial Use in a Detached House in the Main Street (\"MS\"), Main Street\nPeriphery (MSP), Mixed Use (\"MU\"), and \"TNDO\" Districts shall comply with\nthe following:\n(a.) Parking shall be located in the side or rear yards only. If provided in the side\nyards, the parking area shall not exceed 25% of the frontage line and shall not\nbe in the yards adjacent to a street.\n(b.) Parking areas on adjacent mixed-use lots shall be connected whenever\npractical.\n(c.) Trash containers shall be located in the rear yard. If adjacent to existing\nsingle-family residential uses, trash containers shall be limited to residential\nrollout containers only, dumpsters are prohibited.\n(d.) Mechanical equipment at ground level shall be placed on the parking lot side\nof the building away from buildings on adjacent sites and shall be screened\nfrom view by an opaque screen.\n(e.) Hedges, garden walls, or knee walls may be built immediately adjacent to\nproperty lines or as the continuation of building walls. A garden wall, hedge\nor knee wall, a minimum 2.5' in height, maximum 3.5' in height, shall be\ninstalled along any street frontage adjacent to parking areas. Knee walls shall\neither be built of brick, stone or other decorative masonry material, or shall be\nbuilt of wrought iron or other decorative metal, and shall generally match the\narchitectural style of Coats.\n9.2-3 Detached House Building Type.\n(A.) Permitted Height, Uses, Encroachments, and Resiliency Standards.\n(3.) Permitted uses are controlled by zoning district standards.\n(4.) A minimum 8\" overhanging gable end-rake and vented leaves shall be provided\nand finished by profiled molding or gutters to prevent wind-driven rain from\ncompromising structure.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 3\nCELL (1, 1): \n(1.)

Vinyl siding materials are prohibited except where approved landscape plans\nrestrict the use of pine needles or other combustible bedding material within eight\n(8) feet of the foundation wall.\n(B.) Architectural Standards in approved \"TNDO\" Districts requested by the developer.\n(1.) Principles for maintaining the character of the Town:\n(a.) To perpetuate the unique building character of the Town and its environs, and\nto re-establish its local identity, development shall generally employ building\nstyles that are compatible with the architectural vocabulary of the area in their\nexternal treatment. Manufactured homes shall not be permitted as part of\nany development.\n(b.) The front elevations facing the street and the overall massing must\ncommunicate an emphasis on the human scale and the pedestrian\nenvironment. The intention of buildings in all locations must be to relate the\nprincipal facade to the sidewalk and public space of the street to maintain\ncompatibility with the character of structures within the Town.\n(c.) Each building shall be designed to form part of a larger composition of the\narea in which it is situated. Adjacent buildings should thus be of similar scale,\nheight, and configuration to maintain compatibility with the character of\nstructures within the Town.\n(d.) Building silhouettes should be generally consistent. The scale and pitch of\nroof lines should thus be similar across groups of buildings to maintain\ncompatibility with the character of structures within the Town.\n(2.) Configurations & Techniques:\n(a.) Main roofs on residential buildings should be symmetrical gables or hips with\na pitch of between 4:12 and 12:12. Mono-pitch (shed) roofs should be\nattached to the wall of the main building. No mono-pitch roof should be less\nthan 4:12. Grandiose roof pitches with multiple changes of outline are\nacceptable. It is recommended that accessory buildings have roof pitches that\nconform to those of the main building to maintain compatibility with the\ncharacter of structures within the Town.\n(b.) Front Porches extending across a minimum of 40% of the fa\u00e7ade width,\nexcluding front-loading garages, shall average 6'-0\" in depth from fa\u00e7ade to\nfront edge and be included on all Detached Single-family and Duplex (Two-\nfamily) houses.\n(c.) Balconies should generally be simply supported by posts and beams. The\nsupport of cantilevered balconies should be assisted by visible brackets to\nmaintain compatibility with the character of structures within the Town.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article Page 4\n\n\nNEW PAGE 174\n(d.) Two wall materials may be combined horizontally on one facade. The\n\"heavier\" material should be below to maintain compatibility with the\ncharacter of structures within the Town.\n(e.) Exterior chimneys should be finished in brick or stone to maintain\ncompatibility with the character of structures within the Town.\n(f.) Overhanging leaves may expose rafters to maintain compatibility with the\ncharacter of structures within the Town.\n9.3\nAttached House Lot Type and Building Type Standards\n9.3-1\nDescription. The attached house is also known as row-house or Town house.\nTraditional southern homes in Savannah and Charleston provide a model. The\nSouthside neighborhood in Greensboro provides a good contemporary example.\nGenerally, building plans will have narrow frontages with the plan depth being\ngreater than its width. Groups of attached house buildings that are not integrated into\na pedestrian oriented mixed-use urban pattern shall not be permitted within Coats.\nAttached house structures should complement the neighborhood through their design,\nlocation on the site, and building materials. Within the limits described below and\nunless the zoning district standards require greater measures, these regulations shall\napply to all attached houses built on public streets.\nThe photograph (left) is\nof a four-unit single-\nfamily attached town-\nhouse property in\nKannapolis, North\nCarolina is an example\nfor illustration purposes\nonly and is not intended\nto regulate lot/building\nstyles, patterns, or\nforms.\nThe photograph (right) of a six-unit\nsingle-family attached town-house\nproperty in Concord, North\nCarolina is an example for\nillustration purposes only and is not\nintended to regulate lot/building\nstyles, patterns, or forms.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 5\n\nNEW PAGE 303\n12.14-1\nLocation. Off-street loading spaces shall be located on the same zone lot as the\nuse they serve except in the Main Street (MS) District where spaces may be off-site\nand shared with other uses provided the cumulative number of spaces required for\ncombined uses meets the requirements of Section 12.14-4 herein.\n12.14-2\nMinimum Size. The minimum size for off-street loading space(s) shall be 250\nsquare feet with a minimum width of ten (10) feet.\n12.14-3\nArrangement. All off-street loading spaces shall be arranged and marked to\nprovide for orderly and safe unloading and loading, and shall not hinder the free\nmovement of vehicles and pedestrians. All loading and unloading maneuvers shall\ntake place on private property. No backing in from street or maneuvering on right-of-\nway shall be permitted, except in the Main Street (MS) District.\n12.14-4 Minimum Number of Loading Spaces Required.\n(A.)
