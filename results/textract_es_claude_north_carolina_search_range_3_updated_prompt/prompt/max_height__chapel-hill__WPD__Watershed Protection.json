Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Watershed Protection\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"WPD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Watershed Protection\n(WPD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Watershed Protection (WPD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Watershed Protection (WPD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Watershed Protection\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Permanent\nstructures shall be located, to the maximum extent feasible, as far from the watercourse, and as close to the outer boundary of the resource conservation district, as is practical. Permanent\nstructures shall be clustered as much as practical, to minimize land disturbance, to maximize undeveloped open space, and to maximize retention of natural vegetation and buffers. Integrated\nmanagement practices, as described in section 5.4, shall accompany all development within the resource conservation district.\n(5) Water supply, sanitary sewer, and on-site waste disposal systems shall be designed to:\nA. Prevent the infiltration of flood waters into the system(s),\nB. Prevent discharges from the system(s) into flood waters and,\nC. Avoid impairment during flooding to minimize flood damage. Finished floor elevations to be served by sanitary sewer shall be at or above the rim elevation of the nearest upstream\nmanhole cover or be otherwise approved by the town manager.

The smallest practicable area of land shall be exposed at any one time during development. Such minimal area shall be kept\nexposed as short a duration of time as is practical. Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be used as needed to protect exposed areas. Natural plant covering and vegetation shall be\nretained and protected to the maximum degree practical when developing the site, as shall natural features and terrain. Disturbed areas shall be replanted with native trees, shrubs and\nground cover.\n(9) Cutting or filling shall be permitted within the watercourse only if the resulting change to the hydraulic characteristics of the watercourse will:\nA.\nReduce or maintain the water surface elevation during the base flood discharge in the vicinity of the development; provided however, that in no case will cutting or filling be permitted\nwithin the watercourse if greater than a one foot per second increase in the velocity would result; or\nB. Reduce or maintain the velocity of flow during the base flood discharge in the vicinity of the development; provided however, that in no case will cutting or filling be permitted within the\nwatercourse if greater than one-half (1/2) foot rise in the base flood elevation would result.\n(10) All new construction and/or substantial improvements (including the placement of prefabricated buildings and manufactured homes) shall be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored\nto prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.\n(11) All manufactured homes permitted to be placed within resource conservation district shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement by meeting the minimum\nrequirements of the North Carolina Building Code (latest revision).\n(12) Any manufactured home, new manufactured home park or new manufactured home subdivision permitted to be placed within the resource conservation district shall:\nA.

Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or\nmust meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:\nA. A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.\nB. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade.\nC. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other covering or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.\n(h) Procedures in resource conservation district.\n(1) Other approvals required.\nNo permit or approval required to be issued by the town under the provisions of this article shall be valid until all other permits or variances for the same proposal required by any other\nordinance of the town or statute of the State of North Carolina or the United States have been received from those agencies from which such permits or variances are required.\n(2) Records and filings.\nA.

When a landowner or other affected party believes that the town's Geographic Information System (GIS) coverages inaccurately depict surface waters, he or she shall consult the\ntown manager. Upon request, the town manager shall make an on-site determination. When considering affirmative exemption requests, the town manager shall examine the particular\nparcel of land, existing information related to the parcel or the area, and other relevant information.

With respect to\nthe requirements of section 3.6.3, the dwelling or dwelling unit as expanded pursuant to this subsection shall not be considered as nonconforming within the meaning of article 7;\n2. With respect to the requirements of section 3.6.3, development, other than single-family or two-family dwellings or single dwelling units within a townhouse development,\ndevelopment on any single zoning lot may be expanded to the extent of ten (10) percent or less of its footprint as it existed on January 27, 2003; however, this exemption shall not\napply in cases where a development has been expanded one (1) or more times since January 27, 2003, and where the past and proposed expansions, considered together, would\nincrease the development's footprint by a total of more than ten (10) percent of its footprint as it existed on January 27, 2003. With respect to the requirements of section 3.6.3, such\ndevelopment as expanded pursuant to this subsection shall not be considered as nonconforming within the meaning of article 7.\n(4)\nApplication of the resource conservation district to the reconstruction, rehabilitation renovation, or expansion of development existing within the regulatory floodplain and floodway.\nA.
