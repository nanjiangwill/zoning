Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-15\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential\n(R-15) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Residential (R-15). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential (R-15)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

In the event the owner of the\nWireless Support Structure or owner of the property on which it is located fails to\nremove the Wireless Support Structure within the sixty (60) day period, such\nowners are jointly and severally required to remove the same within six (6)\nmonths thereafter. The Town of Cedar Point shall ensure and enforce removal by\nmeans of its existing regulatory authority, with costs of removal charged to the\nowner.\n2. MULTIPLE USES ON A SINGLE PARCEL OR LOT.\nWireless Facilities and Wireless Support Structures may be located on a parcel\ncontaining another principal use on the same site as long as the required\nsetback/Fall Zone requirements can be met. Wireless Facilities and Wireless\nSupport Structures may also be located on a parcel and be the principal use itself.\nG. WIRELESS FACILITIES AND WIRELESS SUPPORT STRUCTURES IN\nEXISTENCE ON THE DATE OF ADOPTION OF THE REVISIONS OF THIS\nSECTION.\n1. Wireless Facilities and Wireless Support Structures that were legally permitted on\nor before the date this Ordinance was enacted shall be considered a permitted and\nlawful use.\n2. Activities at Non-Conforming Wireless Support Structures. Notwithstanding any\nprovision of this Ordinance:\n(a) Ordinary Maintenance may be performed on a Non-Conforming Wireless\nSupport Structure or Wireless Facility.\n(b)\nCollocation of Wireless Facilities on an existing non-conforming Wireless\nSupport Structure shall not be construed as an expansion, enlargement or\nincrease in intensity of a non-conforming structure and/or use and shall be\npermitted through the Administrative Approval process defined in Section\n7.12.B.1; provided that the collocation does not substantially modify the\nsize of the equipment compound at that location or otherwise substantially\nmodify the existing non-conformity.\n(c)\nSubstantial Modifications may be made to non-conforming Wireless\nSupport Structures utilizing the Special Use Permit process defined in\nSection 3.10.\n7.12 OPEN SPACE\nA. PURPOSE AND INTENT\nIt is the intent of this section to protect and promote the public health, safety, and\ngeneral welfare by requiring the dedication of a portion of land for the purpose of\npreserving open space and the protection of significant natural features and/or cultural\nresources.\nB. APPLICABILITY\nEvery applicant for a Site Plan Approval for residential and/or non-residential\nPage I 177\n\n\nNEW PAGE 178\npurposes involving the creation of multiple lots from a parent parcel shall be required\nto dedicate a portion of the parcel for the purpose of preserving open space, and to\npreserve significant natural features and/or cultural resources.\nC. DEDICATION REQUIREMENTS\n1. The applicant shall provide land for open space within the proposed development\nas required in Section 7.6 of this ordinance.\n2. Open space shall be accessible to all lots in the development through a\ncombination of direct access to the street and sidewalks, walkways or connecting\npaths.\n3. Land preserved for the purpose described in this section, shall only be eligible for\nfull credit towards the minimum open space requirement if it is an integral part of\nthe development. If the entire preserved area is located on the periphery of the\ndevelopment, the area shall only be credited for a maximum fifty (50) percent of\nthe required open space. The purpose of this limit is to ensure open space is not\nisolated but is an integral part of the development.\nD. PERMITTED USES WITHIN OPEN SPACE:\nOpen spaces required in this chapter may be used only as specified and as follows:\n1. Buffers required in Section 7.3, BUFFERS\n2. Undeveloped land without a designated purpose held by a property owners\nassociation or non-profit conservation entity\nE. PROHIBITED USES WITHIN OPEN SPACE:\nRequired open spaces may not be used for any of the following:\n1. Storm water management ponds, swales, conveyances, and treatment areas\n2. Recreation space (except as allowed in subsection F.1., below)\n3. Reserved rights of way\n4. Utility, drainage, or access easements\n5. Any land held in private ownership rather than commonly held by a property\nowners association or non-profit conservation entity\nF.\nADDITIONAL PERMITTED USES WITHIN OPEN SPACE AREAS\n1. Open space has no purpose that requires the construction of structures or\nmodification of the existing landscape or grade. An applicant may propose fences,\ncommunity gardens, and passive uses including walking trails, available to the\npublic or restricted to occupants of the development, at the time of development\nreview. The applicant shall construct any trails proposed, which may count toward\na recreational requirement in Section 7.6.D.4.(b).\n2. Utility easements may cross common open space, if necessary, to connect to the\narea network. To the maximum extent practicable, utility easement intersections\nwith open space shall be perpendicular to minimize land disturbance.
