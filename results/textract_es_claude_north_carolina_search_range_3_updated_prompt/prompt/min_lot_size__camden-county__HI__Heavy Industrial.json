Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Heavy Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"HI\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Heavy Industrial\n(HI) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Heavy Industrial (HI). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Heavy Industrial (HI)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Heavy Industrial\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found.

The district accommodates large-\nscale industrial uses including outdoor operations or\nstorage with extensive movement of vehicles,\nHeavy\nmaterials, and goods, truck traffic and greater potential\nfor adverse environmental and visual impacts on\nneighboring lands. The district allows limited forms of\nheavier commercial use types and residential\ndevelopment is prohibited (except for caretaker\nIndustrial\nquarters as an accessory use). District standards are\nintended to prevent the establishment of any use types\nthat would interrupt industrial operations. Extractive\noperations may only take place in accordance with\nState-issued permits and shall be returned to their pre-\nextraction state upon completion.\nNOTES:\n[1] The maximum lot coverage may be increased with approval from NCDEQ and compliance with all applicable stormwater management\nrequirements.\n[2] Applied in cases where there are two or more principal buildings on a lot.\nCamden County\nUnified Development Ordinance\n3-59\nLast Updated:\nAugust 1, 2022\nCELL (1, 1): \nB.\nCELL (1, 2): \nDimensional Requirements\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (2, 1): \n#\nCELL (2, 2): \nSTANDARD TYPE\nCELL (2, 3): \nREQUIREMENT\nCELL (3, 1): \nA\nCELL (3, 2): \nMinimum Lot Area (square feet)\nCELL (3, 3): \n87,120\nCELL (4, 1): \nB\nCELL (4, 2): \nMinimum Lot Width (feet)\nCELL (4, 3): \n125\nCELL (5, 1): \nC\nCELL (5, 2): \nMaximum Lot Coverage (% of lot area)\nCELL (5, 3): \n24 [1]\nCELL (6, 1): \nD\nCELL (6, 2): \nMinimum Front Setback (feet)\nCELL (6, 3): \n25; 50 for an extractive use\nCELL (7, 1): \nE\nCELL (7, 2): \nMinimum Corner Side Setback (feet)\nCELL (7, 3): \n25; 50 for an extractive use\nCELL (8, 1): \nF\nCELL (8, 2): \nMinimum Interior Side Setback (feet)\nCELL (8, 3): \n10; 50 from a residential zoning district or for\nCELL (9, 1): \nG\nCELL (9, 2): \nMinimum Rear Setback (feet)\nCELL (9, 3): \nan extractive use\nCELL (10, 1): \nH\nCELL (10, 2): \nMinimum Distance Between Buildings, Front-to-Back (feet) [2]\nCELL (10, 3): \n20\nCELL (11, 1): \nI\nCELL (11, 2): \nMinimum Distance Between Buildings, Side-to-Side (feet) [2]\nCELL (11, 3): \n20\nCELL (12, 1): \nCELL (12, 2): \nMinimum Accessory Building Setback (feet)\nCELL (12, 3): \n10\nCELL (13, 1): \nK\nCELL (13, 2): \nMaximum Building Height (feet)\nCELL (13, 3): \n50\n\n\nNEW PAGE 150\nARTICLE 151.3 Zoning Districts\nSection 3.6 Commercial Districts\n3.6.8 Heavy Industrial (HI) District\nCamden County\n3-60\nLast Updated:\nUnified Development Ordinance\nAugust 1, 2022\nCELL (1, 1): \nC.\nLot Pattern Example\nCELL (1, 2): \nD.\nCELL (1, 3): \nDistrict Dimensional Standards\nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nA\nOOOOOO\nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (3, 1): \nE.\nPreferred Development\nExamples\nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (3, 4): \nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (4, 3): \nCELL (4, 4): \nB\nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nCELL (5, 3): \nCELL (5, 4): \nCELL (6, 1): \nCELL (6, 2): \nCELL (6, 3): \nD\nF\nCELL (6, 4): \nCELL (7, 1): \nCELL (7, 2): \nCELL (7, 3): \nCELL (7, 4): \nCELL (8, 1): \nCELL (8, 2): \nCELL (8, 3): \nCELL (8, 4): \n\nNEW PAGE 151\nARTICLE 151.3 Zoning Districts\nSection 3.6 Commercial Districts\n3.6.8 Heavy Industrial (HI) District\nF.\nDevelopment Configuration Example\n600000\n\\\nB\nD\nG\nF\nLast Updated:\nAugust 1, 2022\n3-61\nCamden County\nUnified Development Ordinance\n\nNEW PAGE 197\nARTICLE 151.4 Use Regulations\nSection 4.4 Use-Specific Standards\n4.4.2 Residential Uses\nd.\nIt shall comply with the latest wind loading requirements for Camden County;\ne.\nIt shall maintain a minimum width of 16 feet;\nf.\nIt shall be oriented with the longest axis parallel to the lot frontage, to the maximum extent\npracticable;\ng.\nTowing apparatus, wheels, axles, and transporting lights shall be removed;\nh.\nIt shall include a continuous, permanent masonry foundation or masonry curtain wall of solid brick\nor brick veneer, unpierced except for required ventilation and access, installed under the perimeter;\ni.\nIt shall include stairs, entrance platforms, ramps, or other means of entrance and exit that are\ninstalled or constructed in accordance with the standards set by the State Building Code.

RULES OF MEASUREMENT\n10.2.1. PURPOSE\nThe purpose of this section is to clarify the rules of measurement and exemptions that apply to all principal and accessory\nuses allowed in this Ordinance. These standards may be modified by other applicable sections of this Ordinance.\n10.2.2.\nMEASUREMENTS, GENERALLY\nA.\nStraight Lines\nUnless otherwise stated in this Ordinance, distances specified in this Ordinance are to be measured as the length of\nan imaginary straight line joining two points.\nB.\nRounding\nAll calculations that result in a fractional unit or part of a whole number, the number shall be rounded up to the next\nhighest whole number, unless otherwise provided in this section or elsewhere in this Ordinance.\nC.\nIrregular Shapes\nIn cases where an irregular shape complicates the application of these standards, the UDO Administrator shall\ndetermine the applicable dimensional, setback, or bulk standards.\nD.\nSeparation\n1.\nLot to Lot\nWhen the provisions of this Ordinance require separation between two or more lots, or a lot and another\nfeature, separation shall be measured by drawing straight lines from the nearest point of one lot line to the\nnearest point of the lot line subject to the separation requirement (see Figure 10.2.2.D: Separation).\n2.\nUse Type to Use Type\nWhen the provisions of this Ordinance require one use type to be separated from another use type,\nseparation shall be measured by drawing straight lines from the nearest point of the wall of the existing or\nproposed principal structure to the nearest point of the wall of the existing or proposed structure subject to\nthe separation requirement.\nFIGURE 10.2.2.D: SEPARATION\nA\nLEGEND\nA\nLot-to-Lot Separation\nB Use Type-to-Use\nType Separation\nB\nLot Line\nCELL (1, 1): \nCamden County\nCELL (1, 2): \n10-5\nCELL (1, 3): \nLast Updated\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nFebruary 4, 2019\n\n\n Output:"}]}
