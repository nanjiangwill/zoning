Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Heavy Industrial District\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"HI\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Heavy Industrial District\n(HI) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Heavy Industrial District (HI). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Heavy Industrial District (HI)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Heavy Industrial District\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

Setback Measurement\na.\nSetback distances shall be measured from the property line or street right-of-way line to\na point on the lot that is directly below the nearest extension of any part of the building\nthat is substantially a part of the building itself and not a mere appendage to it (such as a\nflagpole, etc.).\nb. If the street right-of-way line is readily determinable (by reference to a recorded map, set\nirons, or other means), the setback shall be measured at a right angle to such right-of-\nway line. If the right-of-way line is not so determinable, the setback shall be measured\nfrom the street centerline.\nC. All setbacks are subject to compliance with adopted applicable fire code provisions.\nC. Relationship of Building to Lot\nIn no case shall there be more than one principal building and its customary accessory buildings\non a lot except in the case of a designed complex of professional, residential or commercial\nbuildings in an appropriate zoning district.\nD. Street Access\nNo building shall be erected on a lot which does not abut a street or have access to a street,\nprovided that in a planned development, a building may be erected adjoining a parking area or\ndedicated open space which has access to a street used in common with other lots.\nE. Infill Development Standards\nInfill development is any new development on land that has been previously developed or vacant\nland where development has occurred around the vacant land.\n1.\nStreet Frontages. New structures should orient windows, main entrances, and other\nprimary building fa\u00e7ade elements toward the street. Care should be taken to avoid the\nappearance of buildings turning their backs or sides toward the street.\n2.\nFront Setback Pattern. The minimum front setback required may be reduced by the\nAdministrator for any lot where the average established front yard setback on developed lots\nlocated within 300 feet on each side of such lot, and fronting on the same street as such lot,\nis less than the minimum required yard setback. In such cases, the minimum front or street\nyard setback may be less than that required but not less than the average of the existing\nfront yard setbacks on the developed lots within 300 feet of each side. In addition, for new\nlots created from existing larger lots, the lot width at the frontage line and the side yard\nsetbacks shall be consistent with the immediately adjacent neighboring parcels on the same\nside of the street.\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-3\nADOPTION DATE: JANUARY 13, 2020\n\n\nNEW PAGE 59\nGENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\n3.\nDriveways. On lots less than 50 feet in width, only one driveway of no more than 12 feet in\nwidth may be used to provide access to garages or off-street parking areas.\n4. Rhythm of Development. Garages or off-street parking areas shall be located in the side or\nrear setback area only.\nF. Irregular Lot Setbacks\nThe location of required front, side and rear yard setbacks on irregularly shaped lots shall be\ndetermined by the Administrator. The determination will be based on the intent and purpose of\nthis ordinance to achieve an appropriate spacing and location of buildings and buildings on\nindividual lots. Where questions arise as to appropriateness, the subdivider may be requested to\nprovide additional design information.\n510.030 Fences & Walls\nAll fences and walls shall comply with the requirements of this Section unless specifically approved\nas part of a Conditional District, Special Use Permit or Variance.\nA. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, fences that are no taller than six (6) feet may be\nbuilt along interior side and rear property lines.\nB. Exterior side yard fences that are no taller than six (6) feet shall be at least five (5) from the right-\nof-way.\nC. Fences in front yards are discouraged, but must be:\n1. Located least two (2) feet from the right-of-way and no closer than two (2) feet from the\ninside edge of the sidewalk;\n2. Less than sixty (60) percent opaque; and\n3. Not exceed four (4) feet in height, except that wrought iron and split rail style fences may be\nup to five (5) feet tall.\nD. No fence shall obstruct any traffic safety visibility zone.\nE. Barbed wire, razor wire or other fence materials designed to cut or puncture are prohibited in all\ndistricts, except in the B-2, LI, HI and CON districts.\nF. Deer fences may be erected around gardens provided that the fences are located at least ten\n(10) feet from the nearest property line.\n510.040 Parking and Loading\nA. Purpose and Intent\nThis Section establishes the minimum requirements for the number of spaces and the design of\nparking areas in the Town of Ayden. This Section provides administrative flexibility for the\nAdministrator to adjust the number of required spaces and the design of spaces to provide for\nadequate parking, accommodate unique site conditions and capitalize on the benefits of parking\nopportunities on-street or in shared parking areas.\nB. Applicability\nThe requirements of this Section shall be applicable to all new development and changes of use\nthat create the need for parking or increase existing parking demands.\nC. Parking Space Requirements\nPermanent off-street parking (including on-street parking in accordance with the requirements\nbelow) is required subject to the table below. If required, parking shall be provided at the time of\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-4\nADOPTION DATE: APRIL 12, 2021\n\n\nNEW PAGE 60\nARTICLE 5\nerection, alteration, enlargement, establishment or change of use of any building or open use of\nland which require additional off-street parking.\nD. Exemptions and Adjustments\n1. Exemptions. Uses in the B-1 District are exempt from the minimum parking requirements of\nthis Section.\n2. Tree Preservation. The minimum number of parking spaces required may be adjusted by\nthe Administrator when it has been determined that the reductions are necessary to preserve\na healthy tree or trees (with a 12 inch or greater diameter at breast height) from being\ndamaged or removed, and where the site plan provides for the retention of said tree or trees.\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-5\nADOPTION DATE: JANUARY 13, 2020\nCELL (1, 1): \nLAND USE TYPE\nCELL (1, 2): \nMINIMUM REQUIRED AUTO\nSPACES\nCELL (1, 3): \nMINIMUM REQUIRED\nBICYCLE PARKING\nSPACES\nCELL (2, 1): \nRESIDENTIAL:\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (3, 1): \nDwelling - Single Family & Two\nFamily\nCELL (3, 2): \n1 per unit or 2 per unit if parking is\nprovided in an enclosed garage\nCELL (3, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (4, 1): \nDwelling - Multifamily\nCELL (4, 2): \n1.5 per unit\nCELL (4, 3): \n2 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (5, 1): \nDwelling - Accessory\nCELL (5, 2): \n1 per unit\nCELL (5, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (6, 1): \nResidential Care Facilities\nCELL (6, 2): \n1 per 2 resident rooms\nCELL (6, 3): \n1 per 40 auto spaces\nCELL (7, 1): \nAll other residential uses\nCELL (7, 2): \n1 per unit\nCELL (7, 3): \nNo requirement\nCELL (8, 1): \nLODGING AND ACCOMMODATIONS:\nCELL (8, 2): \nCELL (8, 3): \nCELL (9, 1): \nAll uses\nCELL (9, 2): \n1 per room\nCELL (9, 3): \n1 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (10, 1): \nOFFICE AND SERVICES:\nCELL (10, 2): \nCELL (10, 3): \nCELL (11, 1): \nMedical Clinic\nCELL (11, 2): \n1 per examination room\nCELL (11, 3): \n1 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (12, 1): \nAll other Office & Service Uses\nCELL (12, 2): \n1 per 700 sf\nCELL (12, 3): \n1 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (13, 1): \nCOMMERCIAL AND ENTERTAINMENT:\nCELL (13, 2): \nCELL (13, 3): \nCELL (14, 1): \nRestaurant\nCELL (14, 2): \n1 per 400 sf\nCELL (14, 3): \n2 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (15, 1): \nIndoor Amusement\nCELL (15, 2): \nNo requirement\nCELL (15, 3): \n2 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (16, 1): \nOutdoor Amusement\nCELL (16, 2): \nNo requirement\nCELL (16, 3): \n2 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (17, 1): \nTheater (Indoor or Outdoor)\nCELL (17, 2): \n1 per 8 seats\nCELL (17, 3): \n2 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (18, 1): \nAll other Commercial and\nEntertainment Uses\nCELL (18, 2): \n1 per 500 sf\nCELL (18, 3): \n2 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (19, 1): \nMANUFACTURING, INDUSTRIAL AND WHOLESALE TRADE:\nCELL (19, 2): \nMANUFACTURING, INDUSTRIAL AND WHOLESALE TRADE:\nCELL (19, 3): \nCELL (20, 1): \nAll uses\nCELL (20, 2): \n1 per 1,000 sf\nCELL (20, 3): \nNo requirement\nCELL (21, 1): \nEDUCATION & INSTITUTIONS:\nCELL (21, 2): \nCELL (21, 3): \nCELL (22, 1): \nChild/Adult Day Care Centers (more\nthan 8 persons)\nCELL (22, 2): \n1 space per classroom\nCELL (22, 3): \n1 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (23, 1): \nReligious Institutions\nCELL (23, 2): \n1 per 8 seats in main assembly hall\nCELL (23, 3): \n1 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (24, 1): \nSchools (elementary & secondary)\nCELL (24, 2): \n1 per 8 seats in main assembly hall\nor gymnasium\nCELL (24, 3): \n2 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (25, 1): \nStudio\nCELL (25, 2): \n1 per 400 sf\nCELL (25, 3): \n1 per 20 auto spaces\nCELL (26, 1): \nAll other Education and Institution\nuses\nCELL (26, 2): \n1 per 500 sf\nCELL (26, 3): \n1 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (27, 1): \nAGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY:\nCELL (27, 2): \nCELL (27, 3): \nCELL (28, 1): \nAll uses\nCELL (28, 2): \nNo requirements\nCELL (28, 3): \nNo requirements\nCELL (29, 1): \nCOMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE:\nCELL (29, 2): \nCOMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE:\nCELL (29, 3): \nCELL (30, 1): \nAll uses\nCELL (30, 2): \nNo requirement\nCELL (30, 3): \nNo requirements\n\nNEW PAGE 61\nGENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nE.

Adjoining parking lots serving (or potentially serving) non-residential or multifamily uses\nshall be interconnected as follows:\n(1) The parking lot under development has a minimum of 24 parking spaces or\nequivalent parking area.\n(2) At least 1 connection is provided at all lot lines that are coincident for at least 60 feet\nwith another lot zoned for non-residential use.\n(3) The connection is at least 20 feet wide.\n(4) If applicable, the connection aligns with a connection that has been previously\nconstructed on an adjacent property.\n(5) The connection has a slope of no greater than 15 percent.\n(6) The connection is not placed where a building on an adjacent property is within 50\nfeet of the lot line which would hamper traffic movements within the parking lot.\n(7) The connection is placed in an area which will not require the removal of significant\nnatural features such as wetlands or trees with a caliper of 6 inches or more.\n(8) In the event these conditions cannot be met without undue hardship, or if such\nconnections would create undesirable traffic flow, the Administrator may waive the\nconnection requirement.\n(9) Where a parking lot connection is required an easement for ingress and egress to\nadjacent lots shall be recorded by the property owner with the Pitt County Register of\nDeeds in the form of an easement plat.\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-8\nADOPTION DATE: APRIL 12, 2021\n\nNEW PAGE 85\nGENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nvalue. If the appraisals differ by more than 15%, the value will be based on the\naverage of the two appraisals.\n3. Where a combination of land dedication and payments in lieu are approved, the\nsubdivider shall be given a credit equivalent to the appraised value per acre of land\ndedicated for recreation purposes. The credit amount shall be determined by\nmultiplying the number of acres to be dedicated by the appraised value per acre. If\nthe total payment in lieu as determined above is larger than the credit amount, the\nsubdivider shall pay the difference between the two amounts. If the credit amount\nis larger than the total payment in lieu as determined above, no additional payment\nin lieu is required. However, the subdivider may not transfer the excess credit from\none subdivision to another.\n4. Upon approval by the Board of Commissioners, payment in lieu of dedication shall\nbe made at the time of final subdivision plat approval. All monies received by the\nTown of Ayden pursuant to these requirements shall be used only for the acquisition\nand development of recreation, park, and open space sites to serve the residents of\nthe development and the residents of the immediate neighborhood within which the\ndevelopment is located. The Board of Commissioners shall also have the authority to\nsell land dedicated pursuant to these provisions with the proceeds of any such sale\nused solely for the acquisition of other recreation, park, or open space sites within the\nimmediate neighborhood within which the development is located.\nM. Ownership & Maintenance\nThe designated common open space and common facilities are outlined in Article 7 -\nSubdivisions and Infrastructure of this ordinance.\n510.080 Landscaping and Buffering\nA. Findings and Purpose\nThe standards established in this ordinance are intended to preserve, protect, restore and\nenhance the aesthetic appeal and scenic beauty of this town; provide adequate buffering\nbetween land uses; reduce noise and air pollution; reduce stormwater run-off; filter and reduce\nglare from artificial light sources; provide shaded areas along streets, sidewalks and in parking\nlots; provide a continuity of vegetation throughout the town; encourage the preservation of\nexisting trees and vegetation; safeguard and enhance property values; and protect the public\nhealth, safety and general welfare.\nB. Applicability\nThe landscaping and buffering standards of this section shall apply to the following:\n1. All new developments (except for infill single-family detached) shall be designed in\naccordance with the requirements of this Article.\n2. Pre-existing development\na. Non-conforming preexisting development is subject to these standards as follows:\n(1) A change in type of occupancy, as set forth in the North Carolina Building Code;\n(2) A change in land use which requires an increase in the number of off-street parking\nspaces or the provision of a buffer yard;\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-30\nADOPTION DATE: APRIL 12, 2021\n\n\nNEW PAGE 86\nARTICLE 5\n(3) Additions or expansions which singularly or collectively exceed 25% of the land area\nor gross building floor area existing at the effective date of this ordinance.\nb. The Town of Ayden recognizes that designing preexisting development to meet new\nregulations is more difficult and expensive than applying these standards to\nundeveloped properties. Therefore, greater flexibility will be afforded preexisting\ndevelopment in meeting the requirements of this section, in that:\n(1) A modification of up to 25% percent may be granted by the Administrator for planting\narea and dimension requirements where compliance presents hardships due to\nbuilding location, lot size, or vehicular area configuration;\n(2) A credit for reducing required off-street parking by 1 space shall be given for the\nconstruction of each landscape island.\nC. Street Trees\n1. Street trees are an essential part of the town streetscape. The Town seeks to maintain\nexisting trees where possible and to encourage the planting and continuance of the\nestablished street tree patterns.\n2. To accomplish this objective, the following shall apply:\na.\nAll subdivisions and developments subject to site plan approval shall provide street\ntrees along their frontage with adjacent public streets.\nb.\nStreet trees shall be selected from the list of large trees, or, where power lines are\nlocated, small trees included in Appendix A - Official Planting List.\nC. Planting strips shall be a minimum of six (6) feet wide.\nd. Planting location shall take into consideration planned roadway widening, public safety,\nstandard drainage requirements and maintenance of sight distances for traffic safety.\nStreet trees may be planted within the right-of-way, within planting strip abutting the\nright-of-way or other location approved by the Administrator.\n3. Street trees, unless subject to overhead power lines, shall be planted at the rate of one (1)\ntwo-inch caliper tree per thirty (30) feet of property line abutting a public street, excluding\ndriveways and traffic visibility zones. This rate may be varied based upon existing trees and\nthe crowns of planted trees.\n4. Trees used to meet buffer and vehicle use area requirements, may be used to meet the\nstreet requirements to the extent that the trees are located within twenty-five (25) feet of a\nstreet.\nD. Buffer Yard Requirements\nBuffers provide compatible transitions between differing land uses, reduce the visual impacts of\ndevelopment and retain existing plant materials.\n1. Buffers are required along the common property lines between developments in different\nzoning districts or between developments of different uses as established in this Section.\n2. Buffer requirements shall not apply when a public street or railroad right-of-way separates\napplicable zoning districts or uses accept where new lots created by a Major Subdivision\nPreliminary Plat abuts but has no access to Major or Minor Thoroughfare. When this\noccurs, a streetyard buffer meeting the Type A Buffer criteria standards shall be provided\nadjacent to the thoroughfare right-of-way. The preservation of existing healthy vegetation\nin the streetyard buffer is strongly encouraged.\n3. The chart below establishes the minimum buffer widths for proposed development.\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-31\nADOPTION DATE: JANUARY 13, 2020\n\n\nNEW PAGE 87\nGENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nA = Type A Buffer\nB = Type B Buffer\nC = Type C Buffer\nNotes:\n1. A proposed nonresidential use locating next to vacant property shall be required to install a\nType C buffer yard.\n2.\nA non-residential or multi-family residential use with 10 or more units adjacent to a RR, RA-20,\nR-12, R-10, or R-8 zoning district shall be required to install a Type C buffer yard.\n3.\nUse of a vacant parcel with a valid plan or permit approval shall be considered developed for\nthe approved use.\n*\nPUD District shall determine buffer yards as specified in the master plan.\nE. Buffer Yard Composition\nThe required buffer yard types may be established using a combination yard widths,\nevergreen trees, canopy trees, understory trees, shrubs, fences, walls, and berms. The\nfollowing tables illustrate the required elements for each buffer yard type.\n1. Type A Buffer: The intent of the Type A Buffer is to create a completely opaque buffer,\nhaving no horizontal openings from the ground to a height of 8 feet within 2 years of\nplanting.

A Type C Buffer can be\nachieved in 2 ways as specified below.\nF. Additions to Buffers and Screening\nWhen it is determined that the conflict of land use is so great that the public safety is not\nserved adequately by the minimum buffer and screening requirements, or where there is a\nneed to prevent a high degree of visual, audio, or physical disorders, then the Administrator\nmay require the installation of fencing or earthen berms in addition to the minimum required\nbuffers and screening, according to the standards below.\n1. Fencing or Walls. Where required as part of a buffer yard, fencing or walls must\nadhere to the provisions below. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the owner of a\nsingle family dwelling from constructing a separate fence along the borders of such\nproperty, provided that all required buffer plantings are maintained.\na. In all cases, the finished side of the fence must face the use with the lower intensity.\nb.\nPermitted fence or wall materials include: masonry, stone, architectural block,\nstucco on masonry, wood or other similar of solid appearance.\nC. The design of fencing or walls shall be sufficient to meet the extent of physical\nscreening required by the Administrator.\nd. The height of the fence shall be determined by the Administrator based on the\nfollowing variables: site conditions; topography; use; and/or building height. The\nminimum height of a fence or wall required by this section shall be 6 feet.\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-33\nADOPTION DATE: JANUARY 13, 2020\nCELL (1, 1): \nType B Buffer Yard Options\nCELL (1, 2): \nMin.
