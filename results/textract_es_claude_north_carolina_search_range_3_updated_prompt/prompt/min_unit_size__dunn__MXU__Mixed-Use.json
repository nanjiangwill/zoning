Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Mixed-Use\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MXU\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Mixed-Use\n(MXU) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Mixed-Use (MXU). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Mixed-Use (MXU)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Mixed-Use\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft).

More specifically, the intent of these regulations is to provide for\nadequate buffering between incompatible land uses; protect, preserve and enhance the aesthetic appeal and\nscenic beauty of the city; reduce noise and air pollution; reduce storm water run-off; filter and reduce glare\nfrom artificial light sources; and provide shaded areas along streets and in parking lots.\nB.\nAPPLICABILITY\nThe landscaping and buffering standards of this Section shall apply to the following:\n1. All new developments (except for infill single-family detached) shall be designed in accordance with the\nrequirements of this Article.\n2. Pre-existing development\na. Non-conforming preexisting development is subject to these standards as follows:\n(1) A change in type of occupancy, as set forth in the North Carolina Building Code\n(2) A change in land use which requires an increase in the number of off-street parking spaces or\nthe provision of a buffer yard\n(3) Additions or expansions which singularly or collectively exceed 25% of the land area or gross\nbuilding floor area existing at the effective date of this ordinance.\nb. The City of Dunn recognizes that designing preexisting development to meet new regulations is more\ndifficult and expensive than applying these standards to undeveloped properties. Therefore, greater\nflexibility will be afforded preexisting development in meeting the requirements of this Section, in\nthat:\n(1) A modification of up to 25% percent may be granted by the Administrator for planting area and\ndimension requirements where compliance presents hardships due to building location, lot size,\nor vehicular area configuration.\n(2) A credit for reducing required off-street parking by one (1) space shall be given for the\nconstruction of each landscape island.\nC.\nSTREET TREES\n1. Street yard trees are an essential part of the City streetscape. Street trees or front yard trees are planted\nin the public right-of-way or on in the front yard of private property, just outside of the right-of-way line.\nCITY OF DUNN, NC\n6-34\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nADOPTION DATE: 04.11.2023\n\n\nNEW PAGE 123\nARTICLE 6\nGENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nThe City seeks to maintain existing trees where possible and to encourage the planting and continuance\nof the established street tree patterns. To accomplish this objective, the following shall apply:\na.\nAll subdivisions and developments subject to approval shall provide street trees along their frontage\nwith adjacent public streets.\nb. Street trees shall be planted on private property or on the public right-of-way. When planted on\nprivate property, they shall be located five (5) to ten (10) feet from back of curb or edge-of-sidewalk,\nwhichever is greater, or as close as possible to those criteria.\nC.\nStreet trees shall be selected from the list of small or understory trees, or, where power lines are\nlocated, small trees included in Appendix B of this ordinance.\nd. Where necessary, planting strips shall be a minimum of five (5) feet wide.\ne.\nPlanting location shall take into consideration planned roadway widening, public safety, standard\ndrainage requirements, and maintenance of sight distances for traffic safety.\n2. Front yard trees, unless subject to overhead power lines, shall be planted at the rate of one (1) two-inch\ncaliper tree per forty (40) feet of property line abutting a public street, excluding driveways and traffic\nvisibility zones. This rate may be varied based upon planned signage areas, existing trees, and the\ncrowns of planted trees.\n3. Trees used to meet buffer and vehicle use area requirements, may be used to meet the street\nrequirements to the extent that the trees are located within twenty-five (25) feet of a street.\nD.\nBUFFER YARD REQUIREMENTS\n1. Buffers provide compatible transitions between differing land uses, reduce the visual impacts of\ndevelopment and retain existing plant materials.\n2. In situations where a development is adjacent to multiple uses then the most restrictive buffer requirement\nfor a property line shall be required along each side and rear property line abutting the property, otherwise\nthe development shall follow the requirements listed below.
