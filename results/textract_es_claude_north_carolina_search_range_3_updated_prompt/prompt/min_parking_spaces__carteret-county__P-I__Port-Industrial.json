Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Port-Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"P-I\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Port-Industrial\n(P-I) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Port-Industrial (P-I). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Port-Industrial (P-I)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Port-Industrial\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

The overlay district shall\napply to any property located within this area as shown on the official zoning map. Areas identified in this overlay district include Compatible Use Zone 1, Compatible\nUse\nZone 2 and Noise Exposure Levels 1, 2 and 3. The following requirements apply in addition to the requirements of the underlying zoning district:\n1. Disclosure for all property transfers and leases for greater than 90 days. The local disclosure statement is required for all property transfers and for\nleases greater than 90 days. All properties located in the AICUZ Overlay District are required to disclose the proximity to Bogue Field prior to transfer. See\nSample Disclosure Form.\n2. List of permitted and special uses. Compatible Use Zones (CUZ-1 and CUZ-2) have been included in Section 3400 [Table of Permitted and Special Uses].\nPermitted uses may be developed, providing that the use meets the zoning requirements for the underlying zoning district and other requirements of\nthis ordinance. If the use is listed as a special use in CUZ-1 or CUZ-2, a special use permit must be secured for the specific request.\n3. Subdivision plats. All subdivision plats with any lots located within the Bogue Field AICUZ Overlay District shall have those properties designated that are\nlocated within any Compatible Use Zone or noise exposure level.

In addition, combining the parking and access of several parcels\nshall be encouraged as an objective to minimize driveways, increase landscaping, and make parking for uses more convenient and attractive. Shared parking may allow\na reduction in total parking requirements, for example, where uses have complementary parking demands or the combined uses qualify as a 'shopping center,\" etc. No\nshared parking shall be installed or otherwise implemented without the express written approval of the Planning Director or designee. The factors that the Planning\nDirector or designee might consider in approving or denying a request for shared parking include, but are not limited to, number of spaces, cross-access easements,\naccess/egress points, driving aisles, islands, striping, signage, and landscaping.\n(Amend. of 10-15-07(3))\n3004.
