Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Conservation\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Conservation\n(CO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Conservation (CO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Conservation (CO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Conservation\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

District Boundaries Shown on Zoning Map\nThe boundaries of the districts are shown on the map accompanying this Ordinance and made a\npart hereof and entitled \"Official Zoning Map, Village of Alamance, North Carolina.\" The zoning\nmap and all the notations, references and amendments thereto, and other information shown\nthereon are hereby made a part of this Ordinance the same as if such information set forth on\nthe map were all fully described as set out herein. The zoning map is posted at the Village of\nAlamance Village Hall and is available for inspection by the public.\nSection 4-9.\nRules for Interpretation of District Boundaries\nA. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the Official Zoning\nMap, the following rules shall apply:\n1. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streets or\nhighways, shall be construed to follow such center lines;\n2. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the right-of-way of streets or\nhighways, shall be construed to follow such rights-of-way;\n3. Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed\nas following such lot lines;\n4. Boundaries indicated as approximately following Village limits shall be construed as\nfollowing such Village limits;\n5. Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to be midway\nVillage of Alamance Zoning Ordinance\nPage 29\n\n\nNEW PAGE 32\nDraft #7\nZONING ORDINANCE\nChapter 4 District Regulations\nbetween the main tracks;\n6. District boundaries indicated as approximately parallel to or extensions of features\nindicated in subsections 1 through 5 above shall be so construed and at such\ndistance therefrom as indicated on the Official Zoning Map. Distance not specifically\nindicated on the Official Zoning Map shall be determined by the scale of the map.\n7. Where a district boundary divides a lot which was in single ownership at the time of\npassage of these regulations, the Board of Adjustment may, as a special exception,\npermit the extension of the regulations for either portion of the lot not to exceed\nfifty feet beyond the district boundary line into the remaining portion of the lot.\nSection 4-10. Interpretation of District Regulations Applicable to Unlisted Uses\nThe procedure provided for below shall be used to determine if an unlisted use shall be\npermitted within the Village's Zoning jurisdiction. Additional uses in character with a district\nmay be added to this Ordinance by amendment.\nFindings by the Board of Aldermen: Where a particular use category or use type is not listed or\nclosely aligned to a use in the Permitted Uses Table, the Administrator shall make a\nrecommendation to the Board of Aldermen at the next scheduled meeting as to whether the\nproposed use should be permitted or denied. The Board of Aldermen shall make the final\ndecision after considering the following criteria:\n1. intent of the Ordinance concerning the district(s) involved\n2. the character of the proposed use\n3. the impact of the proposed use on the zoning district taking into consideration:\na. the type, size and nature of buildings and structures;\nb. the impact on adjacent properties created will not be greater than that ofother\nuses in the zoning district;\nC. parking requirements and traffic generation;\nd. whether the intensity, volume, size or the operation or activity has thepotential\nto be a nuisance to the surrounding properties\nFollowing determination by the Board, the property owner/applicant shall be immediately\nadvised of the decision\nVillage of Alamance Zoning Ordinance\nPage 30\n\n\nNEW PAGE 33\nDraft #7\nVILLAGE OF ALAMANCE ZONING ORDINANCE\nSection 4-11.
