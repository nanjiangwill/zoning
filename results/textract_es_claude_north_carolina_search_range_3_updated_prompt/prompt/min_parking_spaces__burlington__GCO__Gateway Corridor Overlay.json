Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Gateway Corridor Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"GCO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Gateway Corridor Overlay\n(GCO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Gateway Corridor Overlay (GCO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Gateway Corridor Overlay (GCO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Gateway Corridor Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

MIXED-USE DESIGN STANDARDS\n1. Purpose and Intent\nThe purpose for these standards is to create vibrant, pedestrian-oriented areas of residential and non-\nresidential use that are located in the same building or in close proximity to one another on the same\nsite. More specifically, these standards are intended to:\na. Create well-designed, desirable places for City residents and visitors to shop, dine, recreate, and\nlive;\nb. Ensure development within mixed use areas is compact and walkable;\nC.\nShorten travel times and support alternative modes of transportation by reducing the need for\nautomobile travel within urban portions of the City;\nd. Encourage human-scaled development that is pedestrian-oriented;\ne. Reduce development costs by facilitating the most dense forms of development in areas easily\nserved by public infrastructure; and\nf.\nAccommodate both vertically mixed-use development within an individual building as well as\nhorizontally mixed-use development on a single site.\n2. Applicability\nThe standards in this section shall apply to all the following:\na. New development within the MX district;\nb. Live/work dwellings;\nC. Upper story residential; and\nd. Any development that includes principal use types from the residential and commercial or\ninstitutional use classifications in Table 4.2.C, Principal Use Table, within the same building or\nwithin the same development site; and\ne. The demolition, addition, or expansion of existing structures in accordance with the following\ntable:\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\nCity of Burlington\n5-72\nUnified Development Ordinance\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\nCELL (1, 1): \nTABLE 5.5.B.2: APPLICABILITY OF MIXED-USE DESIGN STANDARDS\nCELL (1, 2): \nTABLE 5.5.B.2: APPLICABILITY OF MIXED-USE DESIGN STANDARDS\nCELL (2, 1): \nTYPE OF STRUCTURE OR ACTIVITY\nCELL (2, 2): \nAPPLICABILITY OF MIXED-USE\nDESIGN STANDARDS\nCELL (3, 1): \nNew principal structure(s) on a vacant site\nCELL (3, 2): \nFull compliance required\nCELL (4, 1): \nConstruction of a new principal structure following\nremoval of an existing principal structure\nCELL (4, 2): \nFull compliance required\nCELL (5, 1): \nAddition or expansion to an existing principal structure\nalready subject to the commercial design standards\nCELL (5, 2): \nFull compliance required\nCELL (6, 1): \nAddition or expansion to an existing principal structure\nconstructed prior November 1, 2019 or not subject to the\nmixed-use design standards [1]\nCELL (6, 2): \nExempt from mixed-use design\nstandards\nCELL (7, 1): \nInterior or exterior upfit of an existing principal structure\nwith no addition of floor space constructed prior to\nNovember 1, 2019 or not subject to the mixed-use design\nstandards\nCELL (7, 2): \nExempt from mixed-use design\nstandards\nCELL (8, 1): \nSite improvement of an existing site with no changes to\nexisting principal structure(s)\nCELL (8, 2): \nMixed-use design standards not\napplicable\n\n\n Output:"}]}
