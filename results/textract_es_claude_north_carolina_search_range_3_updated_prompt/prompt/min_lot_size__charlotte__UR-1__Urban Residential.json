Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Urban Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"UR-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Urban Residential\n(UR-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Urban Residential (UR-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Urban Residential (UR-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Urban Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.
