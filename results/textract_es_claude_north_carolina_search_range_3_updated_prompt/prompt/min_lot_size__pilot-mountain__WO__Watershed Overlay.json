Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Watershed Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"WO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Watershed Overlay\n(WO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Watershed Overlay (WO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is \nnot for the zone \"Watershed Overlay (WO)\" but for other zones. \nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Watershed Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Purpose. The purpose of establishing supplementary requirements for development in\ndowntown Pilot Mountain is to protect and enhance the visual character of development and\nto preserve the unique streetscape of downtown by encouraging compatibility among\ndowntown structures. It is not the intent of this overlay district to eliminate architectural\nfreedom or discourage innovative design, but rather to complement the Town of Pilot\nMountain's Development Ordinance and development guidelines for Downtown.\n2.\nApplicability. Buildings within the Downtown Design Overlay (DDO) District exhibit design\nelements that contribute to the unique sense of character of downtown Pilot Mountain.\nSpecifically, buildings tend to have flat or low pitch roofs concealed by the front facade\nparapet, no front or side yard setback, large storefront windows on the street level floor and\nstrong horizontal separations between the first and any upper floors created by windows and/\nor changes in fa\u00e7ade materials.\nIn order to continue and, in some cases, recreate the historic development pattern of\ndowntown Pilot Mountain, the following standards shall apply to all new construction,\nadditions and substantial modifications to existing structures located within the Downtown\nDesign Overlay (DDO) District. For the purposes of this section substantial modification shall\nbe defined as any work which involves the alteration of the building's footprint, construction of\nadditional stories, changes in roof pitch, modification of building fenestration and entryways,\nmaterial changes to the building fa\u00e7ade, or painting.\n3. Exemptions. When in compliance with all other town ordinances, the following types of\nprojects are exempt from the standards of the Downtown Design Overlay (DDO) district:\na. Interior and exterior alterations of buildings that were originally designed and built for\nsingle-family residential use and continue to be used for single-family residential use.\nb. Underground construction which does not consist of any above ground components,\nincluding utility boxes, pipes, poles or similar appurtenant features;\nC. Conducting regular maintenance work on buildings, landscaping, or grounds,\n(including parking lots), which does not significantly alter the appearance or function\nof the building, landscaping or grounds;\nd. Interior remodeling work, which does not involve the alteration of any building\ncomponent that does not alter any exterior building component;\ne. Landscape maintenance and upkeep, excluding the replacement trees;\nf. Temporary uses and structures;\ng. Routine roof maintenance and repair, when using like materials; and\nh. Painting of murals on the side and/or rear fa\u00e7ade of buildings.\n4. Design Standards\n\nNEW PAGE 89\ntime to time by the Board of Commissioners to cover cost of advertising as required\nby this chapter.\nC. The proposed request for a minor or major watershed variance shall include a site\nplan, drawn to scale of at least one (1\") inch to forty (40') feet, indicating the property\nlines of the parcel upon which the use is proposed; any existing or proposed\nstructures; parking areas and other built-upon areas; surface water drainage. The site\nplan shall be neatly drawn and indicate north point, name and address of person who\nprepared the plan, date of the original drawing, and an accurate record of any later\nrevisions.\nd. The Ordinance Administrator shall notify in writing each local government having\njurisdiction in the watershed. Notice shall include a description of the variance being\nrequested. Local governments receiving notice of the variance request may submit\ncomments to the Ordinance Administrator prior to a decision by the Planning and\nZoning Board. Comments shall become a part of the record of proceedings of the\nPlanning and Zoning Board.\ne. The Planning and Zoning Board shall duly fulfill its requirements of public notification,\nevidentiary public hearing and quasi-judicial procedure as provided in this chapter and\nin the NC General Statutes for watershed variances, as for all other variances from\nthe zoning regulations of the Town.\nf. Proceedings of the Planning and Zoning Board. The Board shall keep records of\nthe proceedings, prepare a report containing findings of fact, conclusions of law and\nrecommended decision and forward the record to the Environmental Management\nCommission (which must approve all major watershed variances). A denial of a major\nwatershed variance by the Planning and Zoning Board need not go to the EMC for\nreview. One copy of any report forwarded to the EMC shall be kept on file by the\nClerk.\ng. Major Watershed Variances. If the Planning and Zoning Board decides in favor of\ngranting a major watershed variance, the Board shall prepare a preliminary record of\nthe hearing with all deliberate speed. The preliminary record of the hearing shall\ninclude:\ni. The variance application;\nii. The bearing notices;\niii. The evidence presented;\niv. Motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence and rulings, on them;\nV. Proposed findings and exceptions;\nvi. The proposed decision, including all conditions proposed to be added to the\npermit; and\nvii. The preliminary record shall be sent to the Environmental Management\nCommission for its review as follows:\nIf the Commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance\nqualifies as a major variance and that the property owner can secure no\nreasonable return from, nor make any practical use of the property unless the\nproposed variance is granted, and the variance, if granted, will not result in a\n\n\nNEW PAGE 90\nserious threat to the water supply, then the Commission shall approve the\nvariance with conditions and stipulations. The Commission shall prepare a\nCommission decision and send it to the Planning and Zoning Board. If the\nCommission approves the variance as proposed, the Board shall prepare a\nfinal decision granting the proposed variance. If the Commission approves the\nvariance with conditions and stipulations, the Board shall prepare a final\ndecision, including conditions and stipulations granting the proposed variance.\nIf the Commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance\nqualifies as a major watershed variance and that the property owner can\nsecure a reasonable return from or make a practical use of the property\nwithout the variance or the variance, if granted, will result in a serious threat to\nthe water supply, then the Commission shall deny approval of the variance as\nproposed. The Commission shall prepare a Commission decision and send it\nto the Planning and Zoning Board. The Board shall prepare a final decision\ndenying the variance as proposed.\n10. WSII-CA (O) Watershed II Critical Area (Overlay). The WSII-CA(O) is established as an\noverlay district to impose higher standards in the critical area because the risk of water\nquality degradation from pollution is greater than in the balance of the watershed, most of\nwhich lies within the extraterritorial boundary of the town. The regulations of this district are\nintended to promote higher developmental standards and not limit unnecessarily\ndevelopmental options. In order to maintain a predominantly undeveloped land use intensity\npattern, residential and non-residential uses shall be allowed at a maximum of one (1)\ndwelling unit per two (2) acres and six percent (6%) built-upon area respectively.\na. Limitations on Certain Permitted Uses\ni. Agriculture, provided that all agricultural activities will be encouraged to\nparticipate in the agricultural Cost Share Program and subject to the\nprovisions of the Food Security Act of 1985 and the Food, Agriculture,\nConservation and Trade Act of 1990. Agricultural activities conducted after\nJanuary 1, 1993 shall maintain a minimum ten-foot vegetative buffer, or\nequivalent control as determined by the Soil and Water Conservation\nCommission, along all perennial waters indicated on the most recent versions\nof U.S.G.S. 1:24,000 (7.5 minute) scale topographic maps or as determined\nby local governments studies. Animal operations greater than 100 animal units\nshall employ Best Management Practices (BMP's) by July 1, 1994\nrecommended by the Soil and Water Conservation Commission.\nii. Silviculture, subject to the provisions of the Forest Practices Guidelines\nRelated to Water Quality (15 N.C.A.C. 11.0101 - 11.0209).\niii. Residential development at one dwelling unit per two acres on a project-by-\nproject basis. For purposes of density calculations, total project acreage shall\nnot include any area within the designated right-of-way of any public or private\nstreet within the project, nor shall it include any area within the project donated\nor dedicated to the public, except for storm water control structures approved\nunder the high-density option. No residential lot shall be less than two acres,\nexcept within an approved cluster development.\nb. Prohibited Uses\n\n\nNEW PAGE 91\ni. Sanitary landfills are prohibited.\nii. No new chemical storage or new underground fuel storage tanks are allowed.\niii. The storage of toxic and hazardous materials is prohibited unless a spill\ncontainment plan is implemented.\niv. Sites for land application of sludge/residuals or petroleum-contaminated soils\nare prohibited.\nC. Development Applications. In addition to the standards for Site Plans, the following\nshall be contained on applications for development in the Watershed Overlay:\ni. Total impervious area;\nii. Location of perennial streams;\niii. Septic tank drainage field; and\niv. Sedimentation and erosion controls.\nd. Minimum Lot Area. 87,120 square feet (or two (2) acres) minimum lot area per\ndwelling unit. Because of the high likelihood of a septic tank, a potential buyer should\nfirst check with the Surry County Health Department to determine adequacy of the lot,\nas a larger lot could be required.\n11. WSII-BW (O) WSII-Balance of Watershed (Overlay). The WSII-BW (O) is established as an\noverlay district to impose lower standards in the balance of the watershed area because the\nrisk of water quality degradation from pollution is less than in the critical area of the\nwatershed. The regulations of this district will allow residential uses at a maximum of one (1)\ndwelling unit per acre and non-residential development at twelve percent (12%) built-upon\narea. Projects must minimize built-upon surface area, direct storm water away from surface\nwaters and incorporate Best Management Practices to minimize water quality impacts. Non-\ndischarging landfills and sludge applications sites are allowed.\na. Limitations on Certain Permitted Uses\ni. Agriculture, provided that all agricultural activities will be encouraged to\nparticipate in the agricultural Cost Share Program and subject to the\nprovisions of the Food Security Act of 1985 and the Food, Agriculture,\nConservation and Trade Act of 1990.\nii. Silviculture, subject to the provisions of the Forest Practices Guidelines\nRelated to Water Quality (15 N.C.A.C. 11.0101 - 11.0209).\niii. Residential development at one dwelling unit per acre on a project-by-project\nbasis. For purposes of density calculations, total project acreage shall not\ninclude any area within the designated right-of-way of any public or private\nstreet within the project, nor shall it include any area within the project donated\nor dedicated to the public, except for storm water control structures approved\nunder the high-density option. No residential lot shall be less than one (1)\nacre, except within an approved cluster development.\nb. Prohibited Uses\n\nNEW PAGE 92\ni. No new discharging landfills.\nii.

In addition to the standards for Site Plans, the following\nshall be contained on applications for development in the Watershed Overlay:\ni. Total impervious area;\nii. Location of perennial streams;\niii. Septic tank drainage field; and\niv. Sedimentation and erosion controls.\nd. Density and Built-Upon Area Standards\ni. Residential. No residential lot shall be less than one (1) acre, except within an\napproved cluster development.\nii. Non-residential and Multi-Family. Development may exceed the twelve\npercent (12%) built-upon area on a project-by-project basis in that up to five\npercent (5%) of the balance of the watershed (or 161 acres) may be\ndeveloped for non-residential and multi-family development to seventy percent\n(70%) built-upon area on a project-by-project basis.\nRecords for the 5/70 watershed provisions within the WSII-BW (O). The Ordinance\nAdministrator shall keep records of the town's utilization of the provisions that a maximum of\nfive percent (5%) of the balance of the watershed area may be developed with non-\nresidential development to a maximum of seventy percent (70%) built upon area. Records\nshall include the total acres of non-critical watershed area, total acres eligible to be\ndeveloped under this option, total acres approved for this development option, and individual\nrecords for each project with the following information: location, acres, site plan, use, storm\nwater management plan as applicable and inventory of hazardous materials as applicable.\n\n\nNEW PAGE 93\nARTICLE 10 SIGN REGULATIONS\n10.1 Purpose\n10.2 Applicability\n10.3 General Sign Standards\n10.4 Prohibited Signs\n10.5 Temporary Signs\n10.6 Permanent Signs\n10.1 Purpose\nThe purpose of this Article is to promote the effective and compatible use of signage within the Town of\nPilot Mountain.\n10.2 Applicability\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Article, it shall be unlawful for any person to place, erect, construct,\nenlarge, move, or replace any sign, without first having obtained a permit for such sign from the Ordinance\nAdministrator.\n10.3 General Sign Standards\n1.

When a permit is required, a permit shall be issued prior to the installation or\nplacement of such sign.\na. Permanent Signs Requiring a Permit. The types of permanent signs listed below shall be\nrequired to receive a permit:\ni. Wall Signs (Section 10.6(2))\nii. Freestanding Ground Signs (Section 10.6(3))\niii. Awning Signs (Section 10.6(4))\niv. Projecting Signs (Section 10.6(5))\nV. Canopy Signs (Section 10.6(6))\nvi. Incidental Signs (Section 10.6(7)(a))\nvii. Off-Premise Directory Signs (Section 10.6(8))\nb. Signage Plan Required. For any lot on which the owner proposes to erect one (1) or more\nsigns requiring a permit or for a combined development or other multi-tenant development,\na signage plan shall be required, which includes the following information:\n\n\nNEW PAGE 94\ni. An accurate plot plan of the lot or parcel, at such scale as the Ordinance\nAdministrator may reasonably require;\nii. Location of buildings, parking lots, driveways, and landscaped areas on such lot or\nparcel;\niii. Computation of the maximum total sign area, the maximum area for individual signs,\nthe height of signs, and the number of signs of each type allowed on the lot(s) or\nparcel(s) included in the plan under this Article; and\niv. An accurate indication on the plot plan of the proposed location of each present and\nfuture sign of any type.\nC. Temporary Signs Requiring a Permit. The display of certain temporary signs, including\nthe recurring placement of certain signs where permitted, shall require a permit for such\ntemporary sign prior to its display.\ni. Temporary Signs Requiring a Permit\n(1) Type 3 Freestanding Temporary Signs (Section 10.5(3)(d))\nd. Permit Procedure and Standards\ni. Persons submitting an application for a temporary sign permit shall provide\nsufficient information, including the physical characteristics, display location, and\nproposed period of display (if applicable), in order to determine its compliance with\nthe applicable regulations.\nii. Only those signs, which meet all of the requirements established by Section 10.3 for\nthe particular type of sign, may be permitted. Signs not meeting those regulations\nwill be denied a permit.\niii. Failure to obtain a permit for a temporary sign that is required to be permitted prior\nto displaying it is a violation of this Ordinance.\n4. Sign Area Computations. The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and\nsign height:\na. Computation of Area of Single-faced Signs. The area of a sign face shall be computed\nby means of the smallest square or rectangle, that will encompass the extreme limits of the\nwriting, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color\nforming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign\nfrom the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting\nframework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets\nzoning ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself.\nb. Computation of Area of Multi-Faced Signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one\nface shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one\npoint. When two (2) identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot\nbe viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same\nsign structure and not more than forty-two (42\") inches apart, the sign area shall be\ncomputed by the measurement of one (1) of the faces.\nFigure 10-1: Measurement of a Sign Face\n\n\n Output:"}]}
