Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Conservation\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Conservation\n(CD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Conservation (CD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Conservation (CD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Conservation\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Notes to the Table of Area, Yard, and Height Requirements\nNote 1. Location of Accessory Building.\nAccessory buildings may occupy 10% of the gross lot area, and must be built a minimum\nof 5 (five) feet from any lot line.\nNote 2. Corner Lots.\n(A)\nOn corner lots, the side yard on that side of the lot abutting the side street shall not\nbe less than one-half the front yard setback requirement on that side street.\n(B)\nAccessory buildings on corner lots located on that side of the lot abutting the side\nstreet shall not project beyond the full front yard requirement on that side street.\nNote 3.\nAll buildings in the Central Business and Highway Commercial Districts shall be\npermanent fully enclosed construction. Portable, open air, shed type structures shall be\nprohibited, except as accessory buildings.\nNote 4. Exceptions and Modifications.\nThe dimensional requirements of this Ordinance shall be complied with in all respects\nexcept that, under the specific conditions as outlined in this Ordinance, the requirements\nmay be waived or modified as stated; and, in addition, the dimensional requirements may\nbe changed or modified by the Board of Adjustment.\nArticle 11.

Front Yard Modifications in Residential Districts.\n(A)\nWhere 50% or more of the lots in any block or within 600 feet on both sides of the\nproposed structure, whichever is less, is composed of lots which have been\ndeveloped with buildings whose front, side, or rear yards are less than the minimum\nrequired as specified in the dimensional requirements, the required front, side or\nrear yard shall be the average depth of front, side or rear yards of the developed\nlots, or the minimum dimensional requirements as specified in the Table of Area,\nYard, and Height Requirements, whichever is less. Provided further that if any lot\nlies between two buildings which are less than 100 feet apart, the required front\nand/or rear yards for such lot shall be no greater than the average front and/or rear\nyard of the two adjoining lots or 25 feet, whichever is more.\n(B)\nWhen 50% or more of the lots in any block or within 600 feet on both sides of the\nproposed structure, whichever is less, is composed of lots with buildings that have\nfront yards greater than the minimum required front yard, as specified in the Table\nof Area, Yard, and Height Requirements, the required front yard shall be the\naverage depth of front yards on the developed lots. Provided further that if any lot\nlies between two buildings which are less than 100 feet apart, the required front\nyard for such lot shall be no less than the average front yard of the two adjoining\nlots.\nNote 6. Other Yard Modifications.\nWhere through lots occur, the required front yard shall be provided on both streets.\nArchitectural features such as open or enclosed fire escapes, steps, outside stairways,\nbalconies and similar features, and uncovered porches may not project more than four\nfeet into any required yard. Sills, cornices, leaves, gutters, buttresses, ornamental features,\nand similar items may not project into any required yard more than 30 inches.\n(A)\nRelief From Zoning Set Back Requirements: Property owners wishing to\nconstruct new structures or additions on their property may seek relief from\nbuilding setbacks based on one of the following:\n(1) The irregular shape of the parcel (i.e., pie shaped lots) makes conformance\nwith all the building setbacks impractical to design or build a new home\nequal to 20% of the gross parcel area.\n(2) The location of a new septic field (as required by the County Health\nDepartment) on the property prevents conformance as noted in Item 1\nabove.\n(3) The location of an unchanged existing septic field (as previously approved\nby the County Health Department) on the property prevents conformance as\nnoted in Item 1 above.\nArticle 11.
