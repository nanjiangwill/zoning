Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Light Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"I-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Light Industrial\n(I-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Light Industrial (I-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Light Industrial (I-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Light Industrial\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

This district is defined as medium-density residential\nareas and additional open areas where similar residential development will be a\nviable land use. The minimum lot size is 5,000 square feet for one unit and\n4,100 for each additional unit. The uses permitted in this district are designed to\nstabilize and protect the essential character of the area and prohibit all activities\nof a commercial nature except certain home occupations controlled by specific\nlimitations. The district is intended to accommodate moderate density single-\nfamily residential uses, multifamily residential uses, and supporting public and\ninstitutional uses in areas that have the necessary utilities and road systems to\nsupport such development. Mobile homes are not permitted. (See Article V for\npermitted uses and Article VI for specific area and yard requirements.)\nB.\nR-15, Residential District.

Mobile homes\non individual lots are permitted. (See Article V for permitted uses and Article VI\nfor specific area and yard requirements.)\nF.\nA-1, Agricultural District. This district is primarily intended to accommodate\nvery low density residential uses as well as associated public and institutional\nuses, low intensity commercial uses, and agricultural-related industrial uses\nwhich are interspersed throughout areas that are principally characterized as\nrural in nature. This district reflects the diverse nature of land uses within\npredominantly rural areas and, therefore, permits a wide array of land uses.\nHowever, those intensive land uses, which could have an adverse impact on the\nrural nature, are not permitted or are allowed only on a special use permit basis\nfollowing a formal review and approval process. The district is specifically\nestablished for the following purposes:\n1.\nTo preserve and encourage the continued use of land for agricultural,\nforestry, and open space purposes;\n2.\nTo encourage small-scale and low intensity commercial uses that primarily\nprovide goods and services to residents of the surrounding rural areas;\n3.\nTo encourage only those industries which are agricultural-related;\n4.\nTo encourage the concentration of more intensive urban land uses in and\naround identified growth areas that have the capacity to accommodate the\nutility and traffic demands of such development, thereby avoiding\npremature conversion of farmland to urban uses; and\n5.\nTo discourage any use which, because of its character, would create\npremature or extraordinary public infrastructure and service demands.\n(See Article V for permitted uses and Article VI for specific area and yard\nrequirements.)\nG.\nB-1, General Business District. This district is defined as certain areas that are\ndesigned to serve both non-residents and residents using the major state and\ncounty roads that run through the areas zoned.

This district is defined as an area where\nmanufacturing establishments may be developed. The purpose of this district is\nto permit the normal operations of almost all industries except those that would\nbe detrimental to adjoining properties. Excluded from this district are those\nindustries which deal primarily in hazardous products such as explosives. This\ndistrict is intended to serve limited manufacturing, warehousing, wholesaling, and\nrelated commercial and service activities that have little or no adverse impact\nupon adjoining properties. This district is intended for areas that have access to\nmajor thoroughfares and the necessary utilities to support such development.\n(See Article V for permitted uses and Article VI for specific area and yard\nrequirements.)\nK.\nI-2, Heavy Industrial District. This district is defined as an area to serve a wide\nrange of assembling, fabricating, manufacturing, warehousing, wholesaling, and\nsupport retail and service uses.

All\nregulations which apply to a general use zoning district also apply to the\ncorresponding conditional zoning district. All other rules, regulations, and\nconditions which may be offered by the property owner and approved by the\nBoard of County Commissioners as part of the rezoning process shall also apply.\nProperty may be placed in a conditional zoning district only in response to a\npetition by the owners of all of the property proposed to be included in the\nconditional zoning district. Requirements for conditional zoning districts are\ndelineated in Section 14.07.\n4.04\nOverlay Zoning Districts\nOverlay districts establish certain regulations that are in addition to those of the\nunderlying general use or conditional zoning districts. Property within a designated\noverlay district may be used in a manner permitted in the underlying general use or\nconditional zoning districts only if and to the extent such use is also permitted in the\napplicable overlay district.\nA.\nAP, Airport Protection Overlay District. This district is intended to protect the\nEdenton Municipal Airport environs from encroachment of incompatible land uses\nwhich present hazards to users of the airport as well as persons residing or\nworking in the airport vicinity.
