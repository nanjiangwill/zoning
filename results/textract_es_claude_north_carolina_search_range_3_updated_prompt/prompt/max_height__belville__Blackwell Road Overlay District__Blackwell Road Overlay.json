Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Blackwell Road Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"Blackwell Road Overlay District\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Blackwell Road Overlay\n(Blackwell Road Overlay District) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Blackwell Road Overlay (Blackwell Road Overlay District). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Blackwell Road Overlay (Blackwell Road Overlay District)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Blackwell Road Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

A landscape island comprising an area equaling that of one (1) parking space\nshall be located at the end of each row of parking and be planted with one (1)\nshade tree, a minimum of three (3) inches in caliper, and eight (8) shrubs,\nthree (3) feet in height or less when mature.\n2. The interior of a row of parking shall be landscaped in one (1) of the\nfollowing manners:\ni.\nOne (1) landscape island shall be located after every tentpa(king\nspace within a row; rows with fifteen (15) parking spaces or less shall locate\nthe landscape island in the middle or approximate middle of the row. Such\nlandscape islands shall be planted with one (1) shade tree, a minimum of\nthree (3) inches in caliper.\nii.

Off-Street Parking Area Screening - All parking areas visible from a public or\nprivate right-of-way shall be screened from view. Parking areas located in a side\nyard shall have the portion of the lot that fronts the street screened up to a height\nof three (3) feet. Screening shall be accomplished through the use of shrubs,\nmasonry walls (using material that matches the adjacent building), wrought iron\nfencing, or any combination thereof. If landscaping alone is used, then the\nminimum width of the planting area shall not be less than four (4) feet.\nH.\nOff-Street Parking Area Pervious Paving - For off-street parking areas visible\nfrom a public or private street and/or landscaped per subsection F. of this section,\npervious pavers or pervious paving systems shall occupy a minimum of ten\npercent (10%) of the total area of an off-street parking area, excluding the area\noccupied by required landscape islands and strips (see subsection F.3. of this\nsection for requirements pertaining to parking areas not visible from a public or\nprivate street and not landscaped).\n21\n\n\nNEW PAGE 124\nI.\nParking Structures\n1. Ground Level Screening: The ground level of a parking structure\nlocated along a public or private street right-of-way shall be wrapped\nby retail, office, or some other active use.\n2. Materials: Along all street facing facades, parking structures shall be\ntreated with high-quality materials, to include brick, stone, or similar\nmasonry material. Architectural treatments shall be provided\nconsistent with abutting structures. The fa\u00e7ade shall be designed to\nscreen vehicles. In no instance will rails or cabling alone be sufficient\nto meet this screening requirement.\n3. Clear Entries: Pedestrian entrieshall be clearly visible. Vertical\ncirculation shall not be located in the center of the structure so as to be\ndifficult or circuitous to locate.\n4. Vents and Utility Openings: In the event that any openings for\nventilation, service, or emergency access are located at the first floor\nlevel in the building fa\u00e7ade, then they shall be an integral part of the\noverall building design. These openings as well as pedestrian and\nvehicular entrances shall be designed to minimize visibility of parked\nvehicles. The remainder of the street level frontage shall be either\ncommercial space or an architecturally articulated fa\u00e7ade designed to\nminimize the visibility of parked vehicles.\n22\n\n\nNEW PAGE 125\nSECTION 7.3\nBLACKWELL ROAD OVERLAY DISTRICT\nSection 7.3.1 Purpose and Intent\nThe purpose of the Blackwell Road Overlay District is to establish regulations\nconsistent with the findings and recommendationsof the Vision 2020 Plan,\nspecifically with regard to those recommendations concerning the Blackwell Road\nstreetscape.\nThe intent of the Blackwell Road Overlay District is to establish aesthetic design\nstandards for the Corridor and to improve upon the existing vehicular, pedestrian, and\nbicycle transportation network in the Corridor.\nSection 7.3.2 District Boundaries\nThe boundaries of the Blackwell Road Overlay District are as shown on the Town's\nZoning Map.\nSection 7.3.3 Applicability\nAll applications for a CZC for properties located in the Blackwell Road Overlay\nDistrict, involving grading, construction of new buildingsadditions to existing\nbuildings, construction of signs, similar site improvements, and/or changes in\nuse\nshall demonstrate compliance with the requirements and standards of this Article.\nSection 7.3.4 Streetscape Standards\nAll projects covered by Section 7.3.3, Applicability, shall make improvements along\nthe entire respective property frontage, provided that such requirements may be\nvaried as necessary, by the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT)\nor the Zoning Code Administrator, if it is determined that the standards do not meet\nfuture transportation needs, inhibit public safety, and/or do not comply with adopted\nstandards of either the NCDOT or the Town.\nA.\nStreet Construction.\n1.
