Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"I\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Industrial\n(I) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Industrial (I). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Industrial (I)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Industrial\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

Up to 25% or five\n(5) spaces (whichever is greater) of the required parking may be reduced in this fashion.\nb.\nMinimum Dimensional Requirements of Tree Save Area: The extent of the Critical Root Zone (CRZ)\nof the tree or trees at the outer edges of the tree save area shall constitute the limits of construction\nfor the purposes of this sub-section.

Available Parking Reduction: The actual demand for parking on a particular site may vary based\non the development's context. In these cases, the Administrator may determine that the context\nis\nappropriate to reduce parking requirements. Examples of such cases are:\nA mixed-use development with uses that have peak occupancy at different\ntimes such that one parking space can be demonstrated to handle some parking\nneeds of multiple uses.\nCounting on-street parking spaces directly adjacent to the establishment.\nShared parking in a nearby lot that has empty spaces.\nA commitment to providing valet parking services.\nDemonstrating a likelihood that all required parking may not be needed and\ndeferring construction on a percentage of the parking spaces until after the\ndevelopment is complete, when it becomes clear whether or not the additional\ndeferred spaces are needed.\nThe following are the criteria the Administrator must use when determining the applicable parking\nreductions.\nCITY OF DUNN, NC\n6-10\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nADOPTION DATE: 04.11.2023\n\nNEW PAGE 99\nARTICLE 6\nGENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nE.\nSATELLITE & COMBINATION PARKING\nIf the off-street parking spaces required by this Section cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on\nwhich the principal use is located, such space may be provided on any land within 500 feet.
