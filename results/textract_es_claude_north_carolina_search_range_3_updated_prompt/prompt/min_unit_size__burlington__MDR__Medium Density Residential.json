Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Medium Density Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MDR\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Medium Density Residential\n(MDR) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Medium Density Residential (MDR). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Medium Density Residential (MDR)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Medium Density Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft).

ALLOWABLE RESIDENTIAL DENSITY\nResidential density is the maximum allowable number of residential dwelling units permitted on a particular\nsite, tract, lot, or other unit of land area, typically expressed as a maximum number of residential units\nper acre. Maximum residential density alone may not produce the allowable residential yield since the\nminimum lot area must also be taken into account.

Calculation of Maximum Number of Lots\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\nThe maximum number of lots is calculated by dividing the total square footage of a lot or tract by the\nminimum lot area for the type of use proposed, the resulting number (the quotient) is then rounded\ndownwards to the next lowest whole number to produce the total number of lots permissible for the\ntype of use proposed. The effective density of a lot or tract may differ based on the type of use being\nproposed.\ni.\nExample 1: 67,000 Square-foot Site in the MDR District for Single-family\nDetached Dwelling Lots\na) Lot size: 67,000 square feet.\nb) Minimum lot area for a single-family detached dwelling: 9,000 square feet.\nc) Maximum number of single-family detached dwelling lots: 67,000 / 9,000 = 7.44, or 7\nsingle-family detached lots (fractions are rounded downwards).\nii. Example 2: 67,000 Square-foot Site in the MDR district for Single-family\nAttached Dwelling lots\na) Lot size: 67,000 square feet.\nb) Minimum lot area for single-family attached dwelling: 9,000 square feet + 1,600 square\nfeet for each unit.\nc) Maximum number of single-family attached dwelling lots: (67,000 - 9,000) / 1,600 = 36.25\nor 36 single-family attached lots (fractions are rounded downwards).\n3. Calculation of Allowable Residential Yield\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\nAllowable residential yield is the lesser of the maximum allowable density or the maximum number of\nlots for a given site.\ni.\nExample 1: 67,000 Square -foot Site in the MDR District for Single-Family\nDetached Dwelling lots\na) Maximum density (based on Example 1 in Sub-section 1 above): 8 units.\nb) Maximum number of lots (based on Example i in Sub-section 2 above): 7 lots.\nc) Allowable residential density = 7 units.\nii. Example 2: 67,000 Square -foot Site in the MDR District for Single-Family\nAttached Dwelling lots\na) Maximum density (based on Example 1 in Sub-section 1 above): 8 units.\nb) Maximum number of lots (based on Example ii in Sub-section 2 above): 36 lots.\nc) Allowable residential density = 8 units.\n4. Density Equivalence\na. Accessory dwelling units associated with a single-family residential principal use shall not be\ncounted towards the maximum allowable residential density.\nb. When calculating the density for a private dormitory associated with an educational use, two\nbedrooms in a private dormitory shall be equivalent to one regular dwelling unit.\nC. Maximum density amounts do not apply to student housing or lodging on college or university\ncampuses when the housing is owned or operated by the college or university. In these instances,\nresidential land uses are considered as an accessory to the college or university principal use.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \n8-14\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\n\nNEW PAGE 527\nCHAPTER 8 MEASUREMENT AND DEFINITIONS\nSection 8.3 Rules of Measurement\nG. GROSS FLOOR AREA (GFA)\nGross floor area (GFA) shall be defined as the sum in square feet of all floors of the building measured\nfrom the exterior face of the exterior walls. The gross floor area shall include or exclude areas as indicated\nbelow:\n1. Areas Included in Gross Floor Area\na. All enclosed habitable space.\nb. Elevators, hallways, and stairwells on stories containing habitable space.\n2. Areas Excluded from Gross Floor Area\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\na. Unenclosed porches or decks.\nb. Off-street parking areas, including the elevators, hallways, mechanical equipment, and stairwells\nserving structured parking.\nC. Utility services areas devoted to the electric service, the potable water service, the wastewater\nsystem, the telephone service, the cable service, or to a backup generator.\nd.\nMechanical areas and uninhabited enclosed spaces on tops of roofs not intended for general\nstorage.\nH. HEIGHT\n1. Measurement\nBuilding height shall be measured from the finished or established grade elevation following any land\ndisturbing activities.\n2. Maximum Height\nBuilding height is the vertical distance from a point established as the mean elevation of the finished\ngrade along the front fa\u00e7ade of a building to any of the following points (see Figure 8.3.H: Building\nHeight):\na. The highest point of a flat roof (excluding coping or parapet walls shorter than five feet above the\nroof deck);\nb. The deck line of a mansard roof;\nC. The mid-point of the roof between the ridge and the leaves for a gable, hip, or gambrel roof; or\nd. To the highest point of a dome, shed, or cricket-style roof.\n3. Story\nA building story is the portion of a building where all rooms share the same floor and ceiling level.\na. A crawlspace or basement with an average ceiling height of less than seven feet is not considered\nas a story.\nb. An attic with an average ceiling height of less than six feet is not considered a story.\n4. Exceptions\na. Except when proposed within the AHO, the following features are exempted from the maximum\nheight requirements in this Ordinance:\ni. Parapet walls of less than five feet in height above the roof deck;\nii.\nSpires, steeples, minarets, belfries, cupolas, domes, and similar architectural features not\nintended for human habitation;\niii. Water tanks, vent housings, elevator housings, and equipment covers;\niv. Chimneys, vent pipes, skylights, or mechanical equipment; and\nV. Bulkheads or a single-story penthouse occupying 25 percent or less of the total roof area.\nb.\nIn the AHO, such structures shall be subject to the maximum height limits, and shall require a\nvariance in accordance with Section 2.4.CC, Zoning/Subdivision Variance.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \n8-15\nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\nNEW PAGE 528\nCHAPTER 8 MEASUREMENT AND DEFINITIONS\nSection 8.3 Rules of Measurement\nFIGURE 8.3.H: BUILDING HEIGHT\n(AMENDED 12.3.19 UDOTA-01-20)\nDome\nHigh Point\nMidpoint\n/ of Flat Roof\nof Roof\nHEIGHT\nGrade\nHEIGHT\nGrade\nSpire/Steeple\nDeck\nLine\nSkylight\nHEIGHT\nHEIGHT\nGrade\nI. LOT COVERAGE\n(AMENDED 12.3.19 UDOTA-01-20)\nLot coverage is the percentage of a lot or development site that is covered by buildings or roof structures,\nexcluding allowed projecting leaves and balconies.\nJ. SLOPE AND ELEVATION\n1. Slope\nThe degree of deviation of the ground surface from a flat, horizontal elevation, usually expressed in\npercent or degrees of deviation from horizontal.\n2. Base Flood Elevation (BFE)\na. A determination of the water surface elevations of the base flood as published in the flood\ninsurance study.\nb.\nWhen the BFE has not been provided for land within the FHO, it may be obtained from engineering\nstudies available from a federal, State, or other source using FEMA approved engineering\nmethodologies. This elevation establishes the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.\n3. Finished Grade\nThe established grade following grading, excavation, or other land-disturbing activity.\n4.
