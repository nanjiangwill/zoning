Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Mixed Use\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MU-2\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Mixed Use\n(MU-2) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Mixed Use (MU-2). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Mixed Use (MU-2)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Mixed Use\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Fences along interior side property lines in a residential,\nmixed use, or commercial district shall not exceed 5 feet in height in front of a line\nparallel to the front of the principal structure on the lot. Decorative caps or spires that\nextend above the highest horizontal member of the fence shall not be included in the\nmeasurement of height. Chain link, welded wire, or similar fencing materials, if used,\nshall be placed on the interior side of a masonry wall, solid wood fence, or decorative\nwood or vinyl fence that is equal to or greater in height than the secure fencing and\ndemonstrates effective screening capability. (For example, a 4' high welded wire\nfence attached to the interior of a decorative split rail fence or board farm fence of\nequal height or greater would perform to the standards of this section).\n(C.) In a residential or mixed-use district (SFR, RMST, MS, MU, or TNDO), a fence or\nwall in an established rear yard that abuts an alley may not exceed 6 feet in height\nunless placed 15 or more feet inside property boundary. Within the first 15 feet,\nfences of chain link or similar material are permitted only if screened on the exterior\nside by evergreen shrubs planted no farther apart than 6 feet on center, minimum\nheight 3 feet at installation, or if obscured from view by the screening method(s) set\nout in the paragraph immediately above.\n(D.)

Building Placement, Parking, and Vehicle Access.\n(1.) Buildings will range from 10' to 18' behind the street curb-line in Mixed Use\n(\"MU\"), Main Street (\"MS\"), and \"TNDO\" districts. Within the limits described\nabove, front setbacks will vary depending upon site conditions. Special site\nconditions such as topography, pattern of lot widths, or setbacks of existing\nbuildings on the same block permit a larger setback. Setbacks should be used in a\nmanner that encourages pedestrian activity. For example, squares or spatially\ndefined plazas within building setback areas can act as focal points for\npedestrians.\n(a.) Corners: Setback at street corners will generally replicate frontage conditions.\nSide setbacks on a minor residential street may be less than the front\ndimension.\n(2.) Side and rear setbacks will vary according to side and rear buffer requirements as\nset forth in Article 11, with a minimum 0-foot setback when no buffer is required.\n(3.) Front and rear building facades shall be generally parallel to frontage property\nlines. The fa\u00e7ade shall be determined by the massing of the building. Buildings\nin all locations should relate the principal fa\u00e7ade to the sidewalk and public space\nof the street.\n(4.) Parking shall be located primarily to the rear of the building; side-yard parking\nshall occupy no more than 35% of the primary frontage line and shall not be\nplaced in any side-yard abutting an intersecting street. Where dimensions of\nexisting lots restrict parking behind buildings, the limitations on side-yard parking\nmay be modified.\n(5.) Hedges, garden walls, or knee walls may be built on property lines or as the\ncontinuation of building walls. A garden wall, hedge or knee wall a minimum 2.5'\nin height, maximum 3.5' in height, shall be installed along any street frontage\nadjacent to parking areas. Knee walls should be built of brick, stone or other\ndecorative masonry material, or should be built of wrought iron or other\ndecorative metal, and shall generally match the architectural style of Coats.\n(6.) Parking areas on adjacent lots shall be connected with vehicular and pedestrian\nconnections wherever practical.\n(7.) Trash containers shall be located in a rear parking area (see Parking Regulations,\nArticle 12) and shall be screened from the right-of-way with a Type D Buffer\nYard per standards and specifications set forth in Article 11.\n(8.) Mechanical equipment at ground level shall be placed on the parking lot side of\nthe building away from buildings on adjacent sites and shall be screened from\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 25\n\n\nNEW PAGE 195\nview by either an opaque screen or fence, or a Type D Buffer Yard per standards\nand specifications set forth in Article 11.\n(9.) Building facades at street frontage lines shall be pedestrian oriented and of\npedestrian scale. The building's design shall promote pedestrian activity and\npedestrian-driven commerce. The sidewalk shall be an extension of the street\nlevel businesses' operations. As such, pedestrians should be able to preview\nbusinesses' merchandise and/or dine from the sidewalk. Business activities shall\nnot impede on the required pedestrian travel widths and shall not encroach more\nthan 5 feet into the sidewalk.\n(B.) Encroachments and Pedestrian Access to Building.\n(1.) Balconies, bay windows, arcades, awnings and porches at an upper level and their\nsupports are permitted and encouraged within the sidewalk as shown by the un-\nshaded area. Encroachments affixed\nto the building and horizontally\nprotruding more than 6\" from the face\nPARKING\nof the building must have a minimum\n7'6\" clearance from the finished\ngrade. Encroaching canopies should\ncover the entire sidewalk within the\npermitted distance shown by the un-\n5' MAX BALCONY/PORCH\nshaded area.\nENCROACHMENT\n(2.) Primary pedestrian access into the\nROW\nbuilding shall be from the street\nSIDEWALK\nSTREET\nfrontage line (indicated by larger\narrow). Secondary access may be from parking areas indicated by smaller\narrows).\n9.7-3 Urban Workplace Building Type.\n(A.) Permitted Height and Use Limitations.\n(1.) For buildings with flat roofs, building height shall be measured as the vertical\ndistance from the mean elevation of the existing grade to the highest finished roof\nsurface. The height of parapet walls is not counted in the building height\ncalculations and may vary depending upon the need to screen mechanical\nequipment.\n(2.) For buildings with pitched roofs, building heights shall be measured as the\nvertical distance from the mean elevation of the finished grade to a point\nrepresenting the midpoint of the peak and leave heights.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 26\n\n\nNEW PAGE 196\n(3.) Building height to the ridge may vary depending on the roof pitch.\n(4.) Buildings shall have no less than 2 stories. Buildings shall have no more than 3\nstories, unless the building is in a \"TNDO\" district, in which case the maximum\nnumber of\nstories and\nmaximum\nbuilding\nheight is\nregulated by\n45' MAX\nthe procedure\nfor \"TNDO\"\napproval in\nArticle 7 of\nthis\n5' MAX\nENCROACHMENT\nOrdinance.\n(5.) Buildings shall have no more than 50% of the 1st floor in residential use.\n(B.) Architectural Standards.\n(1.) Principles:\n(a.)

Building elevations fronting or visible from public streets shall be clad with\nmasonry, wood, stucco, or similar material. Vinyl siding shall not comprise a\nstreet fronting building face to maintain compatibility with structures within\nthe Town.\n(c.) The front elevations facing the street, and the overall massing shall\ncommunicate an emphasis on the human scale and the pedestrian environment\nto maintain compatibility with structures within the Town.\n(d.) Each building should be designed to form part of a larger composition of the\narea in which it is situated. Adjacent buildings should thus be of similar scale,\nheight, and configuration to maintain compatibility with structures within the\nTown.\n(e.) Drive-through customer services, if permitted in the district, must be located\nat the rear of the building or on a side which does not abut a street to maintain\ncompatibility with structures within the Town.\n(f.)
