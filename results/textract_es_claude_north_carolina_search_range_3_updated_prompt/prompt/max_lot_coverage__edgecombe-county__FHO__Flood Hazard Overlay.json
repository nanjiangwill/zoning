Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Flood Hazard Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"FHO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Flood Hazard Overlay\n(FHO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Flood Hazard Overlay (FHO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Flood Hazard Overlay (FHO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Flood Hazard Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage refers solely to the maximum lot coverage of buildings for primary use and all accessory structures. Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

DISTRICTS\n$3.4. Overlay Zoning Districts\n3.4.3. FLOOD HAZARD OVERLAY (FHO) DISTRICT\nA.\nSTATUTORY AUTHORIZATION\nThe Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; Parts 3\nand 4 of Article 18 of Chapter 153A; and Part 121, Article 6 of Chapter 153A of the North\nCarolina General Statutes, delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt\nregulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.\nB.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n1. The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of Edgecombe County are subject to periodic\ninundation which results in loss of life, property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of\ncommerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood\nprotection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the\npublic health, safety, and general welfare.\n2. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains\ncausing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas\nof uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.\nC.\nSTATEMENT OF PURPOSE\nIt is the purpose of these standards to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and\nto minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by\nprovisions designed to:\n1.\nRestrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or\nerosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;\n2.\nRequire that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected\nagainst flood damage at the time of initial construction;\n3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective\nbarriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;\n4. Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or\nflood damage; and\n5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood\nwaters, or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\nD.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objectives of these standards are to:\n1. Protect human life, safety, and health;\n2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\n3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally\nundertaken at the expense of the general public;\n4. Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;\n5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and gas mains, electric,\ntelephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;\n6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood\nprone areas; and\n7. Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area.\nE.\nEFFECTIVE DATE\nThese standards shall become effective on June 2, 2015.\nF.\nDEFINITIONS\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage\n179\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n\n\nNEW PAGE 180\nARTICLE 3.

STANDARDS\n$6.13. Subdivision Design\n2. All lots created after November 1, 2021, shall have sufficient area, dimensions, and access\nto allow a principal building to be erected on it in compliance with the requirements of this\nOrdinance.\n3. Lots intended for non-residential development shall be of an adequate size and shape to\naccommodate required off-street parking, loading, screening, landscaping, and on-site\ncirculation features.\n4. Except for special purpose lots, every lot shall maintain the lesser of:\ni. 40 percent of its minimum required area of contiguous buildable area outside the\nfloodplain; or\nii. 3,000 square feet of contiguous buildable area outside the floodplain.\nB.\nLOT LINES\n1. Side lines of lots should be at or near right angles or radial to street lines.\n2. Where side lot lines intersect at the rear of the lot, the angle of intersection shall not be less\nthan 60 degrees.\n3. Lot lines shall coincide with natural and pre-existing man-made drainageways, to the\nmaximum extent practicable.\nC.\nFLAG LOTS\n1. A flag lot shall contain only one single-family dwelling and any accessory structures.\n2. Flag lots may be permitted as a more reasonably suitable alternative to extending a road or\na more conventional lot design when justified by topographic and natural features;\n3. The maximum flag lot size in areas with public sewer shall be one acre.\n4. The maximum flag lot size without public sewer shall be three acres.\n5. The 'flagpole' portion of the lot is not used to calculate area, width, depth, coverage, and\nsetbacks of the lot or to provide off-street parking.\n6.
