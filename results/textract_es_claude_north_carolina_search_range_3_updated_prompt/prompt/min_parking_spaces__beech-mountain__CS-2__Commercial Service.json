Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Commercial Service\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CS-2\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Commercial Service\n(CS-2) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Commercial Service (CS-2). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Commercial Service (CS-2)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Commercial Service\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\"). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 165\n165/167\nCELL (1, 1):\nRestaurants (with drive through service)\nCELL (1, 2):\nOne (1) space for each four (4) seating\naccommodations, plus one (1) space for each\ntwo (2) employees on the shift of largest\nemployment; and Three (3) stacking spaces\nfor each drive through window.\nCELL (2, 1):\nSchool, Elementary and Middle (both public\nand private):\nCELL (2, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each classroom and\nadministrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee and one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (3, 1):\nSchool, High School (both public and private)\nCELL (3, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each fifteen (15)\nstudents for which the building was designed,\nplus one (1) parking space for each classroom\nand administrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee, plus one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (4, 1):\nShopping Centers, large and small\nCELL (4, 2):\nOne (1) space for each three hundred (300)\nsquare feet of gross floor area.\nCELL (5, 1):\nSingle Family, Duplex, Condominiums,\nManufactured Homes, and similar residential\nCELL (5, 2):\nTwo (2) spaces per dwelling unit\nCELL (6, 1):\nTerminals, Bus\nCELL (6, 2):\nOne (1) space for each employee and one (1)\nspace for each bus loading ramp and track.\nCELL (7, 1):\nStadiums, Theaters, and similar uses\ninvolving the assembling of persons:\nCELL (7, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each four (4) seats\nin the largest assembly room.

A written application for a Special Use Permit shall be submitted to the\nZoning Administrator.\n(B) Conference. After submission of an application for a Special Use Permit the Zoning\nAdministrator shall arrange a conference with the applicant. The Zoning Administrator shall also\nsend the Planning Board an agenda for the meeting. At the conference the applicant shall submit a\nsketch development plan and a brief description of the proposed development strategy. The\napplicant shall also submit proposed design specifications for proposed commercial buildings. The\nconference is designed to inform the applicant of the local government's regulations and policies\nconcerning development alternatives and to inform the local government of the applicant's\nintentions, enough to be able to give him or her some informal, nonbinding feedback on the\nacceptability of his or her plan. The greater the level of common understanding between the\napplicant and the local government that can be achieved at the conference stage, the smoother the\nremaining steps of the review and approval process will be. At the conference a date for a public\nhearing shall be determined.\n1\n(C) Notice of hearing. The Board of Adjustment shall give public notice of the hearing in a\nnewspaper having general circulation in Beech Mountain published at least five days prior to the\ndate of the hearing. The Board shall mail notices of the hearing to the affected parties, to members\nof the Planning Board, and to such other persons as the Zoning Administrator shall direct at least\nseven days prior to the hearing. Such notice shall state the location of the building or lot, the\ngeneral nature of the applicant's request, and the time and place of the hearing. 2\n(D) Copies of final development plan to be submitted. At least ten days prior to the date set for\nthe hearing, the applicant shall submit three copies of the final development plan to the Zoning\nAdministrator. The development plan shall contain a map or maps drawn to scale, with the date of\npreparation, and shall contain, where applicable, the following information:\n(1) Existing site conditions, including contours, water courses, identified flood hazard areas,\nany unique natural or man made features.\n(2) Boundary lines of the proposed development, proposed lot lines and plot designs.\n(3) Proposed location and use of all existing and proposed structures.\n(4) Location and size of all areas to be conveyed, dedicated or reserved as common open\nspace, parks, recreational areas, school sites and similar public and semi-public uses.\n(5) The existing and proposed street system, including location and number of off-street\nparking spaces, service areas, loading areas, and major points of access to public rights-of-way.\nNotations of proposed ownership of the street system (public or private).

Due to above-ground utilities, the\ntown may require the use of ornamental trees in place of large shade trees.\nb. Inclusion of existing trees in the landscape design is encouraged. Shrubbery, ground\ncover, and other planting materials shall be used to compliment the tree planting. No area of the\nstreet yard may be exposed soil, but instead shall be covered with vegetation, whether grass or\nshrubbery. The only area that shall remain uncovered is the six-foot radius surrounding the trunk of\nany tree; however, this area shall be mulched.\n(2) Existing vegetation. Existing trees and vegetation, other than exotic, non-native species,\nmay count toward meeting the requirements of this section, when such vegetation is in good\ncondition, is properly protected during development, and helps to further the purpose of the district.\nExisting vegetation that is used to meet the standards of this section shall be maintained or\nreplaced if it dies during the first year after the completion of the development.\n(3) New plant material. Regionally grown and native species of plants are preferred. Any plant\nlisted with the Agricultural Extension Office as a native plant shall be considered to be a native\nplant for these purposes. New plant material shall complement existing site vegetation, should be\nmixed with it and should be integrated with all other natural site features.\n(I) Parking lots; parking lot yards. The purpose of this section is to ensure that the Commercial\nThoroughfare Overlay District of Beech Mountain is an attractive and appealing place for residents\nand visitors. This often means that a higher priority must be placed upon being an attractive and\nfunctional place for people than being convenient for automobiles.\n(1) Parking location. Parking is encouraged to be located to the rear or sides of buildings, with\nthe building fronting on the public way. However, nothing in this section is to prevent the\nestablishment of parking in front of a building so long as the project adheres to all other relevant\nregulations. When parking is to be established in front of buildings, it is recommended that the\napplicant create and utilize on-street parking if such is approved by the NCDOT and/or the town.\n(For the purposes of this section, ON-STREET PARKING is defined as a parking area without a\ndivider between the street and the parking area, in which automobiles directly access the parking\nspaces from the road. On-street parking may be parallel, angled or straight in, as approved by the\nNCDOT and the town.)\n(J) Buffer yards. The purpose of the buffer yard is to provide a transitional area between uses\nthat may differ in development intensity and density. A BUFFER YARD is defined as a planting yard\nthat serves as a visual separation between uses and should be densely planted. No buildings,\nparking areas or other development may encroach within the buffer yard, with the exception of\ntown-approved public walkways or sidewalks. Refer to \u00a7 154.165 for the standards for buffer yards.\n(Ord. 2014-05, passed 12-9-2014; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\u00a7 154.130 ZONING AFFECTS EVERY BUILDING AND USE.\nNo building or land shall hereafter be used and no building or part thereof shall be erected,\nmoved or altered except in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district in which\nit\nis located, except as provided in this chapter.\n(1989 Code, Title V, Ch. 51, Art.

Vacancy and/or non-use of the land, regardless of the intent of the owner or tenant,\nshall constitute discontinuance under this provision.\n(D) Nonconforming uses of structures. This category of nonconformance consists of buildings or\nstructures used at the time of enactment of this chapter for purposes of use not permitted in the\ndistrict in which they are located. Such uses may be continued as follows:\n(1) An existing nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use of a higher\nclassification, provided that the other conditions in this section are complied with.
