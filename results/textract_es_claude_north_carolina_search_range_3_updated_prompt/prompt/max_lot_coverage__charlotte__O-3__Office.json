Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Office\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"O-3\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Office\n(O-3) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Office (O-3). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Office (O-3)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Office\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage refers solely to the maximum lot coverage of buildings for primary use and all accessory structures. Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

The building area coverage shall be the dimensional standards of the applicable zoning District (i.e., R-7500, C-LD, etc.). However, the\ndeveloped area may be increased as a result of utilizing exceptional design and/or best management practices as provided in Section 6.1,\nDesign Flexibility.

Additional development\nrequirements for the BP district are specified below:\n(a)\nMinimum required open space. At least 20 percent of every project in the\nbusiness park district must be devoted to permanent open space. This area\nmust be used for landscaping, lawns, screening, or buffer areas. It may\nnot contain any parking or loading areas, outdoor storage, trash handling,\nor utility or service areas. The area devoted to the minimum project edge\nrequirement may be counted toward this requirement.\n(b)\nUtility lines underground. All utility lines such as electric, telephone,\nCATV, or other similar lines must be installed underground, unless the\nfollowing criteria are met:\n(i)\nThe power lines existed above ground at the time of first approval\nof a plat or development plan by the local government, whether or\nnot the power lines are subsequently relocated during construction\nof the subdivision or development plan.\n(ii)\nThe power lines are located outside the boundaries of the parcel of\nland that contains the subdivision or property covered by the\ndevelopment plan.\nThis requirement applies to lines serving individual sites as well as to\nsecurity and street lighting within the project. However, distribution lines\nwhich serve the entire site may be located above ground. All utility boxes,\ntransformers, meters, and similar structures must be screened from public\nview.\n(c)\nOutdoor storage is permitted. Outdoor storage is permitted as an\naccessory use on any individual lot. Any such storage must be completely\nscreened from adjoining development within and without the site as well\nas from the general public. The screening must be effective at the time\nthat it is installed, even if plant materials are used for all or part of the\nscreening. Access through the screening for vehicles is permitted, but is\nlimited to one 30-foot wide location per-street frontage. All setbacks and\nyards must be observed for outside storage areas. In no case may the\namount of land area devoted to outside storage exceed 20 percent of the\nlot area.\n(d)\nCovenants required. The developer of any business park project must\nestablish restrictive covenants for the entire project area. The restrictive\ncovenants must be submitted to show compliance, but will not be\nreviewed as to form, legality, or methods of enforcement. Those\n9-127\n\n\nNEW PAGE 278\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 8: BUSINESS DISTRICTS\ncovenants must, at a minimum, accomplish the following objectives:\ni.\nCreate a property owners association;\nii.\nProvide for maintenance of individual sites, common areas, open\nspaces, and private streets; and\niii.\nProvide for minimum development and operational standards for\neach site which require adherence to local ordinances and establish\nuniform landscaping, signage, site design, parking, and loading\nstandards. The covenants may include additional restrictions or\nrequirements at the discretion of the developer. However, the\nminimum standards of this ordinance must always be met.\n(e)\nProject edge. The protection of the project edge is essential to the proper\nintegration of a business park development into the community, especially\nwhen adjoining residential areas. The objective of the standards for the\nproject edge is to provide the appropriate separation, screening,\nlandscaping and transition between the development and the adjoining\nproperties.\nThe minimum project edge required around the perimeter of the site is 100\nfeet. However, if the abutting land is zoned and used for business,\nbusiness park, research or industrial purposes, or if the project adjoins the\nright-of-way of a railroad, Class I, or Class II thoroughfare, the minimum\nedge for that part of the project boundary may be reduced to 50 feet. The\nminimum project edge must remain undisturbed except that utility lines,\nstreets and driveways, may be installed in this area pursuant to specific\nsite plan approval. If the project edge does not contain sufficient\nvegetation to adequately screen and buffer, it must be revegetated or\nscreened according to a Class B buffer as per Table 12.302(b). (Petition\n2019-103,10-21-19)\n(f)\nStreet trees. Street trees must be planted along all public and private\nstreets within and abutting any business park development in accordance\nwith the standards and specifications of the Charlotte Street Tree Planting\nprogram and the Charlotte Tree Ordinance (City Code Chapter 21), which\nare adopted herein by reference.\n(g)\nProject entrance. The entrance or entrances to the project should receive\nspecial emphasis in design and construction. It should set the tone for the\ndevelopment within and should create an identity for the project at the\npublic street frontage. Special attention should be paid to signage,\nlandscaping, street configuration, future transit potential, and traffic\ncirculation. At a minimum, a divided street entrance must be used at the\nprincipal entrance to the site. Where internal streets are provided within a\nBP district, individual development sites shall be accessed only from\ninternal streets.\n9-128\n\n\n Output:"}]}
