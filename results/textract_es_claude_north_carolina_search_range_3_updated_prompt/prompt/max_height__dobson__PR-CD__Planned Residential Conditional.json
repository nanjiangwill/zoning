Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Planned Residential Conditional\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"PR-CD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Planned Residential Conditional\n(PR-CD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Planned Residential Conditional (PR-CD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Planned Residential Conditional (PR-CD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Planned Residential Conditional\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

The purpose of the Planned Residential Conditional District (PR-CD) is to encourage the\ndevelopment of environments which provide certain development privileges in exchange for\npreplanning and design considerations. The PR-CD provides an alternative to conventional\nsubdivision design by promoting the conservation and creation of viable, connected open space\nand more flexible lot design options while minimizing development costs. The Planned Residential\nConditional District (PR-CD) provides flexibility in utilizing new development concepts, including\nthe incorporation of a limited amount of non-residential uses. In return for development\nflexibility, additional site plan information and development conditions may be required of the\ndeveloper to assist in evaluating the suitability of a proposed PR-CD. While maximum open space\npreservation and high-quality residential development is the primary goal of PR-CDs, open space\nwithin PR-CDs must balance the need for open space preservation with an increased need for\nintegration with surrounding developments through street connectivity and compatibility with\nadjacent and internal land uses.\n(B) Minimum Size. A PR-CD shall be located on a site containing at least five (5) contiguous acres.\n(C)\nabout:blank\n59/167\n\nNEW PAGE 60\n6/3/24, 7:55 PM\nDobson, NC Code of Ordinances\nPre-Application Conference Required. Prior to the formal submission of a proposed PR-CD, the petitioner or\ntheir representative shall attend a pre-application conference with the Town's planning staff concerning the\nproposed development of the site. The petitioner shall be required to produce a scaled sketch site plan\nshowing the existing cultural, historic, and physical features of the site for review by the planning staff as\nwell as conditions the developer proposes to incorporate into the development. Staff may ask for additional\ninformation such as the location of prime agricultural soils, historical structures, archeological/cultural\nelements, the depth of viewshed as seen from existing public rights-of-way, the location of \"unique\"\nfeatures on the site, and the location and general specifications of any existing and proposed water/sewer\ninfrastructure.\nThe Town's Planning Staff in consultation with other departments shall comment on the site plan within\n15 days. The official plan of the PR-CD shall be submitted for review by the Planning and Zoning Board and\nthe Board of Commissioners only after the completion of the pre-application conference and the written\nresponse.\n(D) Permitted Principal Uses. PR-CDs do not have any inherent permitted or conditional uses and\ndevelopment activities are only allowed through specific conditions approved by the Board of\nCommissioners; however PR-CDs are primarily intended for single-family developments. A\nmaximum of ten percent (10%) of the total land of the development may be utilized for non-\nresidential uses. The compatibility and appropriateness of any non-residential uses proposed\nshall be carefully considered. Those uses permitted and conditions approved by the Board of\nCommissioners shall be reflected on the Conditional Zoning District Supplement issued by the\nZoning Enforcement Officer.\n(E) Relationship to Other Applicable Regulations. A PR-CD shall be subject to all applicable standards,\nprocedures, and regulations of this Ordinance unless otherwise set forth in this section.\n(F) Maximum Density. Maximum residential density shall be calculated based on the existing zoning\ndistrict the proposed PR-CD is located in. All land proposed for non-residential development shall\nbe excluded from density calculations. If all of the PR-CD or a portion of the PR-CD is unable to be\nserved by public water and sewer, minimum lot sizes and maximum density shall be determined\nin consultation with the Surry County Health Department.\n(G) Development Standards. A PR-CD shall meet the following standards:\n(1) Outside Perimeter Lot Setback Requirements. Any lot which adjoins the outside boundary of\nthe PR-CD shall be considered an outside perimeter lot. Internal street refers to a street that\nis within the boundary of the PR-CD. Adjoining street is a street which is not located within the\nPR-CD but is adjacent to the outside boundary of the PR-CD. The following setbacks shall be\nrequired for outside perimeter lots:\n(a) Lots with Access on an Internal Street. Rear yard setback requirement of the existing\nzoning district in which the PR-CD is proposed shall be required.\nabout:blank\n60/167\n\n\nNEW PAGE 61\n6/3/24,7:55 PM\nabout:blank\n61/167\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nDobson, NC Code of Ordinances\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \n(b) Lots with Access on an Adjoining Street.

The minimum distance between the front wall of the structure and the side wall\nof another structure shall not be less than 14 feet.\n(4) Side or Rear Facing Side. The minimum distance between the rear of a structure and side of\nanother structure, or the minimum distance between the side walls of structures, shall not be\nless than ten (10) feet provided that no bay window encroachments are allowed for buildings\ncloser than 14 feet.\n(5) Front Loaded Garages. All front loaded garages shall be set back no less than 20 feet from\npublic rights-of-way or private access easements.\n(6) Minimum Perimeter Lot Size. Perimeter lots within PR-CDs which are adjacent to existing\nsingle family zoning districts shall meet the minimum lot area and dimensional requirements\nof the underlying zoning district. Where perimeter lots in PR-CDs do not meet the minimum\nlot area and dimensional requirements of the surrounding zoning district, a minimum 30 foot\nbufferyard is required between these lots and the adjacent single family zoning district. The\nbufferyard shall contain a minimum of four (4) canopy trees, ten (10) understory trees, and 33\nshrubs per 100 linear feet. The planting material comprising the buffer shall be spread across\nthe width of buffer and not just planted in rows. The intent of this section is to soften the\nappearance of the development and not necessarily screen it from view. Shrubs shall be\nexpected to reach a minimum height of 36 inches, and a minimum spread of 30 inches within\nthree (3) years of planting. Understory trees shall be a minimum of four (4) feet high with a\nminimum caliper of one (1) inch, measured six inches above grade when planted. Canopy\ntrees shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet in height and two (2) inches in caliper, measured six\ninches above grade, when planted. When mature, a canopy tree should be at least 40 feet\nhigh and have a crown width of 30 feet or greater. A minimum of 25% of the understory trees\nand 75% of the shrubs shall be evergreens. The preservation of existing stands of trees and\nshrubs is strongly encouraged and can be credited toward meeting this requirement if\nsufficiently demonstrated on the site plan and accompanied by pictures. This bufferyard shall\nbe located on commonly owned land and shall be considered open space. Where any\nindividual lot in the PR-CD does not meet the dimensional and area requirements of the\nunderlying zoning district and abuts existing single family zoning, the aforementioned\nbufferyard shall be required along the entire length of the PR-CD that abuts the existing\ndevelopment.\n(F) Common Open Space.\n(1)\nabout:blank\n62/167\n\n\nNEW PAGE 63\n6/3/24, 7:55 PM\nDobson, NC Code of Ordinances\nArea. Common open space shall not be less than 25% of the total development area. The overall density of\nthe PR-CD shall not exceed the density permitted within the existing zoning district in which the PR-CD is\nproposed. Open space shall be held in common ownership by a homeowners association or accepted by\nthe Town as public open space.\n(2) Land within a floodway or floodway fringe, as defined by FEMA, may be used to provide not\nmore than 50% of the required open space.\n(3) To qualify as open space, land shall be usable for recreation purposes or shall provide visual,\naesthetic, or environmental amenities and may not be occupied by streets, drives, parking\nareas, or structures other than recreational structures. At least 30% of the gross area (unless\notherwise allowed by the Board of Commissioners) dedicated (for open space) must be\nsuitable for and designed to be used as active recreation space (for example, walking trails,\nball fields, playgrounds, and the like).\n(4) Letter of Credit for Maintenance of Open Space Required. Following inspection and approval\nof the construction and/or installation of all required recreational areas in each phase of the\ndevelopment, the developer shall submit a letter of credit issued in the Town's favor, for 100%\nof the annual maintenance cost of these facilities as agreed upon and approved by the Town\nManager and/or Zoning Enforcement Officer. Such letter of credit shall be renewed every 12\nmonths until such time as the developer ceases to have the controlling vote in the\nhomeowner's association, as recorded in the articles of incorporation of the homeowner's\nassociation, and the Town has received written notice thereof along with a copy of the names,\naddresses, and phone numbers of all duly elected members of the homeowner's association\nBoard of directors.\n(5) Access to Open Space. All property owners within the development shall have access to open\nspace by means of a public street or improved walkway located in an easement at least 15\nfeet in width.\n(6) Open Space Connectivity Requirements. Where practicable, areas of open space within a PR-\nCD shall be connected. Separate areas of active open space on site shall be connected by a\nsidewalk or pedestrian path consisting of an all weather surface. Open space in PR-CDs shall\nadjoin open space in neighboring parcels where practicable. If public parks or greenways are\npresent on adjacent sites, a pedestrian connection to these resources shall be made from the\nPR-CD.\n(7) Maintenance of Open Space. Maintenance of the open space, as shown on the approved plan,\nshall be required in perpetuity and shall be the responsibility of the homeowner's association.\n(8) Alternative Compliance. Alternative compliance measures may be proposed which vary from\nthe strict application of the above requirements in order to accommodate the unique\ncharacter of the site or to utilize innovative design. Alternative compliance may be granted by\nabout:blank\n63/167\n\n\n Output:"}]}
