Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Planned Unit Development\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"PUD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Planned Unit Development\n(PUD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Planned Unit Development (PUD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Planned Unit Development (PUD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Planned Unit Development\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft).

Table of Authorized Uses Established\nThe following table lists the principal uses allowed by right within zoning districts as well as uses\nthat may be authorized subject to approval of a Special Use Permit. Function codes of the Land\nBased Classification Standards (LBCS) of the American Planning Association (APA) correspond to\nthe authorized uses and shall be used to define uses. All uses are subject to the standards and\nregulations within this UDO.\nB. Permitted and Prohibited Uses\nUses not listed as permitted (P); permitted with supplemental use standards (PS); or requiring a\nspecial use permit (S) are presumed to be prohibited (-) from the applicable zoning district.\nC. Uses Not Listed\nIn the event that a particular use is not listed in the Use Table, and such use is not listed as a\nprohibited use and is not otherwise prohibited by law, the Administrator shall determine whether\na\nmaterially similar use exists in this chapter. Should the Administrator determine that a materially\nsimilar use does exist, the regulations governing that use shall apply to the particular use not listed\nand the Administrator's decision shall be recorded in writing.\nD. Similar Uses\nThe Administrator may determine that a use is materially similar if a permitted use is similarly\nclassified by one or more of the following use classification systems:\n1. Land Based Classification Standards (LBCS) of the American Planning Association (APA)\n2. North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS)\nE. Use Table\nUses listed as (P) or (PS) which require a Transportation Impact Analysis (according to Article 7 -\nSubdivisions & Infrastructure), multi-family dwelling developments and all subdivision\ndevelopments with 10 lots or more, are subject to the Major Site/Major Subdivision Preliminary\nPlan Review Process established in Article 8 - Development Processes. See Appendix B - Typical\nDevelopment Process Chart for more information regarding how the development process will be\nadministered according to the use allowances established below.\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n4-2\nADOPTION DATE: JANUARY 13, 2020\n\n\n Output:"}]}
