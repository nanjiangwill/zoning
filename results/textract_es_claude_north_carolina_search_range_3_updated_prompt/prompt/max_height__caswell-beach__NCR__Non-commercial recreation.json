Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Non-commercial recreation\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"NCR\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Non-commercial recreation\n(NCR) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Non-commercial recreation (NCR). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Non-commercial recreation (NCR)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Non-commercial recreation\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

This district is intended for single-family housing at a specific density; such\nas 20,000 square feet per residence. The regulations are designed to maintain a suitable environment for family living.\n(B) Single-family residential districts (R-20, R-12, R-8). These districts are intended primarily for single-family houses at\nvarious densities of population. Certain non-residential uses of public or semi-public nature are permitted. The regulations\nfor these districts are designed to maintain a suitable environment for family living. Densities of development are controlled\nby minimum lot area requirements, which are different with each district. The minimum lot area requirements, in thousands of\nsquare feet, is indicated by the numerical identification of each district.\n(C) Multi-family residential district (R-20MF). The purpose of the R-20MF multi-family district is to provide for low density\napartment development in areas which would be unsuited for multi-family use on a higher density. By having high\ndimensional standards and requiring site plan approval, maximum control of development can be achieved through this\ndistrict.\n(D) R-MH Mobile homes district. The purpose of this district is to provide for the development of properly located and\nplanned facilities for mobile homes. It is recognized that mobile homes should be located in mobile home parks and\nsubdivisions only and that such areas must be carefully located and designed to meet the needs of the residents and to\nachieve a satisfactory relationship to adjoining and nearby property.\n(E) Resort residential condominium district. This district is designed primarily as a district for resort-style condominiums\nserving visitors and tourists, composed of multi-family dwellings, parking and accessory uses such as sales and rental\noffices and recreation amenities.\n(F) Business district. Reserved.\n(G) Conservation. This district is intended to preserve and protect fragile estuarine cosystem from adverse affects\ncreated by incompatible uses.\n(H) Commercial recreation district (CR).\n(1) This district is established to maintain and protect the existing golf course and related uses. The principal use of the\nland is for recreational pursuits which are in keeping with the town's low density single-family residential development. It is\nalso the intent to limit the uses to those that presently exist.\n(a) Golf course;\n(b) Golf club house and pro shop;\n(c) Swimming pool;\n(d) Tennis courts;\n(e) Accessory buildings for golf course maintenance;\n(f) Restaurants with lounge.\n(2) Any new uses (not listed in subdivision (H)(1)) will require the zoning amendment procedure.\n(I) Non-commercial recreation district (NCR). The purpose of this district is to provide and maintain public access to the\ndesignated park land and the beach.\n(1) It is the intent of this section to limit the use to those that presently exist:\n(a) Education;\n(b) Preservation and maintenance, including historic preservation;\n\n\nNEW PAGE 8\n(c) Beach access;\n(d) Parking;\n(e) Fund raising in support of the above uses, including the sale of souvenir items.\n(2) Any new uses not listed in subdivision (I)(1) shall require amendment of this section.\n(Ord. passed 6-8-78; Am.

Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on the map, the following rules shall apply:\n(A) Where a district boundary appears to divide a lot, the location of such boundary, unless the boundary is indicated by\ndimensions, shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing on the map. In the event that a district boundary line on\nthe zoning map divides a platted lot held in one ownership on the date of passage of this chapter, each part of the lot so\ndivided shall be used in conformity with the zoning district in which the part is located.\n(B) Regardless of the existence of copies of the official zoning map which may from time to time be published, the official\nzoning map shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land, buildings or other structures within the\ncorporate limits of the town. The official zoning map shall be kept in the office of the Town Clerk and made available to the\npublic in read only format. All amendments to said map shall be entered onto the official map with date and reference along\nwith certification by the Town Clerk under his or her seal.

Nothing in \u00a7 153.086\nshall prohibit the repair or rebuilding of a structure or use based solely upon the lot coverage or\nbulk size requirements imposed, should such a structure be destroyed or damaged by fire,\nexplosion, tornado, earthquake, hurricane or similar uncontrollable cause. Should a structure\nsuffer such damage or destruction it must be permitted to be repaired or rebuilt in the same\nfootprint that was occupied prior to the damage within one year of the date of such damage, but\nnot thereafter.\n** Note: In determining compliance with the requirements of $153.086, compliance with\nmaximum built-upon area is the first consideration. Therefore, a structure of 5,400 square feet\nbulk size is permitted only if the resultant total built-upon area associated with the construction of\nthe residence including all other impervious or partially impervious surfaces complies with the\nmaximum built-upon area limitations set out in \u00a7 153.086.\n(Ord. 2013-08-0, passed 5-9-13; Am.

The build-to-line is a straight line drawn between the points farthest from the street lot line on\nthe immediately adjacent structures. The line is drawn between that point on each of the immediately adjacent structures\nthat is farthest from the street lot line when measured perpendicularly to the roadway. Should there be no immediately\nadjacent structure or structures, the above-mentioned straight line shall be made between the nearest adjacent structures\ntaking into consideration the curve of the road in front of the property.\n(3) Determination of the ocean-ward or marsh-ward points of adjacent properties farthest from the street lot line and\nproduction of the build-to-line. Using the entirety of each adjacent structure with all attached above-ground level features,\nthe surveyor preparing the proposed building plan shall identify, by survey measurement, the point on each structure that is\nfarthest from the street lot line. The surveyor will prepare a certified line between those points, that will establish the build-to-\nline. Existing fences and walkways over the dunes shall not be used in the survey measurement. Elevated stairs leading\nfrom the principal structure to a walkway are, in their entirety, considered part of the structure. Stairs leading from the\nprincipal structure or attached porch/deck to the ground are, in their entirety, considered part of the structure and shall be\nconsidered in the build-to-line measurement. For purposes of identifying the build-to-line, transitions from residential\nstructure to walkway wider than six feet shall be considered part of the structure.\n(C) Applicability.\n(1) All above-ground construction and placement of structures, including but not necessarily limited to housing, exterior\ndecks, walkways, docks and viewing and seating platforms detached from housing shall be subject to the build-to-line\nprovisions established by this section. No decking, stairs, or at-grade improvements exceeding six inches in height shall be\npermitted ocean-ward or marsh-ward of the build-to-line except as provided in division (D), Exemptions.\n(2) For purposes of this section, structures include buildings, screened enclosures, fences, above-ground swimming\npools and/or man-made facilities or infrastructure that is principally above ground.\n(D) Exemptions. The following shall be permitted beyond the build-to-line subject to the standards provided.\n(1) Walkways, viewing platforms, docks, stairs to the beach, and similar appurtenances.\n(a) Walkways (including associated stairs) connecting the principal structure to beach and marsh walkways and\ndetached seating and viewing platforms shall occur as close as possible to the natural, undisturbed contour of the terrain,\nbut no lower than provided for by CAMA rules, so as to minimize intrusion into the natural features and beauty of the town's\nlandscape. Stairs leading from a walkway to a ground level feature, which may include an in-ground pool, beach, marsh, or\nsimilar, are permitted.\n(b) To minimize intrusion into the health and natural beauty of the dunes, residential walkways must follow, within\nreason, the shortest straight-line path from the structure to the beach. The maximum allowed width for a walkway from a\nresidential structure is six feet. The walking surface of the walkway deck shall be no greater than 18 inches above the\nhighest point of the natural, undisturbed peak of the terrain under the proposed path of the structure.\n(c) A viewing platform, with a total footprint not to exceed 200 square feet may be attached to the walkway. The\nplatform shall be immediately adjacent to the walkway with a transition from walkway to deck not to exceed four feet. The\nwalking surface of the platform may not be elevated above the walking surface of the walkway.\n(d) 1. Hand railings or guard railings on residential walkways shall be no higher than required by the NC Building\nCode. Where elevation requires fall protection, walkway railings must provide at least 50% open space, measured between\nthe vertical pilings. Where code mandates fall protection due to elevation, vertical or horizontal balusters shall be used in a\nmanner conforming to NC Building Code and shall be sized and spaced to provide at least 50% open space, measured\nbetween the vertical pilings. Lattice type closure on railings is not permitted.\n2. For example, a guard rail constructed with a top rail five inches tall, with one and one-half inch vertical or\nhorizontal balusters spaced three and four-fifths inches apart, and a bottom runner that is three and one-half inches tall will\nprovide more than 54% open space.\n(e) Under no circumstances shall a detached platform, walkway, or dock, be roofed, enclosed or have a second story.\n(2) Swimming pool fences. Pool security fences mandated by NC Building Code may be placed on the perimeter of the\npool at the minimum height required by code. Such fences shall be at minimum 70% transparent.\n(3) Construction of minor ornamental features. On marsh side properties, construction of minor ornamental features\nwith horizontal dimensions no greater than six feet and height no greater than three feet are permitted. Such features may\ninclude, but are not limited to, fire pits, benches, and seating.\n(E) Build-to-line when replacing, enlarging, or elevating an existing structure.\n(1) When an existing structure is removed, the build-to-line must be established for any new construction,\nredevelopment, or placement of a structure on that site relative to adjacent properties. The new principal structure and all\naccessory structures shall be subject to the provisions of this section.\n(2) Elevating an existing structure or adding another floor to an existing structure shall be subject to the build-to-line.\nSuch elevation or addition shall only be permitted if the existing structure and new construction are street-ward of the build-\nto-line.\n\n\n Output:"}]}
