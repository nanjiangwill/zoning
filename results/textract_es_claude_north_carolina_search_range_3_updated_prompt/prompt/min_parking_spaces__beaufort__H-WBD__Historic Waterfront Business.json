Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Historic Waterfront Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"H-WBD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Historic Waterfront Business\n(H-WBD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Historic Waterfront Business (H-WBD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Historic Waterfront Business (H-WBD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Historic Waterfront Business\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

Occupations\nA) Intent and Purpose.\nThe Town of Beaufort recognizes the desire and/or need for some citizens to use their\nresidence for limited nonresidential activities. However, the Town believes the need to\nprotect the integrity of residential areas is of paramount concern. A \"home occupation\"\nzoning provision, therefore, should protect residential areas from adverse impacts resulting\nfrom activities associated with home occupations. It is important to allow but to also to\nregulate some nonresidential activities in the Town's residential districts. In essence, a \"home\noccupation\" is a limited commercial-type activity in a residential area to an extent no\nneighbors or passersby will be aware, by outward appearance, of the activity. In practice, a\n\"home occupation\" gives the resident the legal right to use ones' residence for limited\nbusiness activities but not to the extent significant pedestrian and vehicular traffic is\ngenerated.\nB) Performance Criteria.\nA home occupation shall meet the following minimum conditions:\n1) The activity shall not be inconsistent with the use of the premises as dwelling.\n2) Only residents of the dwelling unit shall work there.\n3) There shall be no exterior evidence of the conduct of a home occupation, except as\nspecified in subsection C of this section. Thus, there may be no display of products visible\nin any manner from the outside of the home.\n4) A home occupation shall be conducted in an enclosed area of a primary or accessory\nstructure. It shall not occupy over twenty-five percent (25%) of the combined floor space\nof the primary and accessory structures. No portion of a home occupation shall be\nconducted outside the primary residence or accessory structure.\n5) Electrical or mechanical equipment which creates electromagnetic interference or causes\nfluctuations in line voltage outside the dwelling unit or creates noise not normally\nassociated with residential uses shall be prohibited.\n6) On-site sale of goods or services not produced on the premises shall be prohibited.\n7)\nA home occupation shall not create a significant increase, as determined by the zoning\nadministrator, in vehicular or pedestrian traffic to the residence.\n8)\nA home occupation shall not require additional off-street parking spaces for clients or\ncustomers of the home occupation.\n9) No home occupation shall result in garbage disposal exceeding standard residential use.\n10) No equipment or process shall be used in a home occupation which creates noise,\nvibration, glare, fumes, or odor detectable to the normal senses off the property.\nC) Permitted Signs.\nMore information on signs can be found in section 16 of this Ordinance. An indirectly lighted\nname plate or professional sign not over one square foot (1 ft2 in area and attached flat against\nthe building shall be permitted in connection with an incidental home occupation.\nD) Inspections.\nAn inspector shall have the right at any time, upon reasonable request and with the consent\nof the property owner, to enter and inspect the premises for safety and compliance purposes.\n135\n\n\nNEW PAGE 160\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\nSECTION 13\nParking Requirements\nA) Intent.\nThese regulations are intended to provide off-street parking, stacking, and loading facilities\nin proportion to the need created by each use. These regulations are intended to provide for\naccommodation vehicles in a functionally and aesthetically satisfactory manner and to\nminimize external effects on adjacent land uses.\nB) Number of Parking Spaces Required.\n1) Limitations.\nAll developments in all zoning districts other than the Historic Business District and the\nHistoric Waterfront Business District (H-BD & H-WBD) shall provide a sufficient\nnumber of parking spaces to accommodate the number of vehicles which ordinarily are\nlikely to be attracted to the development in question. For any mixed-use development\ncreated after the adoption of this Ordinance who cannot meet the residential off-street\nparking requirement for their proposed development, the owner/developer shall be\nrequired to contribute $10,000 per parking space needed into a parking fund which will\nbe used by the Town to acquire property as it becomes available for off-street parking for\nthese residential purposes.\n2) Presumptions.\nThe presumptions established by this section are established in all other zoning districts:\na) A development must comply with the parking standards set forth in subsection B-4\nof this section to satisfy the requirement stated in subsection B-1 lof this section; and,\nb) Any development which meets these standards is in compliance. However, Table 13-\n1 of this section is only intended to establish a presumption of parking demand and\nshould be flexibly administered, as provided in subsection C of this section.\n3) Standards.\nStandards set forth in Table 13-1 of this section are indicated by the respective land uses\nassociated within the development. When a determination of the number of parking\nspaces required by this table results in a fractional parking space, any fraction of one-half\nor less may be disregarded, while a fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one\nadditional parking space.\n4) Table of Parking Requirements.\nTable 13-1 of this section shall prescribe the number of parking spaces required for the\nrespective uses when the existing or proposed development is less than twenty-five\nthousand square feet (25,000 ft2). For all existing, proposed, or combination thereof\nof\ndevelopment which is twenty-five thousand square feet (25,000 ft2) or more, there shall\nbe a corresponding twenty percent (20%) decrease in the number of parking spaces\nrequired for this actual use. Table 13-1of this section cannot and does not cover every\npossible situation which may arise. Therefore, in cases not specifically covered, the\npermit issuing authority is authorized to determine the parking requirements using the\nfollowing table as a guide.\n136\n\n\nNEW PAGE 161\nLand

The Board of Commissioners finds trees\nand landscaping:\n1) Provide visual buffering and enhance the beautification of the Town;\n2) Safeguard and enhance property values;\n3) Conserve energy;\n4) Enhance groundwater recharge;\n5) Abate storm water runoff and soil erosion; and,\n6) Reduce noise, glare, and heat.\nB) Vehicle Accommodation Area (VAA) Exemptions\nThe following are exemptions from the landscaping provisions of this Section for VAAs:\n1) Single-family and two family residential parking areas;\n2) Truck loading areas in front of overhead doors;\n3) Truck maneuvering and parking areas unconnected to and exclusive of any vehicle\nparking;\n4) Surfaced areas not to be used for vehicle parking, driving, or maneuvering, provided they\nare made inaccessible to vehicles by a barrier such as bollards, curbs, or fencing;\n5) Vehicle displays, sales, service, and storage areas (parking facilities for these uses are\nsubject to shading requirements); and,\n6) Parking areas under covered stalls and in public garages.\nC) Landscaping Plan Required.\nAll proposed developments and expansions of existing development which result in high or\nmoderately-high impervious surface ratio (ISR) intensity, as defined hereinafter, shall submit\na landscaping plan for review containing the following information:\n1) Landscaping Plan Requirements.\nWhen required, this section and section 18 of this Ordinance, shall work collectively to\nform the site plan needed for such development. A landscaping plan shall contain the\nfollowing items:\na) General location, type, and quantity of plant material;\nb) Existing, protected, or exceptional trees as defined in section 14-B of this Ordinance;\nc) Existing plant material and areas to be left in their natural state;\nd) Location, size and labels for all proposed plants;\ne) Plant lists with common name, quantity, spacing, and size of all proposed landscaping\nmaterial at the time of planting;\nf)\nLocation and description of other landscape improvements such as islands, earth\nberms, walls, fences, buffer yards, sculptures, fountains, street furniture, lights,\ncourtyards, or paved areas;\ng) Planting and installation details;\nh) Location of proposed building(s);\ni) Location of VAAs and internal traffic patterns;\nj) Location of overhead and underground utilities;\n152\n\n\nNEW PAGE 177\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\nk) The landscaping plan shall be drawn to scale, include a North arrow, necessary\nlegends; and,\n1)\nThe location and description of any barriers to be erected to protect any vegetation\nfrom damage both during and after construction.\n2) Applicability.\nExcept for those properties and developments which subsection C-3 of this section\napplies, a landscaping plan is required when:\na)\nA new principal building, new use, or open use of land is constructed, reconstructed,\nor established after the effective date of this Ordinance;\nb) Any development which changes the amount of impervious surface by more than\nfifteen percent (15%). The extent which these standards apply is determined by the\ntable below. These expansions shall include change of use, expansions of buildings,\nparking areas, open uses of land, or combinations thereof.\nTable 15-1 Expansion of Impervious Surface\n3) Exemptions.\nThe following are exempt from this subsection:\na) Developments of less than eight thousand square feet (8000 ft2);\nb) Single-family residential lots;\nc) Expansions of less than fifteen percent (15%) of the ISR as defined in Table 15-1 of\nthis section;\nd) Lots in the Historic Waterfront Business District (H-WBD) and the Historic Business\nDistrict (H-BD) which do not provide off-street parking; and,\ne) Landscaping requirements of this section shall be applied equally to all similarly\nsituated properties. Modifications to these standards may be granted in writing by the\nadministrator if the administrator finds any of the following circumstances exist on\nthe proposed building site or surrounding properties:\ni) Natural land characteristics such as topography or existing vegetation on the\nproposed building site would achieve the same intent of this section;\nii) Innovative landscaping or architectural design is employed on the building site\nwhich would achieve an equivalent shading, aesthetic, and buffering effect;\niii) The required landscaping would be ineffective at maturity due to the proposed\ntopography of the site and/or the location of the improvements on the site; and,\niv) No landscaping shall be required in areas where the Technical Review Committee\n(TRC) finds it would interfere with traffic safety.\nD) Impervious Surface Intensity (ISI).\nVAAs and impervious surface areas shall be categorized according to their impervious\nsurface ratios as specified in Table 15-2.\nTable 15-2 Impervious Surface Intensity Classification\n153\nCELL (1, 1): \nExpansions (% of original ISR)\nCELL (1, 2): \nApplication of Landscaping Requirements\nCELL (2, 1): \n0 15 %\nCELL (2, 2): \nExempt\nCELL (3, 1): \n16 45 %\nCELL (3, 2): \nApplies to expanded areas only\nCELL (4, 1): \n45 % and more\nCELL (4, 2): \nApplies to the whole lot(s)\nCELL (1, 1): \nImpervious Surface Ratio (ISR)\nCELL (1, 2): \nImpervious Surface Intensity (ISI)\nCELL (2, 1): \n0.86-1.0\nCELL (2, 2): \nHigh\nCELL (3, 1): \n0.70-0.85\nCELL (3, 2): \nModerately High\nCELL (4, 1): \n0.41-0.69\nCELL (4, 2): \nModerate\nCELL (5, 1): \n0.40 and below\nCELL (5, 2): \nLow\n\n\n Output:"}]}
