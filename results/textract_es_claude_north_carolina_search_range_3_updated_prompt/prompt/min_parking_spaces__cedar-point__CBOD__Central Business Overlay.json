Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Central Business Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CBOD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Central Business Overlay\n(CBOD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Central Business Overlay (CBOD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Central Business Overlay (CBOD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Central Business Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

No chain link fencing may be used to comply\nwith any part of this section. Dumpsters shall not be allowed in any\nrequired setback or yard space.\nb. Dumpster or mechanical equipment may not be placed in any yard\nthat has access to a public street.\nC.\nMechanical equipment shall be screened from the public street by\nwalls, fencing and/or landscaping. Mechanical equipment on\nrooftops shall be screened from the view of the public street. No\nchain link fencing may be used to comply with any part of this\nsection.\nd. A developer may choose to substantially screen from public view\na parking area by utilizing an earthen berm, masonry wall or other\nsuitable means of screening as determined by the Planning Board.\nii.\nBuffering Standards\nWhen any commercially zoned parcel within the jurisdiction of the\nCedar Point Central Business Overlay District abuts and residentially\nzoned parcel, there shall remain a thirty-five (35) foot vegetative buffer\nto be approved by both the Planning Board and Board of\nCommissioners.\n(g)\nConstruction Standards\ni.\nType of Construction:\na. The predominate exterior building materials on a fa\u00e7ade visible\nfrom a public street shall be of brick, textured masonry unit, stucco,\nstone, wood, cement fiber material (such as \"Hardie board\"), glass\nor the equivalent. No concrete masonry units, such as concrete\nblocks or cinder blocks, are permitted when visible from a public\nstreet unless they are textured to give the appearance of rough\nstone.\nb. The use of vinyl or metal siding is prohibited. Residential\nmanufactured homes/units, non-residential manufactured\nhomes/units, mobile, modular and metal units shall be prohibited,\nexcept for temporary use during construction or for storage of\nmaterials during construction.\nii.\nBuilding Mass:\nHistorically, the buildings in Cedar Point were small and pedestrian\nscaled. Recently proposed developments include buildings which are\nmore massive with large big-box stores and expansive parking areas.\nThese developments have lost the human, intimate scale of Cedar Point.\nMany techniques in this regulation provide tools for allowing large\nPage 77\n\n\nNEW PAGE 78\ndevelopment while reducing their perceived massiveness. While the\nfootprint of new commercial development may remain large, massing\nand organization of building forms can help to retain the human scale of\nCedar Point. There is a difference between massively scaled buildings\nand monumentally scaled buildings. Monumental buildings still relate to\nthe human scale but are carefully made larger to exhibit a sense of\nimportance. Buildings such as churches and institutional buildings are\noften built with this kind of scale in mind. Massive buildings are simply\nhuge buildings that dwarf and are not intended to relate to human scale.\nAirplane hangars, for instance, relate to the scale of an airplane and are\ntherefore massive. When large retail stores become as massive as an\nairplane hangar, they lose their relationship to the human user and feel\nunfriendly.\na. Use techniques to reduce the perceived mass of large buildings.\nWhen making transitions to lower density areas, modulate the mass\nof the building to relate to smaller buildings. Heights can be greater\nif the mass is modulated and other scale techniques are adopted.\nReduce height near low density uses.\nb. Use building mass appropriate to the site. Place buildings of the\ngreatest footprint, massing, and height in activity center core areas\nor at the heart of office developments where the impact on adjacent\nuses is the least.\nC. Floor-to-floor heights of a building can have an impact on the mass\nof a building. For instance, typical ceiling heights in a residence are\n8-9 feet. First floors of office buildings or retail shops can range\nfrom 10-15 feet. Upper floors that include residential or office are\ngenerally 8-12 feet in height. Big-box retailers may have floor to\nceiling heights exceeding 15 feet. When actual or implied floor-to-\nfloor heights exceed these dimensions on the exterior, then a\nbuilding may begin to read more massive than human scaled. When\narticulating large buildings, keep these dimensions in mind.\niii.\nBuilding Size Limitations:\nParcels within the Cedar Point Business Overlay District shall be limited\nto only one commercial structure not to exceed 50,000 square feet of\ntotal structural building area, whether on one floor or multiple floors,\nincluding all attached portions, on any single parcel of land to serve as\nthe principal structure. Any additional buildings on a single lot shall\nfollow the requirements of the underlying zoning district.\niv.\nBuilding Elements and Materials:\nThis section addresses the design elements that impact the exterior\nappearance of a building including:\nroof form and articulation;\nfacade articulation;\narchitectural details;\nmaterials and textures; and\nPage 78\n\nNEW PAGE 81\n(2) Limit the number of color choices. Generally, there is a wall\ncolor, trim color, accent color, and roof color.\n(3)\nUse natural tints of materials such as reds, browns, tans,\ngrays, and greens as primary colors. Save bright accent\ncolors for awnings and signs on commercial buildings.\nBrighter palettes of colors can be employed on residential\nbuildings.\n(4) Use color variation to break up the mass of a building and\nprovide visual interest.\n(h)\nTraffic Impact Analysis Requirement: A Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA)\nshall be required for commercial/industrial type developments proposed\nwithin Town of Cedar Point's Central Business Overlay District with an\nestimated trip generation of 3,000 vehicles per day or greater during an\naverage weekday based on a five-day national average as defined in the\nInstitute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual. The\nTIA shall be developed in accordance with \"Appendix A\" of this Ordinance.\nPage 81\n\n\nNEW PAGE 82\nChapter 6 - Use Standards\n6.1\nUSE TABLE\nA. EXPLANATION OF USE TABLE STRUCTURE\nFor each base zoning district established in this Ordinance, Table 6.1.1, Table of\nPermitted Uses, lists land uses and indicates whether individual uses are prohibited,\npermitted by right, or require a Special Use Permit.\nB. UNLISTED USES\n1. Procedure for Approving Unlisted Uses\nWhere this Ordinance does not list a use as a permitted use or special use in a\nzoning district, and such use is also not prohibited or restricted by this Ordinance\nor elsewhere in the Town Code, upon application for a building permit or any\npermit required under this Ordinance the Town Manager, in the case of a\npermitted use, or the Town Board, in the case of a special use, may allow the\nunlisted use as provided in subsections 2. or 3. below upon a finding that the\nproposed unlisted use:\n(a)\nis similar to permitted or special use allowed in the specific zoning district\nand has an impact that is substantially the same in nature, function, and\nduration as the permitted or special uses allowed in the specific zoning\ndistrict where the unlisted use is proposed, and\n(b) has no adverse impact on neighboring properties or the public interest\ngreater than adverse impacts of permitted or special uses in the zoning\ndistrict where the property is located.\nIn considering a permit for an unlisted use, the Town Manager or Board shall\ngive due consideration to the intent of this Chapter and other provisions of the\nTown Code concerning the district(s) involved, the character of the uses\nspecifically identified, and the character of the use(s) in question.\n2. Criteria for Approving Unlisted Uses\n(a) Substantial equivalent of a permitted use. The Town Manager will\ndetermine whether the application for an unlisted use is the substantial\nequivalent of a permitted use.\ni.\nSchedule a Hearing. The Town Manager will schedule a hearing on\nthe application as he determines whether the application is the\nsubstantial equivalent of a permitted use in the zoning district. At\nleast two weeks prior to the hearing, he shall mail a notice of the hearing\nto the adjacent property owners by regular first-class mail using the\nnames and addresses for such owners as contained on the Carteret\nCounty GIS website. He shall also provide notice of the hearing to the\nCedar Point Mayor and Board of Commissioners.\nii.\nParties in Interest. Adjacent property owners and the\niii.\nTown of Cedar Point are deemed to be interested parties and shall have\nstanding to appeal the Town Manager's decision to the Board of\nAdjustment.\nPage 82\n\n\nNEW PAGE 83\niv.\nCriteria. In order to determine that the proposed use has an impact that\nis similar in nature, function, and duration to a permitted use allowed in\nthe specific zoning district where the property is located, the Town\nManager shall assess all relevant characteristics of the proposed use,\nincluding but not limited to the following:\na. The volume and type of sales, retail, wholesale; size and type of\nitems sold and nature of inventory on the premises;\nb. Any processing done on the premises, including assembly,\nmanufacturing, warehousing, shipping, distribution; any\ndangerous, hazardous, toxic, or explosive materials used in the\nprocessing;\nc. The nature and location of storage and outdoor display of\nmerchandise; enclosed, open, inside or outside the principal\nbuilding; and predominant types of items stored (such as business\nvehicles, work-in-process, inventory, and merchandise,\nconstruction materials, scrap and junk, and raw materials\nincluding liquids and powders);\nd. The type, size and nature of buildings and structures;\ne. The number and density of persons who will occupy, visit or attend\nthe use;\nf. Vehicular and pedestrian traffic including types of vehicles\nconveying persons or property to a use and characteristics of traffic\ngeneration to and from the site;\ng.\nParking requirements, turnover and generation, ratio of the\nnumber of spaces required per unit area or activity, and the\npotential for shared parking with other uses;\nh. The amount and nature of any adverse impact generated from\nor accessing the premises, including but not limited to noise,\nsmoke, odor, lighting, glare, vibration, radiation and fumes;\ni. Any special public utility requirements for serving the proposed\nuse, including but not limited to water supply, wastewater\noutput, pre-treatment of wastes and emissions required or\nrecommended, and any significant power structures and\ncommunications towers or facilities;\nj.\nThe fundamental nature of the proposed use compared to permitted\nuses;\nk. Any special government service requirements for serving the\nproposed use, including law enforcement and public works; and\n1.\nThe anticipated hours of operation of the unlisted use compared to\nthe typical hours of operation of the comparable use.\nV.\nDetermination by the Town Manager.\nAll determinations by the\nTown Manager made pursuant to this subsection shall be in writing.\nvi.\nAppeal of Determination of the Town Manager. Within 10 days of\nissuance or denial, the determination of the Town Manager may be\nappealed to the Zoning Board of Adjustment pursuant to the\nprocedures set forth Section 3.12 of this Ordinance; however,\nPage 83\n\n\n Output:"}]}
