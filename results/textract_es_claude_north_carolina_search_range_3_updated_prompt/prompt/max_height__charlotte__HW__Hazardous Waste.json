Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Hazardous Waste\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"HW\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Hazardous Waste\n(HW) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Hazardous Waste (HW). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Hazardous Waste (HW)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Hazardous Waste\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

The one existing district, which is not convertible, is the R-1.0MF. The\nPlanning Department will initiate a rezoning to change properties in this district to a suitable\ndistrict under the new zoning ordinance.\n(Petition No. 2012-020, 05/14/2012)\nNewly created zoning districts, such as the NS and O-3, will not be applied as part of the\nconversion. These districts will be placed on the ground either through public initiated rezonings\nthrough the area planning process or private initiated rezoning petitions.\nA-1\n\n\nNEW PAGE 835\nZONING MAPS CONVERSION\nA-2\nCELL (1, 1): \nExisting Districts\nCELL (1, 2): \nNew Districts\nCELL (2, 1): \nRU\nCELL (2, 2): \nR-3\nCELL (3, 1): \nR-15\nCELL (3, 2): \nR-3\nCELL (4, 1): \nR-12\nCELL (4, 2): \nR-3\nCELL (5, 1): \nR-9\nCELL (5, 2): \nR-4\nCELL (6, 1): \n---\nR-6\nCELL (6, 2): \n---\nR-5\nCELL (7, 1): \n---\nCELL (7, 2): \nR-6\nCELL (8, 1): \n---\nCELL (8, 2): \nR-8\nCELL (9, 1): \nR-R\nCELL (9, 2): \nR-5\nCELL (10, 1): \nR-20MF wo/Site Plans\nCELL (10, 2): \nR-8MF\nCELL (11, 1): \nR-15MF\nCELL (11, 2): \nR-12MF\nCELL (12, 1): \nR-12MF\nCELL (12, 2): \nR-17MF\nCELL (13, 1): \nR-9MF\nCELL (13, 2): \nR-17MF\nCELL (14, 1): \nR-6MF\nCELL (14, 2): \nR-22MF\nCELL (15, 1): \nR-6MFH\nCELL (15, 2): \nR-43MF\nCELL (16, 1): \nRE-1\nCELL (16, 2): \nRE-1\nCELL (17, 1): \nRE-2\nCELL (17, 2): \nRE-2\nCELL (18, 1): \nInst\nCELL (18, 2): \nInst\nCELL (19, 1): \nO-15\nCELL (19, 2): \nO-1\nCELL (20, 1): \nO-9\nCELL (20, 2): \nO-2\nCELL (21, 1): \nO-6\nCELL (21, 2): \nO-2\nCELL (22, 1): \n---\nCELL (22, 2): \nO-3\nCELL (23, 1): \nB-1\nCELL (23, 2): \nB-1\nCELL (24, 1): \nB-2\nCELL (24, 2): \nB-2\nCELL (25, 1): \nB-D\nCELL (25, 2): \nB-D\nCELL (26, 1): \nUI\nCELL (26, 2): \nUI\nCELL (27, 1): \nI-1\nCELL (27, 2): \nI-1\nCELL (28, 1): \nI-2\nCELL (28, 2): \nI-2\nCELL (29, 1): \nI-3\nCELL (29, 2): \nI-2\nCELL (30, 1): \nHD\nCELL (30, 2): \nHD-O (Historic District)\nCELL (31, 1): \n---\nCELL (31, 2): \nA-O (Airport)\nCELL (32, 1): \n---\nCELL (32, 2): \nC-O (Corridor)\nCELL (33, 1): \n---\nCELL (33, 2): \nMH-O (Manufactured Home)\nCELL (34, 1): \n---\nCELL (34, 2): \nMX-1\nCELL (35, 1): \n---\nCELL (35, 2): \nMX-2\nCELL (36, 1): \n---\nCELL (36, 2): \nMX-3\nCELL (37, 1): \n---\nCELL (37, 2): \nR-MH\nCELL (38, 1): \n---\nCELL (38, 2): \nCC\nCELL (39, 1): \nBP\nCELL (39, 2): \nBP\nCELL (40, 1): \n---\nCELL (40, 2): \nNS\nCELL (41, 1): \n---\nCELL (41, 2): \nHW\nCELL (42, 1): \nUDC-V\nCELL (42, 2): \n---\nCELL (43, 1): \nR-MH\nCELL (43, 2): \nContinue * (Also, See Special Purpose Districts)\nCELL (44, 1): \nR-20MF Innovative\nCELL (44, 2): \nContinue *\nCELL (45, 1): \nR-20MF w/Site Plans\nCELL (45, 2): \nContinue *\nCELL (46, 1): \nR-I\nCELL (46, 2): \nContinue *\nCELL (47, 1): \nR-PUD\nCELL (47, 2): \nContinue *\n\n\n Output:"}]}
