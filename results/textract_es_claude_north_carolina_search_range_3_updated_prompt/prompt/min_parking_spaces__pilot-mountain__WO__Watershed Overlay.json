Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Watershed Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"WO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Watershed Overlay\n(WO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Watershed Overlay (WO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is \nnot for the zone \"Watershed Overlay (WO)\" but for other zones. \nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Watershed Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Jurisdiction. The provisions of this section shall apply within the corporate limits of the town\nand within the territory beyond the corporate limits as prescribed by N.C.G.S. 160D, as now\nor hereafter fixed, for a distance of one mile in all directions.\n2. Exceptions to Applicability. Existing development, as defined in this section is not subject\nto the requirements of this section. Expansions to structures classified as existing\n\n\nNEW PAGE 87\ndevelopment must meet the requirements of this section; however, the built-upon area of the\nexisting development is not required to be included in the density calculations.\nA pre-existing lot owned by an individual prior to the effective date of this section, regardless\nof whether or not a vested right has been established, may be developed for single-family\nresidential purposes without being subject to the restrictions of this section. However, this\nexemption is not applicable to multiple contiguous lots under single ownership.\n3. Cluster Development. Minimum lot sizes are not applicable to single-family cluster\ndevelopments projects; however, the total number of lots shall not exceed the number of lots\nallowed for single-family detached developments. The overall residential density or\nnonresidential built-upon area shall not exceed that allowed for the critical area or the\nbalance of the watershed, whichever is applicable.\n4. Buffer Zone Required\na. A buffer zone for the purposes of this requirement is defined as an area of natural\nor\nplanted vegetation through which storm water runoff flows in a diffuse manner so that\nthe runoff does not become channelized and which provides for infiltration of the\nrunoff and filtering of pollutants. The buffer zone is measured from the normal pool\nelevation of impounded structures and from the bank of each side of streams and\nrivers.\nb. No new development is allowed in the buffer zone, except for water dependent\nstructures and public projects such as road crossings and green ways where no\npractical alternative exists.\nC. These activities should minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff away from the\nsurface waters and maximize the utilization of storm water best management\npractices.\nd. A minimum thirty (30') foot vegetative buffer zone for development activities is\nrequired along all perennial waters indicated on the most recent versions of U.S.G.S.\n1:24,000 (7.5 minute) scale topographic maps or as determined by local government\nstudies, unless a high density option is chosen and then a one-hundred (100') foot\nbuffer zone is required. Desirable artificial stream bank or shoreline stabilization\nis\npermitted.\n5. Ordinance Administrator's Duties. It shall be the duty of Ordinance Administrator to\nadminister and enforce the provisions of this section as follows:\na. The Ordinance Administrator shall keep records of all amendments to these overlay\nprovisions and shall provide copies of all amendments upon adoption to the N.C.\nDivision of Environmental Quality and the N.C. Division of Community Assistance.\nb.\nThe Ordinance Administrator shall keep a record of minor and major watershed\nvariances to these overlay provisions. The record of all minor watershed variances\nshall be submitted to the Environmental Management Commission on an annual\nbasis and shall provide a description of each project receiving a variance and the\nreasons for granting the variance.\n6. Definitions. For the purpose of this subsection, the following definitions shall apply unless\nthe context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.\nAGRICULTURAL USE. The use of waters for stock watering, irrigation and other farm\n\nNEW PAGE 89\ntime to time by the Board of Commissioners to cover cost of advertising as required\nby this chapter.\nC. The proposed request for a minor or major watershed variance shall include a site\nplan, drawn to scale of at least one (1\") inch to forty (40') feet, indicating the property\nlines of the parcel upon which the use is proposed; any existing or proposed\nstructures; parking areas and other built-upon areas; surface water drainage. The site\nplan shall be neatly drawn and indicate north point, name and address of person who\nprepared the plan, date of the original drawing, and an accurate record of any later\nrevisions.\nd. The Ordinance Administrator shall notify in writing each local government having\njurisdiction in the watershed. Notice shall include a description of the variance being\nrequested. Local governments receiving notice of the variance request may submit\ncomments to the Ordinance Administrator prior to a decision by the Planning and\nZoning Board. Comments shall become a part of the record of proceedings of the\nPlanning and Zoning Board.\ne. The Planning and Zoning Board shall duly fulfill its requirements of public notification,\nevidentiary public hearing and quasi-judicial procedure as provided in this chapter and\nin the NC General Statutes for watershed variances, as for all other variances from\nthe zoning regulations of the Town.\nf. Proceedings of the Planning and Zoning Board. The Board shall keep records of\nthe proceedings, prepare a report containing findings of fact, conclusions of law and\nrecommended decision and forward the record to the Environmental Management\nCommission (which must approve all major watershed variances). A denial of a major\nwatershed variance by the Planning and Zoning Board need not go to the EMC for\nreview. One copy of any report forwarded to the EMC shall be kept on file by the\nClerk.\ng. Major Watershed Variances. If the Planning and Zoning Board decides in favor of\ngranting a major watershed variance, the Board shall prepare a preliminary record of\nthe hearing with all deliberate speed. The preliminary record of the hearing shall\ninclude:\ni. The variance application;\nii. The bearing notices;\niii. The evidence presented;\niv. Motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence and rulings, on them;\nV. Proposed findings and exceptions;\nvi. The proposed decision, including all conditions proposed to be added to the\npermit; and\nvii. The preliminary record shall be sent to the Environmental Management\nCommission for its review as follows:\nIf the Commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance\nqualifies as a major variance and that the property owner can secure no\nreasonable return from, nor make any practical use of the property unless the\nproposed variance is granted, and the variance, if granted, will not result in a\n\n\nNEW PAGE 90\nserious threat to the water supply, then the Commission shall approve the\nvariance with conditions and stipulations. The Commission shall prepare a\nCommission decision and send it to the Planning and Zoning Board. If the\nCommission approves the variance as proposed, the Board shall prepare a\nfinal decision granting the proposed variance. If the Commission approves the\nvariance with conditions and stipulations, the Board shall prepare a final\ndecision, including conditions and stipulations granting the proposed variance.\nIf the Commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance\nqualifies as a major watershed variance and that the property owner can\nsecure a reasonable return from or make a practical use of the property\nwithout the variance or the variance, if granted, will result in a serious threat to\nthe water supply, then the Commission shall deny approval of the variance as\nproposed. The Commission shall prepare a Commission decision and send it\nto the Planning and Zoning Board. The Board shall prepare a final decision\ndenying the variance as proposed.\n10. WSII-CA (O) Watershed II Critical Area (Overlay). The WSII-CA(O) is established as an\noverlay district to impose higher standards in the critical area because the risk of water\nquality degradation from pollution is greater than in the balance of the watershed, most of\nwhich lies within the extraterritorial boundary of the town. The regulations of this district are\nintended to promote higher developmental standards and not limit unnecessarily\ndevelopmental options. In order to maintain a predominantly undeveloped land use intensity\npattern, residential and non-residential uses shall be allowed at a maximum of one (1)\ndwelling unit per two (2) acres and six percent (6%) built-upon area respectively.\na. Limitations on Certain Permitted Uses\ni. Agriculture, provided that all agricultural activities will be encouraged to\nparticipate in the agricultural Cost Share Program and subject to the\nprovisions of the Food Security Act of 1985 and the Food, Agriculture,\nConservation and Trade Act of 1990. Agricultural activities conducted after\nJanuary 1, 1993 shall maintain a minimum ten-foot vegetative buffer, or\nequivalent control as determined by the Soil and Water Conservation\nCommission, along all perennial waters indicated on the most recent versions\nof U.S.G.S. 1:24,000 (7.5 minute) scale topographic maps or as determined\nby local governments studies. Animal operations greater than 100 animal units\nshall employ Best Management Practices (BMP's) by July 1, 1994\nrecommended by the Soil and Water Conservation Commission.\nii. Silviculture, subject to the provisions of the Forest Practices Guidelines\nRelated to Water Quality (15 N.C.A.C. 11.0101 - 11.0209).\niii. Residential development at one dwelling unit per two acres on a project-by-\nproject basis. For purposes of density calculations, total project acreage shall\nnot include any area within the designated right-of-way of any public or private\nstreet within the project, nor shall it include any area within the project donated\nor dedicated to the public, except for storm water control structures approved\nunder the high-density option. No residential lot shall be less than two acres,\nexcept within an approved cluster development.\nb. Prohibited Uses\n\n\nNEW PAGE 91\ni. Sanitary landfills are prohibited.\nii. No new chemical storage or new underground fuel storage tanks are allowed.\niii. The storage of toxic and hazardous materials is prohibited unless a spill\ncontainment plan is implemented.\niv. Sites for land application of sludge/residuals or petroleum-contaminated soils\nare prohibited.\nC. Development Applications. In addition to the standards for Site Plans, the following\nshall be contained on applications for development in the Watershed Overlay:\ni. Total impervious area;\nii. Location of perennial streams;\niii. Septic tank drainage field; and\niv. Sedimentation and erosion controls.\nd. Minimum Lot Area. 87,120 square feet (or two (2) acres) minimum lot area per\ndwelling unit. Because of the high likelihood of a septic tank, a potential buyer should\nfirst check with the Surry County Health Department to determine adequacy of the lot,\nas a larger lot could be required.\n11. WSII-BW (O) WSII-Balance of Watershed (Overlay). The WSII-BW (O) is established as an\noverlay district to impose lower standards in the balance of the watershed area because the\nrisk of water quality degradation from pollution is less than in the critical area of the\nwatershed. The regulations of this district will allow residential uses at a maximum of one (1)\ndwelling unit per acre and non-residential development at twelve percent (12%) built-upon\narea. Projects must minimize built-upon surface area, direct storm water away from surface\nwaters and incorporate Best Management Practices to minimize water quality impacts. Non-\ndischarging landfills and sludge applications sites are allowed.\na. Limitations on Certain Permitted Uses\ni. Agriculture, provided that all agricultural activities will be encouraged to\nparticipate in the agricultural Cost Share Program and subject to the\nprovisions of the Food Security Act of 1985 and the Food, Agriculture,\nConservation and Trade Act of 1990.\nii. Silviculture, subject to the provisions of the Forest Practices Guidelines\nRelated to Water Quality (15 N.C.A.C. 11.0101 - 11.0209).\niii. Residential development at one dwelling unit per acre on a project-by-project\nbasis. For purposes of density calculations, total project acreage shall not\ninclude any area within the designated right-of-way of any public or private\nstreet within the project, nor shall it include any area within the project donated\nor dedicated to the public, except for storm water control structures approved\nunder the high-density option. No residential lot shall be less than one (1)\nacre, except within an approved cluster development.\nb. Prohibited Uses\n\nNEW PAGE 92\ni. No new discharging landfills.\nii. The storage of toxic and hazardous materials unless a spill containment plan\nis implemented.\nC. Development Applications. In addition to the standards for Site Plans, the following\nshall be contained on applications for development in the Watershed Overlay:\ni. Total impervious area;\nii. Location of perennial streams;\niii. Septic tank drainage field; and\niv. Sedimentation and erosion controls.\nd. Density and Built-Upon Area Standards\ni. Residential. No residential lot shall be less than one (1) acre, except within an\napproved cluster development.\nii. Non-residential and Multi-Family.
