Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Light Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"M-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Light Industrial\n(M-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Light Industrial (M-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Light Industrial (M-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Light Industrial\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage refers solely to the maximum lot coverage of buildings for primary use and all accessory structures. Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

The building area coverage shall be the dimensional standards of the applicable zoning District (i.e., R-7500, C-LD, etc.). However, the\ndeveloped area may be increased as a result of utilizing exceptional design and/or best management practices as provided in Section 6.1,\nDesign Flexibility.

Locally-adapted species shall be used for all required plantings and drought tolerant\nplants shall be used whenever practicable.\nNative species of trees and shrubs and related cultivars shall be used whenever practicable.\nClustering and/or random spacing of plants and trees is encouraged to produce a natural\nappearance in the landscape, except where uniformity is required for opaque screening.\nLandscaping, including berms, shall be installed and maintained SO as not to interfere with the\nsight distance requirements of this ordinance or the sight distance needs of drivers in parking\nareas, at entrance and exit locations, and at street intersections. See Section 12 of this ordinance.\nMonoculture and over planting shall be avoided except that a single species of tree may be\nplanted in formal parks or in conjunction with a streetscape plan.\nAll landscaping shall be coordinated throughout a development site.\nThe Planning Board may approve revisions to a landscaping plan in order to accommodate\nseasonal planting problems or a lack of plant availability as long as:\n(A) There is no reduction in the quantity of plant material.\n(B) There is no significant change in the size or location of plant materials.\n(C) The new plants are of the same general category and have the same general\ndesign characteristics as the materials being replaced.\nNo more than thirty percent of scrubs planted per 100 linear feet shall be deciduous.\nWhenever trees are required for screening and in buffers and parking lot landscaping a minimum\nof fifty percent shall be canopy trees, and a minimum of twenty percent shall be evergreen.\n68\n\n\nNEW PAGE 69\nZoning Ordinance of the Town of Cleveland, N.C.\nArticle VII\nTrees and scrubs shall be selected from the list of suggested species as listed in the schedule of\ntrees and shrubs.\nB.

Maintenance includes all actions necessary to keep\nlandscaping, material healthy, neat and orderly in appearance, and free of litter and debris. Any\nlandscaping lost or diseased shall be removed and replaced unless, in the opinion of the Town,\nthe maturity of the remaining vegetation sufficiently fulfills the intent of this ordinance.\nTo insure compliance with this ordinance and to encourage required vegetation to be installed\nduring the appropriate season, a letter of compliance may be accepted by the Town in lieu of\ninstallation prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the site.\nThis letter shall be in the form of an affidavit signed by the property owner and shall:\na) Acknowledge that such owner is aware of any landscaping and/or screening\nrequirements which apply to the property;\nand\nb) Stipulate that he/she will comply with those requirements by a specific date\nwithin the next appropriate planting season, but in no case more than nine (9)\nmonths after the date of the affidavit, unless otherwise approved by the Zoning\nAdministrator;\nand\nc) Acknowledge that failure to comply with the provisions of this section within\nthe time frame specified in the letter shall constitute a violation of this\nordinance which shall subject the property owner to any and all enforcement\nactions permitted by law.\nNecessary pruning and trimming shall be accordance with the American National Standards for\nTree Care Operations: Tree Shrub and Other Woody Plant Maintenance-Standard Practices\n(Pruning), and shall be interpreted to include topping of trees through removal of crown material\nor the central leader, or any other similarly severe procedures that cause irreparable harm to the\nnatural form of the tree, except where such procedures are necessary to maintain public overhead\nutilities.
