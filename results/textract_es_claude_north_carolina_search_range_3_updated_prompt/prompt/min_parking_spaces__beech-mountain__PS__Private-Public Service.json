Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Private-Public Service\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"PS\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Private-Public Service\n(PS) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Private-Public Service (PS). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Private-Public Service (PS)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Private-Public Service\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

The purpose of this section is to encourage and provide for flexibility and\ninnovation in the design and location of structures and land development, to provide for mixtures of\nhousing types and land use, to provide for the most efficient use of land resources, and to provide\nan opportunity to develop land areas in a manner different from the standard arrangement of one\nprincipal building on one lot. Residential densities are calculated on a project basis, thus allowing\nthe clustering of buildings in order to create useful open spaces and preserve natural site features.\nIt is further intended that a Planned Unit Development will be in harmony with the character of the\n48 of 198\n4/30/24, 21:02\n\n\nNEW PAGE 49\nFirefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/2050bacc-5248-438d-91.\ndistrict in which it is located.\n(2) Planned Unit Development defined. Any development where more than one principal\nbuilding or use is proposed to be constructed on a single lot, or any building with a gross floor area\nof 25,000 square feet or more, shall be deemed a Planned Unit Development (PUD). Residential\nunits within a PUD may include single-family detached or attached units, townhouse developments,\ngarden apartments, patio homes, condominiums, and other type residential units excluding mobile\nhomes and mobile home parks.\n(3) Land development standards. The following land development standards shall apply for all\nPlanned Unit Developments. PUDs may be located in the R-3 districts as conditional uses, subject\nto a finding by the Board of Adjustment that certain conditions be met:\n(a) Ownership control. The land in a PUD shall be under single ownership or management\nby the applicant before final approval and/or construction, or proper assurances (legal title or\nexecution of a binding sales agreement) shall be provided that the development can be\nsuccessfully completed by the applicant.\n(b) Density requirements. There are no density requirements for non-residential uses as\nlong as the proposed project does not violate the intent of the district in which it is located. The\nproposed residential density of the PUD (dwelling units per acre as shown in \u00a7 154.105) shall\nconform to that permitted in the district in which the development is located. If the PUD lies in more\nthan one district, the number of allowable dwelling units must be separately calculated for each\nportion of the PUD that is in a separate district, and must then be combined to determine the\nnumber of dwelling units allowable in the entire Planned Unit Development.\n(c) Frontage requirements. PUDs shall have access to a highway or road suitable for the\nscale and density of development being proposed.\n(d) Land uses. A mixture of land uses shall be allowed in any PUD. However, within\nresidential districts, non-residential uses shall not constitute the primary use in the PUD, and non-\nresidential uses shall be carefully designed to complement the residential uses within the PUD. All\nPUDs must be compatible with and not violate the intent of the zoning district.\n(e) Minimum requirements.\n1. Waived. The normal minimum lot size, setbacks and frontage requirements are hereby\nwaived for the PUD, provided that the spirit and intent of this section is complied with in the total\ndevelopment plan, as determined by the Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment shall\nexercise ultimate discretion as to whether the total development plan does comply with the spirit\nand intent of this section.\n2. Height limitations. No building or structure shall exceed the height limitations of the\ndistrict in which it is located.\n3.\nRequired distance between buildings. The minimum distance between buildings shall be\n20 feet or as otherwise specified by the Board of Adjustment to ensure adequate air, light, privacy,\nand space for emergency vehicles.\n4.\nAccess to common use areas; streets, walkways, etc. Every dwelling unit shall have\naccess to a public or private street, walkway or other area dedicated to common use, and there\nshall be provision for adequate vehicular circulation to all development properties in order to ensure\nacceptable levels of access for emergency vehicles. All roads within a Planned Unit Development\nshall meet the minimum construction standards for subdivision roads of the North Carolina\n49 of 198\n4/30/24, 21:02\n\n\nNEW PAGE 50\nFirefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/2050bacc-5248-438d-91...\nDepartment of Transportation, Division of Highways' Subdivision Roads Minimum Construction\nStandards dated April, 1983 (as amended) with only the following exception: A reduced right-of-\nway of 40 feet will be permitted if a reduced width is essentially unavoidable due to topographic\nreasons and is approved by the Town Manager and/or Director of Public Works.\n6\n5.\nAccess to public road. All Planned Unit Developments must have access to a public\nroad that meets the minimum construction standards for subdivision roads of the Division of\nHighways of the North Carolina Department of Transportation with the exception that in lieu of\npaving, the developer may use a minimum of eight inches of state approved Aggregate Base\nCourse (ABC). In addition, all such access roads to Planned Unit Developments must be approved\nby the Director of Public Works for the Town of Beech Mountain and the Fire Chief of the Beech\nMountain Volunteer Fire Department to insure the accessibility by emergency or municipal vehicles\nover such access roads to the Planned Unit Development. 7\n(f)\nPrivacy. Each development shall provide reasonable visual and acoustical privacy for\nall\ndwelling units. Fences, insulation, walks, barriers, and landscaping shall be used, as appropriate,\nfor the protection and aesthetic enhancement of property and the privacy of its occupants,\nscreening of objectionable views or uses, and reduction of noise. Multilevel buildings shall be\nlocated within a PUD in such a way as to dissipate any adverse impact on adjoining low-rise\nbuildings and shall not invade the privacy of the occupants of such low-rise buildings.\n(g) Perimeter requirements.\n1. Structures located on the perimeter of the development must be set back from property\nlines and rights-of-way of abutting streets in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning\nOrdinance controlling the district within which the property is situated.\n2. Structures other than single-family detached units located on the perimeter of the\ndevelopment may require screening in a manner which is approved by the Board of Adjustment.\n(h) Water and sewer systems. Plans and accompanying documentation to ensure that the\nwater and sewer systems proposed for the PUD have been approved by the appropriate local and\nstate agencies shall be submitted as part of the application.\n(i) Parking provisions. Preliminary plans shall include parking provisions for all proposed\nuses within the PUD in accordance with \u00a7 154.132 When more than one use is located in the PUD,\nthe minimum required parking shall be the sum of the required parking for each use within the\ndevelopment.\n(j) Vehicle and pedestrian traffic. Any pedestrian and bicycle path circulation system and its\nrelated walkways shall be designed to minimize conflicts between vehicle and pedestrian traffic.\n(k) Protect character within zoning district. Layout of parking areas, service areas,\nentrances, exits, yards, courts and landscaping, and control of signs, lighting, noise or other\npotentially adverse influences shall be such as to protect the character within the zoning district and\ndesirable character in any adjoining district.\n(I) Unit of ownership. Conveyance and maintenance of open space, recreational areas and\ncommunally owned facilities shall be in accordance with the Unit Ownership Act (G.S. Ch. 47A, Art.\n1) and/or any other appropriate mechanisms acceptable to the Board of Adjustment.\n(m) Avoid unnecessary cutting of trees.
