Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Office Assembly\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"O A\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Office Assembly\n(O A) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Office Assembly (O A). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Office Assembly (O A)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Office Assembly\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

(AMENDED 6/22/82; 2/4/86)\n(1)\nThe M-1 and M-2 districts are hereby created to accomplish the purposes and serve\nthe objectives set forth in this subsection. Part of Article XI contains performance standards that place\nlimitations on the characteristics of uses located in the districts created by this section.\n(a)\nM-1 LIGHT MANUFACTURING This zone is designed to accommodate a\nlimited range of industrial activities and a wide range of commercial uses\nincluding wholesaling, storage, mail-order, auto related, and office and retail\nin conjunction with industrial or wholesaling uses. Permitted industrial uses\ninclude enterprises engaged in manufacturing, processing, creating, repairing,\nrenovating, painting, cleaning and assembly where all operations are\ncontained inside a fully enclosed building. The performance standards for the\nM-1 zone located in Part I of Article XI are more restrictive than those in the\nM-2 district.\n(b)\nM-2 GENERAL MANUFACTURING This district is designed to accommodate\nthe widest range of industrial uses. Business operations may be conducted\nwithin and outside a fully enclosed building. The performance standards for\nthis zone are less restrictive than those in the M-1 district.\n(2)\nThere is also established a watershed light industrial (WM-3) zoning district. The\npurpose of this district is to allow areas within the University Lake Watershed that have been zoned\nM-1 prior to the effective date of this subdivision to continue to be used and developed for light\nindustrial and related purposes, subject to certain restrictions designed to protect the watershed.\nConsistent with the purpose of this zone, this district shall be confined to that area zoned M-1 on the\neffective date of this subsection (12/7/1983); this area shall not be expanded and no new WM-3 areas\nshall be designated. For the purposes of this section, changes to make WM-3 zoning uniform on lots\nthat were depicted as entirely within the M-1 zoning at the time of its establishment, but that were\nlater depicted as being bisected by the zoning boundary, will not be considered an expansion of the\ndistrict or the creation of new WM-3 areas. (AMENDED 12/7/83; 06/27/17)\n(3)\nThere is also established a Planned Industrial Development (PID) zoning district. The\npurpose of this district is to provide for the possibility of well-planned and tightly controlled industrial\ndevelopment in areas that are suitable for such development but that are not deemed appropriate for\nM-1 or M-2 zoning because of the less restricted types of development that may occur in such zones.\n(AMENDED 6/22/82; 12/7/83)\n(a)\nNo area less than twenty contiguous acres may be zoned as a Planned\nIndustrial Development district, and then only upon a request submitted by or\non behalf of the owner or owners of all the property intended to be covered by\nsuch zone.\nPage #7\n\n\nNEW PAGE 8\nArt.

Within that portion of the PUD zone that is developed for purposes\npermissible in a residential district, all development must be in accordance\nwith the regulations applicable to the residential zoning district to which the\nparticular PUD zoning district corresponds.\n(b)\nA second element of each PUD district shall be the commercial element. Here\nthere are five possibilities, each one corresponding to either the B-1(g), B-2,\nB-3, O, or O/A zoning districts established by Section 15-136. Within that\nportion of a PUD district that is developed for purposes permissible in a\ncommercial district, all development must be in accordance with the\nregulations applicable to the commercial district to which the PUD district\ncorresponds. (AMENDED 2/04/97)\n(c)\nA manufacturing/processing element may be a third element of any PUD\ndistrict. Here there are two alternatives. The first is that uses permitted within\nthe M-1 district would be permitted within the PUD district. The second\nalternative is that uses permitted only within the M-1 or M-2 zoning districts\nPage #8\n\n\nNEW PAGE 9\nArt. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\nwould not be permitted. If an M-1 element is included, then within that portion\nof the PUD district that is developed for purposes permissible in an M-1\ndistrict, all development must be in accordance with the regulations applicable\nto the M-1 district.\nThe sixty different PUD zoning districts are derived from the various combinations of possible\nalternatives within each of the three elements -- residential, commercial, manufacturing/processing.\nFor example, there is an R-20/B-1(g)/M-1 district, an R-20/B-2/M-1 district, an R-20/B-2 district, an\nR-15/B-1(g)/M-1 district, etc. (AMENDED 2/04/97)\n(2)\nNo area of less than twenty-five contiguous acres may be zoned as a Planned Unit\nDevelopment district, and then only upon the request of the owner or owners of all of the property\nintended to be covered by such zone.\n(3)\nAs indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses (Section 15-146), a planned unit\ndevelopment (use classification 28.000) is the only permissible use in a PUD zone, and planned unit\ndevelopments are permissible only in such zones.\nSection 15-140 Residential High Density and Commercial Overlay District. (AMENDED\n2/4/86)\nThere is hereby created a Residential High Density and Commercial Overlay (RHDC) zoning\ndistrict. The purpose of this district is to provide for the redevelopment of deteriorating commercial\nand manufacturing areas in a manner that is consistent with commercial development goals of the\ntown, namely, for compact, compressed town center growth, for a substantial increase in residential\nopportunities near the town center, and for mixed use development in the downtown.
