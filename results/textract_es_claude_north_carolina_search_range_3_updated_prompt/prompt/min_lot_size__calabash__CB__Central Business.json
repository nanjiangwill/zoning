Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Central Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CB\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Central Business\n(CB) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Central Business (CB). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Central Business (CB)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Central Business\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found.

In lieu of\nthe uniform encroachment, a varying encroachment (i.e., multiple building\ncorner projections into setbacks due to an irregularly shaped parcel) of 25%\nmay occur in any two setbacks provided that the aggregate length does not\nexceed 50% of that building setback face, that all other building setbacks are\nin compliance, and this allowance does not exceed buildable area for this\nparcel.\n(4) At cul-de-sac parcels, residential vehicle garages may reduce the front\nsetback to ten-feet (10') provided that a minimum twenty-foot long (20') car\nparking area is available outside the garage door and this allowance will not\nexceed buildable area for this parcel.\n(5)\nStair and ramp landings (covered or uncovered) not exceeding thirty-six\n(36) square feet or six-feet (6') in any length exclusive of the stairs and\nramp for the purpose of egress to a home.\n(6)\nMechanical equipment, such as air condensers, which are not enclosed may\nencroach up to four-feet (4') into side and rear setbacks provided that a\nminimum three-foot (3') travel path is available between the unit and the\nproperty line.\n(7) Mechanical equipment yards may encroach up to seven-feet (7') into side\nand rear setbacks provided that a three-foot (3') clear travel is available\nthrough this area either by two gates allowing access through this enclosure\nor by a three-foot (3') travel path around the enclosure.\nArticle 11.
