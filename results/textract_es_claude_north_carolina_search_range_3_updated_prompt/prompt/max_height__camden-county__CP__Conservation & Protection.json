Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Conservation & Protection\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CP\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Conservation & Protection\n(CP) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Conservation & Protection (CP). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Conservation & Protection (CP)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Conservation & Protection\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

The district\nallows low-impact recreational facilities (trails,\nboardwalks, docks, boat launches), visitor or\ninterpretive centers, accessways, utilities, erosion\n& Protection\ncontrol features, and public parks, along with typical\naccessory uses such as restrooms, or off-street\nparking areas.

RULES OF MEASUREMENT\n10.2.1. PURPOSE\nThe purpose of this section is to clarify the rules of measurement and exemptions that apply to all principal and accessory\nuses allowed in this Ordinance. These standards may be modified by other applicable sections of this Ordinance.\n10.2.2.\nMEASUREMENTS, GENERALLY\nA.\nStraight Lines\nUnless otherwise stated in this Ordinance, distances specified in this Ordinance are to be measured as the length of\nan imaginary straight line joining two points.\nB.\nRounding\nAll calculations that result in a fractional unit or part of a whole number, the number shall be rounded up to the next\nhighest whole number, unless otherwise provided in this section or elsewhere in this Ordinance.\nC.\nIrregular Shapes\nIn cases where an irregular shape complicates the application of these standards, the UDO Administrator shall\ndetermine the applicable dimensional, setback, or bulk standards.\nD.\nSeparation\n1.\nLot to Lot\nWhen the provisions of this Ordinance require separation between two or more lots, or a lot and another\nfeature, separation shall be measured by drawing straight lines from the nearest point of one lot line to the\nnearest point of the lot line subject to the separation requirement (see Figure 10.2.2.D: Separation).\n2.\nUse Type to Use Type\nWhen the provisions of this Ordinance require one use type to be separated from another use type,\nseparation shall be measured by drawing straight lines from the nearest point of the wall of the existing or\nproposed principal structure to the nearest point of the wall of the existing or proposed structure subject to\nthe separation requirement.\nFIGURE 10.2.2.D: SEPARATION\nA\nLEGEND\nA\nLot-to-Lot Separation\nB Use Type-to-Use\nType Separation\nB\nLot Line\nCELL (1, 1): \nCamden County\nCELL (1, 2): \n10-5\nCELL (1, 3): \nLast Updated\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nFebruary 4, 2019\n\n\n Output:"}]}
