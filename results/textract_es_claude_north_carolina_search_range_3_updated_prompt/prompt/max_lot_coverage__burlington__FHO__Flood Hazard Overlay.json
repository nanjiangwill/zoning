Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Flood Hazard Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"FHO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Flood Hazard Overlay\n(FHO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Flood Hazard Overlay (FHO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Flood Hazard Overlay (FHO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Flood Hazard Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage refers solely to the maximum lot coverage of buildings for primary use and all accessory structures. Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

CONVENTIONAL ZONING DISTRICT INTENT STATEMENTS\nA. RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS\nThe residential zoning districts are proposed to provide a comfortable, healthy, safe, and pleasant\nenvironment in which to live and recreate. More specifically, they are intended to:\n1. Provide appropriately located lands for residential development that are consistent with the goals,\nobjectives, and policies of the City's adopted policy guidance;\n2. Ensure adequate light, air, privacy, and open space areas for each dwelling, and protect residents\nfrom the negative effects of noise, excessive population density, traffic congestion, flooding, and other\nsignificant adverse environmental impacts;\n3. Protect residential areas from fires, explosions, toxic fumes and substances, and other public safety\nhazards;\n4. Provide for residential housing choice, affordability, and diversity with varying housing densities, types,\nand designs, including accessory dwelling units;\n5.\nProvide for safe and efficient vehicular access and circulation and promote bicycle-, and pedestrian-\nfriendly neighborhoods;\n6. Provide safe and efficient access to public transit facilities and alternative forms of transportation, like\ngreenways;\n7. Provide for public services and facilities needed to serve residential areas and accommodate public\nand very low intensity neighborhood-serving non-residential uses in the higher density residential\ndistricts while protecting residential areas from incompatible non-residential development;\n8. Create neighborhoods and preserve existing community character while accommodating new\ndevelopment and redevelopment consistent with the City's goals and objectives; and\n9.\nPreserve the unique character and historic resources of the traditional neighborhoods and the\ncommunity.\nB. BUSINESS ZONING DISTRICTS\nThe business zoning districts are intended to ensure a wide range of office, retail, service, industrial, and\nrelated uses necessary to meet resident and visitor needs, and more specifically to:\n1. Provide appropriately located lands for the full range of business uses needed by the City's residents,\nbusinesses, and workers, consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies in the City's adopted policy\nguidance;\n2. Strengthen the City's economic base, and provide employment opportunities close to home for\nresidents of the City and surrounding areas;\n3.\nCreate suitable environments for various types of business uses, and protect them from the adverse\neffects of incompatible uses;\n4.\nProvide safe and efficient access to alternative forms of transportation like public transit facilities,\nsidewalks, trails, and greenways;\n5. Preserve the unique character and historic resources of the downtown area while increasing\nopportunities for urban development in areas already well-served by infrastructure; and\n6. Minimize the impact of business development on residential districts and sensitive natural\nenvironments.\nC. SPECIAL ZONING DISTRICTS\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\nThe special zoning districts are intended to recognize those portions of the City's jurisdiction that are\nunique or that require special consideration in order to:\n1. Protect and preserve environmentally-sensitive lands;\n2. Accommodate various types of mixed-use development in ways that establish functioning\nneighborhoods where people can live, work, shop, and recreate without travelling extensive distances;\n3. Provide safe and efficient access to alternative forms of transportation like public transit facilities,\nsidewalks, trails, and greenways; and\n4.\nCreate appropriate amounts of flexibility to foster redevelopment, infill, downtown revitalization, and\neconomic opportunities for City residents.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \n3-9\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\n\nNEW PAGE 132\nCHAPTER 3 ZONING DISTRICTS\nSection 3.4 Central Business (CBD) District\n3.4. CENTRAL BUSINESS (CBD) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Central Business (CBD) District is established and intended to\nserve as the commercial and cultural heart of the City's jurisdiction.\nDevelopment in the CBD includes the highest average densities and\nbuilding heights in the City. Development is configured for an urban\ncontext, with buildings built to the street, ground floor uses that\nsupport pedestrian travel, and numerous civic gathering spaces and\ncultural attractions. The district is intended to accommodate a well-\nbalanced mix of uses (e.g., office, retail, service, high-density\nresidential, and entertainment), promote a strong pedestrian-\noriented environment (with a reduced need for off-street parking),\nand preserve and protect the downtown's historical and architectural\nscale and character. The district requires urban-style open space\n(greens, seating areas, plazas, pocket parks, roof gardens, etc.) to\nbe included as a part of new development. Low density residential\nlike single-family detached homes and most forms of industrial\ndevelopment are prohibited in the CBD district.

Density rounding is permitted to the tenths place but is not permitted to the hundredths place.\nC. Land area associated with floodplains and riparian buffers may be included in the calculation of\nthe square footage of a tract or site for the purposes of determining the maximum residential\ndensity.\nd. Land area located within a right-of-way shall not be included in the calculation of allowable density.\ne. Maximum residential density in a particular zoning district may be increased beyond the amount\nstated in CHAPTER 3. ZONING DISTRICTS, in accordance with the standards in Section 7.6,\nSustainability Incentives.\n2. Calculation of Maximum Number of Lots\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\nThe maximum number of lots is calculated by dividing the total square footage of a lot or tract by the\nminimum lot area for the type of use proposed, the resulting number (the quotient) is then rounded\ndownwards to the next lowest whole number to produce the total number of lots permissible for the\ntype of use proposed. The effective density of a lot or tract may differ based on the type of use being\nproposed.\ni.\nExample 1: 67,000 Square-foot Site in the MDR District for Single-family\nDetached Dwelling Lots\na) Lot size: 67,000 square feet.\nb) Minimum lot area for a single-family detached dwelling: 9,000 square feet.\nc) Maximum number of single-family detached dwelling lots: 67,000 / 9,000 = 7.44, or 7\nsingle-family detached lots (fractions are rounded downwards).\nii. Example 2: 67,000 Square-foot Site in the MDR district for Single-family\nAttached Dwelling lots\na) Lot size: 67,000 square feet.\nb) Minimum lot area for single-family attached dwelling: 9,000 square feet + 1,600 square\nfeet for each unit.\nc) Maximum number of single-family attached dwelling lots: (67,000 - 9,000) / 1,600 = 36.25\nor 36 single-family attached lots (fractions are rounded downwards).\n3. Calculation of Allowable Residential Yield\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\nAllowable residential yield is the lesser of the maximum allowable density or the maximum number of\nlots for a given site.\ni.\nExample 1: 67,000 Square -foot Site in the MDR District for Single-Family\nDetached Dwelling lots\na) Maximum density (based on Example 1 in Sub-section 1 above): 8 units.\nb) Maximum number of lots (based on Example i in Sub-section 2 above): 7 lots.\nc) Allowable residential density = 7 units.\nii. Example 2: 67,000 Square -foot Site in the MDR District for Single-Family\nAttached Dwelling lots\na) Maximum density (based on Example 1 in Sub-section 1 above): 8 units.\nb) Maximum number of lots (based on Example ii in Sub-section 2 above): 36 lots.\nc) Allowable residential density = 8 units.\n4. Density Equivalence\na. Accessory dwelling units associated with a single-family residential principal use shall not be\ncounted towards the maximum allowable residential density.\nb. When calculating the density for a private dormitory associated with an educational use, two\nbedrooms in a private dormitory shall be equivalent to one regular dwelling unit.\nC. Maximum density amounts do not apply to student housing or lodging on college or university\ncampuses when the housing is owned or operated by the college or university. In these instances,\nresidential land uses are considered as an accessory to the college or university principal use.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \n8-14\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\n\nNEW PAGE 527\nCHAPTER 8 MEASUREMENT AND DEFINITIONS\nSection 8.3 Rules of Measurement\nG. GROSS FLOOR AREA (GFA)\nGross floor area (GFA) shall be defined as the sum in square feet of all floors of the building measured\nfrom the exterior face of the exterior walls.

The mid-point of the roof between the ridge and the leaves for a gable, hip, or gambrel roof; or\nd. To the highest point of a dome, shed, or cricket-style roof.\n3. Story\nA building story is the portion of a building where all rooms share the same floor and ceiling level.\na. A crawlspace or basement with an average ceiling height of less than seven feet is not considered\nas a story.\nb. An attic with an average ceiling height of less than six feet is not considered a story.\n4. Exceptions\na. Except when proposed within the AHO, the following features are exempted from the maximum\nheight requirements in this Ordinance:\ni. Parapet walls of less than five feet in height above the roof deck;\nii.\nSpires, steeples, minarets, belfries, cupolas, domes, and similar architectural features not\nintended for human habitation;\niii.
