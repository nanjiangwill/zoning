Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Central Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CB\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Central Business\n(CB) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Central Business (CB). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Central Business (CB)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Central Business\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_lot_size is typically between 1,000 and 2,000,000 sq ft or 0.02 and 50 acres. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 11\n\nCB Zone\n\nCELL (2, 1):\nField\nCELL (2, 2):\nValue\nCELL (3, 1):\nmin_lot_size\nCELL (3, 2):\n123456 sq ft\nCELL (4, 1):\nApartment Area\nCELL (4, 2):\n10,000\n\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"CELL (3, 2):\\n123456 sq ft\", 11]],\n    \"rationale\": \"The cell that corresponds to the value for min_lot_size in this table has this answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"123456 sq ft\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 32\n\nSection 6.3 Industrial Area & Dimensional Requirements\n1 Public Sewer or Public Water\n2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\n3 For proposed warehouse/manufacturing uses 35%, for all other uses 25%, subject to\nCommission's authority to permit greater coverage based on landscape, architectural design\nand site development elements that exceed minimum standard of the Regulation\n4\nShall be in addition to requirements of 8.1.2 Landscaping and Buffers\n6-4\n\nCELL (1, 1):\nCELL (1, 2):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 3):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 4):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 5):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 6):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 7):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 8):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (1, 10):\nCELL (2, 1):\nZone\nCELL (2, 2):\nMin\nArea\nCELL (2, 3):\nMin\nWidth\nCELL (2, 4):\nMin\nDepth\nCELL (2, 5):\nMax\nStories\nCELL (2, 6):\nMax\nHeight\nCELL (2, 7):\nMax % Lot\nCoverage\nCELL (2, 8):\nMin\nFront\nYard\nCELL (2, 9):\nMin\nSide\nYard\nCELL (2, 10):\nMin\nRear\nYard\nCELL (3, 1):\nI\nCELL (3, 2):\n20,000\nsq. ft.\nCELL (3, 3):\n100'\nCELL (3, 4):\n100'\nCELL (3, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (3, 6):\n50'\nCELL (3, 7):\nN/A\nCELL (3, 8):\n25'\nCELL (3, 9):\n20'\nCELL (3, 10):\n20'\nCELL (4, 1):\nCB\nCELL (4, 2):\n40,000\nsq. ft. 1\nCELL (4, 3):\n150'\nCELL (4, 4):\n150'\nCELL (4, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (4, 6):\n50'\nCELL (4, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (4, 8):\n50'\nCELL (4, 9):\n20'\nCELL (4, 10):\n20'\nCELL (5, 1):\nCB\nCELL (5, 2):\n60,000\nsq. ft. 2\nCELL (5, 3):\n200'\nCELL (5, 4):\n200'\nCELL (5, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (5, 6):\n50'\nCELL (5, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (5, 8):\n50'\nCELL (5, 9):\n20'\nCELL (5, 10):\n20'4\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"1 Public Sewer or Public Water\", 32],\n        [\"2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\", 32],\n        [\"CELL (4, 2): \\n40,000\\nsq. ft.\", 32],\n        [\"CELL (5, 2): \\n60,000\\nsq. ft.\", 32]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"From this page we can infer that the value is conditional on the presence of a public sewer or water system, and there are two different values for the current zone, depending on that.\",\n    \"answer\": \"40,000 sq ft (if public water or sewer); 60,000 sq ft (otherwise)\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 66\n\nCB Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 123 sq ft, side length is 10 ft\n\nNEW PAGE 67\n\nCB Zone - Senior Active Overlay\n\nmin_lot_size is 1523 sq ft\n\nDKEWKWKDS Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 20,000 sq ft\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"min_lot_size is 123 sq ft\", 66]],\n    \"rationale\": \"The section titled CB says the answer explicitly.

Conditional zoning districts.\n3.5.1 Purpose.\nA.\nConditional zoning districts are created to correspond to each of the base zoning districts. Conditional\nZoning (CZ) Districts allow specific uses to be established in accordance with prescribed conditions\npertaining to an individual project.\nB.\nThe purpose is to provide a voluntary alternative procedure for the rezoning of a property for a specific\nuse. A broad range of uses are permitted in the base district. However, there are instances where a\nbase zoning district designation is clearly inappropriate for a property, but a specific use or uses\npermitted under this district and subject to development requirements would be consistent with the\nspirit and intent of this ordinance. Conditional zoning districts, herein established, are intended to\naccommodate such situations. This voluntary procedure is intended for firm development proposals,\nand is neither intended nor suited for securing early zoning for tentative uses which may not be\nundertaken for a long period of time.\nC.\nJust as there are nine base zoning districts, there are nine corresponding Conditional Zoning Districts.\n3.5.2 Applicability.\nA.\nProperty may be placed in a Conditional Zoning District only in response to a petition by the owners of\nall the property to be included.\nCreated: 2023-08-11 10:27:33 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 11, Update 1)\nPage 20 of 221\nCELL (1, 1): \nCZ OSR\nCELL (1, 2): \nConditional Zoning Open Space and Recreational\nCELL (2, 1): \nCZ RA-30\nCELL (2, 2): \nConditional Zoning Low Density Residential-Agricultura\nCELL (3, 1): \nCZ R-15\nCELL (3, 2): \nConditional Zoning Low to Medium Density Residential\nCELL (4, 1): \nCZ R-10\nCELL (4, 2): \nConditional Zoning Medium Density Residential\nCELL (5, 1): \nCZ R-6\nCELL (5, 2): \nConditional Zoning High Density Residential\nCELL (6, 1): \nCZ O&I\nCELL (6, 2): \nConditional Zoning Office & Institutional\nCELL (7, 1): \nCZ CB\nCELL (7, 2): \nConditional Zoning Central Business\nCELL (8, 1): \nCZ GC\nCELL (8, 2): \nConditional Zoning General Commercial\nCELL (9, 1): \nCZ CP\nCELL (9, 2): \nConditional Zoning Commerce Park\n\n\nNEW PAGE 21\nB.\nSpecific conditions applicable to these districts may be proposed by the petitioner or the town or its\nagencies, but only those conditions mutually approved by the town and the petitioner may be\nincorporated into the requirements of the district. Conditions and site-specific standards imposed in a\nConditional Zoning District shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the development\nand use of the site to the town's ordinances and to any officially adopted plan, and those that address\nthe impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site.\nC.\nIf for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these regulations is found to be illegal or invalid or\nif the applicant should fail to accept any condition, it is the intent of this ordinance that the\nauthorization of such CZ district shall be null and void and of no effect, and that proceedings shall be\ninitiated by the Town of Angier to rezone the property to its previous zoning classification.\nD.\nConditional Zoning Districts shall be approved through the town board approval process outlined in\nchapter 11.\nSection 3.6. Overlay districts.\nOverlay zoning districts are established to provide land use regulations in addition to those created by the\nbase zoning districts herein. These overlay districts are implemented when necessary due to special circumstances.\nThere are two overlay zoning districts in Angier that provide for the protection of special environmental features of\nthe town, as follows:\n3.6.1 Watershed Protection Overlay (WP-O). The following regulations were adopted April 2005 in\naccordance with the state model ordinance:\n3.6.1.1 Intent.\nA.\nThe purpose of the Watershed Protection Overlay District is to prevent significant future water quality\ndeterioration in existing or potential future drinking water reservoirs and rivers that receive\nstormwater runoff form land within the Town of Angier. Protection of all water supplies within the\nstate, in accordance with minimum standards, was mandated by the Water Supply Watershed\nProtection Act passed by the General Assembly in 1989. The quality of water in drinking water\nreservoirs and rivers can be affected by human activities including farming, obstruction of highways\nand streets, subdivision development, industrial development, and other land disturbing activities.\nTypes of water pollutants resulting from these activities include sediment, bacterial contamination,\nheavy metals, synthetic organic compounds, and low-level radioactivity.\nB.\nThe intent of the Watershed Protection Overlay District is to apply a set of regulations involving land\nuse and, in some cases, structural Best Management Practices (BMP's) that protect the watersheds by\nreducing the pollution from future development that enters the drinking water supplies. Land use\nmanagement practices involve minimum lot sizes, maximum allowed density, and built-upon area\nrestrictions, since built-upon areas such as streets, rooftops, and driveways are a major source of\npollution. Structural Best Management Practices allow for more intensive land uses by providing for\ntemporary detention of stormwater runoff so that pollutants may settle.\nC.\nThe Watershed Protection Overlay District as hereby established overlay other zoning districts\nestablished in this ordinance. The new use of any land or new structure within the Watershed\nProtection Overlay District shall comply with the use regulations applicable to the underlying zoning\ndistrict as well as the requirements of the Watershed Protection Overlay District.\nCreated: 2023-08-11 10:27:33 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 11, Update 1)\nPage 21 of 221\nCELL (1, 1): \nWP-O\nCELL (1, 2): \nWatershed Protection Overlay\nCELL (2, 1): \nFDP-O\nCELL (2, 2): \nFlood Damage Prevention Overlay\n\nNEW PAGE 145\n10.6.1 Signs permitted by type.\nCreated: 2023-08-11 10:27:36 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 11, Update 1)\nPage 145 of 221\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nMax.\nCELL (1, 4): \nMax. # signs per\nCELL (1, 5): \nMax. # signs per\nCELL (1, 6): \nMax. # signs per\nCELL (1, 7): \nMax. sign area\nCELL (1, 8): \nMax. sign area\nCELL (1, 9): \nMax.\nCELL (1, 10): \nMin.\nCELL (1, 11): \nNotes\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \n# of\nwalls\nwith\nsigns\nCELL (2, 4): \nStreet\nFrontage\nCELL (2, 5): \nProject\nCELL (2, 6): \nEntrance\nCELL (2, 7): \nProject <\none acre\nCELL (2, 8): \nProject >\none acre\nCELL (2, 9): \nHeight\nCELL (2, 10): \ndistance\nbetween\nsigns\non same\nproperty\nCELL (2, 11): \nCELL (3, 1): \nSINGLE\nTENANT\nCELL (3, 2): \nGround\nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (3, 4): \n1\nCELL (3, 5): \n2\nCELL (3, 6): \nCELL (3, 7): \n100 sq.\nft.\nCELL (3, 8): \n100 sq. ft.\nCELL (3, 9): \n25 ft.\nCELL (3, 10): \n300 ft.\nCELL (3, 11): \nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \nWall\nCELL (4, 3): \n3\nCELL (4, 4): \nCELL (4, 5): \nCELL (4, 6): \nCELL (4, 7): \nsq. ft. =\n1.5 times\ntotal\nlinear ft.\nof\nmounting\nwall\nCELL (4, 8): \nsq. ft. = 1.5\ntimes total\nlinear ft. of\nmounting\nwall\nCELL (4, 9): \nCELL (4, 10): \nCELL (4, 11): \nCELL (5, 1): \nMULTI-TENANT\n&\nSHOPPING\nCOMPLEX\nCELL (5, 2): \nGround\nCELL (5, 3): \nCELL (5, 4): \n1\nCELL (5, 5): \nCELL (5, 6): \nCELL (5, 7): \n40 sq. ft.\n+ 10 sq.\nft. for\neach\ntenant up\nto 100\nsq. ft.\nCELL (5, 8): \n40 sq. ft. +\n12 sq. ft.\nfor each\ntenant up\nto 150 sq.\nft.\nCELL (5, 9): \n25 ft.\nCELL (5, 10): \n300 ft.\nCELL (5, 11): \nCELL (6, 1): \nCELL (6, 2): \nWall\nCELL (6, 3): \n2*\nCELL (6, 4): \nCELL (6, 5): \nCELL (6, 6): \nCELL (6, 7): \nsq. ft. =\n1.5 times\ntotal\nlinear ft.\nof\nCELL (6, 8): \nsq. ft. = 1.5\ntimes total\nlinear ft. of\nmounting\nwall\nCELL (6, 9): \nCELL (6, 10): \nCELL (6, 11): \nApplies to each\ntenant of\ncomplex\n\n\nNEW PAGE 146\n(Ord. of 1-7-2020(1) )\nCreated: 2023-08-11 10:27:36 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 11, Update 1)\nPage 146 of 221\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (1, 6): \nCELL (1, 7): \nmounting\nwall\nCELL (1, 8): \nCELL (1, 9): \nCELL (1, 10): \nCELL (1, 11): \nCELL (2, 1): \nNEIGHBORHOOD\nIDENTIFICATION\nCELL (2, 2): \nGround\nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (2, 5): \nCELL (2, 6): \n1\nCELL (2, 7): \nNA\nCELL (2, 8): \n70 sq. ft.\nper\nentrance\nCELL (2, 9): \n20 ft.\nCELL (2, 10): \nCELL (2, 11): \nCELL (3, 1): \nCIVIC &\nINSTITUTIONAL\nCELL (3, 2): \nGround\nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (3, 4): \n1\nCELL (3, 5): \n2\nCELL (3, 6): \nCELL (3, 7): \n100 sq.\nft.\nCELL (3, 8): \n100 sq. ft.\nCELL (3, 9): \n25 ft.\nCELL (3, 10): \n300 ft.\nCELL (3, 11): \nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \nWall\nCELL (4, 3): \n3\nCELL (4, 4): \nCELL (4, 5): \nCELL (4, 6): \nCELL (4, 7): \nsq. ft. =\n1.5 times\ntotal\nlinear ft.\nof\nmounting\nwall\nCELL (4, 8): \nsq. ft. = 1.5\ntimes total\nlinear ft. of\nmounting\nwall\nCELL (4, 9): \nCELL (4, 10): \nCELL (4, 11): \nApplies to each\nfacility\nCELL (5, 1): \nMANUFACTURED\nHOME PARK\nCELL (5, 2): \nGround\nCELL (5, 3): \nCELL (5, 4): \nCELL (5, 5): \n1\nCELL (5, 6): \nCELL (5, 7): \n24 sq. ft.\n/side\nMIN\nAREA: 16\nsq. ft.\nCELL (5, 8): \n24 sq. ft.\n/side\nMIN AREA:\n16 sq. ft.\nCELL (5, 9): \n8 ft.\nCELL (5, 10): \nCELL (5, 11): \nName of MHP\nand\nowner/operator\nphone num.\nshall be\nincluded.\n\n\nNEW PAGE 147\n10.6.2 Additional requirements by sign type.\nA.\nGround signs.\n1.\nAll ground signs shall be monument, pole, or arm style.
