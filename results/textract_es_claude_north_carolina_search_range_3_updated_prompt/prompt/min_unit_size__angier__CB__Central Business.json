Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Central Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CB\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Central Business\n(CB) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Central Business (CB). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Central Business (CB)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Central Business\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 74\nArticle 4 Zoning Districts\n4.5 Commercial Zoning Districts\n4.5.4.\nSpecial Standards in the CB Zoning District\nD.\nOpen Space\nOpen space requirements for the residential portion of a multifamily or mixed commercial-residential\nproject shall be the same and conform to the requirements for multifamily developments in the MR-\n4-12\nCELL (1, 1):\nUse\nCELL (1, 2):\nDistrict\nCELL (1, 3):\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 4):\nMinimum\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 5):\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 6):\nMinimum\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 7):\nCELL (1, 8):\nYard\n(ft.)\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (2, 1):\nCELL (2, 2):\nCELL (2, 3):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 4):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 5):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 6):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 7):\nFront\nCELL (2, 8):\nRear\nCELL (2, 9):\nSide\nCELL (3, 1):\nAll residential, except\nCELL (3, 2):\nCB\nCELL (3, 3):\n60\nCELL (3, 4):\n60\nCELL (3, 5):\n6,000\nCELL (3, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (3, 7):\n25\u00b3\nCELL (3, 8):\n63\nCELL (3, 9):\n51,2\nCELL (4, 1):\nmultifamily\nCELL (4, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (4, 3):\n75\nCELL (4, 4):\n75\nCELL (4, 5):\n7,500\nCELL (4, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (4, 7):\n253\nCELL (4, 8):\n253\nCELL (4, 9):\n102\nCELL (5, 1):\nMultifamily/ Mixed\nCELL (5, 2):\nCB\nCELL (5, 3):\n100\nCELL (5, 4):\n150\nCELL (5, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (5, 6):\n15,000\nCELL (5, 7):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 8):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 9):\nCELL (6, 1):\ncommercial- residential\nCELL (6, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (6, 3):\n100\nCELL (6, 4):\n100\nCELL (6, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (6, 6):\n7,000\nCELL (6, 7):\nCELL (6, 8):\nCELL (6, 9):\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"CELL (2, 5):\\nWith\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 5):\\n6,000\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (2, 6):\\nWithout\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 6):\\n10,000\" 74]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"For district CB, the section provides the information for min_unit_size.

The automobile\ncover or tarpaulin must remain in good repair and not allowed to deteriorate.\nChapter 9 INFRASTRUCTURE\nSection 9.1. Street standards.\n9.1.1 Conformance with transportation plans. The location and design of streets shall be in conformance with\nany adopted transportation plan of the town. Where conditions warrant, right-of-way width and pavement width\nin excess of the minimum street standards may be required by the technical review committee. In any case where\nany part of a development lies within the corridor of a thoroughfare shown on an official Thoroughfare Map\nadopted pursuant to N.C.G.S. Chapter 136, Article 2E, no development approval shall be granted with respect to\nthe property in the corridor.\n9.1.2 Traffic impact analysis required. The requirement of a traffic impact analysis is intended to help\nmitigate the impacts of new development to existing and proposed roadways and intersections. This analysis\nprovides a standard procedure to identify a development's expected traffic impacts on the road system and any\npotential issues with access to and from a site. As part of this analysis, recommendations will be made to improve\ndevelopment design to resolve these potential adverse traffic impacts and access issues.\nA traffic impact analysis shall be submitted at the time of application for review of a preliminary subdivision\nplat, nonresidential or multifamily site plan, special use permit or a conditional rezoning.\nAll development that is expected to generate 1,000 or more vehicle trips to or from a site during a 24-hour\nperiod shall require a Traffic Impact Analysis. In addition, all development that is expected to generate 100 or\nmore vehicle trips to or from the site during the peak traffic hour shall require a Traffic Impact Analysis.\nThe planning director may waive the requirement for a traffic impact analysis if the applicant shows that the\nproposed development's impact on adjacent roadways and intersections will be no more than those projected by a\ntraffic impact analysis submitted within the past two years for the same site.\nIn addition to any roadway improvements that may be required by NCDOT, roadway improvements\nrecommended by the Traffic Impact Analysis may be required for new development.\nA.\nLevel of service standards.\n1.\nThe traffic impact analysis must demonstrate that the proposed development will not cause\npeak-hour level of service on any adjacent roadway or at any intersection within the study area\nto fall below Level of Service (LOS) \"D\" as defined by the latest edition of the Transportation\nResearch Board's Highway Capacity Manual, or where the level of service is LOS \"E,\" that the\nproposed development would not cause the LOS to fall to a lower grade.\n2.\nIf a road segment or intersection within the study area is LOS \"F,\" the analysis must demonstrate\nthat the proposed development, with any proposed improvements, would not cause build-out\nyear peak-hour operation to decrease more than five percent of the total delay on any\nintersection approach.\n3.\nProposed roadway access points within a development must be shown within the analysis to\navoid unsafe conditions on adjacent roads and intersections.\n4.\nFailure to meet the standards of this section will require the developer to install any roadway or\nintersection improvements needed to correct the deficiencies identified in the analysis.\nB.\nStudy area. A required traffic impact analysis must include the proposed development's traffic impact\non the following:\nCreated: 2023-08-11 10:27:35 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 11, Update 1)\nPage 118 of 221\n\n\n Output:"}]}
