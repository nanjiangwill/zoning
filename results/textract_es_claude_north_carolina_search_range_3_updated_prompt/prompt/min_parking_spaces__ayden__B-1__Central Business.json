Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Central Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"B-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Central Business\n(B-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Central Business (B-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Central Business (B-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Central Business\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

Setback Measurement\na.\nSetback distances shall be measured from the property line or street right-of-way line to\na point on the lot that is directly below the nearest extension of any part of the building\nthat is substantially a part of the building itself and not a mere appendage to it (such as a\nflagpole, etc.).\nb. If the street right-of-way line is readily determinable (by reference to a recorded map, set\nirons, or other means), the setback shall be measured at a right angle to such right-of-\nway line. If the right-of-way line is not so determinable, the setback shall be measured\nfrom the street centerline.\nC. All setbacks are subject to compliance with adopted applicable fire code provisions.\nC. Relationship of Building to Lot\nIn no case shall there be more than one principal building and its customary accessory buildings\non a lot except in the case of a designed complex of professional, residential or commercial\nbuildings in an appropriate zoning district.\nD. Street Access\nNo building shall be erected on a lot which does not abut a street or have access to a street,\nprovided that in a planned development, a building may be erected adjoining a parking area or\ndedicated open space which has access to a street used in common with other lots.\nE. Infill Development Standards\nInfill development is any new development on land that has been previously developed or vacant\nland where development has occurred around the vacant land.\n1.\nStreet Frontages. New structures should orient windows, main entrances, and other\nprimary building fa\u00e7ade elements toward the street. Care should be taken to avoid the\nappearance of buildings turning their backs or sides toward the street.\n2.\nFront Setback Pattern. The minimum front setback required may be reduced by the\nAdministrator for any lot where the average established front yard setback on developed lots\nlocated within 300 feet on each side of such lot, and fronting on the same street as such lot,\nis less than the minimum required yard setback. In such cases, the minimum front or street\nyard setback may be less than that required but not less than the average of the existing\nfront yard setbacks on the developed lots within 300 feet of each side. In addition, for new\nlots created from existing larger lots, the lot width at the frontage line and the side yard\nsetbacks shall be consistent with the immediately adjacent neighboring parcels on the same\nside of the street.\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-3\nADOPTION DATE: JANUARY 13, 2020\n\n\nNEW PAGE 59\nGENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\n3.\nDriveways. On lots less than 50 feet in width, only one driveway of no more than 12 feet in\nwidth may be used to provide access to garages or off-street parking areas.\n4. Rhythm of Development. Garages or off-street parking areas shall be located in the side or\nrear setback area only.\nF. Irregular Lot Setbacks\nThe location of required front, side and rear yard setbacks on irregularly shaped lots shall be\ndetermined by the Administrator. The determination will be based on the intent and purpose of\nthis ordinance to achieve an appropriate spacing and location of buildings and buildings on\nindividual lots. Where questions arise as to appropriateness, the subdivider may be requested to\nprovide additional design information.\n510.030 Fences & Walls\nAll fences and walls shall comply with the requirements of this Section unless specifically approved\nas part of a Conditional District, Special Use Permit or Variance.\nA. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, fences that are no taller than six (6) feet may be\nbuilt along interior side and rear property lines.\nB. Exterior side yard fences that are no taller than six (6) feet shall be at least five (5) from the right-\nof-way.\nC. Fences in front yards are discouraged, but must be:\n1. Located least two (2) feet from the right-of-way and no closer than two (2) feet from the\ninside edge of the sidewalk;\n2. Less than sixty (60) percent opaque; and\n3. Not exceed four (4) feet in height, except that wrought iron and split rail style fences may be\nup to five (5) feet tall.\nD. No fence shall obstruct any traffic safety visibility zone.\nE. Barbed wire, razor wire or other fence materials designed to cut or puncture are prohibited in all\ndistricts, except in the B-2, LI, HI and CON districts.\nF. Deer fences may be erected around gardens provided that the fences are located at least ten\n(10) feet from the nearest property line.\n510.040 Parking and Loading\nA. Purpose and Intent\nThis Section establishes the minimum requirements for the number of spaces and the design of\nparking areas in the Town of Ayden. This Section provides administrative flexibility for the\nAdministrator to adjust the number of required spaces and the design of spaces to provide for\nadequate parking, accommodate unique site conditions and capitalize on the benefits of parking\nopportunities on-street or in shared parking areas.\nB. Applicability\nThe requirements of this Section shall be applicable to all new development and changes of use\nthat create the need for parking or increase existing parking demands.\nC. Parking Space Requirements\nPermanent off-street parking (including on-street parking in accordance with the requirements\nbelow) is required subject to the table below. If required, parking shall be provided at the time of\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-4\nADOPTION DATE: APRIL 12, 2021\n\n\nNEW PAGE 60\nARTICLE 5\nerection, alteration, enlargement, establishment or change of use of any building or open use of\nland which require additional off-street parking.\nD. Exemptions and Adjustments\n1. Exemptions. Uses in the B-1 District are exempt from the minimum parking requirements of\nthis Section.\n2. Tree Preservation. The minimum number of parking spaces required may be adjusted by\nthe Administrator when it has been determined that the reductions are necessary to preserve\na healthy tree or trees (with a 12 inch or greater diameter at breast height) from being\ndamaged or removed, and where the site plan provides for the retention of said tree or trees.\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-5\nADOPTION DATE: JANUARY 13, 2020\nCELL (1, 1): \nLAND USE TYPE\nCELL (1, 2): \nMINIMUM REQUIRED AUTO\nSPACES\nCELL (1, 3): \nMINIMUM REQUIRED\nBICYCLE PARKING\nSPACES\nCELL (2, 1): \nRESIDENTIAL:\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (3, 1): \nDwelling - Single Family & Two\nFamily\nCELL (3, 2): \n1 per unit or 2 per unit if parking is\nprovided in an enclosed garage\nCELL (3, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (4, 1): \nDwelling - Multifamily\nCELL (4, 2): \n1.5 per unit\nCELL (4, 3): \n2 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (5, 1): \nDwelling - Accessory\nCELL (5, 2): \n1 per unit\nCELL (5, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (6, 1): \nResidential Care Facilities\nCELL (6, 2): \n1 per 2 resident rooms\nCELL (6, 3): \n1 per 40 auto spaces\nCELL (7, 1): \nAll other residential uses\nCELL (7, 2): \n1 per unit\nCELL (7, 3): \nNo requirement\nCELL (8, 1): \nLODGING AND ACCOMMODATIONS:\nCELL (8, 2): \nCELL (8, 3): \nCELL (9, 1): \nAll uses\nCELL (9, 2): \n1 per room\nCELL (9, 3): \n1 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (10, 1): \nOFFICE AND SERVICES:\nCELL (10, 2): \nCELL (10, 3): \nCELL (11, 1): \nMedical Clinic\nCELL (11, 2): \n1 per examination room\nCELL (11, 3): \n1 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (12, 1): \nAll other Office & Service Uses\nCELL (12, 2): \n1 per 700 sf\nCELL (12, 3): \n1 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (13, 1): \nCOMMERCIAL AND ENTERTAINMENT:\nCELL (13, 2): \nCELL (13, 3): \nCELL (14, 1): \nRestaurant\nCELL (14, 2): \n1 per 400 sf\nCELL (14, 3): \n2 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (15, 1): \nIndoor Amusement\nCELL (15, 2): \nNo requirement\nCELL (15, 3): \n2 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (16, 1): \nOutdoor Amusement\nCELL (16, 2): \nNo requirement\nCELL (16, 3): \n2 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (17, 1): \nTheater (Indoor or Outdoor)\nCELL (17, 2): \n1 per 8 seats\nCELL (17, 3): \n2 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (18, 1): \nAll other Commercial and\nEntertainment Uses\nCELL (18, 2): \n1 per 500 sf\nCELL (18, 3): \n2 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (19, 1): \nMANUFACTURING, INDUSTRIAL AND WHOLESALE TRADE:\nCELL (19, 2): \nMANUFACTURING, INDUSTRIAL AND WHOLESALE TRADE:\nCELL (19, 3): \nCELL (20, 1): \nAll uses\nCELL (20, 2): \n1 per 1,000 sf\nCELL (20, 3): \nNo requirement\nCELL (21, 1): \nEDUCATION & INSTITUTIONS:\nCELL (21, 2): \nCELL (21, 3): \nCELL (22, 1): \nChild/Adult Day Care Centers (more\nthan 8 persons)\nCELL (22, 2): \n1 space per classroom\nCELL (22, 3): \n1 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (23, 1): \nReligious Institutions\nCELL (23, 2): \n1 per 8 seats in main assembly hall\nCELL (23, 3): \n1 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (24, 1): \nSchools (elementary & secondary)\nCELL (24, 2): \n1 per 8 seats in main assembly hall\nor gymnasium\nCELL (24, 3): \n2 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (25, 1): \nStudio\nCELL (25, 2): \n1 per 400 sf\nCELL (25, 3): \n1 per 20 auto spaces\nCELL (26, 1): \nAll other Education and Institution\nuses\nCELL (26, 2): \n1 per 500 sf\nCELL (26, 3): \n1 per 50 auto spaces\nCELL (27, 1): \nAGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY:\nCELL (27, 2): \nCELL (27, 3): \nCELL (28, 1): \nAll uses\nCELL (28, 2): \nNo requirements\nCELL (28, 3): \nNo requirements\nCELL (29, 1): \nCOMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE:\nCELL (29, 2): \nCOMMUNICATIONS, TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE:\nCELL (29, 3): \nCELL (30, 1): \nAll uses\nCELL (30, 2): \nNo requirement\nCELL (30, 3): \nNo requirements\n\nNEW PAGE 61\nGENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nE.
