Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Medium Density Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MDR\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Medium Density Residential\n(MDR) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Medium Density Residential (MDR). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Medium Density Residential (MDR)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Medium Density Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage refers solely to the maximum lot coverage of buildings for primary use and all accessory structures. Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

However, the\ndeveloped area may be increased as a result of utilizing exceptional design and/or best management practices as provided in Section 6.1,\nDesign Flexibility.

MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (MDR) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Medium Density Residential (MDR) district is established to accommodate moderate\ndensity residential development and complimentary uses in suburban-to-urban settings\nthroughout the City's jurisdiction. Use of the conservation subdivision configuration\nis\noptional for residential subdivisions of five lots or more. The district accommodates\nutilities as well as various neighborhood-supporting institutional uses such as parks,\nschools, and public safety facilities. District regulations discourage uses that interfere\nwith the development of residential neighborhoods or that are detrimental to the\nresidential nature of the district. Conservation subdivisions, pocket neighborhoods, or\nbungalow courts are allowed as optional forms of development.\nNOTES:\n(AMENDED 06.21.22 UDOTA-03-22; AMENDED 12.6.22 UDOTA-05-22)\n[1] Includes duplex, triplex, and quadriplex dwellings.\n[2] Increased to 7 units per acre in a pocket neighborhood, bungalow court, or conservation subdivision.\n[3] Decreased to 6,000 square feet for lots in pocket neighborhoods, bungalow courts, and conservation subdivisions.\n[4] 10,000 for duplex buildings; 15,000 for triplex buildings; 20,000 for quadriplex buildings; and 9,000 for a single-family attached\ndevelopment plus an additional 1,600 square feet per single-family attached unit in the development.\n[5] This is a minimum development size, not a minimum lot area.\n[6] Dev. in the WPO is subject to built-upon limits in Section 3.20.F, Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay (WPO) District.\n[7] Increased to 90% for lots in pocket neighborhoods, 80% for lots in bungalow courts, and 99% for lots in conservation subdivisions.\n[8] Applied to the entire single-family attached development, not to individual lots with an individual single-family attached dwelling.\n[9] Applied to entire development (not individual lots) if a pocket neighborhood, bungalow court, or conservation subdivision.\n[10] Standards applied to entire development, not individual lots.\n[11] Open space set-aside requirements applied to single-family detached subdivisions of six or more lots and development comprised of six\nor more duplex, triplex, or quadriplex buildings. All single-family attached and multi-family development shall provide open space set-aside.\n[12] Open space set-aside shall be configured with at least 50 percent devoted to active recreation features in accordance with Section 7.1,\nOpen Space Set-Aside.\n[13] In cases where development is in a subdivision established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, no setback shall be required to\nbe greater than the average setback of existing residential structures on the same side of the block or within a distance of 500 feet\nhorizontally on either side when blocks are not present.\n[14] On corner lots of record, the street setback may be reduced by 50 percent on the long side of the lot.\n[15] Reduced to as low as 3 feet for dwellings in pocket neighborhoods, bungalow courts, and conservation subdivisions.\n[16] Duplex dwellings may utilize a side yard setback that is the same as a single-family detached dwelling.\n[17] Duplex, triplex, quadplex, and single-family attached buildings with party walls may maintain a sideyard setback of zero along party\nwalls.\n[18] 20 feet required from lot lines abutting single-family detached residential dwellings.\n[19] Applied in lieu of side or rear setbacks in multi-building developments.\n[20] Development in the AHO is subject to maximum building heights in Section 3.20.B, Airport Height Overlay (AHO) District.\nCity of Burlington\nUnified Development Ordinance\n3-28\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\nCELL (1, 1): \nB.

MEDIUM INDUSTRIAL (MI) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Medium Industrial (MI) district is established to\naccommodate modern, technologically-based, clean\nindustrial development that takes place in highly\ncontrolled environments. Typical activities taking place in\nthe district include bio-engineering, pharmaceuticals,\nprecision fabrication and assembly, and research and\ndevelopment. The district does not allow heavy industrial\nuses, residential uses, or retail, except as accessory uses.\nDistrict standards are intended to prevent the\nestablishment of any use types that would interrupt\nindustrial operations. District standards require that no\nland or structure be used for any purpose that causes\nnoxious or offensive odors, gas fumes, smoke, dust,\nvibration, or noise that substantially interferes with other\nnearby uses.\nB.
