Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Mixed Use\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MX-2\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Mixed Use\n(MX-2) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Mixed Use (MX-2). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Mixed Use (MX-2)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Mixed Use\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

Purpose.\nThe Conditional Zoning Districts allow for the establishment of certain uses, which, because of\ntheir nature or scale, have particular impacts on both the immediate area and the community as a\nwhole. The development of these uses cannot be predetermined or controlled by general district\nstandards. In order to accommodate these uses, this Section establishes specific development\nstandards for these uses, which allow for flexibility in development while protecting existing\ndeveloped areas. The permitted uses and development standards are contained within each\ndistrict. The process for approval of a Conditional Zoning District is explained in Chapter 6,\nPart 2.\nPART 2: MIXED-USE DISTRICTS (MX-1, MX-2, and MX-3)\nSection 11.201. Purpose.\nThe Mixed Use Districts are hereby established in order to accommodate the development of\nplanned communities that may incorporate a full range of housing types and, in some instances,\ncompatible nonresidential uses that provide goods, services, and employment primarily to serve\nthe residents of the planned community. In order to encourage high quality design and\ninnovative arrangement of buildings and open space uses throughout the project, these districts\nprovide substantial flexibility from the conventional use and dimensional requirements of the\ngeneral districts. Three mixed-use districts are established with varying degrees of development\nintensity to address the application of mixed use to various locations within the community. The\ndevelopmental and locational criteria for the districts are as follows:\n11 1\nCELL (1, 1): \nMX-1:\nCELL (1, 2): \nThis district permits only residential mixed-use development and is applicable to\ndevelopments 10 acres or larger. This district is intended to be located within any\nresidential areas in the community.\nCELL (2, 1): \nMX-2:\nCELL (2, 2): \nThis district permits residential mixed use development (dwellings and permitted\naccessory uses and structures) on tracts which are 10 acres or larger and\nresidential mixed use and nonresidential use development on tracts which are 36\nacres or larger. This district is permitted within the community along major\nthoroughfares, minor thoroughfares or collector streets having adequate access.\n\n\nNEW PAGE 494\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 2: MIXED USE DISTRICTS (MX-1, MX-2, MX-3)\nMX-3:\nThis district permits residential mixed use and major commercial institutional and\nemployment uses. This district is applicable to developments 100 acres or larger.\nIt is intended to be located as a component of \"Development Enterprise Areas\", or\nsimilar areas identified in the adopted Generalized Land Plan, and areas of the\ncommunity along major thoroughfares.\nSection 11.202.
