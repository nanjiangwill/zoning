Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Heavy Industry Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"HIO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Heavy Industry Overlay\n(HIO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Heavy Industry Overlay (HIO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Heavy Industry Overlay (HIO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Heavy Industry Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

It is the intent\nof this district to provide and permit certain public and private heavy industrial uses and\nfacilities that incorporate hazardous materials and/or scientific technology, including\nwholesale, distribution, storage, processing, manufacturing and production. However, it\nis required that industries in this district take all necessary actions including but not\nlimited to installation of apparatus and technological equipment available to prevent\nnegative impacts on the environment and the community from the emissions of smoke,\ndust, fumes, noise and vibrations and other activities and/or products resulting from such\nhazardous industrial activities in accordance with federal, state and local regulations.\nThe Mini Farm Overlay District (MFO) permits buildings to be grouped on a site, parcel,\nor property in order to optimize the use of land and resources for both residential and\nagricultural purposes. By clustering development at a density no greater than one unit\nper developed acre, projects developed in accordance with these standards can obtain\ndensity bonuses while preserving unique natural features for agricultural use. The Mini\nFarm Overlay District mandates the dedication of both agricultural land and open space\nwith density bonuses provided as an incentive for adhering to the standards. It is the\nintent of this district to be used for new development in undeveloped outlying areas of the\nTown and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. Allowed building/lot type is Detached House.\nThe Manufactured Home Overlay District (MHO) is established to protect the standard of\nliving and neighborhood conditions. Established standards that will enable the use of\ninnovative manufactured homes with a higher aesthetic standard will invigorate these\ncommunities. Non-conforming manufactured home parks that have not received\napproval for continuation would be amortized over a period of time to allow the\nowner/operator to meet reasonable financial payback expectations in accordance with\naccepted practices in North Carolina. Existing parks could be limited to less fundamental\nstandards and specifications, while new parks are required to meet a higher standard.\nThese parks may be ideally suited for alternative designs such as Tiny House, Park\nModel and other styles of housing where installation standards are considered temporary.\nThe overlay could be expanded to apply to permanent installations of innovative\nmanufactured housing in subdivisions or parks in accordance with G.S. 160D-909.\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 6\n\n\nNEW PAGE 138\n8.4\nDistrict Development Standards and Permitted Uses Listed for Each District\nDevelopment standards are established for each of the following Primary General-Use\nDistricts to promote the orderly development of the Town of Chadbourn.

Intent. The Agriculture District (AG) is established to protect lands used for\nagricultural production, agriculturally based businesses and related activities.\nFarmland is a defining element of Chadbourn's identity and the protection of these\nlands aids in preserving the character of the Town until such time as new\ndevelopment is preferred by the Town. Listed uses are limited, with an emphasis\non uses that are agricultural in nature. Development density is very low to\nencourage preservation of agricultural lands while discouraging large lot\nresidential subdivision type development and excessive septic system utility. The\nAgriculture District can also be used to preserve open spaces.\n(B.) Listed Uses:\n(1.) Uses listed by right: See Table of Uses (Table 8.1) of this Article\n(2.)

The building's size;\n3. The compatibility of the building's architecture with community\ncharacter and the purposes of the scenic corridor overlay district.\n(3.) Scenic Corridor Dimensions. The designated scenic corridors shall meet the\nfollowing dimensional standards:\n(a.) The width of the scenic easement within the Suburban Scenic Corridor\nshall be 10% of the lot depth but no more than 100 feet from the edge of\nthe public right-of-way. The Planning, Zoning & Subdivision\nAdministrator may require an additional scenic depth of up to 50 feet in\norder to preserve structures and/or vegetation deemed to be significant.\n(b.) The width of the scenic easement within the Gateway Scenic Corridor\nshall be 10% of the lot depth but no more than 50 feet from the edge of the\nhighway right-of-way. The Planning, Zoning & Subdivision\nAdministrator may require an additional depth of up to 25 feet in order to\npreserve structures and/or vegetation deemed to be significant.\n(c.) The width of the scenic easement within the Bypass Scenic Corridor shall\nbe 10% of the lot depth but no more than 75 feet from the edge of the\npublic right-of-way. The Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator\nmay require an additional depth of up to 25 feet in order to preserve\nstructures and/or vegetation deemed to be significant.\n(4.) Scenic Corridor Provisions. The following provisions shall govern\ndevelopment within a designated scenic corridor:\n(a.) The area within the scenic easement may be dedicated to the Town as a\nconservation easement, provided it meets the standards for such an\neasement as established by applicable state and federal standards.\n(b.) Development density shall be calculated for the entire property, including\nthe area within the scenic easement, with the exception that development\ndensity bonuses of up to 50 percent are given for the portion of the\nproperty within the scenic easement. In the event that the property owner\nprovides a scenic easement wider than required by this ordinance, the\ndensity bonus may be increased up to 75% for the area located within the\nscenic easement.\nFor example, the Jones family own a 10-acre property zoned Single-Family\nResidential (SFR). Two (2) acres of the property are within the Scenic\nCorridor Overlay. The density is calculated as follows:\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 32\n\n\nNEW PAGE 164\nBase density @ 3 units/acre X 10 acres = 30 units\n50% density bonus for 2 acres in scenic corridor easement\n50% of (2 acres X 3 units/acre) = 3-unit bonus\nTotal Density = 33units\nIf the Jones provide an easement wider than required, then they would receive a\n75% density bonus for the area within the easement:\nBase density @ 3units/acre X 10 acres = 30 units\n75% density bonus for 2 acres with wider easement\n75% of (2 acres X 3 units/acre) = 4.5-unit bonus\nTotal Density = 35 units\n(c.) Development may be clustered on the portion of the property located\noutside the scenic easement.\n(5.) Curb Cuts. There shall be a minimum separation of 500' between curb cuts\nin the suburban scenic corridors. This separation requirement may be waived\nby the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator if the width of the\nproperty frontage would preclude a second curb cut meeting this spacing\nrequirement.\n(6.) Lot Standards & Specifications. The lot type standards and building type\nstandard listed in the underlying district, as set forth in section 8.4 and further\ndescribed in Article 9, shall apply in the Scenic Corridor Overlay District.\n(D.) Open Space. The provision and design of open space shall comply with the\nrequirements set forth in Article 21. Land within the scenic easement may count\nfor up to 100% of the minimum open space required by Article 21 of this\nOrdinance.\n(E.) Parking & Landscaping. Parking shall comply with the requirements set forth in\nArticle 12. Landscaping shall comply with the requirements set forth in Article 11.\n(This space left blank intentionally.)\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 33\n\n\nNEW PAGE 165\n8.5-3 Heavy Industry Overlay (HIO)\n(A.)
