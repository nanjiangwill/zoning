Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"R-1 Low Density Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If R-1 Low Density Residential\n(R-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor R-1 Low Density Residential (R-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"R-1 Low Density Residential (R-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"R-1 Low Density Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found.

Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were\nmanifestly arranged or designed for that use at the time of adoption or amendment of this\nordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.\n3. If no structural alterations are made, any non-conforming structure or use of structures\nmay be changed to any conforming use, or, with the approval of the Town board of\nCommissioners, to any use more in character with uses permitted in the district.

Where non-conforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination,\nremoval or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the non-conforming status of the\nland. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of\nmore than 75 percent of the replacement cost at time of destruction.\n18\n\n\nNEW PAGE 23\nE. Repairs and Maintenance\n1. Normal maintenance and repair of a structure occupied by a non-conforming use is\npermitted provided it does not expand the non-conforming use.\n2. If a non-conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a non-conforming use\nbecomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is\ndeclared by the Building Inspector to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical\ncondition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with\nthe regulations of the district in which it is located.\n3.\nNothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a\nsafe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official\ncharged with protecting the public safety, upon order of that official.\nF. Uses Under Conditional Use Provisions Not Non-Conforming\nAny use which is permitted as a conditional use in a district under the terms of this ordinance\nshall not be deemed a non-conforming use in such district, but shall without further action be\nconsidered a conforming use.\n19\n\n\nNEW PAGE 24\nARTICLE VI.
