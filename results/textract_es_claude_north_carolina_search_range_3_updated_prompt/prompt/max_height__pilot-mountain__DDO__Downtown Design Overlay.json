Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Downtown Design Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"DDO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Downtown Design Overlay\n(DDO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Downtown Design Overlay (DDO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is \nnot for the zone \"Downtown Design Overlay (DDO)\" but for other zones. \nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Downtown Design Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Purpose. The purpose of establishing supplementary requirements for development in\ndowntown Pilot Mountain is to protect and enhance the visual character of development and\nto preserve the unique streetscape of downtown by encouraging compatibility among\ndowntown structures. It is not the intent of this overlay district to eliminate architectural\nfreedom or discourage innovative design, but rather to complement the Town of Pilot\nMountain's Development Ordinance and development guidelines for Downtown.\n2.\nApplicability. Buildings within the Downtown Design Overlay (DDO) District exhibit design\nelements that contribute to the unique sense of character of downtown Pilot Mountain.\nSpecifically, buildings tend to have flat or low pitch roofs concealed by the front facade\nparapet, no front or side yard setback, large storefront windows on the street level floor and\nstrong horizontal separations between the first and any upper floors created by windows and/\nor changes in fa\u00e7ade materials.\nIn order to continue and, in some cases, recreate the historic development pattern of\ndowntown Pilot Mountain, the following standards shall apply to all new construction,\nadditions and substantial modifications to existing structures located within the Downtown\nDesign Overlay (DDO) District. For the purposes of this section substantial modification shall\nbe defined as any work which involves the alteration of the building's footprint, construction of\nadditional stories, changes in roof pitch, modification of building fenestration and entryways,\nmaterial changes to the building fa\u00e7ade, or painting.\n3. Exemptions. When in compliance with all other town ordinances, the following types of\nprojects are exempt from the standards of the Downtown Design Overlay (DDO) district:\na. Interior and exterior alterations of buildings that were originally designed and built for\nsingle-family residential use and continue to be used for single-family residential use.\nb. Underground construction which does not consist of any above ground components,\nincluding utility boxes, pipes, poles or similar appurtenant features;\nC. Conducting regular maintenance work on buildings, landscaping, or grounds,\n(including parking lots), which does not significantly alter the appearance or function\nof the building, landscaping or grounds;\nd. Interior remodeling work, which does not involve the alteration of any building\ncomponent that does not alter any exterior building component;\ne. Landscape maintenance and upkeep, excluding the replacement trees;\nf. Temporary uses and structures;\ng. Routine roof maintenance and repair, when using like materials; and\nh. Painting of murals on the side and/or rear fa\u00e7ade of buildings.\n4. Design Standards\n\nNEW PAGE 81\na. Front Build-to Line. The front building wall of each new principal structure within the\nDDO shall be constructed so that at least eighty percent (80%) of the width of the\nprimary facade is set back no more than six (6') feet from the edge of the right-of-way\nof Main Street. Existing buildings, which are set back greater than six (6') feet, are\npermitted to retain their current setback, but in no case shall any existing building be\naltered in a manner that increases the setback beyond the minimum, or otherwise\nlessens compliance with this requirement.\nb. Building Height. The following provisions shall regulate the height of buildings within\nthe DDO:\ni. No building within the DDO may exceed fifty (50') feet in height.\nii.

Glass used to meet the glazed area requirements of Subsection 4(d)(iii) shall\nbe transparent, and have a minimum visible light transmission ratio of seventy\npercent (70%).
