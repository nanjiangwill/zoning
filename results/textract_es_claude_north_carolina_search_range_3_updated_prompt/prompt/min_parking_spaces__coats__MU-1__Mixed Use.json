Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Mixed Use\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MU-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Mixed Use\n(MU-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Mixed Use (MU-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Mixed Use (MU-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Mixed Use\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

Conditional zoning affords a degree of certainty in\nland use decisions not possible when rezoning to a Primary General Use District.\nAdditional standards and regulations, mutually agreed upon in writing by the Town of\nCoats and the petitioner, may be attached to a proposed development to ensure\ncompatibility with the surrounding uses and with applicable adopted plans in\naccordance with the requirements of this section.\n5.4-2 Conditional zoning districts.\nConditional zoning is available for any of the Primary General Use or Overlay\nDistrict classifications enumerated in Article 8 of this Ordinance, except for those that\nrequire a site-specific development plan as part of the application (e.g., Traditional\nNeighborhood Development (TNDO) Overlay District, Heavy Industry (HIO)\nOverlay District). The conditional zoning designation shall be indicated on all zoning\nmaps and other official documents with the suffix, \"(CZ)\" and enumerated to\nreference the ordinance on record of the approval (e.g. \"MU-1(CZ-2021-01), Ord.\n#2021-99\").\n5.4-3 General requirements.\nThe following provisions shall apply in the administration of conditional zoning:\n(A) A conditional zoning application shall be considered only upon request of the\nowner of the affected property or a duly authorized representative of the property\nowner demonstrated by written, signed and notarized documentation.\n(B) Applicant shall meet with representatives of the surrounding property owners and\nof the surrounding neighborhood(s) to discuss the proposed development, and include\na report of any such meetings in accordance with Section 5.3-1(B) of this Article to\nthe Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator.\n(C) All standards and requirements of the corresponding Primary General Use District\nshall be met, except to the extent that the conditions imposed by the conditional\nzoning are more restrictive than the general use standards.\n(D) No uses shall be permitted except those enumerated in the ordinance adopting the\nconditional zoning.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 5 - Page 9\n\n\nNEW PAGE 92\n(E) The conditions agreed upon pursuant to the Conditional Zoning approval shall be\nstated in the adopting ordinance and may limit the uses which are permitted on the\nproperty. By way of illustration and not limitation, conditions may specify location on\nthe property of the proposed structure(s), the number of dwelling units, the location\nand extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways, and access streets,\nthe location and extent of buffer areas and other special purpose areas, the timing of\ndevelopment, the height of structures, the location and extent of rights-of-way and\nother areas to be dedicated for public purposes, and other such matters as may be\nidentified as appropriate for the proposed development.\n(F) Minor modifications to the approved Conditional Zoning ordinance may be\napproved by the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator per authorization\nunder G.S. 160D-703(b). The minor modifications authorized herein are intended to\nprovide relief where conditions established by the Conditional Zoning ordinance\ncreate a hardship based upon a unique physical attribute of the property itself or some\nother factor unique to the property which was not known at the time of ordinance\nadoption and which has subsequently rendered the property difficult or impossible to\nuse due to the condition(s) imposed by the zoning. The permit holder shall bear the\nburden of proof to secure the modification(s). Such modifications shall be limited to\nthe following:\n1. A deviation of up to ten percent or 24 inches, whichever is greater, from the\napproved setback, provided that the conditions for approving a deviation from\nthe required setback established by Article 14 (Flexible Development\nStandards) of this Ordinance are met.\n2. A reduction of up to 25 percent in the number of parking spaces required for\nthe use provided that the proposed development is located within 1/2 mile of\neither the Main Street District (MS) or the Mixed Use (MU-1 and MU-2) and\non-street parking is available.\n3. Any other minor modification in accordance with the limitations and\nprocedures prescribed in this Ordinance, unless restricted by G.S. 160D-\n703(b), or the Conditional Zoning ordinance adopted pursuant to this section\nspecifies otherwise.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 5 - Page 10\n\n\nNEW PAGE 93\nAny other modifications must be approved by the Board of Commissioners as an\namendment to the Conditional Zoning ordinance, and may be referred to the Planning\nBoard or Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator as appropriate. The\nPlanning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator shall in every case have the discretion\nto decline to exercise the power to approve or deny modifications as provided for\nherein, and may require the applicant to seek an amendment to the Conditional\nZoning ordinance.\n(G) Any violation of a provision of a Conditional Zoning ordinance shall be treated\nthe same as any other violation of this Ordinance and shall be subject to the same\nremedies and penalties as any other such violation.\n(H) If for any reason any provision of a Conditional Zoning ordinance is found to be\nillegal or invalid, or if the applicant should fail to accept any condition, the entire\nConditional Zoning ordinance shall be null and void, and the property shall revert to\nits previous zoning classification without further action by the Board of\nCommissioners.\n(I) If no formal action (e.g. construction plan submittal, permit application, etc.) has\nbeen taken to begin the development of the property in accordance with the\nConditional Zoning ordinance within 24 months of its approval by Board of\nCommissioners, or no vested right has been obtained, then the property shall revert to\nits previous zoning classification, or the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision\nAdministrator may initiate appropriate action to rezone the affected property to any\nother classification deemed consistent with \"The Plan\" referenced in Article 1 of this\nOrdinance, including subsequent amendments adopted by the Board of\nCommissioners of the Town of Coats and other applicable adopted plans.\n(J) If the use or uses commenced pursuant to a Conditional Zoning ordinance adopted\npursuant to this section are abandoned or discontinued or no vested right has been\nobtained then the property shall revert to its previous zoning classification, or the\nPlanning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator may initiate appropriate action to\nrezone the affected property to any other classification deemed consistent with \"The\nPlan\" referenced in Article 1 of this Ordinance, including subsequent amendments\nadopted by the Board of Commissioners of the Town of Coats and other applicable\nadopted plans.\n(K) No variances or special use permits may be issued for developments on property\nthat is subject to a Conditional Zoning ordinance.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 5 - Page 11\n\n\nNEW PAGE 94\n5.4-4 Application procedure.\nWhen applying for Conditional Zoning, the application shall specify the nature of the\nproposed development and shall propose conditions to ensure compatibility with the\nsurrounding uses and consistency with adopted plans. Applications for Conditional\nZoning shall be processed, considered, and voted upon in accordance with procedures\nestablished in Section 5.3 of this Article for zoning map and zoning text amendments,\nexcept as provided below:\n(A) The application shall include site plans, landscape plans, building elevations, floor\nplans, and such other information required to provide the approving bodies with a\ncomplete and accurate description of the proposed development.\n(B) The application and supporting materials shall be reviewed by the Planning,\nZoning & Subdivision Administrator in accordance with Section 7.8 of this Ordinance\nprior to the meeting of the Planning Board at which the application is to be\nconsidered. The recommendations and comments of the Planning, Zoning &\nSubdivision Administrator shall be reported to the Planning Board. In addition, the\nCoats Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator shall evaluate Conditional\nZoning applications on the basis of the criteria for special use permits set out in\nArticle 7, and shall submit said report at the legislative hearings on said applications.\n(C) Following review by the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator, the\nPlanning Board shall review the application and all requisite documents at a regularly\nscheduled meeting following the procedures defined in Sub-section 5.3-2 of this\nArticle. The Planning Board may recommend approval of the application, including\nrecommending conditions for the zoning; recommend denial of the application; or\ncontinue the consideration of the application in order to receive further information\nregarding the application as authorized by Sub-section 5.3-2(C) of this Article.\n(D) Upon receipt of the recommendations from the Planning Board, the Board of\nCommissioners shall hold a legislative hearing on the application for Conditional\nZoning. Notice of the legislative hearing shall be provided in accordance with the\nprovisions for legislative hearings for zoning map amendments as set forth in Section\n5.3-3(B) of this Ordinance and G.S. 160D-601 and G.S.160D-602.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 5 - Page 12\n\nNEW PAGE 113\nplans. All specific conditions shall run with the land and shall be binding on the\noriginal applicants, their heirs, successors, and assigns. The special use zoning\npermit, as approved, shall be recorded by the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision\nAdministrator with the Register of Deeds for the county in which the subject property\nis located the same as a deed restriction. The zoning permit recipient shall be\nresponsible for paying the recording fee. No building permit shall be issued for the\nsubject property until the recording is made.\n7.8-6 Transfer of approval. A special use approval is not transferable from one property to\nanother but is transferred to a subsequent owner of the property to which applied.\n7.8-7\nResubmission of denied applications. No application for approval of a special use\nshall be filed with, or accepted by, the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator\nthat is identical or substantially similar to an application that has been denied by the\nCoats Board of Adjustment within one year of the final action by the Board of\nAdjustment denying the request. This waiting period may be waived in an individual\ncase, for good cause shown, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of\nBoard of Adjustment.\n7.8-8\nNotice of hearing. Notice of evidentiary hearings required under this section for\nspecial use approvals shall be provided in accordance with the requirements\nestablished by G.S. 160D-406 for evidentiary hearing notification.\n7.8-9 Project phasing. If a project approved as a special use is to be developed in phases, a\nmaster plan for the entire development site must be approved by the Coats Board of\nAdjustment at the same time and in the same manner the special use zoning permit\napplication is considered.\n(A.) Final plans for phases of the special use may be submitted in stages and shall be\napproved by the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator provided that the\nfollowing requirements are met:\n(1.) All stages shall be shown with precise boundaries on the master plan and shall be\nnumbered in the expected order of development.\n(2.) Each phase must be able to exist independently of subsequent phases by meeting\nall applicable laws and regulations as if the phase were a separate project.\n(3.) All the data required for the project as a whole shall be given for each stage\nshown on the plan.\n(4.) A proportionate share of the open space, common facilities, amenities, play areas,\netc. shall be included in each stage of the development, except that centralized\ncommon facilities shall be guaranteed by bond or other irrevocable financial\ninstrument valid for the duration of the project implementation period.\n(5.) The phasing shall be consistent with the traffic circulation, drainage, and utilities\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 7 - Page 12\n\n\nNEW PAGE 114\nplan for the entire master plan for the special use.\n(6.) Each phase of the special use must comply with any and all conditions attached\nto the approval of the special use zoning permit by the Coats Board of Adjustment.\n7.8-10 Variances. In issuing special use zoning permits, the Coats Board of Adjustment may\nprescribe dimensional requirements (height, setback, etc.) that are different from the\nrequirements of the corresponding general zoning classification, and may prescribe\ndevelopment and design standards that are different from those set out in Article 9;\nprovided, that any request for a modification to a dimensional requirement or\ndevelopment and design standard that is less restrictive than would be applicable for\nthe underlying general zoning classification must be specifically described in any\nnotices required for the evidentiary hearing on the special use zoning permit\napplication, and must be set out separately in any Ordinance issuing said special use\nzoning permit, together with an explanation of the reason for the modification. Except\nas modified pursuant to this paragraph, all standards and requirements applicable to\nthe underlying general zoning district must be met. Variances, per Article 6 of this\nOrdinance, to the standards established by any special use permit shall not be\nallowed. Minor modifications per Sub-section 7.8-14 of this Article are eligible.\n7.8-11 Appeals. An appeal from the decision of the Coats Board of Adjustment regarding a\nspecial use application and Site Development Plan may be made by an aggrieved\nparty and shall be made to the Superior Court of the county in which the subject\nproperty is located in the nature of certiorari. Any such petition to the Superior Court\nshall be filed with the court no later than 30 days after a written copy of the decision\nof the Board of Adjustment is received by the applicant.\n7.8-12 Permit validity. Approval(s) of a special use zoning permit application and Site\nDevelopment Plan shall run with the land and constitute approval of a site-specific\nvesting plan in accordance with G.S. 160D-108(d) and be valid for a minimum of not\nless than two (2) years from the date of approval by the Coats Board of Adjustment.\nFailure to initiate construction, or otherwise begin the permitted use, within this time\nshall render the special use approval null and void. Multi-phased development of a\nspecial use project containing 25 acres or more remains vested for a period of seven\n(7) years from the time a site plan approval is granted as authorized in G.S. 160D-\n108(f).\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 7 - Page 13\n\n\nNEW PAGE 115\n7.8-13 Failure to Comply with Plans or Conditions. In the event of failure to comply with\nthe plans approved by the Board of Adjustment or with any other conditions imposed\nupon the special use zoning permit, the zoning permit shall thereupon immediately\nbecome void and of no effect. No building permits for further construction or\ncertificates of occupancy under this special use zoning permit shall be issued. If a\nfailure to comply with conditions in a special use zoning permit occurs after\noccupancy, the owner, lessee, or other responsible person shall be notified in writing\nof the violation. No earlier than five days after the receipt of the written notice, the\nbody issuing the special use zoning permit may issue a finding of fact that a violation\nof the requirements of this Ordinance exists. If such finding of fact is made, it shall be\nunlawful for any person, firm or corporation to continue the special use until the\nresponsible party makes the necessary corrections and the Board of Adjustment\nconducts an evidentiary hearing and finds that the violation no longer exists.\n7.8-14 Minor modifications. Minor modifications to the approved special use permit may be\napproved by the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator per authorization\nunder G.S. 160D-705(c). The minor modifications authorized herein are intended to\nprovide relief where conditions established by the special use permit create a hardship\nbased upon a unique physical attribute of the property itself or some other factor\nunique to the property which was not known at the time of special use permit\napproval and which has subsequently rendered the property difficult or impossible to\nuse due to the condition(s) imposed by the special use permit. The special use permit\nholder shall bear the burden of proof to secure the modification(s). Such\nmodifications shall be limited to the following:\n1. A deviation of up to ten percent or 24 inches, whichever is greater, from the\napproved setback, provided that the conditions for approving a deviation from the\nrequired setback established by Article 14 (Flexible Development Standards) of\nthis Ordinance are met.\n2. A reduction of up to 25 percent in the number of parking spaces required for the\nuse provided that the proposed development is located within 1/2 mile of either the\nMain Street District (MS) or the Mixed Use (MU-1 and MU-2) and on-street\nparking is available.\n3. Any other minor modification in accordance with the limitations and procedures\nprescribed in this Ordinance, unless restricted by G.S. 16D-703(b), or the special\nuse permit adopted pursuant to this section specifies otherwise.\nAny other modifications must be approved by the Board of Adjustment as an\namendment to the special use permit and may be referred to the Planning Board or\nPlanning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator as appropriate. The Planning, Zoning\n& Subdivision Administrator shall in every case have the discretion to decline to\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 7 - Page 14\n\n\nNEW PAGE 116\nexercise the power to approve or deny modifications as provided for herein, and may\nrequire the applicant to seek an amendment to the Special Use Permit.\n7.8-15 Special Use Permit recorded. Special Use Permits shall be recorded by the holder of\nthe permit with the Harnett County Register of Deeds within 60 days of approval.\nModifications to Special Use Permits shall be recorded in the same manner in which\nthe original permit was recorded.\n7.9\nUses Listed with Additional Standards\n7.9-1 Purpose. Uses listed with additional standards are uses permitted by right, provided\nthat the additional standards set forth in Section 10.1 of this Ordinance are met. The\nadditional standards are intended to ensure that the uses fit the intent of the zoning\ndistricts within which they are permitted, and that the uses are compatible with other\ndevelopment permitted within the zoning districts. Review and approval of these uses\nare the authority of the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator, who has no\ndiscretion to modify the additional standards.\n7.9-2 Plan submittal.\n(A.) Filing of application. An application for a zoning permit for a use with additional\nstandards may be filed by landowner, a lessee or person holding an option or contract\nto purchase or lease land, or by an authorized agent of the landowner. Where an agent\nfiles the application, the agent shall provide documentation that the owner of the\nproperty has authorized the filing of the application. The application for a zoning\npermit for a use with additional standards shall be filed with the Planning, Zoning &\nSubdivision Administrator on a form provided by the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision\nAdministrator.\n(B.) Information required. Each application for a zoning permit for a use with additional\nstandards shall contain all information required by the Planning, Zoning &\nSubdivision Administrator. The application shall be accompanied by a Site\nDevelopment Plan meeting the requirements for Site Development Plans as\nestablished by section 7.7 of this Ordinance.\n7.9-3\nStaff review. Notwithstanding the procedures applicable in section 7.7 of this\nOrdinance, the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator shall review the\nproposed use and determine if the additional standards for that use have been met.\nIf\nthe additional standards have been met, the use shall be approved provided all other\napplicable standards and procedures have been met. Failure to meet all the additional\nstandards shall result in denial of a zoning permit for the proposed use. The Planning,\nZoning & Subdivision Administrator shall approve or deny the proposed use with\nadditional standards or request more information, if needed, within ten (10) working\ndays of submittal.
