Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential Manufactured Home\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"RMH\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential Manufactured Home\n(RMH) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Residential Manufactured Home (RMH). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential Manufactured Home (RMH)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential Manufactured Home\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft).

RESIDENTIAL MANUFACTURED HOME (RMH) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\nThe Residential Manufactured Home (RMH) district is established as\na\nmeans of providing reasonable opportunities for the placement of\nmanufactured dwellings in the City's jurisdiction. The district\nprovides attainable housing opportunities for low and moderate-\nincome residents while at the same time establishing minimum\ndesign requirements for these uses to ensure a minimum level of\nquality and safety. The standards are intended to protect property\nvalues and preserve the character and integrity of the community or\nindividual neighborhoods within the community. In addition to\nmanufactured homes, the district also allows single-family detached\nresidential development and a very limited range of supporting\ninstitutional uses. Manufactured homes are subject to the use\nspecific standards in CHAPTER 4. USE STANDARDS.\nNOTES:\n[1] Site-built single-family detached residential dwellings may be developed at densities of 7 units an acre.\n[2] Site-built single-family detached residential dwellings may be developed on lots of 6,000 square feet.\n[3] Development in the WPO is subject to built-upon limits in Section 3.20.F, Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay\n(WPO) District.\n[4] Site-built single-family detached residential dwellings may be developed on lots with a width of 50 feet.\n[5] Open space set-aside requirements applied to subdivisions of five or more lots.\n[6] Open space set-aside shall be configured with at least 50 percent devoted to active recreation features in accordance\nwith Section 7.1, Open Space Set-Aside.\n[7] In cases where development is in a subdivision established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, no setback shall\nbe required to be greater than the average setback of existing residential structures on the same side of the block or within\na distance of 500 feet horizontally on either side when blocks are not present.\n[8] On corner lots of record, the street setback may be reduced by 50 percent on the long side of the lot.\n[9] 20 feet from an internal street.\n[10] Applied in lieu of side or rear setbacks in multi-building developments.\n[11] In accordance with the North Carolina Building Code.\n[12] Development in the AHO is subject to the maximum building heights in Section 3.20.B, Airport Height Overlay (AHO)\nDistrict.\nCity of Burlington\n3-47\nUnified Development Ordinance\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\nCELL (1, 1): \nB.
