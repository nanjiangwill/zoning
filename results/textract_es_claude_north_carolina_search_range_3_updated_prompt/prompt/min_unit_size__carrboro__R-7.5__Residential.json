Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-7.5\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential\n(R-7.5) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Residential (R-7.5). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential (R-7.5)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft).

Within this district, those\nuses indicated as permissible in the Table of Permissible Uses may be developed, but only if such\ndevelopments are owned and operated by the United States, the State of North Carolina, Orange\nCounty, the Town of Carrboro, or any agency, department, or subdivision of the foregoing\ngovernments.\nSection 15-139 Planned Unit Development District Established.\n(1)\nThere are hereby established sixty different Planned Unit Development (PUD) zoning\ndistricts as described in this section. Each PUD zoning district is designed to combine the\ncharacteristics of at least two and possibly three zoning districts. (AMENDED 2/24/87)\n(a)\nOne element of each PUD district shall be the residential element. Here there\nare six possibilities, each one corresponding to one of the following residential\ndistricts identified in Section 15-135: R-20, R-15, R-10, R-7.5, R-3, or\nR- S.I.R. Within that portion of the PUD zone that is developed for purposes\npermissible in a residential district, all development must be in accordance\nwith the regulations applicable to the residential zoning district to which the\nparticular PUD zoning district corresponds.\n(b)\nA second element of each PUD district shall be the commercial element. Here\nthere are five possibilities, each one corresponding to either the B-1(g), B-2,\nB-3, O, or O/A zoning districts established by Section 15-136. Within that\nportion of a PUD district that is developed for purposes permissible in a\ncommercial district, all development must be in accordance with the\nregulations applicable to the commercial district to which the PUD district\ncorresponds. (AMENDED 2/04/97)\n(c)\nA manufacturing/processing element may be a third element of any PUD\ndistrict. Here there are two alternatives. The first is that uses permitted within\nthe M-1 district would be permitted within the PUD district. The second\nalternative is that uses permitted only within the M-1 or M-2 zoning districts\nPage #8\n\n\nNEW PAGE 9\nArt. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\nwould not be permitted. If an M-1 element is included, then within that portion\nof the PUD district that is developed for purposes permissible in an M-1\ndistrict, all development must be in accordance with the regulations applicable\nto the M-1 district.\nThe sixty different PUD zoning districts are derived from the various combinations of possible\nalternatives within each of the three elements -- residential, commercial, manufacturing/processing.\nFor example, there is an R-20/B-1(g)/M-1 district, an R-20/B-2/M-1 district, an R-20/B-2 district, an\nR-15/B-1(g)/M-1 district, etc. (AMENDED 2/04/97)\n(2)\nNo area of less than twenty-five contiguous acres may be zoned as a Planned Unit\nDevelopment district, and then only upon the request of the owner or owners of all of the property\nintended to be covered by such zone.\n(3)\nAs indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses (Section 15-146), a planned unit\ndevelopment (use classification 28.000) is the only permissible use in a PUD zone, and planned unit\ndevelopments are permissible only in such zones.\nSection 15-140 Residential High Density and Commercial Overlay District.

The purpose of this district is to provide for the redevelopment of deteriorating commercial\nand manufacturing areas in a manner that is consistent with commercial development goals of the\ntown, namely, for compact, compressed town center growth, for a substantial increase in residential\nopportunities near the town center, and for mixed use development in the downtown. Property that\nlies within this overlay district may be developed in accordance with either the regulations applicable\nto the underlying district or the following regulations:\n(1)\nTo take advantage of provisions applicable to the RHDC overlay district, lots must\ncontain at least one and one half acres of contiguous land under single ownership.\n(2)\nUses permissible shall be those permissible within either the R-2 district or the B-1(c)\ndistrict, or both, except that subdivisions other than architecturally integrated\nsubdivisions shall not be allowed.\n(3)\nResidential density shall be determined as if the property were zoned R-2.\n(4)\nTwenty percent of the lot area shall remain as usable open space (see Section 15-198),\nexcept that where the development seeks to provide interior open space or indoor hard\ncourt, pool, or other active recreation facilities in excess of the basic requirement set\nforth in Article XIII, the permit-issuing authority may reduce the open space\nrequirement to reflect the quality and amount of such facilities.
