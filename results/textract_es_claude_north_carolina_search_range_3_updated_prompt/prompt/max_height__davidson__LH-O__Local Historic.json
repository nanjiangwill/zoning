Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Local Historic\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"LH-O\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Local Historic\n(LH-O) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Local Historic (LH-O). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Local Historic (LH-O)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Local Historic\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Building sites should be clustered in order to minimize their impact on the landscape\nand preserve views and historical features.\nH. Public Spaces\nPublic spaces are required or encouraged in mixed-use, commercial, or employment nodes\nbased upon the requirements of the specific planning area. The design and location of urban\nopen space on a site is important factor in a successful pedestrian environment. To ensure\nthat the open space is well-used, it is essential to locate and design it carefully in accordance\nwith the following general standards:\nUrban open spaces shall be fronted by streets and buildings to encourage its use\nand its safety.\nThe space shall be located where it is visible and easily accessible from homes and\npublic areas (building entrances, streets, sidewalks).\nThe space should be located to take views and sun exposure into account.\nThe space shall be well-buffered from moving cars so that users can enjoy and relax\nin the space.\nThe space shall be visible from streets or internal drives, but should not be wholly\nexposed to them.\nThe space shall be partially enclosed with building walls, freestanding walls,\nlandscaping, raised planters, or on-street parking to help buffer it and create a\ncomfortable \"outdoor room.\"\nSee Section 7, Parks and Open Space, for additional information.\nI. Exceptions\nExceptions from the site and building design standards established in this section may be\napproved by the Planning Director to preserve mature trees and natural features.\n4.3.2 GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPMENT OR REDEVELOPMENT IN EXISTING BUILDINGS\nThis section is intended to ensure the compatibility of infill development and redevelopment\nto surrounding neighborhoods and shall apply to new construction and the expansion of\nexisting buildings. As a means to provide guidance for the design of buildings that integrate\nwell into the context of Davidson, this section identifies the following key features necessary\nto ensure compatibility. When developing in the Village Infill Planning Area, in addition to\nthe standards below, see Section 2 for development in the Village Infill Overlay District.\nD. Street Frontage: Street trees should be preserved.\nE.\nRhythm of Development along the Street: Established building rhythms along\nstreet frontages should be continued. Larger buildings can be integrated into\nsmaller-scale neighbohrhoods by creating repetitive bays with facade articulation.\nF. Building Orientation: Main entrances, and other primary building fa\u00e7ade elements\nshould be oriented toward the street. Courtyard buildings should orient main\nentrances toward courtyards that open to the street and serve as a semi-public\nextension of the public realm.\nG. Front Setback Patterns: Established building setback patterns should be continued\nTown of Davidson, NC\nDAVIDSON PLANNING ORDINANCE\n4-5\n\n\nNEW PAGE 129\nSite\n&\nBuilding\nDesign Standards | 4.4 General Building Design Requirements\nas practical. Deep front setbacks can compromise the pedestrian realm.\nH. Building Form: Massing, proportion, scale, setbacks, spaces between buildings, and\ntheir relative positions should be used to integrate new development into existing\nstreetscapes.\nI.\nDensity: Density should increase closer to mixed use and commercial nodes.\nJ.\nBuilding Design: Buildings should be designed to respect the existing built\nenvironment, but not be explicit reproduction of past historical styles.\n4.4 GENERAL BUILDING DESIGN REQUIREMENTS\nThis section shall apply to all buildings, excluding the detached house, and accessory\nstructure building types. For requirements for these building types see Specific Building Type\nRequirements, Section 4.5.\n4.4.1 STANDARDS\nThe design of buildings should be complementary with prevalent architectural features\nof the surrounding neighborhood, especially in areas where patterns established by\nrecurring architectural features are well-documented and valued.\nA. Building Height\n1. Building height, as established in each respective planning area in Section 2, is\nmeasured as the number of stories in a building. A story is a habitable level in a\nbuilding.\n2. The following elements shall not be calculated as stories:\na. Under-roof areas less than seven feet clear height with dormers.\nb. Unoccupied residential attics less than seven feet above the leaves.\nC.\nRaised basements less than four feet exposed at the lowest grade at the front\nfa\u00e7ade.\nd. Mezzanines\n3.\nBuilding height is measured from the finished floor elevation of the fa\u00e7ade facing the\nstreet to the ridgeline or the highest point of the roof (where there is no ridgeline),\nexcluding chimneys and basements, excepting raised basements described above.\nUnless specifically stated elsewhere in this ordinance, the height requirements\nestablished in this ordinance shall not apply to:\na.\nBuilding elements (such as church spires, belfries, cupolas, domes, parapets, etc.)\nwhich are not intended for human occupancy;\nb. Mechanical penthouses which are set back at least 20 feet from the front\nelevation of the building.\n4.\nThis ordinance requires buildings, excluding detached and attached house building\ntypes, to be at least two stories. The following exceptions are permitted:\n4-6\nDAVIDSON PLANNING ORDINANCE\n07.01.21\n\n\nNEW PAGE 130\nSite & Building Design Standards | 4.4 General Building Design Requirements\na.

Conference centers over 10,000 square feet, civic buildings, workplace\nbuildings used in light manufacturing, sanctuaries, auditoriums, neighborhood\nclubhouses, and gymnasiums may be one-story without liner buildings with\nPlanning Director approval.\nB. Form and Massing\n1.\nFranchise architecture, where buildings are stylized in an attempt to use the building\nitself as advertising, is not permitted.\n2.\nFor large scale buildings, the front fa\u00e7ade shall create repetitive bays, or the fa\u00e7ade\nshall be divided into an asymmetrical, yet balanced, composition.\n3. Buildings on a corner or axial termini should be designed with additional height or\narchitectural embellishments to emphasize their location.\n4. Building design shall take the natural topography of the site into consideration.\nConstruction techniques shall be used to have the least amount of impact on\nsites with a slope greater than 15 percent. Examples of such techniques include\navoiding excessive cut and fill on site during construction, building into the slope\n(if topography permits), terracing the building and site improvements to match\ntopography as closely as possible, and controlling water runoff.\n5.\nStructured parking shall be screened in such a way that cars are not visible from the\nsidewalk in front of the building. Locating structured parking at the interior of the\nblock surrounded by buildings is the preferred method.\n6. Large scale single-use buildings, such as parking garages, athletic arenas, and big\nbox retail stores, shall be located behind two story liner buildings or above a one\nstory storefront. See section 4.4.1.A.4 for exceptions.\nC. Facade Articulation*\nAll building facades visible from a public street or park/open space shall have:\n1. A recognizable base, distinguished from the body of the building by features such\nas, but not limited to:\na. Thicker walls, ledges or sills;\nb. Visually heavier materials (such as brick, stone, tile or other masonry) than those\nused on the body of the building; and/or\nC. Lighter or darker colored materials, mullions, panels or planters.\n*Not applicable to Detached House, Townhouse, or Live/Work building types: 1.
