Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Watershed Protection Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"WP-O\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Watershed Protection Overlay\n(WP-O) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Watershed Protection Overlay (WP-O). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Watershed Protection Overlay (WP-O)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Watershed Protection Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Conditional zoning districts.\n3.5.1 Purpose.\nA.\nConditional zoning districts are created to correspond to each of the base zoning districts. Conditional\nZoning (CZ) Districts allow specific uses to be established in accordance with prescribed conditions\npertaining to an individual project.\nB.\nThe purpose is to provide a voluntary alternative procedure for the rezoning of a property for a specific\nuse. A broad range of uses are permitted in the base district. However, there are instances where a\nbase zoning district designation is clearly inappropriate for a property, but a specific use or uses\npermitted under this district and subject to development requirements would be consistent with the\nspirit and intent of this ordinance. Conditional zoning districts, herein established, are intended to\naccommodate such situations. This voluntary procedure is intended for firm development proposals,\nand is neither intended nor suited for securing early zoning for tentative uses which may not be\nundertaken for a long period of time.\nC.\nJust as there are nine base zoning districts, there are nine corresponding Conditional Zoning Districts.\n3.5.2 Applicability.\nA.\nProperty may be placed in a Conditional Zoning District only in response to a petition by the owners of\nall the property to be included.\nCreated: 2023-08-11 10:27:33 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 11, Update 1)\nPage 20 of 221\nCELL (1, 1): \nCZ OSR\nCELL (1, 2): \nConditional Zoning Open Space and Recreational\nCELL (2, 1): \nCZ RA-30\nCELL (2, 2): \nConditional Zoning Low Density Residential-Agricultura\nCELL (3, 1): \nCZ R-15\nCELL (3, 2): \nConditional Zoning Low to Medium Density Residential\nCELL (4, 1): \nCZ R-10\nCELL (4, 2): \nConditional Zoning Medium Density Residential\nCELL (5, 1): \nCZ R-6\nCELL (5, 2): \nConditional Zoning High Density Residential\nCELL (6, 1): \nCZ O&I\nCELL (6, 2): \nConditional Zoning Office & Institutional\nCELL (7, 1): \nCZ CB\nCELL (7, 2): \nConditional Zoning Central Business\nCELL (8, 1): \nCZ GC\nCELL (8, 2): \nConditional Zoning General Commercial\nCELL (9, 1): \nCZ CP\nCELL (9, 2): \nConditional Zoning Commerce Park\n\n\nNEW PAGE 21\nB.\nSpecific conditions applicable to these districts may be proposed by the petitioner or the town or its\nagencies, but only those conditions mutually approved by the town and the petitioner may be\nincorporated into the requirements of the district.

Overlay districts.\nOverlay zoning districts are established to provide land use regulations in addition to those created by the\nbase zoning districts herein. These overlay districts are implemented when necessary due to special circumstances.\nThere are two overlay zoning districts in Angier that provide for the protection of special environmental features of\nthe town, as follows:\n3.6.1 Watershed Protection Overlay (WP-O). The following regulations were adopted April 2005 in\naccordance with the state model ordinance:\n3.6.1.1 Intent.\nA.\nThe purpose of the Watershed Protection Overlay District is to prevent significant future water quality\ndeterioration in existing or potential future drinking water reservoirs and rivers that receive\nstormwater runoff form land within the Town of Angier. Protection of all water supplies within the\nstate, in accordance with minimum standards, was mandated by the Water Supply Watershed\nProtection Act passed by the General Assembly in 1989. The quality of water in drinking water\nreservoirs and rivers can be affected by human activities including farming, obstruction of highways\nand streets, subdivision development, industrial development, and other land disturbing activities.\nTypes of water pollutants resulting from these activities include sediment, bacterial contamination,\nheavy metals, synthetic organic compounds, and low-level radioactivity.\nB.\nThe intent of the Watershed Protection Overlay District is to apply a set of regulations involving land\nuse and, in some cases, structural Best Management Practices (BMP's) that protect the watersheds by\nreducing the pollution from future development that enters the drinking water supplies. Land use\nmanagement practices involve minimum lot sizes, maximum allowed density, and built-upon area\nrestrictions, since built-upon areas such as streets, rooftops, and driveways are a major source of\npollution. Structural Best Management Practices allow for more intensive land uses by providing for\ntemporary detention of stormwater runoff so that pollutants may settle.\nC.\nThe Watershed Protection Overlay District as hereby established overlay other zoning districts\nestablished in this ordinance. The new use of any land or new structure within the Watershed\nProtection Overlay District shall comply with the use regulations applicable to the underlying zoning\ndistrict as well as the requirements of the Watershed Protection Overlay District.\nCreated: 2023-08-11 10:27:33 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 11, Update 1)\nPage 21 of 221\nCELL (1, 1): \nWP-O\nCELL (1, 2): \nWatershed Protection Overlay\nCELL (2, 1): \nFDP-O\nCELL (2, 2): \nFlood Damage Prevention Overlay\n\n\nNEW PAGE 22\nD.\nA Watershed Protection Overlay District will be applied to the Town of Angier's portion of watersheds\nthat have been classified as WS-IV watersheds by the North Carolina Environmental Management\nCommission in its implementation of the Water Supply Watershed Protection Act of 1989. In\naccordance with the State Mandate, one (1) Watershed Protection Overlay District, as listed in the\nfollowing table, is hereby established.\n3.6.1.2 General. Pursuant to the requirements of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 143-214.5, one Watershed Protection\nOverlay District, as described in this ordinance, has been established for lands within the watersheds of\nexisting drinking water rivers. This district overlays other zoning districts established in this ordinance and\ndelineated on the Town of Angier Official Zoning Map. Wherever standards of the underlying zoning district\ndiffer from the watershed protection overlay standards, the more restrictive provisions shall apply.\n3.6.1.3 Applicability of watershed development standards. Only new development activities requiring\nan erosion/sedimentation control plan under State Code (NCAC, Chapter 4) or local government program\nand/or resulting in the disturbance of one acre or more of land area are required to comply with the\nwatershed protection requirements as specified in this section.\n3.6.1.4 Land use regulations. All uses and activities allowed in the underlying zoning districts are permitted with\nthe following exceptions:\n3.6.1.5 Density and built-upon area requirements under the low and high density options. Minimum and maximum\nresidential and nonresidential density and built-upon area limits shall be as indicated in the table below, or as\nrequired by the underlying zoning district, whichever is less.\nCreated: 2023-08-11 10:27:33 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 11, Update 1)\nPage 22 of 221\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nDISTRICT\nCELL (1, 3): \nGENERAL LOCATION\nCELL (2, 1): \nU-CAPE FEAR-PA\nCELL (2, 2): \nUpper Cape Fear\nRiver Protected\nWatershed Overlay District\nCELL (2, 3): \nThe portion of the drainage basin\nof the Cape Fear River located in\nthe Town of Angier's planning and\ndevelopment regulation\njurisdiction and draining to the\nTown of Lillington's water intake.\nCELL (1, 1): \nDISTRICT\nCELL (1, 2): \nLAND USE REGULATIONS\nCELL (2, 1): \nU-CAPE FEAR-PA\nCELL (2, 2): \nNew sites for land application of sludge/residuals or petroleum\ncontaminated soils are permitted.\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nNew nondischarging landfills are permitted.\nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \nNew discharging landfills are permitted.\nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nAgricultural activities are permitted and are subject to the provisions of\nthe Food Security Act of 1985 and the Food, Agriculture, Conservation,\nand Trade Act of 1990.\nCELL (6, 1): \nCELL (6, 2): \nSilviculture activities are permitted and subject to the provisions of the\nForest Practices Guidelines Related to Water Quality (15 NCAC 11.0101-\n.0209.\nCELL (1, 1): \nDISTRICT\nCELL (1, 2): \nDEVELOPMENT\nTYPE\nCELL (1, 3): \nMAXIMUM\nDENSITY/BUILT-\nUPON AREA\nCELL (2, 1): \nU-CAPE\nFEAR-CA\nCELL (2, 2): \nSingle-Family\nDevelopment\nCELL (2, 3): \nLow Density\nOption\n\n\nNEW PAGE 23\nCreated: 2023-08-11 10:27:33 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 11, Update 1)\nPage 23 of 221\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \n20,000 square\nfoot (0.45 acre)\nminimum lot\nsize with curb\nand gutter,\nAND\n30' stream\nbuffers along\nperennial\nstreams,\nOR\n24 percent\nbuilt-upon area\nwith curb and\ngutters,\nAND\n30' stream\nbuffers along\nperennial\nstreams,\nOR\n14,000 square\nfoot (0.32 acre)\nminimum lot\nsize without\ncurb and\ngutter,\nAND\n30' stream\nbuffers along\nperennial\nstreams,\nOR\n36 percent\nbuilt-upon area\nwithout curb\nand gutter,\nAND\n30' stream\nbuffers along\nperennial\nstreams.\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nHigh Density\nOption\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (3, 3): \nOn-site\ninfiltration of\n\n\nNEW PAGE 24\nCreated: 2023-08-11 10:27:33 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 11, Update 1)\nPage 24 of 221\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nthe first inch of\nstormwater\nrunoff required\nwhere density\nexceeds 2\ndwelling units\nper 40,000\nsquare feet (.92\nacre), or 24\npercent built-\nupon area (with\ncurb and\ngutter), or 3\ndwelling units\nper 40,000\nsquare feet (.92\nacre) or 36\npercent built-\nupon area\n(without curb\nand gutter),\nAND\n70 percent\nbuilt-upon\narea,\nAND\n100' stream\nbuffers along\nperennial\nstreams.\nCELL (2, 1): \nU-CAPE\nFEAR-CA\n(continued)\nCELL (2, 2): \nOther\nResidential\nand\nNonresidential\nDevelopment\nCELL (2, 3): \nLow Density\nOption\n24 percent\nbuilt-upon area\nwith curb and\ngutter,\nAND\n30' stream\nbuffers along\nperennial\nstreams,\nOR\n36 percent\nbuilt-upon area\nwithout curb\nand gutter,\n\nNEW PAGE 218\nReference level.
