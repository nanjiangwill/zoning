Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Medium Density Residential-Limited Use\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MDR-LU\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Medium Density Residential-Limited Use\n(MDR-LU) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Medium Density Residential-Limited Use (MDR-LU). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Medium Density Residential-Limited Use (MDR-LU)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Medium Density Residential-Limited Use\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

DETERMINATION OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP BOUNDARIES\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\nThe Planning Director shall be responsible for determination of boundaries on the Official Zoning Map in\naccordance with the standards in Section 2.4.F, Determination, and the following standards:\n1. Boundaries shown as approximately following a utility line or a street, alley, railroad, or other public\naccessway shall be interpreted as following the centerline of the right-of-way or easement for\nthe\nutility line or accessway.\n2. If a street, alley, railroad, or utility easement forming the boundary between two separate zoning\ndistricts is abandoned or removed from dedication, the district boundaries shall be construed as\nfollowing the centerline of the abandoned or vacated roadbed or utility easement.\n3. Boundaries shown as approximately following a lot line shall be interpreted as following the lot line as\nit existed when the boundary was established. If a subsequent minor adjustment (such as from\nsettlement of a boundary dispute or overlap) results in the lot line moving 10 feet or less, the zoning\nboundary shall be interpreted as moving with the lot line.\n4. Boundaries shown as approximately following a river, stream, canal, lake, or other watercourse shall\nbe interpreted as following the centerline of the watercourse as it actually exists, and as moving with\nthat centerline to the extent the watercourse moves as a result of natural processes (flooding, erosion,\nsedimentation, etc.).\n5. Boundaries shown parallel to or as extensions of features indicated in this subsection shall be\ninterpreted as such.\n6. Boundaries shown as following the boundary of the City limits shall be interpreted as following the\nboundary of municipal incorporation.\n7. Wherever a single lot is located within two or more different zoning districts, each portion of the lot\nshall be subject to all the regulations applicable to the zoning district where it is located.\n8.\nIf the specific location of a depicted boundary cannot be determined from application of the above\nstandards, it shall be determined by using the Official Zoning Map's scale to determine the boundary's\ndistance from other features shown on the map.\n9. Where the actual location of existing physical or natural features vary from that shown on the Official\nZoning Map, or in other circumstances that are not covered by this subsection, the Planning Director\nshall have the authority to determine the district boundaries.\nCity of Burlington\n3-7\nUnified Development Ordinance\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\n\n Output:"}]}
