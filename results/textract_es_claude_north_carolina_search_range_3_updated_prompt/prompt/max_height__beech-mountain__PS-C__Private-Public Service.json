Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Private-Public Service\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"PS-C\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Private-Public Service\n(PS-C) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Private-Public Service (PS-C). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Private-Public Service (PS-C)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Private-Public Service\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Floor-to-ceiling windows greater than one story are prohibited.\nC.\nGlass block visible from the main thoroughfare on which the parcel is situated is\nprohibited.\nd. Reflective glass is prohibited.\n(F) Building entrance. Every building shall have a well-defined entrance visible from the main\nthoroughfare on which the parcel is situated (e.g., If the parcel on which the building is situated has\nfrontage on Beech Mountain Parkway, the entrance shall be visible from Beech Mountain\nParkway). These entrances may be covered porches or other architectural amenities that convey\nan impression of welcome and openness.\n(G) Color.

Due to above-ground utilities, the\ntown may require the use of ornamental trees in place of large shade trees.\nb. Inclusion of existing trees in the landscape design is encouraged. Shrubbery, ground\ncover, and other planting materials shall be used to compliment the tree planting. No area of the\nstreet yard may be exposed soil, but instead shall be covered with vegetation, whether grass or\nshrubbery. The only area that shall remain uncovered is the six-foot radius surrounding the trunk of\nany tree; however, this area shall be mulched.\n(2) Existing vegetation. Existing trees and vegetation, other than exotic, non-native species,\nmay count toward meeting the requirements of this section, when such vegetation is in good\ncondition, is properly protected during development, and helps to further the purpose of the district.\nExisting vegetation that is used to meet the standards of this section shall be maintained or\nreplaced if it dies during the first year after the completion of the development.\n(3) New plant material. Regionally grown and native species of plants are preferred. Any plant\nlisted with the Agricultural Extension Office as a native plant shall be considered to be a native\nplant for these purposes. New plant material shall complement existing site vegetation, should be\nmixed with it and should be integrated with all other natural site features.\n(I) Parking lots; parking lot yards. The purpose of this section is to ensure that the Commercial\nThoroughfare Overlay District of Beech Mountain is an attractive and appealing place for residents\nand visitors. This often means that a higher priority must be placed upon being an attractive and\nfunctional place for people than being convenient for automobiles.\n(1) Parking location. Parking is encouraged to be located to the rear or sides of buildings, with\nthe building fronting on the public way. However, nothing in this section is to prevent the\nestablishment of parking in front of a building so long as the project adheres to all other relevant\nregulations. When parking is to be established in front of buildings, it is recommended that the\napplicant create and utilize on-street parking if such is approved by the NCDOT and/or the town.\n(For the purposes of this section, ON-STREET PARKING is defined as a parking area without a\ndivider between the street and the parking area, in which automobiles directly access the parking\nspaces from the road. On-street parking may be parallel, angled or straight in, as approved by the\nNCDOT and the town.)\n(J) Buffer yards. The purpose of the buffer yard is to provide a transitional area between uses\nthat may differ in development intensity and density. A BUFFER YARD is defined as a planting yard\nthat serves as a visual separation between uses and should be densely planted. No buildings,\nparking areas or other development may encroach within the buffer yard, with the exception of\ntown-approved public walkways or sidewalks. Refer to \u00a7 154.165 for the standards for buffer yards.\n(Ord. 2014-05, passed 12-9-2014; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\u00a7 154.130 ZONING AFFECTS EVERY BUILDING AND USE.\nNo building or land shall hereafter be used and no building or part thereof shall be erected,\nmoved or altered except in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district in which\nit\nis located, except as provided in this chapter.\n(1989 Code, Title V, Ch. 51, Art.
