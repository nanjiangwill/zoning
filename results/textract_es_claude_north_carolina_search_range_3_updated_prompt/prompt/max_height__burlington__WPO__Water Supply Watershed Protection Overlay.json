Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"WPO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay\n(WPO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay (WPO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay (WPO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

GENERAL BUSINESS (GB) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe General Business (GB) district is the primary district intended to serve\nretail, business, and service uses in the City and is found along major\narterial streets, interstate interchanges, and on blocks surrounding the\ncentral business district. Development in the GB district tends to be\nautomobile oriented and comprised of a mix of individual buildings on\nindividual sites and multi-tenant or multi-building developments located\nnear major roadway intersections. In addition to commercial uses, the\ndistrict also accommodates wholesale sales, warehousing uses, and a very\nwide range of institutional uses. Limited forms of residential use are\nallowed, such as upper-story residential and multi-family development.\nUses in the district are subject to standards intended to ensure development\nis compatible with adjacent residential neighborhoods, ensure that the\ntraffic carrying capacity along the City's major roadways is not impaired due\nto unsafe turning movements, and that development is well landscaped and\naesthetically pleasing. In order to maintain compatibility with surrounding\nuses and ensure a high quality of development, all activities, including\nstorage shall be indoors or be fully screened from view from the street or\nfrom lands in lower-intensity zoning districts.\nB.

The district allows\na wide range of housing types, including duplexes, triplexes, quadraplexes, upper-\nstory residential, single-family attached, and single-family detached dwellings. The\ndistrict also allows pocket neighborhoods and bungalow courts. As a means of\ncreating compact, functional neighborhoods, the district also allows a wide variety\nof\ninstitutional uses, including community centers, day care, schools, assisted living,\nreligious institutions, parks, and utilities. Mixed use development is also allowed in\nlocations where negative impacts can be minimized. Proximity and access to transit\nfacilities and alternative forms of transportation are vital in this district. Low density\ndevelopment comprised of uniform building types or styles is discouraged.\nB.

LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (LDR) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Low Density Residential (LDR) district is established to\naccommodate low density residential development and\ncomplimentary uses in rural and suburban settings throughout\nthe City's jurisdiction. Use of the conservation subdivision\nconfiguration is optional for residential subdivisions of five lots\nor more. While the district allows single-family detached\nhomes, manufactured homes in park-style developments or on\nindividual lots are prohibited. The district accommodates\nequestrian uses, utilities, as well as various neighborhood-\nsupporting institutional uses such as parks, schools, and public\nsafety facilities. District regulations discourage uses that\ninterfere with the development of residential neighborhoods or\nthat are detrimental to the suburban nature of the district.\nConservation subdivisions have reduced dimensional\nrequirements but must retain at least 50 percent of the\ndevelopment area as open space set-aside.\nB.
