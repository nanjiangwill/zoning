Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Planned Unit Development\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"PUD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Planned Unit Development\n(PUD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Planned Unit Development (PUD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Planned Unit Development (PUD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Planned Unit Development\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 74\nArticle 4 Zoning Districts\n4.5 Commercial Zoning Districts\n4.5.4.\nSpecial Standards in the PUD Zoning District\nD.\nOpen Space\nOpen space requirements for the residential portion of a multifamily or mixed commercial-residential\nproject shall be the same and conform to the requirements for multifamily developments in the MR-\n4-12\nCELL (1, 1):\nUse\nCELL (1, 2):\nDistrict\nCELL (1, 3):\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 4):\nMinimum\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 5):\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 6):\nMinimum\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 7):\nCELL (1, 8):\nYard\n(ft.)\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (2, 1):\nCELL (2, 2):\nCELL (2, 3):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 4):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 5):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 6):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 7):\nFront\nCELL (2, 8):\nRear\nCELL (2, 9):\nSide\nCELL (3, 1):\nAll residential, except\nCELL (3, 2):\nPUD\nCELL (3, 3):\n60\nCELL (3, 4):\n60\nCELL (3, 5):\n6,000\nCELL (3, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (3, 7):\n25\u00b3\nCELL (3, 8):\n63\nCELL (3, 9):\n51,2\nCELL (4, 1):\nmultifamily\nCELL (4, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (4, 3):\n75\nCELL (4, 4):\n75\nCELL (4, 5):\n7,500\nCELL (4, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (4, 7):\n253\nCELL (4, 8):\n253\nCELL (4, 9):\n102\nCELL (5, 1):\nMultifamily/ Mixed\nCELL (5, 2):\nPUD\nCELL (5, 3):\n100\nCELL (5, 4):\n150\nCELL (5, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (5, 6):\n15,000\nCELL (5, 7):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 8):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 9):\nCELL (6, 1):\ncommercial- residential\nCELL (6, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (6, 3):\n100\nCELL (6, 4):\n100\nCELL (6, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (6, 6):\n7,000\nCELL (6, 7):\nCELL (6, 8):\nCELL (6, 9):\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"CELL (2, 5):\\nWith\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 5):\\n6,000\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (2, 6):\\nWithout\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 6):\\n10,000\" 74]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"For district PUD, the section provides the information for min_unit_size.

The owner or developer is also responsible for providing and\nmaintaining the required buffer yard and screening. If the replacement of screening\nmaterial becomes necessary to continue its effectiveness, the owner or developer\nis\nresponsible for such replacement.\n2) When screening for outdoor storage is required, the owner, developer, tenant, or occupant\nshall be required to submit a buffer yard plan to the Planning and Inspections Department\nand to install and maintain the required buffer yard and screening.\n3)\nThe owner of a subdivision or PUD may either submit a buffer yard plan for each lot or\none for the entire subdivision or PUD. Should one plan be submitted for the entire\nsubdivision or PUD, the owner or developer may either install the entire buffer yard at\nonce or install the buffer yard for each phase of construction in conjunction with the\nbuilding permit issuance for the phase.\nI) Maintenance of a Buffer Yard.\n1) Vegetation.\nThe property owner, developer, tenant, and occupant shall be jointly and severally\nresponsible for maintaining all vegetation required by this section in a healthy condition\nand as set forth in section N of this section.\n2) Fencing.\nNo fence shall have more than twenty percent (20%) of its surface area covered with\ndisfigured, racked or missing materials, or peeling paint. No fence shall be allowed to\nremain with bent or broken supports or be allowed to stand more than fifteen degrees\n(15\u00b0) away from the perpendicular. Support structures of the fence/wall, other than those\nused to enhance its appearance, shall be seen, if at all, by the use responsible for building\nand maintaining the buffer and not by the adjacent use. Replacement or repair of fencing\nshall occur upon written notification from the zoning administrator within a period of no\nmore than thirty successive days.\n3) Pruning.\nPruning shall follow the guidelines set in section 14 of this Ordinance and shall not\ncompromise the minimum height requirements at the time of the original planting.\nJ) Requirements for Refuse Collection Areas.\n1)\nScreening/buffering is required for all refuse collection areas designed for commercial\nuse. A location for refuse collection shall be shown on all site plans. An area specifically\ndesignated for recycling is strongly recommended and in some cases required per North\nCarolina General Statutes.\n2) If a refuse collection area is provided for unmanned uses (e.g. cemeteries or public or\nprivate utilities such as power, water, or communication facilities) which do not generate\na lot of refuse, the requirements of this section shall apply.\n3) Refuse collection areas shall be screened on three sides by an opaque fence or wall SO it\nis not visible from any surrounding properties or streets. In rare circumstances where site\nconditions support the refuse collection area(s) facing a right of way, the fourth side\nwould require screening/buffering in the form of an opaque gate (chain link fencing is\nprohibited). Collection areas shall be designed SO waste removal trucks can easily access\nthe waste containers.\n184\n\n\nNEW PAGE 209\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\n4) Refuse collection areas shall be set back at least five feet (5') from the side and rear\nproperty line and shall not be closer to any street right of way than the wall(s) of the\nprimary structure.\n5) Refuse collection areas shall be constructed to Town standards. If more than one\ncontainer is needed, the collection area shall be based on the detail multiplied by the\nnumber of containers needed.\n6) Refuse collection areas which serve restaurants or other such uses as determined\nnecessary, shall drain into the sanitary sewer through a grease trap or other approved\nmethod as deemed appropriate by the Town's Public Works Department.\n7) Any modifications to existing refuse collection areas shall comply with the requirements\nof this section.\n8) Due to the particularities of any given development, the Board of Commissioners (BOC)\nrecognizes the inflexible application of this section may result in a development which is\nunable to fully comply with the standards set forth herein. Therefore, the Town may grant\nflexibility when an existing development has insufficient land available, an unsafe\ncondition would be created, or other extenuating circumstances exist. Whenever\nflexibility is granted, the reasons for granting the flexibility shall be documented and the\nTown may impose specific conditions to any flexibility granted.\nK) Plant Materials Used in Buffer Yards.\nTrees and planting material shall follow the standards in section 14 of this Ordinance. A list\nof recommended shrubs and trees may be found in Appendix A of this Ordinance.\nRecommendations for buffer yard material, other than those listed in Appendix A, may be\nobtained from the town planner.\nL) Further Buffer Yard Requirements.\nThe following requirements shall be followed as well as the standards and requirements found\nin section 14 of this Ordinance:\n1) Seeding.\nAll buffer yard areas which are not landscaped shall be seeded or sodded with lawn or\nplanted with ground cover unless the lawn or ground cover is already established.\n2) Encroachment.\nAmong other things, buffer yards may not be encroached upon by vehicular areas (except\ncommon access drives), buildings, exterior storage, dumpsters, or mechanical equipment\nunless otherwise provided. Encroachment by storm water detention ponds may occur\nsubject to the approval of the Town of Beaufort. Any plant materials placed within storm\nwater storage areas shall be of a variety which will survive periodic flooding.\n3) \"Type C\" Screening/Buffering for Outdoor Storage.\nPrior to the installation of a \"type C\" screen/buffer yard for outdoor storage (requirements\nfor \"type C\" are in subsection C-3 of this section), a buffer yard plan to include the area\nof the storage area(s) and the specific type of fence and plantings shall be submitted to\nthe zoning administrator for approval. Plans submitted shall follow the guidelines set in\nsubsection M of this section.\nNo certificate of compliance for any new construction or new renovation shall be\napproved by the Town's Planning and Inspections Department until the required\nscreening/buffering is installed in accordance with the approved plan.\n4) Recreational Use.\n185\n\n\nNEW PAGE 210\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\nA buffer yard may be used for passive recreation; it may contain pedestrian or bike trails,\nprovided:\na) No plant material is eliminated;\nb) The total width of the buffer yard is maintained; and\nc) All other regulations of this Ordinance are met. In no event shall active recreational\nuses such as playing fields, swimming pools, or tennis courts be permitted in buffer\nyards.\n5) Easement.\nNo vegetative screening/buffering or barrier required by this section shall be planted on\nproperty subject to utility or drainage easements without the consent of the Public Works\nDepartment and the easement holder.\n6) Future Rights-of-Way Expansion.\nRequired landscaping materials, fencing, and berms shall not encroach within projected\nfuture thoroughfare rights-of-way.\n7) Solid Wall.\nA stand-alone wall of solid construction (wood, masonry, etc.) which is without openings,\naccesses, protrusions, lighting, mechanical equipment, etc., may be used to satisfy the\nfencing requirements of this section along those areas where the building exists. There\nshall be no breaks or separations between fencing and building walls along property lines\nwhere a combination of fencing and building walls are used to satisfy the requirements\nof this section.\nM) Buffer Yard Plan.\n1) A buffer yard plan shall be required if an expansion involves new construction of five\nthousand square feet (5000 ft2 or more in gross floor area; or entails a twenty percent\n(20%) or greater increase in existing gross floor area and results in a building or\ncombination of buildings of five thousand square feet (5000 ft2) or more in gross floor\narea.\n2) Prior to the issuance of a building permit, an applicant must propose and receive approval\nfor a buffer yard plan. Buffer yard plans shall require approval by the Planning and\nInspections Department and recommendations on the proposed buffer yard material may\nbe obtained from the town planner.\nA screening/buffering plan may be prepared by the applicant but does not have to be\nprepared by a licensed surveyor, landscape architect, etc. The purpose of the plan is to\navoid any misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the requirements before the applicant\nspends any time or money on the installation of the buffer yard. The buffer yard plan\nmust be drawn to scale and shall indicate the following information:\na) Screening/buffering required as outlined in subsection C of this section;\nb) Existing and proposed buildings, drives, parking areas, exterior storage areas,\ndumpsters, storm water detention areas (if applicable), accessory structures (if\napplicable), and private and public utility easements;\nc) Location of existing and proposed planting areas and type of vegetation which will\nbe used to comply with the buffer yard requirements including the species identified\nby common and scientific name, height at maturity, DBH (the single stem trees only)\nat maturity, and spacing of all vegetation;\n186\n\n\n Output:"}]}
