Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential-Agricultural\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-A-C\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential-Agricultural\n(R-A-C) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Residential-Agricultural (R-A-C). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential-Agricultural (R-A-C)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential-Agricultural\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_lot_size is typically between 1,000 and 2,000,000 sq ft or 0.02 and 50 acres. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 11\n\nR-A-C Zone\n\nCELL (2, 1):\nField\nCELL (2, 2):\nValue\nCELL (3, 1):\nmin_lot_size\nCELL (3, 2):\n123456 sq ft\nCELL (4, 1):\nApartment Area\nCELL (4, 2):\n10,000\n\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"CELL (3, 2):\\n123456 sq ft\", 11]],\n    \"rationale\": \"The cell that corresponds to the value for min_lot_size in this table has this answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"123456 sq ft\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 32\n\nSection 6.3 Industrial Area & Dimensional Requirements\n1 Public Sewer or Public Water\n2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\n3 For proposed warehouse/manufacturing uses 35%, for all other uses 25%, subject to\nCommission's authority to permit greater coverage based on landscape, architectural design\nand site development elements that exceed minimum standard of the Regulation\n4\nShall be in addition to requirements of 8.1.2 Landscaping and Buffers\n6-4\n\nCELL (1, 1):\nCELL (1, 2):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 3):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 4):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 5):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 6):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 7):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 8):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (1, 10):\nCELL (2, 1):\nZone\nCELL (2, 2):\nMin\nArea\nCELL (2, 3):\nMin\nWidth\nCELL (2, 4):\nMin\nDepth\nCELL (2, 5):\nMax\nStories\nCELL (2, 6):\nMax\nHeight\nCELL (2, 7):\nMax % Lot\nCoverage\nCELL (2, 8):\nMin\nFront\nYard\nCELL (2, 9):\nMin\nSide\nYard\nCELL (2, 10):\nMin\nRear\nYard\nCELL (3, 1):\nI\nCELL (3, 2):\n20,000\nsq. ft.\nCELL (3, 3):\n100'\nCELL (3, 4):\n100'\nCELL (3, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (3, 6):\n50'\nCELL (3, 7):\nN/A\nCELL (3, 8):\n25'\nCELL (3, 9):\n20'\nCELL (3, 10):\n20'\nCELL (4, 1):\nR-A-C\nCELL (4, 2):\n40,000\nsq. ft. 1\nCELL (4, 3):\n150'\nCELL (4, 4):\n150'\nCELL (4, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (4, 6):\n50'\nCELL (4, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (4, 8):\n50'\nCELL (4, 9):\n20'\nCELL (4, 10):\n20'\nCELL (5, 1):\nR-A-C\nCELL (5, 2):\n60,000\nsq. ft. 2\nCELL (5, 3):\n200'\nCELL (5, 4):\n200'\nCELL (5, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (5, 6):\n50'\nCELL (5, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (5, 8):\n50'\nCELL (5, 9):\n20'\nCELL (5, 10):\n20'4\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"1 Public Sewer or Public Water\", 32],\n        [\"2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\", 32],\n        [\"CELL (4, 2): \\n40,000\\nsq. ft.\", 32],\n        [\"CELL (5, 2): \\n60,000\\nsq. ft.\", 32]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"From this page we can infer that the value is conditional on the presence of a public sewer or water system, and there are two different values for the current zone, depending on that.\",\n    \"answer\": \"40,000 sq ft (if public water or sewer); 60,000 sq ft (otherwise)\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 66\n\nR-A-C Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 123 sq ft, side length is 10 ft\n\nNEW PAGE 67\n\nR-A-C Zone - Senior Active Overlay\n\nmin_lot_size is 1523 sq ft\n\nDKEWKWKDS Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 20,000 sq ft\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"min_lot_size is 123 sq ft\", 66]],\n    \"rationale\": \"The section titled R-A-C says the answer explicitly.

Some land uses are of such a\nnature and scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediate area and on the entire\ncommunity, which cannot be predetermined and controlled by the standards of a general use district. In\naddition, this process will ensure compatibility with the Town's Land Use Plan and other adopted plans.

The purpose of the Planned Residential Conditional District (PR-CD) is to encourage the\ndevelopment of environments which provide certain development privileges in exchange for\npreplanning and design considerations. The PR-CD provides an alternative to conventional\nsubdivision design by promoting the conservation and creation of viable, connected open space\nand more flexible lot design options while minimizing development costs. The Planned Residential\nConditional District (PR-CD) provides flexibility in utilizing new development concepts, including\nthe incorporation of a limited amount of non-residential uses. In return for development\nflexibility, additional site plan information and development conditions may be required of the\ndeveloper to assist in evaluating the suitability of a proposed PR-CD. While maximum open space\npreservation and high-quality residential development is the primary goal of PR-CDs, open space\nwithin PR-CDs must balance the need for open space preservation with an increased need for\nintegration with surrounding developments through street connectivity and compatibility with\nadjacent and internal land uses.\n(B) Minimum Size. A PR-CD shall be located on a site containing at least five (5) contiguous acres.\n(C)\nabout:blank\n59/167\n\nNEW PAGE 60\n6/3/24, 7:55 PM\nDobson, NC Code of Ordinances\nPre-Application Conference Required. Prior to the formal submission of a proposed PR-CD, the petitioner or\ntheir representative shall attend a pre-application conference with the Town's planning staff concerning the\nproposed development of the site. The petitioner shall be required to produce a scaled sketch site plan\nshowing the existing cultural, historic, and physical features of the site for review by the planning staff as\nwell as conditions the developer proposes to incorporate into the development. Staff may ask for additional\ninformation such as the location of prime agricultural soils, historical structures, archeological/cultural\nelements, the depth of viewshed as seen from existing public rights-of-way, the location of \"unique\"\nfeatures on the site, and the location and general specifications of any existing and proposed water/sewer\ninfrastructure.\nThe Town's Planning Staff in consultation with other departments shall comment on the site plan within\n15 days. The official plan of the PR-CD shall be submitted for review by the Planning and Zoning Board and\nthe Board of Commissioners only after the completion of the pre-application conference and the written\nresponse.\n(D) Permitted Principal Uses. PR-CDs do not have any inherent permitted or conditional uses and\ndevelopment activities are only allowed through specific conditions approved by the Board of\nCommissioners; however PR-CDs are primarily intended for single-family developments. A\nmaximum of ten percent (10%) of the total land of the development may be utilized for non-\nresidential uses. The compatibility and appropriateness of any non-residential uses proposed\nshall be carefully considered. Those uses permitted and conditions approved by the Board of\nCommissioners shall be reflected on the Conditional Zoning District Supplement issued by the\nZoning Enforcement Officer.\n(E) Relationship to Other Applicable Regulations. A PR-CD shall be subject to all applicable standards,\nprocedures, and regulations of this Ordinance unless otherwise set forth in this section.\n(F) Maximum Density. Maximum residential density shall be calculated based on the existing zoning\ndistrict the proposed PR-CD is located in. All land proposed for non-residential development shall\nbe excluded from density calculations. If all of the PR-CD or a portion of the PR-CD is unable to be\nserved by public water and sewer, minimum lot sizes and maximum density shall be determined\nin consultation with the Surry County Health Department.\n(G) Development Standards. A PR-CD shall meet the following standards:\n(1) Outside Perimeter Lot Setback Requirements. Any lot which adjoins the outside boundary of\nthe PR-CD shall be considered an outside perimeter lot. Internal street refers to a street that\nis within the boundary of the PR-CD. Adjoining street is a street which is not located within the\nPR-CD but is adjacent to the outside boundary of the PR-CD. The following setbacks shall be\nrequired for outside perimeter lots:\n(a) Lots with Access on an Internal Street.
