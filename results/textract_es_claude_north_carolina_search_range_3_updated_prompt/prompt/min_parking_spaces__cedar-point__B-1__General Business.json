Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"General Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"B-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If General Business\n(B-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor General Business (B-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"General Business (B-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"General Business\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

APPLICABILITY\nEvery applicant for a Site Plan Approval for residential and/or non-residential\nPage I 177\n\n\nNEW PAGE 178\npurposes involving the creation of multiple lots from a parent parcel shall be required\nto dedicate a portion of the parcel for the purpose of preserving open space, and to\npreserve significant natural features and/or cultural resources.\nC. DEDICATION REQUIREMENTS\n1. The applicant shall provide land for open space within the proposed development\nas required in Section 7.6 of this ordinance.\n2. Open space shall be accessible to all lots in the development through a\ncombination of direct access to the street and sidewalks, walkways or connecting\npaths.\n3. Land preserved for the purpose described in this section, shall only be eligible for\nfull credit towards the minimum open space requirement if it is an integral part of\nthe development. If the entire preserved area is located on the periphery of the\ndevelopment, the area shall only be credited for a maximum fifty (50) percent of\nthe required open space. The purpose of this limit is to ensure open space is not\nisolated but is an integral part of the development.\nD. PERMITTED USES WITHIN OPEN SPACE:\nOpen spaces required in this chapter may be used only as specified and as follows:\n1. Buffers required in Section 7.3, BUFFERS\n2. Undeveloped land without a designated purpose held by a property owners\nassociation or non-profit conservation entity\nE. PROHIBITED USES WITHIN OPEN SPACE:\nRequired open spaces may not be used for any of the following:\n1. Storm water management ponds, swales, conveyances, and treatment areas\n2. Recreation space (except as allowed in subsection F.1., below)\n3. Reserved rights of way\n4. Utility, drainage, or access easements\n5. Any land held in private ownership rather than commonly held by a property\nowners association or non-profit conservation entity\nF.\nADDITIONAL PERMITTED USES WITHIN OPEN SPACE AREAS\n1. Open space has no purpose that requires the construction of structures or\nmodification of the existing landscape or grade. An applicant may propose fences,\ncommunity gardens, and passive uses including walking trails, available to the\npublic or restricted to occupants of the development, at the time of development\nreview. The applicant shall construct any trails proposed, which may count toward\na recreational requirement in Section 7.6.D.4.(b).\n2. Utility easements may cross common open space, if necessary, to connect to the\narea network. To the maximum extent practicable, utility easement intersections\nwith open space shall be perpendicular to minimize land disturbance. In no case\nshall a utility easement run parallel with an area of common open space for a length\nof more than 50 feet without specific authorization by the permit issuing authority\nand a plan for mitigating the impact of the disturbance on the intent of the open\nspace.\n3. Design Requirements\nAll residential developments shall provide walkways connecting residences and\nPage I 178\n\n\nNEW PAGE 179\nopen or common areas. This may be accomplished with sidewalks along street\nfrontages or walkways through recorded access or utility easements.\nG. LAND CHARACTERISTICS\n1. To prevent open space from becoming a nuisance, all open space within a\ndevelopment shall be accessible from a public right of way.\n2. Open space shall be arranged to have both contiguity and connectivity within the\ndevelopment that is dedicating the open space and to any surrounding dedicated\nopen space. For the purposes of this paragraph, contiguity shall mean that the\nparcel being offered as open space is of sufficient area to be meaningful in\nachieving the intent of open space and connectivity shall mean that the parcel\nbeing offered as open space shall be located SO that a person or wildlife can move\nbetween open space parcels without traveling across private property or along a\npublic road or sidewalk.\n7.13\nOFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS.\nA. INTENT\nIn order to assure a proper and uniform development of public parking areas\nthroughout the Town of Cedar Point, to relieve traffic congestion in the streets and\nto minimize any detrimental effects of off-street parking areas on adjacent properties,\nthe procedures and standards set forth in this section will apply.\nB.

A standard parking space must have minimum dimensions of 10 feet in width and\n20 feet in length. This area does not include any passageways and driveways used\nfor access to the space or spaces.\n2. Required off-street parking spaces and loading spaces are permanent areas and\nshall not be used for any other above ground purpose.\n3. Sufficient maneuvering space shall be provided SO that no vehicle will be required\nto back into the public right-of-way.\n4.
