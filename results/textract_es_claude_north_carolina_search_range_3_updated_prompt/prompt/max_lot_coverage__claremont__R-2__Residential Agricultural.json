Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential Agricultural\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-2\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential Agricultural\n(R-2) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Residential Agricultural (R-2). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential Agricultural (R-2)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential Agricultural\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage refers solely to the maximum lot coverage of buildings for primary use and all accessory structures. Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

On existing city-owned wireless telecommunications facilities without increasing the height of the structure.\nb. On existing wireless telecommunications facilities without increasing the height of the structure.\nC. On city-owned properties or facilities.\nd. On properties in areas zoned M-1 Manufacturing.\ne. On properties in areas zoned B-3 Highway Business.\nf. On properties in areas zoned R-2 Residential Agriculture.\n\n\nNEW PAGE 66\n3. If the proposed site is not proposed for the highest priority listed above, then a detailed explanation and justification\nmust be provided as to why a site of all higher priority designations was not selected. The person seeking such an exception\nmust satisfactorily demonstrate the reason or reasons why such a permit should be granted for the proposed site, and the\nhardship that would be incurred by the applicant if the permit were not granted for the wireless telecommunications facility as\nproposed.\n4. An applicant may not by-pass sites of higher priority by stating the site proposed is the only site leased or selected or\nbecause there is an existing lease with a landowner. An application shall address co-location as an option. If such option is\nnot proposed, the applicant must explain to the reasonable satisfaction of the city why co-location is technically or\ncommercially impracticable. Agreements between wireless telecommunications facility owners limiting or prohibiting co-\nlocation shall not be a valid basis for any claim of commercial impracticability or hardship.\n5. Notwithstanding the above, the city may approve any site located within an area in the above list of priorities, provided\nthat the city finds that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants\nand will not have a deleterious effect on the nature and character of the community and neighborhood. Conversely, the city\nmay direct that the proposed location be changed to another location that is more in keeping with the goals of this article\nand the public interest as determined by the city.\n6. Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an area of highest priority or highest available priority, the city\nmay disapprove an application for any of the following reasons:\na. Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and requirements;\nb. Conflict with the historic nature or character of a neighborhood or district;\nC. The use or construction of wireless telecommunications facilities which is contrary to an already stated purpose of a\nspecific zoning or land use designation;\nd. The placement and location of wireless telecommunications facilities which would create an unacceptable risk, or the\nreasonable probability of such, to residents, the public, employees and agents of the city, or employees of the service\nprovider or other service providers;\ne. The placement and location of a wireless telecommunications facility would result in a conflict with or compromise in or\nchange the nature or character of the surrounding area;\nf. Conflicts with the provisions of this article; and\ng. Failure to submit a complete application as required under this article.\n7. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article, for good cause shown, such as the ability to utilize a shorter or\nless intrusive facility elsewhere and still accomplish the primary service objective, the city may require the relocation of a\nproposed site, including allowing for the fact that relocating the site chosen by the applicant may require the use of more\nthan one (1) site to provide substantially the same service if the relocation could result in a less intrusive facility or facilities,\nsingly or in combination. The existence of a lease entered into prior to the approval of an application shall not be deemed\njustification for the requested location. (Ord. of 3/1/10)\nSec. 9-3-121 Shared use of wireless telecommunications facilities structures.\n1. The city requires the co-location of antenna arrays on existing wireless telecommunications facilities as opposed to the\nconstruction of a new wireless telecommunications facility or increasing the height, footprint or profile beyond the conditions\nof the approved special use permit for an existing wireless telecommunications facility, unless such is proven to be\ntechnologically impracticable. The applicant shall submit a comprehensive report inventorying all existing wireless\ntelecommunications facilities and other suitable structures within one (1) mile of the location of any proposed new wireless\ntelecommunications facility, unless the applicant can show that some other distance is more appropriate and reasonable and\ndemonstrate conclusively why an existing wireless telecommunications facility or other suitable structure cannot be used.\n2. An applicant intending to co-locate on an existing wireless telecommunications facility shall be required to document\nthe intent of the existing owner to permit its use by the applicant.\n3. Such shared use shall consist only of the minimum antenna array technologically required to provide service primarily\nand essentially within the city, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown. (Ord. of 3/1/10; Ord. of 6/21/21, No.\n41-21)\nSec. 9-3-122 Type and height of wireless telecommunications facilities.\n1. All new towers shall be of the monopole type, unless such is able to be proven to be technologically impracticable. No\nnew towers of a lattice or guyed type shall be permitted, unless relief is otherwise expressly granted.\n2. The applicant shall submit documentation justifying the total height of any wireless telecommunications facility or\nantenna requested and the basis therefore. Documentation in the form of propagation studies must include all backup data\nused to produce the studies at the requested height and a minimum of ten (10) feet lower height to enable verification of the\nneed for the requested height.\n3.\nFor a new wireless telecommunications facility a reduction in the identified size of the identified service area of ten\npercent (10%) or less of the predicted service area shall not be deemed justification for exceeding the otherwise maximum\n\n\nNEW PAGE 67\nallowable height of a wireless telecommunications facility.\n4. The maximum permitted total height of a new wireless telecommunications facility shall be ninety (90) feet above pre-\nconstruction ground level, unless it can be proven that such height would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the\nprovision of service in the intended service area within the community. The maximum permitted height is not an as-of-right\nheight, but rather the maximum permitted height, absent proof of the technological need for a greater height.\n5. For a wireless facility to be located on an existing wireless telecommunications facility, such documentation will be\nanalyzed in the context of the justification of the height needed to provide service primarily and essentially within the city, to\nthe extent practicable, unless good cause is shown. A reduction in the size of the identified service area of ten percent\n(10%) or less of the predicted service area shall not be deemed justification for increasing the height of a facility.\n6. Notwithstanding the preceding subsection 4. of this section, wireless telecommunications facilities shall be no taller\nthan the minimum height technologically necessary to enable the provision of wireless service coverage or capacity as\nneeded within the community (i.e. the city, and its jurisdiction).\n7. Documentation substantiating the height necessary to provide for the placement of an antennal array to provide\nwireless service to the community shall be submitted by the applicant prior to issuance of a zoning permit for a new wireless\ntelecommunications facility, i.e. tower, but shall not be required prior to the issuance of the special use permit, unless the\nrequested height exceeds the ninety (90) foot maximum height. Such documentation shall be provided with an application\nfor the first attachment of an antenna array and for any proposed increase in the previously permitted height.\n8. Relief from the maximum height for new wireless telecommunications facilities shall only be considered where\nevidence substantiates a taller height is necessary for the provision of wireless service to the community, to the exclusion of\nany alternative option that is not technologically or commercially impracticable, and where denial of a taller height would\nhave the effect of prohibiting the provision of wireless service to the community. Such documentation shall be provided prior\nto consideration of a special use permit when the requested height exceeds the ninety (90) foot maximum height.\n9. Prior to issuing a zoning permit for the co-location of an antenna array on an existing wireless telecommunications\nfacility, an applicant shall demonstrate that the co-location is located appropriately on the wireless telecommunications\nfacility with the overall goal being to preserve the carrying capacity of the wireless telecommunications facility for future co-\nlocations and to minimize the visual intrusiveness and impact, including the profile of the wireless telecommunications\nfacility.\n10. In determining the necessary height for a wireless telecommunications facility, or the height or placement of a co-\nlocation on a wireless telecommunications facility, the signal strengths analyzed shall be the threshold or lowest signal\nstrength at which the customer equipment is designed to function, which may be required to be determined by the\nmanufacturer's published specifications for the customer equipment.\n11. As the city has made the policy decision that more towers of a shorter height is in the public interest, as opposed to\nfewer taller towers, spacing, or the distance between towers, shall be such that the service may be provided without\nexceeding the maximum permitted height. (Ord. of 3/1/10; Ord. of 6/21/21, No. 41-21)\nSec. 9-3-123 Visibility of wireless telecommunications facilities.\n1. Wireless telecommunications facilities shall not be artificially lighted or marked, except as required by federal\nregulations.\n2. Stealth: All new wireless telecommunications facilities, including but not limited to towers, shall utilize stealth or\ncamouflage techniques and technology, unless such can be shown to be either commercially or technologically\nimpracticable.\n3. Dual mode: In order to minimize the number of antenna arrays and thus the visual impact, the city may require the use\nof dual mode antennas to be used, including by two (2) different carriers, unless it can be proven that such will not work\ntechnologically and that such would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service in the city.\n4.
