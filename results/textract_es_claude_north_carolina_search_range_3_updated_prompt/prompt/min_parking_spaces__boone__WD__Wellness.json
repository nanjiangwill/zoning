Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Wellness\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"WD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Wellness\n(WD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Wellness (WD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Wellness (WD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Wellness\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

Every parcel shall retain existing trees or provide new trees to equal thirty\npercent (30%) tree canopy coverage.\nb. The plan must show pre and post development canopy calculations and trees\nby common and botanical name, size, quantity, and health of tree(s) and tree\ncanopy coverage provided by each tree. Canopy coverage is the area beneath\nthe drip line of the existing trees on the lot/parcel. For onsite trees if the\ncanopy extends into a neighboring property, credit for that portion of the\ncanopy may also be taken. Canopy coverage can only be credited from healthy\ntrees or stands of trees.\nC.\nCredit for newly planted trees shall be calculated as follows:\nd. When calculating how much existing tree canopy coverage is already present\non the parcel, you may multiply this by 1.25. This additional credit is to\nencourage the preservation of existing tree canopy.\nJ. Parking Standards. Except as provided herein, development within the WD district\nshall meet the standards in Article 24 Parking.\n1. Vehicular Parking:\na.

To limit the amount of impervious surfaces dedicated to parking on each lot,\nshared parking is encouraged. A shared parking analysis prepared by a\nregistered licensed professional transportation engineer in North Carolina\nusing the Urban Land Institute (ULI) Shared Parking Model (latest edition) or\na\nstudy showing excessive, unused parking by one owner to be shared with\nanother owner must be submitted. A written agreement between landowner\nS acknowledging the number of shared parking spaces must be submitted and\nagreed to by the permit-issuing authority.\nf.\nA parking study, prepared by a licensed professional engineer, illustrating the\nrequired parking ratios do not accurately apply to a specific development.\ng. If the number of required off-street parking spaces cannot be reasonably\nprovided on the property associated with the principal use, then spaces may\nbe provided on adjacent or nearby lots, satellite parking lots may be located up\nto a half-mile (0.5 mi) from the principal use building if served by a transit line,\nshuttle, or located along a dedicated pedestrian sidewalk or greenway trail.\nWritten permission from the owner/person responsible for the satellite\nparking spaces must be provided. The applicant shall provide written\nacknowledgement that continuing the validity of his permit depends on his\ncontinuing ability to provide the requisite number of parking spaces.\n3. Parking Structures: Parking structures are strongly encouraged to consolidate\nparking, and to encourage walking and better utilization of the land.\na.\nParking structures are encouraged to be located at the interior of a block or\nunder buildings, not visible from the public right-of- way. Ground floor\ncommercial uses, or space adaptable for future commercial use, are\nencouraged to be integrated into the structure located along the public street.\nb.\nParking structures shall not have exposed structured parking at the ground\nfloor level along street frontages.\nC.

Parking structures should be designed so ramps are hidden from view of the\nstreet or public right-of-way.\ne. Structures should be constructed of the same building materials as the district\nbuildings.\n4. Drive-Through Facilities:\na. Non-restaurant drive-throughs are allowed.\nb. Drive-through and stacking lanes shall not be located along facades facing a\npublic street.\nC. Drive- through and pick up windows shall be placed to the side or rear of\nbuildings and screened.\nd. Architectural elements, landscaping and/or other screening elements shall be\nused to minimize the visual impacts of the drive-through facility.\ne. Screening shall be a minimum four (4) foot height wall compatible with the\nbuilding architecture, material, color and details or a continuous compact\nevergreen hedge (36\" minimum height at the time of planting reaching 48\"\nminimum height within three years).\nf.\nThe design and location of the facility shall not impede vehicular flow or\npedestrian movement and safety.\ng. Drive-through and pick-up window canopy materials, design and color shall be\nthe same as the primary building.\nK. Loading/ Unloading Areas:\n1. Loading and unloading areas are regulated by Section 24.08.\n2. Loading and unloading activities are not permitted in the public right-of-way unless\nspecifically designated by the Town.\n3.
