Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Mixed Use\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"M-U\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Mixed Use\n(M-U) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Mixed Use (M-U). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Mixed Use (M-U)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Mixed Use\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_lot_size is typically between 1,000 and 2,000,000 sq ft or 0.02 and 50 acres. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 11\n\nM-U Zone\n\nCELL (2, 1):\nField\nCELL (2, 2):\nValue\nCELL (3, 1):\nmin_lot_size\nCELL (3, 2):\n123456 sq ft\nCELL (4, 1):\nApartment Area\nCELL (4, 2):\n10,000\n\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"CELL (3, 2):\\n123456 sq ft\", 11]],\n    \"rationale\": \"The cell that corresponds to the value for min_lot_size in this table has this answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"123456 sq ft\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 32\n\nSection 6.3 Industrial Area & Dimensional Requirements\n1 Public Sewer or Public Water\n2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\n3 For proposed warehouse/manufacturing uses 35%, for all other uses 25%, subject to\nCommission's authority to permit greater coverage based on landscape, architectural design\nand site development elements that exceed minimum standard of the Regulation\n4\nShall be in addition to requirements of 8.1.2 Landscaping and Buffers\n6-4\n\nCELL (1, 1):\nCELL (1, 2):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 3):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 4):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 5):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 6):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 7):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 8):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (1, 10):\nCELL (2, 1):\nZone\nCELL (2, 2):\nMin\nArea\nCELL (2, 3):\nMin\nWidth\nCELL (2, 4):\nMin\nDepth\nCELL (2, 5):\nMax\nStories\nCELL (2, 6):\nMax\nHeight\nCELL (2, 7):\nMax % Lot\nCoverage\nCELL (2, 8):\nMin\nFront\nYard\nCELL (2, 9):\nMin\nSide\nYard\nCELL (2, 10):\nMin\nRear\nYard\nCELL (3, 1):\nI\nCELL (3, 2):\n20,000\nsq. ft.\nCELL (3, 3):\n100'\nCELL (3, 4):\n100'\nCELL (3, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (3, 6):\n50'\nCELL (3, 7):\nN/A\nCELL (3, 8):\n25'\nCELL (3, 9):\n20'\nCELL (3, 10):\n20'\nCELL (4, 1):\nM-U\nCELL (4, 2):\n40,000\nsq. ft. 1\nCELL (4, 3):\n150'\nCELL (4, 4):\n150'\nCELL (4, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (4, 6):\n50'\nCELL (4, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (4, 8):\n50'\nCELL (4, 9):\n20'\nCELL (4, 10):\n20'\nCELL (5, 1):\nM-U\nCELL (5, 2):\n60,000\nsq. ft. 2\nCELL (5, 3):\n200'\nCELL (5, 4):\n200'\nCELL (5, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (5, 6):\n50'\nCELL (5, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (5, 8):\n50'\nCELL (5, 9):\n20'\nCELL (5, 10):\n20'4\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"1 Public Sewer or Public Water\", 32],\n        [\"2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\", 32],\n        [\"CELL (4, 2): \\n40,000\\nsq. ft.\", 32],\n        [\"CELL (5, 2): \\n60,000\\nsq. ft.\", 32]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"From this page we can infer that the value is conditional on the presence of a public sewer or water system, and there are two different values for the current zone, depending on that.\",\n    \"answer\": \"40,000 sq ft (if public water or sewer); 60,000 sq ft (otherwise)\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 66\n\nM-U Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 123 sq ft, side length is 10 ft\n\nNEW PAGE 67\n\nM-U Zone - Senior Active Overlay\n\nmin_lot_size is 1523 sq ft\n\nDKEWKWKDS Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 20,000 sq ft\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"min_lot_size is 123 sq ft\", 66]],\n    \"rationale\": \"The section titled M-U says the answer explicitly.

The front setbacks, or any setback\nadjacent to a street or road right-of-way, must provide for sight visibility. (See illustration in \u00a7 152.072 of this chapter.) When natural\nfeatures, including topography and existing trees of significant value to the lot, create a problem for setting a structure, the Board of\nAdjustment shall have the authority, upon request, to grant relief to vary the setbacks in order to reduce land disturbance or\npreserve valuable natural resources.\n(A) Setbacks from roads. All setbacks from adjacent roads or right-of-way shall be measured from the edge of the traveled way\nif no right-of-way exists. However, in no case shall any structure be located closer than 20 feet from the edge of any traveled way,\nexcept as otherwise provided in \u00a7 152.028(B) of this chapter.\n(B) Setbacks from natural features. In order to protect and preserve the valuable natural features of the town's community, the\nBoard of Adjustment, upon request, may authorize a property owner a variance to reduce a required setback. A property owner\nmay make such a request if supporting evidence is provided that a reduced setback can and will preserve a natural feature which\nmay include natural vegetation, a watercourse or a topographic feature. Evidence shall include a site plan which depicts the\nexisting natural features of the site, the location and an elevation of the proposed structures, the setback variance requested and a\nplan which provides protection and safeguards for the natural features of the site. In considering and granting a variance, the Board\nof Adjustment must find that the impact of the reduced setback will enhance and not adversely affect the safety, health and\naesthetics of the adjacent properties and the community.\n(C) Setbacks from streams.\n(1) The following conservation setback requirements shall apply as set forth by the Division of Water Quality and the county:\n(a) Twenty-five feet from the top of bank of streams;\n(b) Thirty feet from the top of bank of any classified trout stream; and\n(c) Fifty feet from the top of bank of streams on commercial properties in C-1, C-1P and C-2 Districts.\n(2) Note: storm water and drainage facilities can encroach into these easements for up to 25% of the easement.\n(D) Transitional Setbacks from M-I Zoning District. In the event any part of a parcel zoned as M-I abuts any parcel zoned as R-1,\nR-1U, or R-2, the minimum setbacks for the side setback of the M-I parcel shall be not less than 35 feet, and the rear setback of\nthe M-I parcel shall be not less than 35 feet.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 5-14-2007; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 306; Res. passed - -2022)\n\u00a7 152.030 LAND DISTURBING ACTIVITIES INVOLVING STEEP SLOPES.\nThe intent of these regulations is to provide special measures for land development activities in areas requiring land disturbance\nof steep and very steep slopes, to facilitate the identification of land areas subject to possible slope failure and to require\ninvestigation and remediation of such conditions, if necessary, when such land is proposed to be developed.\n(A) (1) The following categories of steep slope are hereby established:\n(a) Very steep slopes are slopes steeper than 50%; and\nCELL (1, 1): \nM-E\nCELL (1, 2): \n60%\nCELL (1, 3): \n55%\nCELL (1, 4): \n50%\nCELL (1, 5): \n45%\nCELL (1, 6): \nGeotechnical\nengineer\nrequired\nCELL (2, 1): \nCZD\nCELL (2, 2): \n60% to *90%\nCELL (2, 3): \n55%\nCELL (2, 4): \n50%\nCELL (2, 5): \n45%\nCELL (2, 6): \nGeotechnical\nengineer\nrequired\nCELL (3, 1): \nM-U\nCELL (3, 2): \n70%\nCELL (3, 3): \n65%\nCELL (3, 4): \n60%\nCELL (3, 5): \n55%\nCELL (3, 6): \nGeotechnical\nengineer\nrequired\nCELL (4, 1): \nRC\nCELL (4, 2): \n50%\nCELL (4, 3): \n45%\nCELL (4, 4): \n40%\nCELL (4, 5): \n35%\nCELL (4, 6): \nGeotechnical\nengineer\nrequired\n\n\nNEW PAGE 27\n(b) Steep slopes are slopes between 20% and 50%.\n(2) Percentage of average slope is determined by the following method:\nS = 0.0023 LA\nI = Contour intervals of the map in feet, with said intervals being 5 feet or less\nL = Total length of the contour lines within the parcel in feet\nA = Area of the parcel in acres\n0.0023 = The constant that converts square feet into acres\n(3) The above formula for calculating the percentage of average slope is used for $152.028(C) of this chapter; which\ndetermines the amount of impervious surface allowed for percentage of slope. Once the placement of the footprint of a structure\nhas been identified, the height of the building can be determined by the midpoint of each wall of the smallest rectangle that can be\nmade with the entire footprint, to determine a midpoint in the center of that rectangle to be used for a measuring point to determine\nthe height of the building.\n(B) Development requirements for both steep and very steep slopes shall be as follows:\n(1) All stream crossings, culverts and disturbance of riparian zones are to comply with appropriate state and federal\nregulations;\n(2) Should the Zoning Administrator believe that geological hazard indicators are present, at the direction of the Town\nManager, he or she may employ and/or contract with an independent geotechnical engineer to evaluate plans for development, as\nnecessary, with the cost for this technical review to be borne by the person(s) requesting development of the property. Once the\nanalysis is performed, the Zoning Administrator shall cause it to become a part of the public record.\n(3) Developers of property, where the development plan requires land disturbing activity on very steep slopes, shall make\nreasonable effort to preserve and protect features of the slope, such as trees and other plant material, which may help to stabilize\nthe slope.\n(4) The owner of any property whose development plan will include the disturbance of a steep or very steep slope, as\ndetermined by the Zoning Administrator, may challenge this determination by appeal to the Board of Adjustment as provided in \u00a7\n152.270 of this chapter.\n(C) The requirements for land disturbing activities on very steep slopes shall be as follows.\n(1) Plans for the development of any property must be accompanied by a site-specific geologic analysis of the very steep\nslope portion of the site to be disturbed by the proposed development plan, paid for the by the applicant, and conducted by a\ngeotechnical engineer, to determine whether the proposed development plan can be implemented without jeopardizing the slope\nstability on the site itself or/and on properties surrounding the site.\n(2) If the property is determined to be safe for development and requires remedial measures to ensure slope stability, a North\nCarolina registered geotechnical engineer must develop and present a plan to the Zoning Administrator that will preserve slope\nstability on the site during and after completion of grading and construction for the site, as well as for surrounding properties to the\nextent that the contemplated development activities on the site affect surrounding properties.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 310)\n\u00a7 152.031 PROCEDURES FOR REVIEW OF PLANS AND APPLICATIONS.\n(A) The intent of this section is to allow the town staff reasonable time for review of submitted plans and applications. These\nrequirements will also allow the Board members to carefully consider plans, applications and staff review comments.\n(B) Certain fees apply to the reviewing of plans and are outlined in the Banner Elk Fee Schedule and must be paid before the\nreview begins.\n(C) All applications and site plans for minor and major subdivisions, and special uses that involve site plan approvals shall be\nsubmitted to the Zoning Administrator for review at least 30 days before the Board meeting where these applications will be\nreviewed. Three paper copies and one digital copy of plans shall be presented for staff review, and then after the review, upon\nrequest from the staff, additional copies shall be provided for the Board members no later than 15 days before the meeting. For all\nsubdivisions and special uses that require site plan approvals, if extension of public water and/or sewer is proposed, three paper\ncopies and one digital copy of utility plans shall be submitted to the Public Works Director for review at least 45 days prior to\nconsideration of the plans by the appropriate board. Estimated number of units, bedrooms, lots shall be provided and uses\nspecified. Extensions of the Town of Banner Elk water distribution and wastewater collection systems and the allocation of capacity\nrelated to these extensions will be evaluated in the context of consistency with the most current Water and Sewer Master Plan by\nthe Town Council at a regular meeting.\n(D) For special uses, any public hearing with the Board of Adjustment will be scheduled in the month following the Planning\nBoard meeting to allow sufficient time to meet the requirements of advertising the public hearing in the local newspaper.\n(E) If the applications and the required plans are not complete, the applicant shall be notified by staff in writing. Additional\ninformation required shall be listed and the applicant shall be made aware of the fact that the Boards will not review incomplete\napplications or plans. Changes or additions to applications as a result of Staff recommendations must be submitted to the Town\nManager for consideration no later than 15 days prior to any respective Board Meeting.\n(F) If an application for a special use permit that requires site plan approval is denied, the same application cannot be\n\nNEW PAGE 98\n(B) Minimum size of cluster subdivision. The minimum size of a cluster subdivision shall be five acres, exclusive of any street\nrights-of-way.\n(C) Minimum lot size and dimensional requirements. Within an approved cluster subdivision, the minimum lot size and\ndimensional requirements of Ch. 151 of this code of ordinances and this chapter are waived, provided all provisions for open space\ndedication and the required approvals of water and sewer systems conform with the requirements of all applicable codes,\nordinances and policies. A minimum setback of 15 feet shall be established along the exterior perimeter of the cluster subdivision.\n(D) Open space requirements.\n(1) A minimum amount of permanent open space shall be provided in any cluster subdivision in an amount equal to or greater\nthan the total square foot reduction in all lots, but in no case less than one contiguous acre. The open space shall be dedicated for\nopen space use, owned and maintained by a property owners association. An instrument providing for the dedication, ownership\nand maintenance of the open space shall be submitted with the preliminary plat. In calculating open space requirements, a cluster\nsubdivision may use a maximum of 50% of the following areas or uses:\n(a) Required setbacks;\n(b) Lakes or ponds;\n(c) Rock outcrops; and\n(d) Slopes exceeding 40%.\n(2) The required open space area shall be located on land contiguous to and geographically situated within the subdivision.\nThe required open space is in addition to the active recreation area described in \u00a7 152.032 of this chapter.\n(E) Utilities. Cluster subdivisions are required to have access and utilize water and sewer service from the town; provided,\nhowever, where town water and/or sewer service is not available, individual or community systems may be approved by the\nPlanning Board and Town Council provided the systems are designed and approved by the appropriate agency prior to the\nsubmission of a preliminary plat.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 4-9-2007; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 808)\n\u00a7 152.190 HOME OCCUPATIONS.\n(A) Intent.
