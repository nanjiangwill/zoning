Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Flood Hazard Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"FHO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Flood Hazard Overlay\n(FHO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Flood Hazard Overlay (FHO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Flood Hazard Overlay (FHO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Flood Hazard Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

The Flood Hazard Overlay District (FHO), as established\nin Section 9.4(b), is designed for the purpose of protecting people and property from the\nhazards of flooding in accordance with the authority provided in NCGS 153A-121.\nThe Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143;\nArticle 6 of Chapter 153A; Article 8 of Chapter 160A; and Article 7, 9, and 11 of Chapter 160D\n(Effective July 1, 2021) of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local governmental\nunits the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and\ngeneral welfare. (Amended 9/14/2021)\nTherefore, the Town Council of Edenton, North Carolina, does ordain as follows:\n(b)\nFindings of Fact.\n(1)\nThe flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of Edenton are subject to\nperiodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety\nhazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,\nextraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and\nimpairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,\nsafety, and general welfare.\n(2)\nThese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in\nfloodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the\noccupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other\nhazards.\n(c)\nStatement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section to promote the public\nhealth, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood\nconditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 9/14/2021\n16-1\nCELL (1, 1): \n(1)\nCELL (1, 2): \nRestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and\nproperty due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging\nincreases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;\nCELL (2, 1): \n(2)\nCELL (2, 2): \nRequire that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve\nsuch uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial\nconstruction;\nCELL (3, 1): \n(3)\nCELL (3, 2): \nControl the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural\nprotective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of\nfloodwaters;\n\n\nNEW PAGE 200\n(4)\nControl filling, grading, dredging and other all development which may\nincrease erosion or flood damage; and (Amended 9/14/2021)\n(5)\nPrevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will\nunnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to\nother lands.\n(d)\nObjectives. The objectives of this Section are to:\n(1)\nProtect human life, safety, and health; (Amended 9/14/2021)\n(2)\nMinimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\n(3)\nMinimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding\nand generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;\n(4)\nMinimize prolonged business losses and interruptions; (Amended\n9/14/2021)\n(5)\nMinimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas\nmains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets and bridges\nlocated in flood prone areas; (Amended 9/14/2021)\n(6)\nMinimize damage to private and public property due to flooding;\n(7)\nMake flood insurance available to the community through the National\nFlood Insurance Program;\n(8)\nMaintain the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains;\n(9)\nHelp maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and\ndevelopment of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood\nblight areas; and\n(10)\nEnsure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a\nSpecial Flood Hazard Area.\nSection 16.2 Definitions.\nUnless specifically defined below, word or phrases used in this Section shall be\ninterpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this\nOrdinance its most reasonable application.\nAccessory Structure (Appurtenant Structure).

New bulletins, as well as updates of existing bulletins, are issued\nperiodically as needed. The bulletins do not create regulations; rather they provide specific\nguidance for complying with the minimum requirements of existing NFIP regulations.\nIt should be noted that Technical Bulletins and Technical Fact Sheets provide guidance\non the minimum requirements of the NFIP regulations. State or community requirements that\nexceed those of the NFIP take precedence. Design professionals should contact the community\nofficials to determine whether more restrictive State or local regulations apply to the building or\nsite in question. All applicable standards of the State or local building code must also be met for\nany building in a flood hazard area.\nTemperature Controlled. Having the temperature regulated by a heating and/or cooling\nsystem, built-in or appliance.\nVariance.

The Special Flood\nHazard Areas are those identified under the Cooperating Technical State (CTS) agreement\nbetween the State of North Carolina and FEMA in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated\nDecember 21, 2018, for Chowan County and associated DFIRM panels, including any digital\ndata developed as part of the FIS, which are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of\nthis ordinance, and all revisions thereto. Future revisions to the FIS and DFIRM panels that do\nnot change flood hazard data within the jurisdictional authority of the Town of Edenton area also\nadopted by reference and declared a part of this ordinance. Subsequent Letter of Map\nRevisions (LOMRs) and/or Physical Map Revisions (PMRs) shall be adopted within three (3)\nmonths. In addition, upon annexation to the Town of Edenton or inclusion in the Extra-Territorial\nJurisdiction (ETJ), the Special Flood Hazard Areas identified by the Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency (FEMA) and/or produced under the Cooperating Technical State\nagreement between the State of North Carolina and FEMA as stated above, for the\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 9/14/2021\n16-12\n\n\n Output:"}]}
