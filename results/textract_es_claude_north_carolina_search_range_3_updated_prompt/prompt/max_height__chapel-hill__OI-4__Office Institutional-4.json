Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Office Institutional-4\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"OI-4\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Office Institutional-4\n(OI-4) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Office Institutional-4 (OI-4). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Office Institutional-4 (OI-4)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Office Institutional-4\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

A key feature of this district is the preparation of a development plan that would allow the property owner, immediate neighbors, and the larger community to understand\nspecifically what levels of development are being proposed, and what impacts would likely accompany the development, so that mitigation measures can be designed and implemented.\n(b) Overview of Development Review Procedures.\nProcedures in this zoning district are designed to facilitate:\nArticulation of development plans that involve multiple buildings in multiple locations over an extended time period on a given tract of land, as defined in a development plan;\nIdentification of total infrastructure needs for such proposed development as specified in a development plan and cumulative impacts resulting from full development as specified in a\n10 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 11\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\ndevelopment plan; and\nProvision of measures to mitigate the negative impacts, including off-site construction of parking decks as described in subsection (d)(2), phased in a manner appropriate with the pace of\nconstruction.\nTo this end, owners of property zoned OI-4 are encouraged to prepare detailed development plans, as described below, for review and approval by the town council. For buildings that are included in an\napproved development plan, site development permits for individual buildings are to be issued by the town manager, following a determination by the town manager that such individual building plans are\ngenerally consistent with the town council-approved development plan.\nFor development proposed within an OI-4 zoning district that is not included in a town council-approved development plan, but is a minor modification according to the provisions of subsection (j) of this\nsection, the town manager may approve a change to the development plan and issue a site development permit. For development proposed within an OI-4 zoning district that is not included in a town\ncouncil-approved development plan and that cannot be considered a minor modification to the plan according to subsection (j) of this section, such development shall be considered to be a special use, and\nsubject to the special use permit procedural requirements of section 4.5 of this appendix. In the alternative, the applicant may apply to the town council for an amendment to the development plan.\nOnce a property is zoned office/institutional-4, all regulations, standards, and procedures prescribed for the previously-applicable zoning district shall apply until (1) a development plan is approved; or\n(2) six (6) months have elapsed, whichever comes first.\n(c) Concept plan review. Prior to submittal of a development plan or modification of development plan, a concept plan review shall be conducted by the Town Council. It is the intent of the\nconceptual development plan process to provide an opportunity for the Town Council, Town Manager and citizens to review and evaluate the impact of the proposed development on the\ncharacter of the area in which it is proposed to be located.\n(1) Submittal requirements. Applications for conceptual development plan review shall be filed with the Town Manager. The Town Manager shall prescribe the form(s) on which information shall\nbe submitted. Application submittal requirements shall include the following:\nA. Descriptions of proposed development with building locations, building sizes, parking arrangements, and description of building heights with consideration of impact on adjacent areas.\n(d) Development Plan.\nA development plan shall address issues such as general location and size of new facilities, parking, utilities, stormwater management, impervious surface, and access/circulation. A development plan\nshall identify the general location, size, and proposed uses of buildings. A development plan shall project anticipated impacts on streets, water and sewer facilities, stormwater runoff, air quality, noise, and\nlighting.\n(1) Submittal requirements. Application submittal requirements shall include the following:\nA. Specific descriptions of proposed development with building locations, building sizes, parking arrangements, and description of building heights with consideration of impact on adjacent\nareas.\nB. Analysis of impacts resulting from proposed development, along with options to mitigate impacts relating to:\nTransportation management (traffic, transit, parking, bikes, pedestrians, air quality);\nStormwater management analysis (quantity and quality); and\nNoise and lighting analysis.\nIndividual effects must be evaluated in the context of the whole development plan and not in isolation. Impacts shall be evaluated in accordance with guidelines endorsed for use by the town\ncouncil.\nC. Preliminary timetable and sequencing schedule for building construction and for related mitigation measures.\n(2) Off-site components. Mitigation measures involving construction of parking decks may need to be developed outside the boundaries of the development plan. Notwithstanding any other\nprovision of this Land Use Management Ordinance, a parking deck proposed to mitigate impacts of a development plan, and approved by the town council as part of a development plan, may\nbe located on a site not within the boundaries of an OI-4 zoning district. Any such facility shall be reviewed as a site development permit according to the provisions of subsection (i)(2) of this\nsection.\n(e) Permitted uses and development intensities.\nPermitted uses shall be identical with uses listed in the use matrix (section 3.7) as being permitted in OI-3, except that place of assembly shall be considered to be a permitted use and not a special use.\nThe maximum floor area allowed shall be as provided in a development plan that is approved by the town council. Special restrictions apply in perimeter transition areas (see subsection (g)).\nFor purposes of calculating compliance with a specified maximum floor area, the following land uses shall not be counted as floor area: new residential development (including Dwellings and residence\nhalls), and new public cultural facilities.\n(f) Standards.\nDevelopment in the OI-4 zoning district shall be designed in a manner that provides a mix of uses which are integrated, interrelated and linked by pedestrian ways, bikeways, and other transportation\nsystems. Development plans shall, as practical and consistent with applicable laws and regulations, include measures to encourage reduction of automobile use and promote alternative modes of\ntransportation; to mitigate adverse environmental impacts; to promote conservation of non-renewable energy resources; and to achieve visual continuity in the siting and scale of buildings. Specifically, a\ndevelopment plan shall address the following:\n(1) Noise: Noise levels from development proposed in the development plan shall not exceed those allowed by the Town of Chapel Hill Noise Ordinance.\n(2) Environment: Development proposed in the development plan shall minimize impacts on natural site features, and be accompanied by measures to mitigate those impacts.\n(3) Transportation: Development proposed in the development plan shall be accompanied by measures to mitigate transportation impacts that are caused by the development.\n(4) Stormwater management: Development proposed in the development plan shall be accompanied by measures to mitigate stormwater impacts (quantity and quality) that are caused by the\ndevelopment.\n(5) Public utilities: There shall be a general demonstration that water, sewer, and other needed utilities can be made available to accommodate development proposed in the development plan.\n(6) Historic districts: The provisions of section 3.6.2 of this appendix shall apply to any development proposed within one of Chapel Hill's Historic Districts.\n(g) Perimeter transition areas.\nA development plan shall designate a perimeter transition area establishing appropriate standards at borders of the development plan, necessary to minimize impacts of development proposed in\nthe development plan on adjacent property, to be approved by the town council as part of the development plan. Standards shall address:\n(1) Screening mechanical equipment,\n(2) Exterior lighting,\n(3) Height limits,\n(4) Landscaping.\n(h) Procedures for approval of development plans.\n11 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\n\nNEW PAGE 12\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nApplications for a development plan, special use permit, or site development permit shall be filed with the town manager.\n(1) Application submittal requirements. The town manager shall prescribe the form(s) of applications as well as any other material he/she may reasonably require to determine compliance with\nthis section. Applications shall include information described in subsection (d)(1).\n(2) Process for review.\nA.\nApplications for development plan approval may be reviewed by the planning commission, and the planning commission may conduct a preliminary forum to review the application and\nthe town manager's report and to provide comments to the applicant.\nB. Applications for development plan approval will be considered at an evidentiary hearing. Relevant evidentiary procedures for such hearings are as set forth in NCGS 160D-406. Notice of\nthe date, time, and place of the Town Council evidentiary hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the planning jurisdiction once a week for two (2) successive\nweeks, with the first notice to be published not less than ten (10) nor more than twenty-five (25) days prior to the date of the hearing.\nC.\nPresentation of Evidence. The applicant, the town council, and any person who would have standing to appeal the decision under NCGS 160D-1402(c) shall have the right to participate as\na party at the evidentiary hearing. Other witnesses may present competent, material, and substantial evidence that is not repetitive as allowed by the town council. All persons who intend\nto present evidence at the evidentiary hearing shall be sworn.\nObjections regarding jurisdictional and evidentiary issues, including, but not limited to, the standing of a party, may be made to the town council. The mayor shall rule on any objections,\nand the mayor's rulings may be appealed to the full town council. These rulings are also subject to judicial review pursuant to NCGS 160D-1402. Objections based on jurisdictional issues\nmay be raised for the first time on judicial review.\nD. The applicant shall bear the burden of presenting evidence sufficient to establish persuasively that the proposed development will comply with the determinations required in subsection\n(h)(3).\nE. A record of the proceedings of the hearing shall be made and shall include all documentary evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing. Town council action on an application for\ndevelopment plan approval shall occur within one hundred twenty (120) days of the date of submittal of a complete application.\n(3) Town council action.\nA. The town council shall approve a development plan unless it finds that the proposed development would not:\nMaintain the public health, safety, and general welfare; or\nMaintain the value of adjacent property; or\nComply with all required regulations and standards of this chapter, including all applicable provisions of article 2 and with all other applicable regulations; or\nConform with the general plans for the physical development of the Town as embodied in this chapter and in the comprehensive plan.\nB. Town council action shall be to:\nApprove;\nApprove with conditions; or\nDeny.\n(i) Actions after decision on development plan.\n(1) Recording approval. If the application for approval of a development plan is approved or approved with conditions, the town manager shall issue the approval in accord with the action of the\ntown council. The applicant shall record such approval in the office of the county register of deeds. The development plan, including all conditions attached thereto, shall run with the land and\nshall be binding on the original applicant as well as all successors, assigns, and heirs.\n(2) Individual site development permits. If the development plan is approved, or approved with conditions, the town manager may then accept applications for individual site development\npermits for specific buildings that are described in the development plan. No work on a building identified on the development plan may begin until a site development permit has been\nissued. The town manager shall prescribe the form(s) of applications as well as any other material he/she may reasonably require to determine compliance with the development plan. Any\napplication for a site development permit in a perimeter transition area shall include provisions for mailed notification to property owners within one thousand (1,000) feet of the proposed\ndevelopment. If the town manager finds that the application is consistent with the development plan, he/she shall approve the application and issue the site development permit within fifteen\n(15) working days of the submittal of a complete application. If the town manager finds that the application is not consistent with the development plan he/she shall deny the application\nwithin fifteen (15) working days of the acceptance of the application and refer the applicant to the special use permit process described in section 4.5 of this appendix. Alternatively, the\napplicant may apply for an amendment to the development plan.\n(3) Expiration, abandonment, revocation of development plan. If an application for a site development permit pursuant to an approved development plan has not been submitted to the town\nmanager within two (2) years of the date of approval of the development plan, the approval shall automatically expire. On request by the holder of an approved development plan, the town\ncouncil shall approve the abandonment of the plan if it determines that no subsequent development approvals have been granted and no construction activity has taken place pursuant to the\ndevelopment plan. If material conditions of a development plan are violated, and remain in violation after giving the property owner a reasonable amount of time to correct such violation, the\ntown council may revoke the plan after notification to the property owner and opportunity for property owner response at a public meeting of the town council.\n(j) Process for amending the development plan.\nThe town manager is authorized to approve minor modifications and changes in the ordering of phases in an approved development plan, as long as such changes continue to be in compliance with the\napproving action of the town council and all other applicable requirements, and result in a configuration of buildings that is generally consistent with the approved development plan. The town manager\nshall not have the authority to approve changes that constitute a major modification of the development plan.\nBefore making a determination as to whether a proposed action is a minor or major modification, the town manager shall review the record of the proceedings on the original application for the\ndevelopment plan and any subsequent applications for modifications of the development plan, and shall use the following criteria in making a determination:\n(1) A change in the boundaries of the development plan approved by the town council shall constitute a major modification;\n(2) A substantial change in the floor area or number of parking spaces approved by the town council shall constitute a major modification. (General rule: more than a 5% increase in overall net\nnew floor area or parking in a development plan approved by the town council would be considered substantial.);\n(3)\nSubstantial changes in pedestrian or vehicular access or circulation approved by the town council shall constitute a major modification. (General rule: changes that would affect access or\ncirculation beyond the boundaries of a development plan would be considered substantial.); and\n(4) Substantial change in the amount or location of open areas approved by the town council shall constitute a major modification.\nIf the proposed action is determined to be a major modification, the town manager shall require the filing of an application for approval of the major modification, following procedures outlined in this\nsection for initial approval of a development plan.\n(Ord.

The district allows for a more intense and efficient use of land at increased densities for the mutual reinforcement of public investments and private development. Uses and\ndevelopment are regulated to create a more intense built-up environment, oriented to pedestrians and bicycles, to provide a density and intensity that is transit supportive. The development\nstandards of the zone also are designed to encourage a safe and pleasant pedestrian and bicycle environment near transit stations by encouraging an intensive area of shops and activities, by\nencouraging amenities such as benches, kiosks, and outdoor cafes, and by limiting conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians and bicycles. It is the intent of this section that a TOD district be\nrestricted to areas within one-half of a mile of a transit station, which area is equivalent to a typical 10-minute walking distance.\nBecause most transit users will walk only one-quarter to one-half of a mile to a transit facility, transit influence areas require high densities on small areas of land. The town therefore finds and\ndetermines that uses inconsistent with transit will undermine the most efficient use of limited land areas within a TOD, and may render the transit system unworkable. Accordingly, the uses\npermitted within the core (TOD-C) and perimeter (TOD-P) zoning districts are those which are dependent upon, or which may generate, a relatively high level of transit usage. Uses which would\ninterfere with transit usage and which generate few transit trips are not permitted.\n(a) Designation procedures.\nA transit oriented development may be designated pursuant to the procedures established in section 4.4 of this appendix.\n(b) Designation criteria.\nTo be designated a transit oriented development district, the area must meet the following criteria:\n(1) At least fifty (50) percent of the territory within a TOD must lie within one-quarter (1/4) of a mile of a transit station or major bus boarding location, and shall be classified as transit oriented\ndevelopment-core (\"TOD-C\").\n(2) Areas between one-quarter (1/4) of a mile and one-half (1/2) of a mile from a transit station or a major bus boarding location may be classified as transit oriented development-perimeter (\"TOD-\nP\"). No land area shall be zoned \"TOD-P\" unless it adjoins an area zoned \"TOD-C.\"\nPRIMARY\nPRIMARY\nVEHICULAR\nPEDESTRIAN\nSTREET\nSTREET\nCOMMERCIAL\nMIXED USE BLDG\nMIXED\nUSE\nPARKING\nPARK\nTRANSIT\nGARAGE\nSTOP\nMIXED\nUSE\nCOMMERCIAL\nTRANSIT STOP WITHIN\nEXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE\n(c) Uses and dimensional standards.\nThe TOD district shall establish minimum levels of density and intensity required to support transit ridership, and prohibit lower levels of density which will not support transit ridership and will\n13 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\n\nNEW PAGE 14\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\ncreate unacceptable levels of vehicular congestion.\nThe TOD district shall establish permitted, special and prohibited uses. Land uses which are not supportive of public transportation in that they tend to not generate transit ridership, and which\nrequire access primarily by automobile, shall be prohibited.\n(d) Development standards.\nThe ordinance designating the TOD shall include standards governing landscaping, lot layout, buffers, setbacks, parks and open space, parking, transportation, and urban design. The ordinance\nshall establish maximum setbacks and maximum parking requirements which support transit usage.\nTransit related development\nTeam\nExample: Buildings within a TOD district feature small front setbacks in order to provide efficient pedestrian and bicycle movement (top graphic). Buildings in conventional commercial strips do not\nsupport transit usage because pedestrians are separated from buildings by parking lots and wide setbacks (bottom graphic).\n(Source: USDOT, A Guide to Land Use and Public Transportation (Dec. 1989))\n3.5.5. University-1 District\n(a) Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of the University-1 district (U-1) is to establish procedural and substantive standards for the town council's review and approval of development on\nlarge tracts of land where the predominant uses aretobepublic orprivate developmentforcollege/university,researchactivity,civic,hospital, clinics, cultural, and/or related or support functions\nwith integrated supporting housing, general business, convenience business, office-type business, recreation, utility, and/or open space uses.\nThe objective of the U-1 district is to allow for orderly and sustainable growth and major new development while mitigating impacts to nearby neighborhoods, the community, and the environment. A key\nfeature of this district is the concurrent review of a rezoning application and an initial proposed development agreement within such district that allows the property owner, immediate neighbors, and\ncommunity to understand the type and intensity of development being proposed, the timing of that development, the potential impacts of the development, the mitigation measures that will be\nimplemented to address those impacts, and the commitments of both the developer and the town regarding public facilities and services needed to support the proposed development. A development\nagreement that is approved by ordinance as a legislative decision of the town council pursuant to G.S. 160D-1003 is an integral component of the U-1 zoning district.\n(b) Overview of development review procedures. Procedures in this zoning district are designed to facilitate:\n1. Articulation of a long-term development plan that provides a context for more detailed intermediate and short term plans and projects;\n2. Articulation of detailed plans that involve multiple buildings over an extended time period on a defined portion of the zoning district that is subject to an individual development agreement;\n3. Identification of the infrastructure needs and impacts related to the development specified in a development agreement;\n4.\nProvision of measures to mitigate the negative impacts of development in the development agreement and to promote sustainability of approved development, with the mitigation\nimplemented in a manner appropriate with the pace of development; and\n5. Provision of predictability and certainty as to the type, intensity, and design of development set out in a town council-approved development agreement.\nApplicants proposing that property be zoned U-1 must submit a long-range development plan and supporting analysis at the time of petition for rezoning to this district. Upon approval by the town\ncouncil of a development agreement in this district, site development permits for individual buildings are to be issued by the town manager, following a determination by the town manager that such\nindividual building projects do not violate the town council-approved development agreement.\nFor development proposed within the U-1 zoning district that is not included in a town council-approved development agreement, but is a minor modification according to the provisions of this section,\nthe town manager may approve a change to the development agreement and issue a site development permit.\nExcept as specifically authorized as a permitted use under subsection 3.5.5(g)(1), development proposed within this zoning district that is not included in a town council-approved development\nagreement and/or that cannot be considered a minor modification to a development agreement shall be considered to be a special use and subject to the special use permit standards and procedural\nrequirements of section 4.5 of this appendix. In the alternative, the applicant may apply to the town council for an amendment to the development agreement.\nThe terms used within this section have the same meaning and scope as provided by this appendix and state law. Provided, however, that to the extent a council-approved and owner-executed\ndevelopment agreement define a term to have a different meaning or scope, that meaning and scope shall apply as specified in the development agreement.\n(c) Minimum requirements.\nAn\napplication for rezoning to a U-1 district may only be initiated by the owner of the property to be rezoned or a duly authorized agent of the owner.\nAn application for rezoning to a U-1 district must, in addition to all other requirements of this ordinance, include:\n1. A long-range plan for the development of the entire area proposed to be included in the district.\n2. An ecological assessment of the entire area proposed to be included in the district.\n3. A proposed development agreement for a discrete portion of the land to be placed in the district.\nThe town manager may specify forms and reasonable requirements related to these mandated materials to be submitted with a rezoning petition.\n(d) Long-range development plan. When an application for a rezoning to this district is submitted, the developer shall submit a long-range development plan to provide an opportunity for the town\ncouncil, town manager and citizens to see the developer's current plans at a conceptual level for long-term development of all property within the proposed zoning district. This long-range plan is\nnecessary to provide a context for individual development agreements for development within the district. The long-range plan shall represent a good faith depiction of the developer's intentions\nrelative to overall development of the site. It is not, however, submitted for town approval and shall not be deemed to create a binding commitment on behalf of the developer or the town.\nThe long-range development plan shall be submitted to the town manager prior to or concurrently with the submission of an application to rezone property into this district. An updated long-range\ndevelopment plan shall also be submitted with all applications for approval of a development agreement within the district or for approval of major modifications of a development agreement within the\ndistrict.\n(e) Development agreement. A proposed development agreement in this district must include all provisions mandated by state law and shall at a minimum include:\n1. A legal description of the property subject to the agreement and the names of its legal and equitable property owners.\n2. The duration of the agreement.\n14 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\n\nNEW PAGE 15\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n3.\nThe development uses permitted on the property, including population densities and building types, intensities, placement on the site, and design.\n4. A description of public facilities that will service the development, including who provides the facilities, the date any new public facilities, if needed, will be constructed, and a schedule or\ntriggering points to assure public facilities are available concurrent with the impacts of the development.\n5.\nA description, where appropriate, of any reservation or dedication of land for public purposes and any provisions to protect environmentally sensitive property.\n6. A description of all local development permits approved or needed to be approved for the development of the property together with a statement indicating that the failure of the agreement\nto address a particular permit, condition, term, or restriction does not relieve the developer of the necessity of complying with the law governing their permitting requirements, conditions,\nterms, or restrictions.\n7. A description of any conditions, terms, restrictions, or other requirements determined to be necessary by the town council for the public health, safety, or welfare.\n8. A description, where appropriate, of any provisions for the preservation and restoration of historic structures.\n9. A development schedule, including commencement dates and interim completion dates at no greater than five-year intervals, provided, however, the failure to meet a commencement or\ncompletion date shall not, in and of itself, constitute a material breach of the development agreement pursuant to NCGS 160D-1008 but must be judged based upon the totality of the\ncircumstances.\nThe development agreement may provide that the entire proposed development or any phase of it be commenced or completed within a specified period of time. The development agreement may\ninclude other defined performance standards to be met by the applicant and/or its successors in interest.\n(f) Permitted within the boundary of a development agreement.\n(1) Permitted uses within a development agreement. The predominant uses are to be public or private development for college/university, research activity, civic, hospital, clinics, cultural, and/or\nrelated or support functions with integrated supporting housing, general business, convenience business, office-type business, recreation, utility, and/or open space uses. Uses that may be\napproved within a development agreement in this district include all uses allowed within the OI-4 district as permitted uses, special uses, or accessory uses. The maximum floor area, density\nof development, building heights and general locations, other attributes of development intensity, and design guidelines for the development permitted shall be as provided in a town council-\napproved development agreement. The development agreement may provide that specified uses shall require a town council-approved special use permit.\nA large central cogeneration/utility plant may only be approved within a development agreement in this district upon approval of a special use permit by the town council. For the purposes of\nthis section, a large central cogeneration/utility plant includes any facility designed to produce steam, heat, electric power, chilled water, or cooling for other buildings and that is designed to\nor has the capacity to serve more than two million square feet of building space. The process established by section 4.5.3 of this appendix shall be followed in the consideration of this special\nuse permit and sections 4.5.4 and 4.5.5 of this appendix shall apply to modification, expiration, and revocation of this special use permit. The town council shall not approve that permit unless\neach of the following findings is made:\n1. That the use is located, designed, and proposed to be operated so as to maintain or promote the public health, safety, and general welfare;\n2. That the use is located, designed, and proposed to be operated so as to maintain or enhance the value of contiguous property, or that the use is a public necessity;\n3. That the use conforms with the general plans for the physical development of the town as embodied in the comprehensive plan; and\n4. That the use conforms with the applicable terms of the development agreement.\n(g) Permitted and special uses outside a boundary area of a development agreement.\n(1) Permitted uses outside the boundary area of a development agreement. Uses that may be approved as permitted uses within the zoning district but outside the boundary area or terms of a\ntown council-approved development agreement are:\nCommunity gardens;\nLocal farmers markets;\nRecreational facility, non-profit;\nTrails, greenways, and recreational land;\nPublic use facilities;\nSolar energy collection arrays;\nRadio, television, or wireless transmitting and/or receiving facilities, provided the total height of an antenna-supporting structure is not more than one hundred twenty (120) feet and there is\na\nfive hundred-foot or more setback from the property line;\nWind turbines designed to produce 100kW or less, provided the total height is not more than one hundred twenty (120) feet, there is a minimum ground clearance of thirty (30) feet from\nrotors, and there is a five hundred-foot or more setback from the property line. Wind turbines designed to produce 100kW or less may also be located on rooftops.\nThese permitted uses shall require a zoning compliance permit pursuant to section 4.9 of this appendix and, as is provided for OI-3 and OI-4 districts in Table 3.7-1 (Use Matrix), shall not require a\nspecial use permit based on the floor area of the proposed development.\n(2) Uses subject to a special use permit outside the boundary area of a development agreement. Uses that may be approved as special uses within this zoning district outside the boundary or\nterms of a town council-approved development agreement (including proposed uses for property formerly covered by a development agreement that has expired or been terminated) are\nlimited to those uses allowed within the OI-4 district as permitted uses, special uses, or accessory uses as set forth in Table 3.7-1 (Use Matrix). These special uses shall be subject to the\ndimensional requirements for the OI-4 district as set forth in Table 3-8.1 (Dimensional Matrix) and the perimeter transition area requirements applicable in the OI-4 district.\n(h) Existing conditions within a U-1 zoning district. Existing uses, structures, and conditions within a U-1 zoning district as of the effective day property is placed in this district may be continued as\nspecified by this section. All existing uses of land that do not involve the use of a building can be continued as they exist as of the effective date the property is zoned U-1 and can be changed to\nany use permitted by subsection 3.5.5(f)(1). Any existing building within the U-1 district can be used for the use in effect as of the effective date property is zoned U-1 and can be changed to any\nuse permitted pursuant to a development agreement as authorized by subsection 3.5.5(f)(1). Any existing building being used for a use permitted by this appendix or by an applicable\ndevelopment agreement may be expanded to the extent that the town manager finds that the expansion is exempt from the transportation impact analysis requirements of subsection 5.8(g) of\nthis appendix. Any new construction, development, or site improvements associated with continuation of existing conditions shall be consistent with the terms of all applicable development\nagreements in effect within the district.\n(i) Development standards. Development in the U-1 zoning district shall be designed to provide a mix of uses within all major phases of the development that are integrated, interrelated and linked\nby pedestrian ways, bikeways, and/or other transportation systems. Development agreements shall, to the extent practical and consistent with applicable laws and regulations, include measures\nto encourage reduction of automobile use and promote alternative modes of transportation; to provide sustainable building design and land uses; to mitigate adverse environmental impacts; to\npromote conservation of non-renewable energy resources; to exceed minimally accepted practices; and to achieve visual continuity in the siting and scale of buildings.\nSpecifically, a development agreement in this district shall at a minimum address the following:\n1. Plan consistency. The proposed development shall be generally consistent with the long range development plan for the district submitted by the owner. The development shall be generally\nconsistent with the adopted comprehensive plan for the town.\n15 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\n\n Output:"}]}
