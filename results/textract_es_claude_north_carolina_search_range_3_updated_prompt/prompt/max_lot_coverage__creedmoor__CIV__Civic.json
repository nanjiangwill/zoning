Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Civic\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CIV\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Civic\n(CIV) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Civic (CIV). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Civic (CIV)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Civic\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text.

Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

Preservation of open space in developing areas serves a variety of purposes, including meeting the\nrecreational needs of residents, improving the aesthetic character of the community, reducing stormwater\nrunoff, improving stormwater runoff water quality, and enhancing air quality. The standards set forth below\nestablish regulations for open space in residential and non-residential developments.\n21.2\nOpen Space.\nAlthough open space can be agricultural or natural in character, open space is typically planned active play areas,\ngreenways, or walking trails that are developed as part of a residential and/or non-residential development.\nThe following standards are hereby established for open space, with the exception of the Main Street (MS)\nDistrict, which shall be exempt from the requirements of this section.\n21.2-1 OPEN SPACE LAND AREA REQUIREMENTS. Open space shall be provided in accordance with the\nfollowing table for:\nA. initial residential development containing five or more units,\nB. redevelopment or additional development that adds five or more units,\nC.\ninitial nonresidential or mixed use development greater than 0.6 acres, and\nD.\nredevelopment or additional development that adds 25 percent more nonresidential or mixed use\nfloor area on a site that exceeds 0.6 acres within any 36 consecutive month period.\nTABLE 21.1\n21.2-2 LAND DESIGNATED AS FUTURE OPEN SPACE. Regardless of the requirements and exemptions of this\nsubsection, any portion of the site of the proposed development that is designated as future open\nspace or greenway in the City Plan 2030 -Land Use and Comprehensive Master Plan adopted by the\nCity of Creedmoor, as amended from time to time, shall be reserved for open space. This area may be\ncounted toward the total amount of open space required for the development.\nIf the total amount of land required proposed as future open space or greenway is less than the total\namount of open space required for the development by the above table, then the developer shall\nprovide additional open space to meet the requirement of the above table. If the amount of land\ndesignated as future open space or greenway exceeds the total amount of open space required by the\nabove table, then the developer must still provide the open space designated in the official adopted\nplan.\n21.2-3 MINIMUM OPEN SPACE AREA. Individual areas designated as open space areas shall not contain less\nArticle 21 - Page 1\nCELL (1, 1): \nZONING DISTRICT\nCELL (1, 2): \nREQUIRED OPEN SPACE\nCELL (2, 1): \nAll residential districts.\nCELL (2, 2): \nSingle-family/and/or duplex subdivisions: 10% of total\nsubdivision project site area.\nOther residential: 500 square feet of open space per unit or\n9% of lot area, whichever is greater\nNonresidential uses (e.g., religious institutions, schools,\netc.): 6% of lot area.\nCELL (3, 1): \nAll other districts, excluding MS which is\nexempt from these requirements\nCELL (3, 2): \n7.5% of lot area\n\n\nNEW PAGE 280\nthan 500 square feet.\nIMPROVEMENT OF OPEN SPACE. With the exception of Natural and Agricultural Open Space, open\nspace shall be planned and improved, accessible and usable by persons living nearby. Improved shall\nmean cleared of underbrush and debris and shall contain landscaped areas designated for both active\nand passive recreational pursuits. At least 25% of the improved open space land shall be dedicated to\nactive recreation purposes such as playgrounds, tennis courts, ball fields, volleyball courts, etc. The\nbalance of the open space park area may be designed for passive recreation.\n21.2-4 DESIGN AND LOCATION. In major subdivisions and multi-building developments in all zoning districts\nexcept Agricultural, open space shall be integrated into the design of the site. In subdivisions where\n50% or more of the lots are less than 0.75 acre in size, open space shall be located within 1/4 mile of at\nleast 90% of the building lots, as measured along the rights-of-way of streets providing access between\nthe two. In subdivisions where 50% or more of the lots are 0.75 acre or more in size, open space shall\nbe located within 1/2 mile of at least 90% of the building lots, as measured along the rights-of-way of\nstreets providing access between the two.\n21.2-5 FOCAL POINT. Open space features should provide focal points for the neighborhood. A central square\nor green, for example, may comprise a majority of the open space. There should be a hierarchy of open\nspace within new neighborhoods so that open space serves the needs of multiple age groups.\n21.2-6 TYPES OF OPEN SPACE. Open space types include Squares, Parks, Forecourts, Plazas, Greenways, and\nNatural and Agricultural. Standards for these open space types are set forth below.\nA. SQUARES\nSquares are areas for passive recreational use. Squares shall be bounded by streets on a minimum of\nthree sides or 75% of their perimeter.\nSquares should be used in tight urban environments where residents have little yard space. Squares\nare used to bring a more natural landscape into an urban environment. As such, not more than 25%\nof a square should be impervious surface coverage. Hardscaping should be decorative (example brick\npavers instead of asphalt for walkways).\nMin size: 500 sq. feet\nMax Size: 2 acres\nB. PARKS\nParks are areas for passive or active recreational use. Parks should be bounded by streets on a\nminimum of two sides or 50% of their perimeter.\nMinimum Size: 6,500 square feet\nArticle 21 - Page 2\n\n\nNEW PAGE 281\nMaximum Size: 8 Acres. Maximum size may exceed eight acres if the park serves multiple\nneighborhoods or preserves environmental features.\nParks should be areas where passive and active recreation occur simultaneously (example: park\nbenches for elderly and a tot-lot for young children), encouraging intergenerational interactions among\npark users.\nC. FORECOURT\nForecourts are open spaces that act as buffers between residential buildings and streets or non-\nresidential buildings. Forecourts are entirely bounded by buildings or streets. It is recommended that\nforecourts be planted parallel to all street right-of-ways.\nMinimum Size: 500 sq. feet\nMaximum Size: 1.5 acre\nD. PLAZA\nA plaza is an open area adjacent to a civic or commercial building. Plazas should be planted with\ndeciduous trees to provide shade in the summer (example: the NC State Capital Building lawn in\nRaleigh, NC). Plazas function as gathering places and may incorporate a variety of non-permanent\nactivities such as outdoor farmers markets or craft fairs. Limited parking is permissible on plazas.\nPlazas should match the architectural style of the buildings that they are adjacent to regarding\nmaterials and design. Plazas shall be level or gently sloping.\nMinimum Size: none\nMaximum Size: none\nE. GREENWAYS\nGreenways are spaces designed to incorporate natural settings such as creeks and significant stands of\ntrees within a neighborhood. Greenways shall have streets or pedestrian ROWs parallel to or\nintegrated into at least 75% of their length. Greenways are used for walking, jogging, biking, and they\nare used as wildlife corridors. Greenways may have infrequent small-scale active recreational facilities\nArticle 21 - Page 3\n\nNEW PAGE 282\nsuch as playgrounds, although the majority of greenways shall be for passive, pedestrian and/or bicycle\nrecreation.\nF.\nNATURAL AND AGRICULTURAL OPEN SPACE\nNatural and Agricultural Open Space preserves agricultural lands, environmentally sensitive areas,\nscenic views, cultural features, and rural character that would likely be lost through conventional\ndevelopment approaches. To accomplish this goal, the City of Creedmoor encourages creativity and\nallows for greater flexibility in the design of developments through use of the Mini-Farm Overlay\nDistrict and conditional zoning districts (Article 8).\nNatural and Agricultural Open Space shall be placed in preserves, which may adjoin housing areas that\nhave been designed more compactly to create larger areas that may be enjoyed equally by all residents\nof the neighborhood.\n21.2-7 OPEN SPACE OWNERSHIP AND CONSERVATION EASEMENT. Open space shall be owned or\nadministered by one or a combination of the following methods: fee simple ownership by a private\nnon-profit land conservancy; owned by a homeowners association; or by individual private ownership\nsuch as a farmer, developer or other private entity that maintains the open space (i.e. farming,\nequestrian facility, etc.)\nAll lands within areas required to be maintained as open space shall be protected by a permanent\nconservation easement, prohibiting further development, and setting other standards safeguarding the\nsite's special resources from negative changes.\nPublic use of the open space may be limited to residents of the development, except for land used for\npublic sidewalks and multi-use trails, provided that such open space is held in private or association\nownership.\n21.2-8 MAINTENANCE. The owner or lessee of the property designated as the open space shall be responsible\nfor the maintenance of the open space area. Landscaped areas shall be maintained in good condition\nand the entire area shall be kept clear of debris. Failure to maintain the area shall constitute a violation\nof this ordinance and subject the violator to the penalty provisions of Article 23 if not corrected within\n30 days of notification. Alternatively, if acceptable to the City, as applicable, the land may be dedicated\nto the City for public use and thereafter maintained by the City.\n21.2-9 LAND ACCEPTABLE FOR OPEN SPACE DESIGNATION. The classes of land enumerated below may be\nutilized to meet the requirements of this section.\nA. Open water, wetlands, utility transmission right-of-ways, and undisturbed floodplains may account\nfor up to twenty percent (20%) of the area requirement.\nB. Land used for public sidewalks significantly in excess of standard sidewalk requirements,\nstreetscape and hardscape areas accessible to the public including sidewalk cafe areas, areas\ncontaining public art, and similar urban open space amenities.\nC.\nLand on which locally or nationally designated historic structures are located and determined to\nbe contributing to the designation.\nD. Land which exceeds a 10 percent slope may be used to provide up to 50 percent (50%) of the\nrequired open space if existing slopes and vegetation so designated remain undisturbed.\nE. Land used for stormwater retention, provided such land is natural in appearance and is not\nseparately fenced, may be used for up to ten percent (10%) of the required open space.\nF. Reserved.\nG.\nLand that is suitable for agriculture, land that has environmentally sensitive areas (ex. mature\nArticle 21 - Page 4\n\n\n Output:"}]}
