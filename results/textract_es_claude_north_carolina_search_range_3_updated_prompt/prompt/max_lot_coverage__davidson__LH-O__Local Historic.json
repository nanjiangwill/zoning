Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Local Historic\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"LH-O\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Local Historic\n(LH-O) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Local Historic (LH-O). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Local Historic (LH-O)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Local Historic\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text.

Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

Prohibited Activity:\nTrenching, placing backfill in the critical root zone (CRZ), driving or parking\nequipment in the CRZ, and dumping of trash, oil, paint or other materials\ndetrimental to plant health in close proximity of the trees to be preserved is\nprohibited.\nConstruction traffic, storage of vehicles and materials, grading, and unapproved\nsite disturbance shall not take place within the CRZ of the existing trees.\nThe areas shall remain free of all building materials, stockpiled soil or other\nconstruction debris.\n3. Protection Requirements:\na. Location: Protective barricades shall be placed around all trees designated to\nbe saved prior to the start of development activities or grading. Such barricades\nshall be erected at a radial recommended minimum distance of 1.5 feet for\nevery inch of trunk diameter at breast height (DBH) or the dripline, whichever\nis greater and outside the CRZ as approved by the Arborist, unless the Arborist\napproves a different distance based on the approved development plan or\nsite circumstances. For example, a 12-inch diameter tree trunk at breast height\nshould have a minimal radial protection zone of 18 feet. The circular diameter of\nprotection around the trunk would be 36 feet from the base of the tree. Prior to\napproval of construction beginning, the Arborist must approve and inspect the\nbarricade designs and installation.\nb. Materials: Protective barricades shall consist of 2\" X 4\" posts with 1\"x 4\" rails or\norange safety fence.\nC.\nDuration: Protective barricades shall remain in place until development\nactivities are complete.\nd.\nGrading Protocol: Where grading within a tree dripline cannot be avoided and\nis approved by the Planning Director and/or Arborist, cut and fill shall be limited\nto 1/4 to 1/3 of the area within the dripline. Tree roots must be pruned with\nclean cuts at the edge of the disturbed area, and no fill shall be placed within\nthe dripline of a tree without venting to allow air and water to reach the roots.\nIn the case of an approved construction or grading permit within the CRZ, the\nArborist shall provide and ensure recommendations to protect the affected\ntrees are implemented.\nF.\nReplacement of Preserved or Planted Trees: The proper care and protection of trees\nthroughout and beyond the development process is critical. Penalties for violations\nrange from $50.00 to $ 1,000.00 or more per tree or $ 5.00 to $10.00 per square foot\ndisturbed and, depending on the penalty, may be enforced on landowners as well as\nparties executing work.
