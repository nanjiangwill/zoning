Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential-Agricultural\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-A\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential-Agricultural\n(R-A) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Residential-Agricultural (R-A). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential-Agricultural (R-A)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential-Agricultural\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_lot_size is typically between 1,000 and 2,000,000 sq ft or 0.02 and 50 acres. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 11\n\nR-A Zone\n\nCELL (2, 1):\nField\nCELL (2, 2):\nValue\nCELL (3, 1):\nmin_lot_size\nCELL (3, 2):\n123456 sq ft\nCELL (4, 1):\nApartment Area\nCELL (4, 2):\n10,000\n\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"CELL (3, 2):\\n123456 sq ft\", 11]],\n    \"rationale\": \"The cell that corresponds to the value for min_lot_size in this table has this answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"123456 sq ft\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 32\n\nSection 6.3 Industrial Area & Dimensional Requirements\n1 Public Sewer or Public Water\n2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\n3 For proposed warehouse/manufacturing uses 35%, for all other uses 25%, subject to\nCommission's authority to permit greater coverage based on landscape, architectural design\nand site development elements that exceed minimum standard of the Regulation\n4\nShall be in addition to requirements of 8.1.2 Landscaping and Buffers\n6-4\n\nCELL (1, 1):\nCELL (1, 2):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 3):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 4):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 5):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 6):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 7):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 8):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (1, 10):\nCELL (2, 1):\nZone\nCELL (2, 2):\nMin\nArea\nCELL (2, 3):\nMin\nWidth\nCELL (2, 4):\nMin\nDepth\nCELL (2, 5):\nMax\nStories\nCELL (2, 6):\nMax\nHeight\nCELL (2, 7):\nMax % Lot\nCoverage\nCELL (2, 8):\nMin\nFront\nYard\nCELL (2, 9):\nMin\nSide\nYard\nCELL (2, 10):\nMin\nRear\nYard\nCELL (3, 1):\nI\nCELL (3, 2):\n20,000\nsq. ft.\nCELL (3, 3):\n100'\nCELL (3, 4):\n100'\nCELL (3, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (3, 6):\n50'\nCELL (3, 7):\nN/A\nCELL (3, 8):\n25'\nCELL (3, 9):\n20'\nCELL (3, 10):\n20'\nCELL (4, 1):\nR-A\nCELL (4, 2):\n40,000\nsq. ft. 1\nCELL (4, 3):\n150'\nCELL (4, 4):\n150'\nCELL (4, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (4, 6):\n50'\nCELL (4, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (4, 8):\n50'\nCELL (4, 9):\n20'\nCELL (4, 10):\n20'\nCELL (5, 1):\nR-A\nCELL (5, 2):\n60,000\nsq. ft. 2\nCELL (5, 3):\n200'\nCELL (5, 4):\n200'\nCELL (5, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (5, 6):\n50'\nCELL (5, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (5, 8):\n50'\nCELL (5, 9):\n20'\nCELL (5, 10):\n20'4\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"1 Public Sewer or Public Water\", 32],\n        [\"2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\", 32],\n        [\"CELL (4, 2): \\n40,000\\nsq. ft.\", 32],\n        [\"CELL (5, 2): \\n60,000\\nsq. ft.\", 32]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"From this page we can infer that the value is conditional on the presence of a public sewer or water system, and there are two different values for the current zone, depending on that.\",\n    \"answer\": \"40,000 sq ft (if public water or sewer); 60,000 sq ft (otherwise)\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 66\n\nR-A Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 123 sq ft, side length is 10 ft\n\nNEW PAGE 67\n\nR-A Zone - Senior Active Overlay\n\nmin_lot_size is 1523 sq ft\n\nDKEWKWKDS Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 20,000 sq ft\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"min_lot_size is 123 sq ft\", 66]],\n    \"rationale\": \"The section titled R-A says the answer explicitly.

General use zoning districts each have a corresponding\nconditional zoning district. Each district was formulated using goals and recommendations from the Town of\nDobson Land Use Plan.\nR-A Residential-Agricultural District\nThe intent of the R-A Residential-Agricultural District is to maintain a rural development\npattern in the extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) area where single-family housing will be\nseparated from one another by open field or wooded areas. The impact of one homeowner's\nactivities on his neighbor will be less than if the property owners were located side by side in a\nsubdivision. Consequently, the property owner may have more freedom to use his land as he\nsees fit.

Because development\nwill be on smaller lots than in the R-A District, more restrictions will be imposed on\nlandowners. Generally, these areas are not served by municipal water or sewer.\nR-15 Residential District\nThe intent of the R-15 Residential District is to provide a quiet, medium-density residential\nneighborhood inside the corporate limits that is served by both public water and sewer.\nR-8A Residential Multifamily District\nThe intent of the R-8A Multifamily Residential District is to provide areas for high density\nresidential development such as apartments and condominiums. It is expected that both\npublic water and sewer will be available within the corporate limits.\nR-MH Manufactured Home Residential District\nThe intent of the R-MH Manufactured Home Residential District is to insure that\nmanufactured home parks meet minimal development standards in order to protect the\nresidents of these parks as well as neighboring land owners.\nPR-CD Planned Residential Conditional District\nThe purpose of the PR-CD Planned Residential Conditional District is to encourage the\ndevelopment of environments which provide certain development privileges in exchange for\npreplanning and design considerations. The PR-CD provides an alternative to conventional\nsubdivision design by promoting the conservation and creation of viable, connected open\nspace and more flexible lot design options while minimizing development costs.\nO-I Office-Institution District\nThe intent of the Office-Institution District is to provide locations primarily for office and\ninstitutional development, although single-family dwellings are also permitted. Normally this\ndistrict provides a buffer between nonresidential and residential zoning districts.\nB-1 Central Business District\nThe intent of the B-1 Central Business District is to provide an area near the center of Dobson\nwhere compatible commercial and governmental uses may be established that do not infringe\non neighboring residential uses.\nB-2 Highway Business

Some land uses are of such a\nnature and scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediate area and on the entire\ncommunity, which cannot be predetermined and controlled by the standards of a general use district. In\naddition, this process will ensure compatibility with the Town's Land Use Plan and other adopted plans. The\nreview process established in this Article provides for a specific review process subject to specific conditions\nwhich mitigate concerns with the proposed development and ensure compatibility of the use with the\nsurrounding community.\n8.2 - General Requirements.\nProperty may be placed in a conditional district only in response to a petition by the owners of all the\nproperty to be included. Specific conditions applicable to these districts may be proposed by the petitioner\nor the Town, but only those conditions mutually approved by the Town and the petitioner may be\nincorporated into approval and permit requirements.

Only those uses\nand structures indicated in the approved petition and site plan shall be allowed on the subject\nparcel or parcels.\n(C) Following the approval of the petition for a conditional zoning district, the subject property shall\nbe identified on the zoning maps by the appropriate district designation. A corresponding\nconditional zoning district shall be identified by the same designation as the underlying general\nuse district followed by the letter \"C\" (ex. R-A-C). If the Town uses a color scheme identifying\nzoning districts on the official Zoning Map, then the conditional zoning district shall use the same\ncolor as the corresponding general use district.\n8.9 - Planned Residential Conditional Districts.\n(A) Purpose. The purpose of the Planned Residential Conditional District (PR-CD) is to encourage the\ndevelopment of environments which provide certain development privileges in exchange for\npreplanning and design considerations. The PR-CD provides an alternative to conventional\nsubdivision design by promoting the conservation and creation of viable, connected open space\nand more flexible lot design options while minimizing development costs. The Planned Residential\nConditional District (PR-CD) provides flexibility in utilizing new development concepts, including\nthe incorporation of a limited amount of non-residential uses. In return for development\nflexibility, additional site plan information and development conditions may be required of the\ndeveloper to assist in evaluating the suitability of a proposed PR-CD. While maximum open space\npreservation and high-quality residential development is the primary goal of PR-CDs, open space\nwithin PR-CDs must balance the need for open space preservation with an increased need for\nintegration with surrounding developments through street connectivity and compatibility with\nadjacent and internal land uses.\n(B) Minimum Size. A PR-CD shall be located on a site containing at least five (5) contiguous acres.\n(C)\nabout:blank\n59/167\n\n\nNEW PAGE 60\n6/3/24, 7:55 PM\nDobson, NC Code of Ordinances\nPre-Application Conference Required. Prior to the formal submission of a proposed PR-CD, the petitioner or\ntheir representative shall attend a pre-application conference with the Town's planning staff concerning the\nproposed development of the site. The petitioner shall be required to produce a scaled sketch site plan\nshowing the existing cultural, historic, and physical features of the site for review by the planning staff as\nwell as conditions the developer proposes to incorporate into the development. Staff may ask for additional\ninformation such as the location of prime agricultural soils, historical structures, archeological/cultural\nelements, the depth of viewshed as seen from existing public rights-of-way, the location of \"unique\"\nfeatures on the site, and the location and general specifications of any existing and proposed water/sewer\ninfrastructure.\nThe Town's Planning Staff in consultation with other departments shall comment on the site plan within\n15 days. The official plan of the PR-CD shall be submitted for review by the Planning and Zoning Board and\nthe Board of Commissioners only after the completion of the pre-application conference and the written\nresponse.\n(D) Permitted Principal Uses. PR-CDs do not have any inherent permitted or conditional uses and\ndevelopment activities are only allowed through specific conditions approved by the Board of\nCommissioners; however PR-CDs are primarily intended for single-family developments. A\nmaximum of ten percent (10%) of the total land of the development may be utilized for non-\nresidential uses. The compatibility and appropriateness of any non-residential uses proposed\nshall be carefully considered. Those uses permitted and conditions approved by the Board of\nCommissioners shall be reflected on the Conditional Zoning District Supplement issued by the\nZoning Enforcement Officer.\n(E) Relationship to Other Applicable Regulations. A PR-CD shall be subject to all applicable standards,\nprocedures, and regulations of this Ordinance unless otherwise set forth in this section.\n(F) Maximum Density. Maximum residential density shall be calculated based on the existing zoning\ndistrict the proposed PR-CD is located in. All land proposed for non-residential development shall\nbe excluded from density calculations. If all of the PR-CD or a portion of the PR-CD is unable to be\nserved by public water and sewer, minimum lot sizes and maximum density shall be determined\nin consultation with the Surry County Health Department.\n(G) Development Standards. A PR-CD shall meet the following standards:\n(1) Outside Perimeter Lot Setback Requirements. Any lot which adjoins the outside boundary of\nthe PR-CD shall be considered an outside perimeter lot. Internal street refers to a street that\nis within the boundary of the PR-CD. Adjoining street is a street which is not located within the\nPR-CD but is adjacent to the outside boundary of the PR-CD. The following setbacks shall be\nrequired for outside perimeter lots:\n(a) Lots with Access on an Internal Street. Rear yard setback requirement of the existing\nzoning district in which the PR-CD is proposed shall be required.\nabout:blank\n60/167\n\n\nNEW PAGE 61\n6/3/24,7:55 PM\nabout:blank\n61/167\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nDobson, NC Code of Ordinances\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \n(b) Lots with Access on an Adjoining Street.
