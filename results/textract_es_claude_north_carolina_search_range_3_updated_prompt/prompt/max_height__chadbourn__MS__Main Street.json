Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Main Street\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MS\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Main Street\n(MS) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Main Street (MS). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Main Street (MS)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Main Street\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Within the limits described\nabove, front setbacks will vary depending upon site conditions. Special site\nconditions such as topography, pattern of lot widths, or setbacks of existing\nbuildings on the same block permit a larger setback. Setbacks should be used in a\nmanner that encourages pedestrian activity. For example, squares or spatially\ndefined plazas within building setback areas can act as focal points for\npedestrians.\n(a.) Corners: Setback at street corners will generally replicate frontage conditions.\nSide setbacks on a minor residential street may be less than the front\ndimension.\n(2.) Side and rear setbacks will vary according to side and rear buffer requirements as\nset forth in Article 11, with a minimum 0-foot setback when no buffer is required.\n(3.) Front and rear building facades shall be generally parallel to frontage property\nlines. The fa\u00e7ade shall be determined by the massing of the building. Buildings\nin all locations should relate the principal fa\u00e7ade to the sidewalk and public space\nof the street.\n(4.) Parking shall be located primarily to the rear of the building; side-yard parking\nshall occupy no more than 35% of the primary frontage line and shall not be\nplaced in any side-yard abutting an intersecting street. Where dimensions of\nexisting lots restrict parking behind buildings, the limitations on side-yard parking\nmay be modified.\n(5.)

Building facades at street frontage lines shall be pedestrian oriented and of\npedestrian scale. The building's design shall promote pedestrian activity and\npedestrian-driven commerce. The sidewalk shall be an extension of the street\nlevel businesses' operations. As such, pedestrians should be able to preview\nbusinesses' merchandise and/or dine from the sidewalk. Business activities shall\nnot impede on the required pedestrian travel widths and shall not encroach more\nthan 5 feet into the sidewalk.\n(B.) Encroachments and Pedestrian Access to Building.\n(1.) Balconies, bay windows, arcades, awnings and porches at an upper level and their\nsupports are permitted and encouraged within the sidewalk as shown by the un-\nshaded area. Encroachments affixed\nto the building and horizontally\nprotruding more than 6\" from the face\nPARKING\nof the building must have a minimum\n7'6\" clearance from the finished\ngrade.

For buildings with flat roofs, building height shall be measured as the vertical\ndistance from the mean elevation of the existing grade to the highest finished roof\nsurface. The height of parapet walls is not counted in the building height\ncalculations and may vary depending upon the need to screen mechanical\nequipment.\n(2.) For buildings with pitched roofs, building heights shall be measured as the\nvertical distance from the mean elevation of the finished grade to a point\nrepresenting the midpoint of the peak and leave heights.\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 26\n\n\nNEW PAGE 210\n(3.) Building height to the ridge may vary depending on the roof pitch.\n(4.) Buildings shall have no less than 2 stories.

Adjacent buildings should thus be of similar scale,\nheight, and configuration to maintain compatibility with structures within the\nTown.\n(e.) Drive-through customer services, if permitted in the district, must be located\nat the rear of the building or on a side which does not abut a street to maintain\ncompatibility with structures within the Town.\n(f.)
