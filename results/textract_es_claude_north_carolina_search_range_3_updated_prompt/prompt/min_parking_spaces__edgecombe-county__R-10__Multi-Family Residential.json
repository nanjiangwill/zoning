Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Multi-Family Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-10\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Multi-Family Residential\n(R-10) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Multi-Family Residential (R-10). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Multi-Family Residential (R-10)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Multi-Family Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL (R-10) DISTRICT\nA.\nR-10 DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENT\nThe Multi-Family Residential (R-10) district is the most dense of the residential districts and allows a\nbroad range of residential use types. The R-10 district is typically configured as a single development\non one or two lots, though are also some examples of multiple lot developments throughout the\nCounty. Multi-family development is typically more dense than its immediate surroundings, and can\nalso serve as an effective transition between single-family detached development and adjacent\ncommercial or employment uses. Buildings in the R-10 district tend to have shared site access, shared\nbuilding access, common site features (like recreation space) owned in common, and centralized\nservice functions. Residential densities are slightly higher for most forms of allowable residential\ndevelopment than is permitted in the other residential districts, though multi-family density is double\nthat in the other residential districts. Uses that are potentially detrimental to residential development\nare generally discouraged in the R-10 district. In order to maintain compatibility with surrounding uses\nand ensure a high quality of development, all activities shall comply with the standards in Article 6.\nStandards.\nB.\nR 10 EXAMPLE DEVELOPMENT\nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nLAST AMENDED\nUnified Development Ordinance\nPage 157\n5.2.22\n\n\nNEW PAGE 158\nARTICLE 3.

OFFICE AND INSTITUTIONAL (OI) DISTRICT\nA.\nOI DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENT\nThe Office and Institutional (OI) District is established to accommodate office uses, institutional\nfacilities, educational uses, research and development facilities, corporate headquarters, and\nresidential and mixed uses in high quality single-building and multi-building developments. Buildings\nhave a wide range of sizes and heights, based on their function. The district also accommodates the\nancillary service uses necessary to support the predominant office and institutional development but is\nnot intended as a retail district. Retail, personal service, and other commercial uses permitted as\naccessory to an office or institutional use should not occupy more than ten percent of the floor area\nand should be configured to minimize visibility from off-site areas. The OI district also serves as a\ntransition area between higher intensity commercial uses and nearby lower density single-family\nresidential neighborhoods. In order to maintain compatibility with surrounding uses and ensure a high\nquality of development, all activities shall comply with the standards in Article 6.
