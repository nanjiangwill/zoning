Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Planned Manufactured Home and Recreational Vehicle Park\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MC\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Planned Manufactured Home and Recreational Vehicle Park\n(MC) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Planned Manufactured Home and Recreational Vehicle Park (MC). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Planned Manufactured Home and Recreational Vehicle Park (MC)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Planned Manufactured Home and Recreational Vehicle Park\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

The submission of such a master plan, and the acceptance thereof by\nCarteret County, shall not be deemed a waiver of any required subdivision, group housing or other specific requirement contained within any ordinance of\nCarteret County, but rather the submission of such plan shall only be effective as a waiver of the requirement for approval of a master plan. To the extent\nthat the master plan as submitted fails to meet any substantive requirements of density or otherwise of the revised zoning ordinance, the submission of said\nplan shall grant no rights to construct or subdivide in accordance with said plan, except to the extent that valid permits for construction are or have been\nissued prior to the effective date of the revised zoning ordinance.\n.3\nAny property designated a \"Flexible PUD\" prior to the adoption of the revised zoning ordinance shall retain all master plan approvals given prior to the date\nof adoption of the revised zoning ordinance, and all procedural prerequisites to the designation of a property as a \"Flexible PUD\" as set out in the revised\nzoning ordinance shall be waived as to such predesignated \"Flexible PUDs.\"\nThis Zoning Map of Carteret County shall be effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the 18th day of June, 1990.\n(Res. of 6-21-21 )\n1005. Jurisdiction.\nThese regulations govern the development and use of land and structures in all of the unincorporated areas of Carteret County, not to include the areas regulated\nby the Down East Conservation Ordinance (DECO) or any other governmental unit. These regulations do not apply to bona fide farms, except that non-farms may be\nregulated as per section 1007.\n(Res. of 5-18-15)\n1006. Interpretation of zoning maps.\nWhere uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various districts shown on the maps cited in section 1004, the following rules will be used to interpret\nthe maps:\n1006.1 In cases where a boundary line is located within a street or alley right-of-way, railroad or utility right-of-way or easement, canal, navigable or unnavigable\nwater body, it will be considered to be in the center of the street or alley right-of-way, railroad or utility easement, canal or water body. If the actual location of such\nright-of-way, easement, canal or water body varies slightly from the location as shown on the map, then the actual location will control.\n1006.2 Where a district boundary is shown to approximately coincide with a property line or city limit line, the property line or city limit line will be considered to be\nthe district boundary, unless otherwise indicated.\n1006.3 In cases where a district boundary does not coincide or approximately coincide with any street or alley, railroad, water body or canal, or property line, and no\ndimensions are shown, the location of the boundary will be determined by the use of the scale appearing on the map.\n1007.

Zoning affects every building and use.\nNo building, structure or land may be used or occupied, and no building, structure or part thereof may be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, enlarged, or\nstructurally altered unless in conformity with all the regulations of this ordinance for the district in which it is located, except as otherwise provided by this ordinance.\nHowever, the regulations in this ordinance do not apply to bona fide farms as defined in section 1100.\n1010. Rounding off fractions.\nWhen any requirement of this ordinance results in a fraction of a unit, a fraction of one-half or more will be rounded off and considered a whole unit. Fractions of\nless than one-half will be rounded off to the nearest lower number of units. For example, when the determination of the number of dwelling units permitted on a lot\nresults in a fraction of a dwelling unit, a fraction of one-half or more will be considered a dwelling unit and a fraction of less than one-half will be disregarded.\n1011. Lots divided by zoning district boundaries.\nDividing a lot by zoning district boundaries, also known as split zoning, is prohibited. All existing lots divided by zoning district boundaries shall be rezoned, which\nmay include Conditional rezoning, or subdivided per code requirements prior to development.\n(Res of 6-21-21)\n3 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\n\n\nNEW PAGE 4\nCarteret County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nFor the purposes of this section, development shall mean any construction on a vacant parcel, any improvements requiring a building permit that result in at least a\nfifty (50) percent increase in the gross floor area on the parcel, any improvements requiring a building permit that result in at least a fifty (50) percent increase in the\ntax assessed value of all improvements on the property, or any new earth disturbance activity (except for a bona fide agricultural activity) that totals at least one (1)\nacre at that time.\n(Amend. of 10-15-07(2))\n1012. Reduction of lot area prohibited.\nNo lot existing at the time of adoption of this ordinance may be reduced in its dimensions or area below the minimum requirements of this ordinance for the district\nin which it is located unless specifically authorized by other provisions of this ordinance.\n1013. Every lot must abut a street.\nNo building, structure or use of land for any purpose except agriculture may be placed on a lot which does not abut a street. The following sections list exceptions to\nthis rule.\n1013.1 A single-family detached dwelling may be constructed on a lot that does not abut a street, provided that the lot meets the terms of the Carteret County\nSubdivision Regulations or is a lot of record.\n1013.2 Any structure approved under the group housing ordinance is exempt from this section.\n1014. - Interpretation and application of these regulations.\nIn the interpretation and application of this ordinance, the provisions of the ordinance will be construed to be the minimum requirements adopted to promote the\npublic health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare.\n1015. - Relation of this ordinance to other ordinances.\nIt is not intended that this ordinance will in any way repeal, annul or interfere with the existing provisions of any law or ordinance except the zoning ordinance which\nthis ordinance replaces. In addition it is not intended that this ordinance will in any way repeal, annul or interfere with any rules, regulations or zoning permits which\nwere legally adopted or issued under previous ordinances for the use or development of land or structures.\n1016. Zoning boundaries over surface waters.\nSince 160D-702, as amended, permits a county to regulate development over estuarine waters and over lands covered by navigable waters owned by the state\npursuant to G.S. 146-12, within the bounds of that county, the zoning boundaries for waterfront parcels shall be extended linearly 400 feet waterward of the mean\nhigh-water mark. This water surface zoning shall not unreasonably infringe on the right to navigation protected by the federal government or on other rights, such as\nshellfishing rights, allowed by state government.\n(Res. of 6-21-21 )\n1017. Zoning district changes affecting the zoning maps.\nUpon the effective date of this ordinance, the R-50 (single-family residential district) zone shall be changed in name to RA (rural agricultural), and the C-I (planned\nmobile home and camp park district) zone shall be changed in name to MC (planned mobile home and camp park district). These changes do not constitute a change in\nthe dimensional requirements or uses permitted within these districts. The USG zoning classification, which has been shown on the official zoning map but has never\nhad any zoning requirements, shall be changed in name to P-I (port-industrial district).\n(Amend. of 9-17-12(1))\n1100. - RULES OF CONSTRUCTION AND DEFINITIONS\n1101.
