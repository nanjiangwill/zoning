Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Planned Development\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"PD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Planned Development\n(PD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Planned Development (PD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Planned Development (PD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Planned Development\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text.

Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

The list of the use types the applicant wishes to be permitted in the limited use zoning district shall\namount to a condition placed upon the land as part of the approval of the rezoning application.\n2. Applicants are strongly encouraged to keep the list of permitted use types as short as possible. The\nPlanning and Zoning Commission or City Council may suggest conditions that further reduce the range\nof proposed permitted use types during consideration of the application.\n3. No conditions, other than the list of proposed permitted uses, may be included with an application for\na limited use zoning district.\n4. The list of permitted uses shall be agreed to by both the applicant and the City Council.\n5.

PLANNED DEVELOPMENT (PD) DISTRICTS\nA. PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Planned Development (PD) and the Planned Development Downtown (PDD) districts are established\nand intended to encourage innovative land planning and site design concepts that support a high quality\nof life and achieve a high quality of development, environmental sensitivity, energy efficiency, and other\nCity goals and objectives by:\n1. Reducing or diminishing the inflexibility or uniform design that sometimes results from strict application\nof zoning and development standards designed primarily for individual lots;\n2.\nAllowing greater freedom in selecting the means of providing access, open space, and design\namenities;\n3. Allowing greater freedom in providing a well-integrated mix of residential and non-residential land\nuses in the same development, including a mix of housing types, lot sizes, and densities;\n4. Creating a system of incentives for redevelopment and infill in order to revitalize the downtown area;\n5. Promoting a vibrant public realm in the lands around downtown by placing increased emphasis on\nactive ground floor uses, pedestrian-oriented building fa\u00e7ade design, intensive use of sidewalks, and\nestablishment of public gathering areas;\n6.\nProviding for efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets and thereby\nlowering development and housing costs; and\n7.\nPromoting quality design and environmentally sensitive development that respects surrounding\nestablished land use character and respects and takes advantage of a site's natural and man-made\nfeatures, such as trees, estuaries, shorelines, special flood hazard area, and historic features.\nB. GENERAL STANDARDS FOR ALL PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS\n1. How Established\nA planned development is established in a manner similar to the establishment of a conditional zoning\ndistrict in accordance with the procedures and requirements in Section 2.4.M, Planned Development,\nand Section 3.19, Planned Development (PD) Districts.\n2. Districts Distinguished\n(AMENDED 12.3.19 UDOTA-01-20)\nThis Ordinance establishes the following two types of planned development district:\na. The basic Planned Development (PD) district, which is available to all lands in the City's jurisdiction\noutside of the area eligible for the Planned Development Downtown (PDD) district; and\nb. The Planned Development Downtown (PDD) district, which is available solely to the lands around\nthe downtown area located within the PDD-Eligibility Boundary depicted on the Official Zoning\nMap. Application for the rezoning of lands within the PDD-Eligibility Boundary to the PDD district\nshall be reviewed in accordance with the standards in this section. Applications to rezone land\nwithin the PDD-Eligibility Boundary to a zoning district other than the PDD district are hereby\ndeclared inconsistent with the City's adopted policy guidance and this Ordinance, and may not be\napproved by the City Council.\nC.\nIn cases where a portion of a lot is within the PDD eligibility boundary, the entire lot shall be\nconsidered to be within the PDD eligibility boundary.\n3. Master Plan Required\nAll development configured as a PD or PDD shall be subject to a master plan submitted and approved\nas part of the application to establish the district. The master plan shall:\na. Include a statement of planning objectives for the district;\nb. Describe the specific ways in which any modifications to the generally applicable standards in this\nOrdinance will result in a development of higher quality than would have otherwise resulted if the\ndevelopment was established without any proposed modifications to the standards in this\nOrdinance;\nC.\nIdentify the general location of individual development areas, identified by land use(s) and/or\ndevelopment density or intensity;\nd.\nDepict the general configuration and relationship of the principal elements of the proposed\ndevelopment, including general building types;\ne.\nIdentify for the entire district and each development area the acreage, types and mix of land uses,\nnumber of residential units (by use type), non-residential floor area (by use type), residential\ndensity, and non-residential intensity (floor area);\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \n3-54\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\n\nNEW PAGE 177\nCHAPTER 3 ZONING DISTRICTS\nSection 3.19 Planned Development (PD) Districts\nf.

Densities/Intensities\nThe densities for residential development and the intensities for non-residential development\napplicable in each development area of a PD or PDD district shall be as established in the master plan,\nand shall be consistent with adopted policy guidance.\n5. Dimensional Standards\nThe dimensional standards applicable in each development area of a PD or PDD district shall be as\nestablished in the master plan. The master plan shall include at least the following types of\ndimensional standards:\na. Minimum lot area;\nb. Minimum lot width;\nC. Minimum and maximum setbacks;\nd. Maximum lot coverage;\ne. Maximum building height;\nf. Maximum individual building size;\ng. Floor area ratio; and\nh. Minimum setbacks from adjoining residential development or residential zoning districts.\n6. Development Standards\na. Generally\n(AMENDED 06.21.22 UDOTA-03-22)\nAll development in a PD or PDD district shall comply with the development standards of CHAPTER\n5. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS, the subdivision and infrastructure design standards of CHAPTER\n6. SUBDIVISIONS, and the environmental protection standards in CHAPTER 7. ENVIRONMENT,\nunless modified in accordance with this section.\nb. Enhanced Landscaping\n(AMENDED 06.21.22 UDOTA-03-22; AMENDED 12.6.22 UDOTA-05-22)\nWhile not required, enhanced landscaping is one technique that can be used by a planned\ndevelopment to exceed the development quality that would otherwise result from a strict\napplication of the Ordinance requirements. Increasing the caliper size at time of planting of newly\nplanted material by an amount 50 percent or greater beyond that required by Section 5.3.F, Plant\nMaterial Specifications, in combination with any of the following additional alternatives may be\nproposed as a means of demonstrating increased development quality:\ni.\nUse of planted berms (trees and shrubs) as a means of establishing increased visual and\nacoustical separation between uses;\nii.\nEstablishment of a minimum number of new trees and shrubs that exceeds what would have\nbeen required for a traditional or non-master planned development;\niii. Exceed a minimum percentage requirement of evergreen planted materials or inclusion of\nevergreen plants where none are required;\niv.

Utilization of plants that create year-round visual interest, including winter flowering plants,\nplants that bloom more than once per year, or plants with unique leaf shapes, colors, or forms;\nor\nvi. Other alternative configuration for consideration by the Technical Review Committee.\nC. Enhanced Off-Street Parking\nWhile not required, enhanced off-street parking that includes one or more level 2 or level 3 EV\ncharging stations is one technique that can be used by a planned development to exceed the\ndevelopment quality that would otherwise result from a strict application of the Ordinance\nrequirements.\nd. Limitations\nIn no instance shall a planned development district seek to modify, waive, or reduce any of the\nfollowing standards:\ne. Redevelopment\n(AMENDED 06.21.22 UDOTA-03-22)\nIn cases where a planned development district is proposed as part of redevelopment of an existing\nsite and the existing site does not comply with the standards in subsection (c) above, the\ndevelopment contemplated in the planned development shall not be required to achieve full\ncompliance, but shall not increase the degree to which the development fails to comply with the\nstandards in subsection (c) above.\n7. Consistency with Adopted Policy Guidance\nThe PD or PDD zoning district designation, the master plan, and the terms and conditions document\nshould be consistent with the Comprehensive Land Use Plan, and any applicable functional plans and\nsmall area plans adopted by the City.\n8. Compatibility with Surrounding Areas\na. Development along the perimeter of a PD district shall be compatible with adjacent existing or\nproposed development. Where there are issues of compatibility, the master plan shall provide for\ntransition areas at the edges of the PD district that provide for appropriate buffering and/or ensure\na complementary character of uses. Determination of complementary character shall be based\non densities/intensities, lot size and dimensions, building height, building mass and scale, hours\nof operation, exterior lighting, siting of service areas, or other aspects identified by the City\nCouncil.\nb. The standards in this subsection shall only apply to lands along the edge of the PDD Eligibility\nBoundary when applied to development in the PDD district.\n9. Development Phasing Plan\nIf development in the PD or PDD district is proposed to be phased, the master plan shall include a\ndevelopment phasing plan that identifies the general sequence or phases in which the district is\nproposed to be developed, including how residential and non-residential development will be timed,\nhow infrastructure (public and private) and open space will be provided and timed, and how\ndevelopment will be coordinated with the City's capital improvements program.\n10. Conversion Schedule\na.
