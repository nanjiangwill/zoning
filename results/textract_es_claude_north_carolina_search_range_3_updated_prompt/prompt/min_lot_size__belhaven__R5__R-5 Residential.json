Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"R-5 Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R5\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If R-5 Residential\n(R5) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor R-5 Residential (R5). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"R-5 Residential (R5)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"R-5 Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

In the General Business, Highway\nBusiness, or Industrial districts, no fence shall exceed 10 feet in height.\nNo fence shall be built nor shall any vegetation be grown that significantly impairs vision within ten feet\nof a street or highway right-of-way.\n152.140 SCREENING AND BUFFER REQUIREMENTS\nMulti-family, commercial, and industrial uses may be required by the Planning Board to provide a buffer\nand/or screening as defined in this chapter. If existing vegetation is equal to or above the requirements\nof this chapter, additional vegetation may not be required.\nBuffers shall be required for solid waste collection dumpsters, which are (i) located on sites used for\nmulti-family residential, commercial, or industrial purposes and (ii) abutting a residence, residentially\nzoned lot, or street right-of-way shall be screened from the view of adjoined residences, residentially\nzoned lots, or street rights-of-way. Such screening may consist of natural vegetation, fences, walls, or\nberms and shall be installed, located, or constructed so as to create an effective screen.\nBuffers shall be required for multi-family residential uses when three (3) or more multi-family\nresidential dwelling units are proposed to be located directly abutting a property which is used for\nsingle-family residential purposes.\n152.141 FRONT YARD SETBACKS FOR DWELLINGS\nIf the average setback of existing dwellings on lots located immediately adjacent to and on both sides of\nthe vacant lot, or within 100 feet, whichever is closer, is less than the minimum required front yard\ndepth, then the Zoning Administrator or his/her designee may grant an exception to the front yard\nsetback requirement. In no manner shall the vacant lot owner's front yard be less than 50% its original\nrequired front yard depth setback according to its zoning classification. In the event that the vacant lot\nowner desires a greater reduction in the front yard setback than the exception allows, the owner may\nrequest a variance from the Board of Adjustment.\n152.142 MINIMUM LOT SIZE\nNo yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this chapter shall be reduced in dimension or area below\nthe minimum requirements set forth herein. Yards or lots created after the effective date of this chapter\nshall meet at least the minimum requirements established by this chapter, unless otherwise stated.\n152.143 NUMBER OF PRINCIPAL BUILDINGS PER LOCATION\nEvery principal building hereafter erected, established or moved shall be located on a separate lot and in\nno case shall there be more than one principal building on a lot.

All such housing shall be permitted only as disaster related emergency\nhousing and shall be utilized for a period not to exceed 180 days. It shall be unlawful to camp on any\nrights-of-way, environmental sensitive areas, beaches, or government property.\n152.145 SETBACK REQUIREMENTS EXCLUDE FENCES AND RETAINING WALLS\nThe setback requirements of these regulations shall not prohibit any necessary retaining wall or prohibit\nany wall or fence. However, within or abutting the residential district, no wall or fence shall exceed six\nfeet in height within a front or side yard and in the general business, highway business or industrial\ndistricts, no fence shall exceed ten feet in height.\n152.146 ACCESSORY BUILDINGS\n(a) No accessory building or use shall be erected in any required front or side yard within five feet\nof the rear lot line or within eight feet or any side lot line, and not separate accessory building or\nuse shall be erected within ten feet of any other accessory building or use.\n(b) No lot shall have in excess of two accessory buildings.\n(c) Carports of any type shall not encroach into the required side yard setback.\n(d) Accessory buildings may be erected in any side or rear yards provided that no separate\naccessory building.\n(e) No accessory building shall be located on the side yard required on a street side of a corner.\n152.147 Accessory Uses and Structures\nPermitted Accessory Uses\nThe uses listed in Column A, below, shall be permitted by right (unless noted otherwise) in any of the\nzoning districts set forth in Column B, below:\nAdopted 3/13/2023\n21\nCELL (1, 1): \n(A) Accessory Use\nCELL (1, 2): \n(B) Zoning Districts\nCELL (2, 1): \nAccessory Dwellings\nCELL (2, 2): \nR5, R5-M, RA, RAW\nCELL (3, 1): \nGarages or carports (non-commercial)\nCELL (3, 2): \nR5, R5-M, RA, RAW\nCELL (4, 1): \nGreenhouses (non-commercial)\nCELL (4, 2): \nR5, R5-M, RA, RAW\nCELL (5, 1): \nOff-Street parking and driveways\nCELL (5, 2): \nR5, R5-M, RA, RAW\nCELL (6, 1): \nSatellite Dishes\nCELL (6, 2): \nR5, R5-M, RA, RAW\nCELL (7, 1): \nStorage Buildings (residential)\nCELL (7, 2): \nR5, R5-M, RA, RAW\nCELL (8, 1): \nSwimming Pools\nCELL (8, 2): \nR5, R5-M, RA, RAW\nCELL (9, 1): \nAny other building or use customarily incidental to the permitted primary\nuse or building (subject to the location standards of this section)\nCELL (9, 2): \nR5, R5-M, RA, RAW\n\n\nNEW PAGE 24\nAccessory buildings or uses shall not be constructed or established on a lot until construction of the\nprincipal building has commenced or the primary use is established, except as provided in 152.148.\nAccessory buildings shall not be used for dwelling purposes, except as provided in section 152.148.\nLocation.
