Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Industrial-Rural\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"RU-I\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Industrial-Rural\n(RU-I) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Industrial-Rural (RU-I). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Industrial-Rural (RU-I)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Industrial-Rural\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

RU-I: Industrial-Rural\n1. This District is intended to accommodate uses on lands which have not been in productive agricultural or farm use in the previous five year\nperiod. Also, this District is intended to be applied only on lands not anticipated to become urban or suburban by the Land Use Plan, and\nwhich are not wetlands or environmentally sensitive lands. This District is intended to provide areas for uses of open air or extensive rather\nthan intensive character such as:\ni. Agricultural industry;\nii.\nRepositories for waste products whose composition and features require they be removed from other Zoning Districts;\niii.\nChemical extraction or energy generation from crops or woods or the wastes of same, or conversion of crops, woods, and animals to\nvarious products of use to society; and\niv. Animal slaughtering and processing operations and even incineration of animal remains.\n2. This District is intended to be used in an extremely limited manner sufficient only to meet proven needs for such generally adverse uses.\n3. Such land uses require restriction of other uses such as residential, institutional, commercial, and manufacturing where there are\nconcentrations of persons likely at any given time.\nCommentary: The Sunny Point Military Ocean Terminal's buffer zone is an illustration of how man would be expected to be limited in\naccessibility or closeness to uses in this District.\nB. I-G: Industrial-General\nThe I-G District is intended to provide locations for enterprises engaged in a broad range of manufacturing, processing, creating, repairing,\nrenovating, painting, cleaning, or assembly of goods, merchandise or equipment.

CP - Conservation and Protection\nA. Intent\nThe Conservation and Protection District (CP) is intended to be used for the permanent protection and preservation of environmentally sensitive\nlands, and historical, cultural, and archeological areas of Brunswick County. Generally, activities within a CP district are limited to very low\nintensity uses, agricultural and silvicultural activities, parks, open space and natural habitat preservation, and very limited residential uses.\nConstruction and land disturbing activities should be limited in nature and scope and should have a very low impact on the environment and the\nsurrounding setting. Public or community water or wastewater facilities are generally discouraged in order to deter development pressure.\nB. Permitted Uses\nOnly uses specifically listed in the use table in Section 5.2 as a permitted use (\"P\"), permitted subject to limited use standards (\"L\"), or permitted\nsubject to special use permit (\"SUP\") shall be allowed in a CP District.\nC. Standards\n1. Applicability\ni. The following standards shall apply to all development within a CP district with the exception of bona fide farms. However, bona fide\nfarms are encouraged to comply with these requirements to the extent possible to ensure that impacts on the land and the surrounding\nenvironment are minimal.\nii. In addition to the standards contained in this Section. All other provisions in this Ordinance and all other applicable laws shall apply,\nexcept those that are incompatible with the provisions contained herein.\n2. Dimensional Standards\nProjects shall meet the following standards.\nNotes:\n1\nAdditional Building Height above 40 feet up to a maximum height of 75 feet is allowed at the following rates:\nNon-Viewshed Protection Overlay areas at a rate of one additional foot of height for every one foot of additional yard depth (front, rear,\nand sides);\nViewshed Protection Overlay (see Section 4.12.6.) areas at a rate of one additional foot of height for every two feet of additional yard\ndepth (front, rear, and sides).\nNorth Carolina Building Codes apply.\n3. Development Standards\nIn order to reduce the impact of development on the existing natural environment, the following standards apply to all land disturbing\nactivities within a CP district:\ni.

Development Guidelines\nIn order to reduce the impact of development on the existing natural environment, the following guidelines apply to all activities within a CP\ndistrict. As guidelines, they provide an increased degree of flexibility.\ni. If development is anticipated to occur, the plan for such development should prioritize the preservation of natural habitat and sensitive\nenvironmental features such as large stands of trees, wetlands, Carolina Bays, pocosins, watercourses, marshes, and tidal areas.\nii. The use of Low Impact Design, stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) and other alternative construction principles is strongly\nencouraged.\niii. All site clearing and preparation, and construction activities should avoid removing existing trees and disturbing existing vegetation to\nthe extent possible.\niv. Although fencing is allowed, such fencing should be designed to allow for easy movement of wildlife. If more impervious fencing is\ndesired, it is recommended that such fencing be limited to the areas around inhabited or occupied structures so that remaining portions\nof the property allow easy movement of wildlife.\n(Ord. No. UDO-19-02, \u00a7 11, 9-19-19)\n4.7.2. MI - Military Installation\nA. Intent\n1. The purpose of the Military Installation District (MI) is to recognize the location of major single use and multiple use military facilities in\nBrunswick County.\n2. While federal government areas are not subject to local zoning and other codes, they occupy large land areas in the County. These areas\ntherefore are identified on the zoning map as a Special Purpose District to differentiate them from other areas that are covered by the\nregulations in this Ordinance.\n3. The main objective of this District is to identify specific resources not otherwise identified where protection can be considered in the public's\ninterest; identify interests relating to land use planning that impact County policy on industry, the environment and residential land uses in\ngeneral; minimize substantial development impacts of these facilities; and develop a coordinated, planning/zoning process to include all\nfederal entities.\nB. Permitted Principal Uses and Structures\nThe uses specified as permitted uses include any uses authorized by, and located in, official Military Installations of the U.S. Government.\nC. Development Coordination Required/Encouraged\n1. Notification Required\nWhen an ordinance amendment or modification would result in a rezoning or change or affect the list of permitted uses within five miles of a\nmilitary base, comments and analysis of the base commander shall be included in the consideration before making a final determination\n(N.C.G.S. 160D-601). Mailed notification shall be provided prior to any such action as specified in Section 9.1.B.3.iv.\n2. Coordination Encouraged\nIn areas of MI Districts not affected by military security in areas where commercial, residential, or mixed use developments are proposed,\nand in areas where joint public/private development may be explored, the federal government and Brunswick County is encouraged to\nestablish a coordinated planning process to achieve both federal and local benefits, to minimize development impacts, and to help meet the\nobjectives and policies of the Land Use Plan of Brunswick County\nOrd.
