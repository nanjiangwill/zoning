Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Wellness\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"WD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Wellness\n(WD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Wellness (WD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Wellness (WD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Wellness\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage refers solely to the maximum lot coverage of buildings for primary use and all accessory structures. Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

The building area coverage shall be the dimensional standards of the applicable zoning District (i.e., R-7500, C-LD, etc.). However, the\ndeveloped area may be increased as a result of utilizing exceptional design and/or best management practices as provided in Section 6.1,\nDesign Flexibility.

If the number of required off-street parking spaces cannot be reasonably\nprovided on the property associated with the principal use, then spaces may\nbe provided on adjacent or nearby lots, satellite parking lots may be located up\nto a half-mile (0.5 mi) from the principal use building if served by a transit line,\nshuttle, or located along a dedicated pedestrian sidewalk or greenway trail.\nWritten permission from the owner/person responsible for the satellite\nparking spaces must be provided.

Parking structures should be designed so ramps are hidden from view of the\nstreet or public right-of-way.\ne. Structures should be constructed of the same building materials as the district\nbuildings.\n4. Drive-Through Facilities:\na. Non-restaurant drive-throughs are allowed.\nb. Drive-through and stacking lanes shall not be located along facades facing a\npublic street.\nC. Drive- through and pick up windows shall be placed to the side or rear of\nbuildings and screened.\nd. Architectural elements, landscaping and/or other screening elements shall be\nused to minimize the visual impacts of the drive-through facility.\ne. Screening shall be a minimum four (4) foot height wall compatible with the\nbuilding architecture, material, color and details or a continuous compact\nevergreen hedge (36\" minimum height at the time of planting reaching 48\"\nminimum height within three years).\nf.\nThe design and location of the facility shall not impede vehicular flow or\npedestrian movement and safety.\ng. Drive-through and pick-up window canopy materials, design and color shall be\nthe same as the primary building.\nK. Loading/ Unloading Areas:\n1. Loading and unloading areas are regulated by Section 24.08.\n2. Loading and unloading activities are not permitted in the public right-of-way unless\nspecifically designated by the Town.\n3. All loading/unloading areas shall be located to the side or rear of buildings and shall\nbe screened from public view.\n4.
