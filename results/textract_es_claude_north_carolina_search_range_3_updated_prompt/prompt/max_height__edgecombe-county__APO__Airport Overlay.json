Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Airport Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"APO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Airport Overlay\n(APO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Airport Overlay (APO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Airport Overlay (APO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Airport Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

ZONING COMPLIANCE PERMIT REQUIRED\ni. The Zoning Administrator shall not issue a zoning compliance permit for development\nwithin an AO-A, AO-T, AO-H, or AO-C zone until it has been determined that the\nproposal is in compliance with these regulations.\nii. Except as specifically provided in Section 3.4.2.D, APO District Sub-Zones, no material\nchange shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise\nestablished, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit\ntherefor shall have been applied for and granted.\niii. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired,\nwith sufficient detail to allow determination of whether the resulting use, structure, or\ntree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed.
