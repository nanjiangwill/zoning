Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Agriculture\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"AG\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Agriculture\n(AG) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Agriculture (AG). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Agriculture (AG)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Agriculture\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

It is the intent\nof this district to provide and permit certain public and private heavy industrial uses and\nfacilities that incorporate hazardous materials and/or scientific technology, including\nwholesale, distribution, storage, processing, manufacturing and production. However, it\nis required that industries in this district take all necessary actions including but not\nlimited to installation of apparatus and technological equipment available to prevent\nnegative impacts on the environment and the community from the emissions of smoke,\ndust, fumes, noise and vibrations and other activities and/or products resulting from such\nhazardous industrial activities in accordance with federal, state and local regulations.\nThe Mini Farm Overlay District (MFO) permits buildings to be grouped on a site, parcel,\nor property in order to optimize the use of land and resources for both residential and\nagricultural purposes. By clustering development at a density no greater than one unit\nper developed acre, projects developed in accordance with these standards can obtain\ndensity bonuses while preserving unique natural features for agricultural use. The Mini\nFarm Overlay District mandates the dedication of both agricultural land and open space\nwith density bonuses provided as an incentive for adhering to the standards. It is the\nintent of this district to be used for new development in undeveloped outlying areas of the\nTown and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. Allowed building/lot type is Detached House.\nThe Manufactured Home Overlay District (MHO) is established to protect the standard of\nliving and neighborhood conditions. Established standards that will enable the use of\ninnovative manufactured homes with a higher aesthetic standard will invigorate these\ncommunities. Non-conforming manufactured home parks that have not received\napproval for continuation would be amortized over a period of time to allow the\nowner/operator to meet reasonable financial payback expectations in accordance with\naccepted practices in North Carolina. Existing parks could be limited to less fundamental\nstandards and specifications, while new parks are required to meet a higher standard.\nThese parks may be ideally suited for alternative designs such as Tiny House, Park\nModel and other styles of housing where installation standards are considered temporary.\nThe overlay could be expanded to apply to permanent installations of innovative\nmanufactured housing in subdivisions or parks in accordance with G.S. 160D-909.\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 6\n\n\nNEW PAGE 138\n8.4\nDistrict Development Standards and Permitted Uses Listed for Each District\nDevelopment standards are established for each of the following Primary General-Use\nDistricts to promote the orderly development of the Town of Chadbourn. The uses listed\nfor each district, are as specified in Table 8.1, Sections 1-3 appearing at the end of this\nArticle for each of the three categories of use listings as follows:\n1) Listed Use - Where a use is listed in a given district, the symbol \"L\" is entered in\nthe corresponding district column for the specific use.\n2) Use Listed with Additional Standards - Where a use requiring supplemental\nstandards and specifications in accordance with Section 10.1 of this Ordinance is\nlisted in a district, the symbol \"A\" is entered in the corresponding district column\nfor the specific use along with the reference number for the applicable\nsupplemental standard(s).\n3) Special Use - Where a use is listed in a given district, upon satisfaction of the\nrequirements established in Section 10.2 of this Ordinance, the symbol \"S\" is\nentered in the corresponding district column for the specific use.\nWhere a use is not listed within a given Primary General-Use District, such use shall not\nbe permitted.\n8.4-1 Agriculture District (AG)\n(A.) Intent. The Agriculture District (AG) is established to protect lands used for\nagricultural production, agriculturally based businesses and related activities.\nFarmland is a defining element of Chadbourn's identity and the protection of these\nlands aids in preserving the character of the Town until such time as new\ndevelopment is preferred by the Town. Listed uses are limited, with an emphasis\non uses that are agricultural in nature. Development density is very low to\nencourage preservation of agricultural lands while discouraging large lot\nresidential subdivision type development and excessive septic system utility. The\nAgriculture District can also be used to preserve open spaces.\n(B.) Listed Uses:\n(1.) Uses listed by right: See Table of Uses (Table 8.1) of this Article\n(2.)

Allowed building/lot types in the\nSingle-Family Districts are Detached House. Listed uses are restricted to Single-\nFamily, including duplex (two-family), homes and their accessory uses.\nNeighborhoods in these districts are the dominant land use in Chadbourn and are a\nmajor element in defining the character of the community. Standards for the\nSingle-Family Residential Districts promote that new development maintains the\ncharacter of the community.

Screening of a dumpster shall not be required in the Industrial District,\nunless the dumpster is located within one hundred (100) feet of an existing non-\nindustrial land use. Screening options include:\n(A.) A single opaque material wall or fence with a minimum height of 6 feet.\n(B.) A combination of opaque materials, berming, and/or evergreen landscaping spaced\nat 8 feet on center that provides the required screening effect. The combination of\nopaque materials, berming, and/or evergreen landscaping shall have a minimum\nheight of 6 feet within three (3) years of planting.\n(C.) The wall(s) of a principal or accessory structure may also count for screening.\n(D.) Chain-link fencing with woven slats of opaque material is not acceptable.\n11.6-3 Street Trees.

Existing Trees: See Section 11.9 for information regarding credits for preservation of\nexisting trees.\n(F.) No more than fifteen (15) percent of the street-planting yard may be used for\nwalkways serving individual lots, except in the MS, and MU districts. Parking,\nmerchandise display, and off-street loading are prohibited in the street-planting yard.\n11.6-4 Parking Lot Planting Areas.\n(A.) Applicability. Parking lot landscaping buffers shall be required to separate parking\nareas from adjacent uses for new and/or expanding parking lots with six (6) or more\nspaces. Required canopy trees and shrubs shall be located within the parking lot and\nadjacent to parking spaces in planting areas between rows of parking spaces, at the\nend of parking bays, in tree islands, and/or around the periphery of the parking lot.\nThe following buffer requirements shall apply to parking lots with six (6) or more\nspaces:\n(1.) A minimum of a type D buffer shall be provided for all parking lots with six (6)\nor more spaces.\n(2.)
