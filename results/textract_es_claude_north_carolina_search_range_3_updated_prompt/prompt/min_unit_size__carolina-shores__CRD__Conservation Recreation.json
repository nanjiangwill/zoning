Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Conservation Recreation\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CRD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Conservation Recreation\n(CRD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Conservation Recreation (CRD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Conservation Recreation (CRD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Conservation Recreation\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 74\nArticle 4 Zoning Districts\n4.5 Commercial Zoning Districts\n4.5.4.\nSpecial Standards in the CRD Zoning District\nD.\nOpen Space\nOpen space requirements for the residential portion of a multifamily or mixed commercial-residential\nproject shall be the same and conform to the requirements for multifamily developments in the MR-\n4-12\nCELL (1, 1):\nUse\nCELL (1, 2):\nDistrict\nCELL (1, 3):\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 4):\nMinimum\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 5):\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 6):\nMinimum\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 7):\nCELL (1, 8):\nYard\n(ft.)\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (2, 1):\nCELL (2, 2):\nCELL (2, 3):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 4):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 5):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 6):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 7):\nFront\nCELL (2, 8):\nRear\nCELL (2, 9):\nSide\nCELL (3, 1):\nAll residential, except\nCELL (3, 2):\nCRD\nCELL (3, 3):\n60\nCELL (3, 4):\n60\nCELL (3, 5):\n6,000\nCELL (3, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (3, 7):\n25\u00b3\nCELL (3, 8):\n63\nCELL (3, 9):\n51,2\nCELL (4, 1):\nmultifamily\nCELL (4, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (4, 3):\n75\nCELL (4, 4):\n75\nCELL (4, 5):\n7,500\nCELL (4, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (4, 7):\n253\nCELL (4, 8):\n253\nCELL (4, 9):\n102\nCELL (5, 1):\nMultifamily/ Mixed\nCELL (5, 2):\nCRD\nCELL (5, 3):\n100\nCELL (5, 4):\n150\nCELL (5, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (5, 6):\n15,000\nCELL (5, 7):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 8):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 9):\nCELL (6, 1):\ncommercial- residential\nCELL (6, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (6, 3):\n100\nCELL (6, 4):\n100\nCELL (6, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (6, 6):\n7,000\nCELL (6, 7):\nCELL (6, 8):\nCELL (6, 9):\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"CELL (2, 5):\\nWith\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 5):\\n6,000\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (2, 6):\\nWithout\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 6):\\n10,000\" 74]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"For district CRD, the section provides the information for min_unit_size.

Electric vehicle charging station(s) shall be permitted in a single-family garage designed to service the occupants of the home. Accessory\nsingle-family charging stations shall not exceed residential Building Code electrical limitations. Whereas, charging station(s) installed in a\nparking lot for non single-family residential use are expected to have intensive use and will be permitted to have multiple \"rapid charging\nstations\" to serve expected demand.\n(D) Battery exchange station: exchange stations are permitted in any commercial or industrial zoning district, provided, however, all other\nrequirements for the building or space the use occupies can be satisfied, such as design review, Fire Code and Building Code requirements.\nThis use is specifically prohibited in exclusively residential or conservation/recreation zoning districts.\n(E) Design criteria for commercial and multi-family development, the following criteria shall be applied to electric charging facilities.\n(1) Number required. This is an optional improvement. No minimum number of stalls applies. However, if electric vehicle stalls are\nreserved for electric vehicles, care should be taken to ensure enough spots are available for all of a site's parking needs.\n(2) Generally. Location and provision of electric vehicle parking will vary based on the design and use of the primary parking lot, keeping\nin mind flexibility will be needed in various parking lot layout options.\n(3) Signage to identify. Each charging station space should be posted with signage indicating the space is only for electric vehicle\ncharging purposes. Days and hours of operations should be included if time limits or tow away provisions are to be enforced by the owner.\n(4) Maintenance. Charging station equipment should be maintained in all respects, including the functioning of the charging equipment.\n(5) Accessibility. Where charging station equipment is provided within an adjacent pedestrian circulation area, such as a sidewalk or\naccessible route to the building entrance, charging equipment should be located so as to not interfere with accessibility.\n(6) Lighting. Where charging station equipment is installed, adequate site lighting should also be provided unless charging is for daytime\npurposes only.\n(7) Notification of station specifics. Information on the charging station identifying voltage and amperage levels and any time of use, fees\nor safety information.\n\n\nNEW PAGE 52\n(8) Avoid the most convenient parking spaces Stalls should not be located in the most convenient spots because this would encourage\nuse by non electric vehicles.\n(9) Avoid conflict with handicap spots. Stalls should generally not be located adjacent to handicap spots unless designed for\nhandicapped use.\n(10) Design for compatibility. Design should be appropriate to the location and use. Facilities should be able to be readily identified by\nelectric cars but blended into the surrounding landscape/ architecture for compatibility with the character and use of the site.\n(Ord. eff. 9-6-2012, \u00a7 7.5; Am.

Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n\u00a7 91.87 MIXED USE.\n(A) Mixed use defined. The MIXED USE OPTION is provided to allow flexibility in development requirements such as setbacks, density,\npermitted uses and the like, to accommodate the unique physical, economic, design or other characteristics of a development without\ncompromising the essential standards needed for the protection of the public interest. Mixed use developments require a special use permit,\nas specified in \u00a7 91.56, in which the primary use of land is a mix of residential and small-scale commercial uses such as retail, office, service\nand entertainment establishments. A mix of permitted uses is allowed within the same building or on the same lot or as separate uses on\nindividual parcels. This development pattern is characterized by overlapping patterns of use and activities, and clearly defined, human scale\nexternal spaces, where citizens can live, conduct business and meet freely with others. Development within the mixed use conditional use\nshall be in accordance with the standards set forth herein.\n(B) Performance standards. The UDO Administrator, Planning Board and Board of Commissioners will work cooperatively with the\napplicant in determining the appropriate performance standards for mixed use developments. The standards of the zoning district, or districts,\nin which the mixed use is located, provide general guidance in determining the standards, with consideration given to the specific\ncharacteristics and needs of the individual project. Ultimately, all performance standards such as density, permitted uses, parcel dimensional\nrequirements, lighting, landscaping, parking, signage and the like, shall be established by the Board of Commissioners upon recommendation\nof the Planning Board through issuance of the conditional use permit. The conditions specified by the conditional use permit shall be\ncompatible with the surrounding area and the objectives of this UDO. Creative design concepts are encouraged to minimize impacts on\ninfrastructure and to support environmental protection. The mixed use shall comply with \u00a7\u00a7 91.240 through 91.261, 91.270 and 91.280,\nEnvironmental Regulations and \u00a7\u00a7 91.210 through 91.229, Subdivisions.\n(C) Permitted uses.
