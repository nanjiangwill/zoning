Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Mixed Use Village Conditional Zoning\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MU-V-CZD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Mixed Use Village Conditional Zoning\n(MU-V-CZD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Mixed Use Village Conditional Zoning (MU-V-CZD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Mixed Use Village Conditional Zoning (MU-V-CZD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Mixed Use Village Conditional Zoning\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 74\nArticle 4 Zoning Districts\n4.5 Commercial Zoning Districts\n4.5.4.\nSpecial Standards in the MU-V-CZD Zoning District\nD.\nOpen Space\nOpen space requirements for the residential portion of a multifamily or mixed commercial-residential\nproject shall be the same and conform to the requirements for multifamily developments in the MR-\n4-12\nCELL (1, 1):\nUse\nCELL (1, 2):\nDistrict\nCELL (1, 3):\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 4):\nMinimum\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 5):\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 6):\nMinimum\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 7):\nCELL (1, 8):\nYard\n(ft.)\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (2, 1):\nCELL (2, 2):\nCELL (2, 3):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 4):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 5):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 6):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 7):\nFront\nCELL (2, 8):\nRear\nCELL (2, 9):\nSide\nCELL (3, 1):\nAll residential, except\nCELL (3, 2):\nMU-V-CZD\nCELL (3, 3):\n60\nCELL (3, 4):\n60\nCELL (3, 5):\n6,000\nCELL (3, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (3, 7):\n25\u00b3\nCELL (3, 8):\n63\nCELL (3, 9):\n51,2\nCELL (4, 1):\nmultifamily\nCELL (4, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (4, 3):\n75\nCELL (4, 4):\n75\nCELL (4, 5):\n7,500\nCELL (4, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (4, 7):\n253\nCELL (4, 8):\n253\nCELL (4, 9):\n102\nCELL (5, 1):\nMultifamily/ Mixed\nCELL (5, 2):\nMU-V-CZD\nCELL (5, 3):\n100\nCELL (5, 4):\n150\nCELL (5, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (5, 6):\n15,000\nCELL (5, 7):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 8):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 9):\nCELL (6, 1):\ncommercial- residential\nCELL (6, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (6, 3):\n100\nCELL (6, 4):\n100\nCELL (6, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (6, 6):\n7,000\nCELL (6, 7):\nCELL (6, 8):\nCELL (6, 9):\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"CELL (2, 5):\\nWith\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 5):\\n6,000\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (2, 6):\\nWithout\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 6):\\n10,000\" 74]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"For district MU-V-CZD, the section provides the information for min_unit_size.

The average of these two (2) spots elevations is the mean finished grade and the elevation\nfrom which height measurements are made.\n(3) The entire structure, and all portions thereof, is subject to the maximum setback height.\nExceptions:\nA. The structure or part thereof is below the allowable core height, as described in division (g) below.\nB. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted in section 3.8.3 Exceptions to Setback and Height Requirements, below.\nC. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted as provided elsewhere in this Appendix.\n(4) For purposes of applying setback and height regulations to development within an OI-3 or OI-4 zoning district or within a townhouse development or a planned development, all contiguous\nland within the district, townhouse development, or planned development shall be considered as a single zoning lot.\n(f) Maximum Core Height: Column (F) is the maximum allowable height in the interior or core area of a lot. The core height provides additional allowable height on the interior of a zoning lot based\non the horizontal distance measured away from the perimeter setback line of the lot. The allowable core height increases with the distance interior to the lot, measured from the perimeter\nsetback line at a rate described below.\n(1) In all Zoning Districts, except those explicitly named in subdivision (2), the allowable core height increases at a rate of one (1) foot in height for every two (2) feet of distance interior to the lot,\nmeasured away from the perimeter setbacks. This is equivalent to a slope of 1/2 (rise/run) or 1:2.\n(2) In the Town Center 1 to 3, Office/Institutional 3 to 4 zoning districts the allowable core height increases at the following rates:\nA. Street and interior setbacks: one (1) feet in height for every one (1) feet of distance interior to the lot, measured away from the street and interior setbacks. This is equivalent to a slope of\n1/1 (rise/run) or 1:1.\nB. Solar setbacks: one (1) feet in height for every one (1) foot and seven-tenths of a foot (1.7 feet) of distance interior to the lot, measured away from the street and interior setbacks. This is\nequivalent to a slope of 1/1.7 (rise/run) or 1:1.7.\n(3) No structure, or part thereof, shall project beyond the allowable core height of a structure or part thereof.\nExceptions:\nA. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted in section 3.8.3 Exceptions to Setback and Height Requirements, below.\nB. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted as provided elsewhere in this Appendix.\n(4) If a structure is located in the vicinity of an airport, the height limitations set forth in Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 77, or successor regulations, shall apply where such limitations are\nstricter than those established in this appendix.\n(g) Minimum Street Setback. Column (G) establishes a minimum setback from the street right-of-way line. Where a zoning lot fronts on a street with a right-of-way width not meeting the standards of\nthis appendix, street setback shall be measured from a line running parallel to the centerline of the street at a distance from such centerline equal to one-half (1/2) the standard right-of-way width\nof the street.\nException:\n(1) The town manager or town council may exempt lots from this requirement upon making one (1) of the following findings:\nA. Where a building line has already been established by existing structures along the block which are situated on lots comprising at least twenty-five (25) percent of the street frontage, the\nbuilding may be constructed at the established building line; or\nB. The existing right-of-way is adequate to encompass any anticipated need for widening of the street or other improvements and widening of the right-of-way to town standards would\ncreate nonconforming street setbacks for other structures on the street.\n(h) Minimum Interior Setback. Column (H) establishes a minimum setback measured from the interior lot lines.\nException:\n(1) The interior setback requirements may be reduced to zero (0) under certain conditions (see section 5.2.8.).\nNote:\n(2) Side setbacks are set at zero (0) in many non-residential districts in order to encourage the formation of a street wall, as is found in traditional commercial centers such as the TC district along\nFranklin Street.\n(i) Minimum Solar Setback. Column (I) establishes a minimum setback measured from north lot lines. Where a solar setback and either a street or interior setback both apply to the same portion of a\nlot line, the required minimum setback shall be the greater of the two (2).\nExceptions:\n(1) The solar setback may be reduced to zero (0) under certain conditions (see section 5.2.8).\n(2) Minimum solar setback requirements shall not apply to any structure, or part thereof, when the proposed height of the structure is ninety (90) percent, or less, of the maximum allowed\nsetback height. In such cases, the lesser interior setback may be used instead.\n(j)\nMaximum Impervious Surface Ratio. Column (J) establishes the maximum ratio of impervious surface on a lot. The maximum amount of impervious surface area is divided by multiplying the gross\nland area of the lot by the ratio established in Column (K) and as described below:\n(1) Single-family and two-family residential development: (.50)\n(2) Multifamily developments, fraternities and sororities, non-residential, or mixed-use development: (.70).\nException:\n(3) Impervious surface restrictions shall not apply to town center zoning districts.\n(k) Maximum Floor Area Ratio. Maximum floor area allowed shall be the number of square feet derived by multiplying gross land area by the applicable floor area ratio (FAR) as shown in Table 3.8.1.\nExceptions:\n(1) A maximum floor area ratio shall not apply to:\nA. Dwelling Units, Single-Family\nB. Dwelling Units, Single-Family with Accessory Apartment\nC. Dwelling Units, Single-Family with Cottage\nD. Public Cultural Facilities\n(2) For two-family dwellings on a single zoning lot, the floor area shall be .40 in all zones and overlay zones, except where the overlay zone establishes a more restrictive floor area ratio for\nduplexes.\n(3)\nFor public elementary and secondary schools, the maximum floor area ratio shall be 0.174 unless a higher floor area ratio is established in Column (L).\n43 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\n\nNEW PAGE 44\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(4) Where a lot is partially within the resource conservation district, the maximum allowable floor area of the portion of the lot outside of the resource conservation district shall be calculated\nthe sum of:\nas\nA.

The town encourages cluster developments as defined in Appendix A [Definitions]. Cluster developments, as defined in Appendix A [Definitions], require modification of lot size\nstandards; individual lots may be somewhat smaller but the sum of reductions in lot area becomes common recreation area for the benefit of all residents of the cluster development. The\nrecreation area is increased and the intensity of development is controlled. Cluster developments also allow the developer greater design flexibility and will permit reasonable use of land with\ndifficult topography.\n(b) Approval requirements. The town council may approve a cluster development in any residential district, or the HR-L or HR-M Special Districts, if it finds that:\n(1) The tract proposed for cluster development is at least two (2) acres in size.\n(2) Public, separate, water supply and sewerage connections are available for every subdivided lot.\n(3)\nThe total number of lots proposed for the tract, excluding parcels of reserved recreation area, is not greater than the number determined by multiplying the total gross land area by the\nmaximum density established in section 3.8 for that zoning district.\n(4) The recreation area reserved within the tract shall conform to the recreation area standards of section 5.5.\n(5) The minimum amount of land reserved as recreation area shall be the sum of all reductions in minimum gross land area as a result of the cluster form of development, combined with the\nminimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5. Only the minimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5 may be dedicated outside the boundaries of the land being\nsubdivided as specified in section 5.5.2.\n(c)\nReductions in lot and setback requirements. For lots created as part of a cluster development, minimum gross land area, minimum lot width, and minimum setback requirements may be reduced\nas follows:\n(1) Minimum lot size requirements specified in section 3.8 may be reduced to five thousand, five hundred (5,500) square feet gross land area.\n(2) Minimum lot width requirements specified in section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to fifty (50) feet.\n(3) Minimum street setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the street lot line forms an exterior boundary of the cluster development.\n(4)\nMinimum interior setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to eight (8) feet except where the interior lot line\nforms a boundary of the cluster development.\n(5) Minimum solar setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the north lot line forms\na\nboundary of the cluster development.\n(d) Floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations. For lots created as part of a cluster development, floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations, as shown in Table 3.8-1, shall be\ncalculated using the gross land area of the lot or the minimum lot size for the zoning district, whichever is greater.\n(Ord.

This section promotes the public health, safety and welfare of the town by promoting housing of high quality located in neighborhoods throughout the community for households of\na\nvariety of income levels, ages and sizes in order to meet the town's goal of preserving and promoting a culturally and economically diverse population in our community.\nBased upon the review and consideration of reports and analyses of the housing supply in the town, the town finds and determines that the diversity of its housing stock has declined for many reasons\nincluding increasing property values and construction costs. The town recognizes the need to provide affordable housing to households of a broad range of income levels in order to maintain a diverse\npopulation and to provide housing for those who live or work in the town. Without intervention, the trend toward rising housing prices will result in an increasingly inadequate supply of affordable housing\nfor town residents and local employees, which will have a negative impact upon the ability of local employers to maintain an adequate local work force and will otherwise be detrimental to the public health,\nsafety and welfare of the town and its residents. Since the remaining land appropriate for new residential development within the town is limited, it is essential that a reasonable proportion of such land be\ndeveloped into housing units affordable to low- and moderate-income households and working families. The town finds and determines that additional market rate development would displace and\neliminate opportunities for additional affordable housing in the town unless the restrictions on use established by this section are included. This displacement would create the following threats to the\nhealth, safety, or the general welfare of the community:\nIncreases in travel time and distances for persons who provide services or are employed in the town, but who cannot find decent, affordable shelter, which in turn increases traffic congestion,\nreduces air and water quality, and has an adverse impact on public health resulting from excessive commuting; and\nAn imbalance in population diversity; and\nInconsistency with the vision for future development and the specific policies of the town's comprehensive plan.\nThe regulations set forth in this section further a key goal of the town's comprehensive plan: to create and preserve affordable housing opportunities. The regulations also support other goals of the\ntown including the reduction of traffic congestion and associated air pollution; and the prevention of sprawl through the maintenance of the urban services boundary. Documentation exists demonstrating\nthat the construction of residential dwelling units in Chapel Hill generates need for affordable housing for workers and families. These regulations are intended to provide a structure for cooperative\nparticipation by the public and private sectors in the production of affordable housing.\n3.10.1 Applicability and Minimum Project Size.\n(a) Single-family and two-family units. This section applies to all development that includes:\n(1) At least five (5) single-family dwelling units or two-family dwelling units; or\n(2) At least five (5) single-family lots; or\n(3) Two-family lots in which six (6) or more residential units are allowed by the Chapel Hill Land Use Management Ordinance, either individually or as part of the same subdivision.\n(b) Multifamily units. This section applies to all development that includes:\n(1) New development that creates at least five (5) multifamily dwelling units; or\n(2) Any vertical mixed use building that creates at least five (5) multifamily dwelling units; or\n(3) Renovation or reconstruction of an existing building that contains multifamily dwelling units, and that increases the number of dwelling units from the number of dwelling units in the original\nstructure by at least five (5); or\n(4) Any change in use of all or part of an existing building from a nonresidential use to a residential use that has at least five (5) dwelling units.\n3.10.2 Affordable Dwelling Units or Lots Required.\n(a) General requirement. A development that is subject to this section shall provide the number of affordable dwelling units required by Table 3.10-1, below.\nTable 3.10-1 Inclusionary Zoning Requirements\n(1) The set-\n(b) Calculation of units required.\naside\n(1) For development of multifamily dwelling units:\nrequirement\nA.

Nothing required by section 3.10 shall be construed to establish rent control. Where the zoning district allows multifamily dwelling units, the applicant may substitute rental units for\nunits intended for sale, pursuant to an approved affordable housing performance agreement (see section 3.10.4, below). If rental units are added, they are added voluntarily by the developer/\nproperty owner.\n(f) Floor area.

Will further affordable housing opportunities in the town to an equivalent or greater extent than constructing affordable dwelling units on-site as required by section 3.10.2; and\nB. Will not cause the town to incur any net cost as a result of the alternative compliance mechanism; or\n(3) It is impossible to provide the units on-site because of federal or state law.\n(d) The town council, or the planning commission, in circumstances where the planning commission has final authority, may approve one or more of the following options to providing affordable\ndwelling units that are required by this section.\n(1) Land dedication. Obligations may be satisfied by dedication of land in lieu of providing affordable housing on-site, as follows:\nA. The land shall be dedicated to the town or its designee.\nB. The land shall be located within the Town of Chapel Hill's urban services boundary, and shall be suitable for development as determined by the town council.\nC.\nThe value of land to be dedicated in satisfaction of this alternative means of compliance and its suitability shall be determined, at the cost of the developer, by an independent certified\nappraiser and by such alternative and means of valuation as approved by the town council, or the planning commission, in circumstances where the planning commission has final\nauthority.\nD.\nLand deeded to the town must be zoned such as to allow construction of at least that number of dwelling units for which the obligation of construction is being satisfied by the dedication\nof land. Land so deeded to the town or its designee shall be of equivalent or greater value than the payment in lieu contribution that would be required under this section; or, if the land is\nof lesser value, dedication of the land shall be accompanied by a payment in lieu equivalent to the difference.

The town manager shall determine whether the form and content\nof the restrictions comply with this section. Off-site units shall be located within the Town of Chapel Hill or its extraterritorial jurisdiction or joint planning area. The restriction of such existing\nunits must result in the creation of units that are of equivalent value, quality, and size of the permanently affordable dwelling units which would have been constructed on-site if this\nalternative had not been utilized. Where a proposed development consists of ownership units, units created under this section shall be ownership units. The value of dwelling units created\npursuant to this section as a way of meeting the permanently affordable dwelling unit requirement shall be determined, at the expense of the developer, by a certified appraiser or by such\nalternative means of valuation as approved by the town council, or the planning commission, in circumstances where the planning commission has final authority.\n(3) Off-site construction of affordable housing within the incorporated areas of the town joint planning area or its extraterritorial jurisdiction.
