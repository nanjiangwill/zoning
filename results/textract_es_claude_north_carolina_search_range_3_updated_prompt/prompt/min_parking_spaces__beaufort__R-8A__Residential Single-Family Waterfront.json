Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential Single-Family Waterfront\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-8A\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential Single-Family Waterfront\n(R-8A) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Residential Single-Family Waterfront (R-8A). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential Single-Family Waterfront (R-8A)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential Single-Family Waterfront\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\"). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 165\n165/167\nCELL (1, 1):\nRestaurants (with drive through service)\nCELL (1, 2):\nOne (1) space for each four (4) seating\naccommodations, plus one (1) space for each\ntwo (2) employees on the shift of largest\nemployment; and Three (3) stacking spaces\nfor each drive through window.\nCELL (2, 1):\nSchool, Elementary and Middle (both public\nand private):\nCELL (2, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each classroom and\nadministrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee and one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (3, 1):\nSchool, High School (both public and private)\nCELL (3, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each fifteen (15)\nstudents for which the building was designed,\nplus one (1) parking space for each classroom\nand administrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee, plus one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (4, 1):\nShopping Centers, large and small\nCELL (4, 2):\nOne (1) space for each three hundred (300)\nsquare feet of gross floor area.\nCELL (5, 1):\nSingle Family, Duplex, Condominiums,\nManufactured Homes, and similar residential\nCELL (5, 2):\nTwo (2) spaces per dwelling unit\nCELL (6, 1):\nTerminals, Bus\nCELL (6, 2):\nOne (1) space for each employee and one (1)\nspace for each bus loading ramp and track.\nCELL (7, 1):\nStadiums, Theaters, and similar uses\ninvolving the assembling of persons:\nCELL (7, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each four (4) seats\nin the largest assembly room.

Residential Zones\nA) State Guidelines for Areas of Environmental Concern.\nAll lots shall comply with the applicable Areas of Environmental Concern (AEC) Standards,\nas amended in accordance with the State Guidelines for AECs (15 NCAC 7H) pursuant to the\nCoastal Area Management Act of 1974.\nB) Thoroughfare Rights-of-Way.\nUnless otherwise specified, buildings shall be set back at least fifty feet (50') from the right-\nof-way of major thoroughfares as depicted in the Carteret County Comprehensive\nTransportation Plan. An existing building which intrudes into the required setback may\nexpand, but additional construction shall not be placed in any required setback and all other\nprovisions of this Ordinance shall be observed.\nC) Encroachments Permitted into Required Yard Setbacks.\n1) Interior lots.\nExcept for reasonable supports, completely open carports, porches, decks, canopies, patios,\nand stairways may encroach into required side and rear yard setbacks by fifty percent\n(50%).\n2) Corner lots.\nExcept for reasonable supports, completely open carports, porches, decks, canopies, and\nstairways may encroach by seventy-five percent (75%) into any yard other than the right-\nof-way yard setback.\n3) Carports.\nIn defining carports, three sides of the carport must be left open; decorative walls, planters,\nshrubbery, or other obstructions are permitted as part of the carport or adjacent to the\ncarport as long as it does not exceed three feet (3') in height and a minimum of fifty percent\n(50%) of the area is unobstructed.\n4) Covered patios, covered decks, covered stoops, and covered porches shall not project into\nrequired side yards.\n5) Steps and open covered porches shall not project more than six feet (6') from the main\nbuilding line.\nD) Encroachments in Street Rights-of-Way in National Register Historic District. The Town\nof Beaufort was founded more than 300 years ago. As a result of surveying and other errors,\nparts of some homes in the National Register Historic District encroach in the street rights-of-\nway. Some of these homes constructed prior to 1950 contribute to the special nature of the\ndistrict reflecting the heritage and architectural history of the community. To require the\nremoval of the encroaching parts of these homes would compromise the historical and\narchitectural integrity of the district. As a result within the National Register Historic District,\na license is granted by the Town to the owners of homes with parts encroaching into street\nrights-of-way, when such encroachments were constructed prior to 1950, to continue the\nencroachment on the following conditions:\n7\n\n\nNEW PAGE 28\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\n1) The encroachment may be maintained, repaired and replaced in situ but may not be\nenlarged in any dimension, except, however, if a building is being raised to comply with\nFEMA flood elevations, the encroachment may be raised accordingly.\n2) The zoning administrator and building inspector are authorized to permit maintenance,\nrepair and replacement of the encroaching feature.\n3) No estate in a street right-of-way is being granted in this section and the license is revocable\nat the will of the Town.\n4) If an encroachment is removed and not replaced within one year, the license granted herein\nis revoked and will not be restored without action of the Board of Commissioners (BOC).\nE) Recreational Vehicles.\nRecreational vehicles may be stored on any lot in any residential zoning district provided they\nare not stored in the required setback for front yards. Recreational vehicles, while being stored\nin this area, cannot be used for sleeping, utility, office, material storage, etc.\nF) Accessory Buildings.\nAccessory buildings shall be subject to the following regulations:\n1) An accessory building which is more than sixteen feet (16') in height or which is\nstructurally attached to the principal building shall comply with all the zoning restrictions\napplicable to the principal building.\n2) An accessory building no more than sixteen feet (16') in height may occupy not more than\ntwenty-five percent (25%) of the area of a required rear yard if no part of such accessory\nbuilding is less than five feet (5') from the rear and side lot lines.\n3) An accessory building no more than sixteen feet (16') in height may be erected on any\ninterior lot in either required side yard and on a corner lot in the required side yard not\nabutting the street if no part of such accessory building is less than five feet (5') from a\nside lot line.\n4) An accessory building in the required rear yard of a corner lot shall not project beyond or\nnearer to the street than the front setback line, as extended, of the lot adjacent to thereto\nand whose front yard abuts thereon.\nG) Swimming Pools, Hot Tubs or Spas.\nPrivate swimming pools, hot tubs, or spas are permitted as accessory uses in any residential\ndistrict. No private swimming pool, hot tub, or spa in a residential district shall operate as a\nbusiness.\nH) Docks and Piers in Certain Areas of R-8, R-8A, and RS-5 Zoning Districts.\nWithin the Regulated Area:\n1) Only one residential boat dock per riparian lot is permitted. No other structure below the\nhigh water mark is permitted.\n2) Residential boat docks may contain boat slips subject to the following limitations:\n8\n\n\nNEW PAGE 29\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\na) No more than four boat slips per riparian lot with a single-family dwelling located on\nsuch lot.\nb) No more than two boat slips per riparian lot on which there is no dwelling.\nc) No more than two boat slips per dwelling unit on riparian lots used for multi-family\ndwellings, whether the multi-family dwellings are conforming or not.\n3) Residential boat docks may not include any living quarters.\n4) Residential boat docks may include roofs over permitted platform areas not to exceed four\nhundred square feet.
