Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Private-Public Service\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"PS-C\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Private-Public Service\n(PS-C) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Private-Public Service (PS-C). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Private-Public Service (PS-C)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Private-Public Service\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Each General Use\nDistrict category serves a different purpose and imposes its own set of requirements and\nrestrictions on the use of land in addition to the general requirements and restrictions imposed on\nall land or uses within the planning jurisdiction. A General Use District may be layered with an\nOverlay District.\n(A) Each district described below constitutes a General Use District.\n(1) Low Density Single-Family Residential District (R-1). The Low Density Single-Family\nResidential District is primarily intended to provide locations for low density residential and related\ntype development in areas where more intense development is not practical. These areas are not\nlikely to have public water and sewer services available and are located away from the main\ndeveloped area of Beech Mountain. The minimum required lot area will be 40,000 square feet\nunless additional land is required for adequate sewage disposal.\n(2)\nSingle-Family Residential District (R-2, R-2A). 1 The Single-Family Residential District is\nprimarily intended to provide locations for single-family residential and supporting uses in areas\nwhere public water and sewer services are available or will likely be provided in the future. This\ndistrict is further intended to protect existing single-family subdivisions from encroachment of\nincompatible land uses and thus does not allow mobile homes or mobile home parks. This district\nwill be applied within those areas designated on the Land Use Plan as Single-Family Residential\nand platted as single-family residential subdivisions.\n29 of 198\n4/30/24,\n\n\nNEW PAGE 30\nFirefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/2050bacc-5248-438d-91..\n(3) Multi-Family High Density Residential District (R-3A and R-3B). These districts are\nintended for a variety of residential uses, including single-family houses, duplexes and multi-family\nbuildings and developments, depending upon the availability of public water and sewer services.\nSome areas within these districts may not have adequate water and sewer services available for\nthe higher densities and will thus be suitable for single-family residential units. Other areas within\nthese districts will have adequate public water and sewer service available and will thus be suitable\nfor higher density uses such as multi-family residential units and Planned Unit Developments.\nThese districts also provide for various recreational and community service uses that will\ncomplement the residential development. These districts will be applied within those areas\ndesignated on the Land Use Plan as Multi-Family Residential, R-3A and R-3B. 2, 3\n(4) Commercial Service Districts (CS-1 and CS-2). The Commercial Service Districts (CS-1)\n(CS-2) are primarily intended to provide suitable locations for clustered commercial development,\nto encourage the concentration of commercial activity in those specified areas with access to major\ntraffic arteries, and to discourage strip commercial development. These districts will usually be\napplied to existing commercial developments on sites within areas designated on the Land Use\nPlan as Commercial Service Centers. These districts may also be applied to suitable areas\nadjacent to existing commercial concentrations to allow for their expansion. CS-2 shall be\ncontiguous to other commercial zones.\n(5) Private-Public Service District (PS and PS-C). The Private-Public Service District (PS) is\nprimarily intended to be an area containing a concentration of private and public service activities\nsuch as schools, recreation parks and emergency services, amidst population centers. This district\nwill apply to those areas designated on the Land Use Plan as Private-Public Service Centers.\n(6) Beech Mountain Resort District (BMR). The Beech Mountain Resort District (BMR) is\nprimarily intended to be an area used as a ski resort, theme park or similar recreational area.

WS II is an overlay district as shown on\nthe official Zoning Map primarily intended to maintain a predominantly undeveloped land use\nintensity pattern. Single-family uses, where permitted, shall be allowed at a maximum of one\ndwelling unit per acre on a project by project basis. All other residential and non-residential\ndevelopment shall be allowed a maximum of 12% built-upon area, where permitted. In addition,\ncommercial uses may occupy 5% of the balance of the watershed with a 70% built-upon area when\napproved as a special, non-residential intensity allocation (SNIA). The Zoning Administrator\nis\nauthorized to approve SNIA's consistent with the provisions of this chapter. Projects must minimize\nbuilt-upon surface area, direct storm water away from surface waters and incorporate Best\nManagement Practices to minimize water quality impacts.\n1\nLandfills and sites for the land\napplication of residuals or petroleum-contaminated soils are prohibited in the district. No activity,\nsituation, structure or land use shall be allowed within the WS-II and WS-II-C water supply\nwatersheds which poses a threat to water quality or the public health, safety and welfare. Such\nconditions may arise from (for example) inadequate on-site sewage systems, inadequate\nsedimentation and erosion control measures, the improper storage or disposal of junk, trash or\nother refuse within a buffer area, the improper management of storm water runoff or any other\nsituation found to pose a threat to water quality.\n2\n(2) Buckeye Creek Water Supply Watershed Critical Area WS // C. WS II C is an overlay\ndistrict as shown on the official Zoning Map intended to maintain a predominantly undeveloped land\nuse pattern.

These entrances may be covered porches or other architectural amenities that convey\nan impression of welcome and openness.\n(G) Color. Colors shall be natural and subdued (earth tones are recommended) and shall blend\nin well with the natural surroundings. Openings and entryways should be clearly expressed with\nchanges of texture or color. Principal building and trim colors are subject to review. Trim color shall\nrefer to any or all building's trim elements (such as leaves, soffits, overhangs and fascias).\n(1) Allowed:\na. Natural and subdued colors (earth tones).\nb.

Due to above-ground utilities, the\ntown may require the use of ornamental trees in place of large shade trees.\nb. Inclusion of existing trees in the landscape design is encouraged. Shrubbery, ground\ncover, and other planting materials shall be used to compliment the tree planting. No area of the\nstreet yard may be exposed soil, but instead shall be covered with vegetation, whether grass or\nshrubbery. The only area that shall remain uncovered is the six-foot radius surrounding the trunk of\nany tree; however, this area shall be mulched.\n(2) Existing vegetation. Existing trees and vegetation, other than exotic, non-native species,\nmay count toward meeting the requirements of this section, when such vegetation is in good\ncondition, is properly protected during development, and helps to further the purpose of the district.\nExisting vegetation that is used to meet the standards of this section shall be maintained or\nreplaced if it dies during the first year after the completion of the development.\n(3) New plant material. Regionally grown and native species of plants are preferred. Any plant\nlisted with the Agricultural Extension Office as a native plant shall be considered to be a native\nplant for these purposes. New plant material shall complement existing site vegetation, should be\nmixed with it and should be integrated with all other natural site features.\n(I) Parking lots; parking lot yards. The purpose of this section is to ensure that the Commercial\nThoroughfare Overlay District of Beech Mountain is an attractive and appealing place for residents\nand visitors. This often means that a higher priority must be placed upon being an attractive and\nfunctional place for people than being convenient for automobiles.\n(1) Parking location. Parking is encouraged to be located to the rear or sides of buildings, with\nthe building fronting on the public way. However, nothing in this section is to prevent the\nestablishment of parking in front of a building so long as the project adheres to all other relevant\nregulations. When parking is to be established in front of buildings, it is recommended that the\napplicant create and utilize on-street parking if such is approved by the NCDOT and/or the town.\n(For the purposes of this section, ON-STREET PARKING is defined as a parking area without a\ndivider between the street and the parking area, in which automobiles directly access the parking\nspaces from the road. On-street parking may be parallel, angled or straight in, as approved by the\nNCDOT and the town.)\n(J) Buffer yards.
