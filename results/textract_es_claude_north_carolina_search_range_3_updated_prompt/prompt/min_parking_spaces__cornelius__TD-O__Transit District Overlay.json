Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Transit District Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"TD-O\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Transit District Overlay\n(TD-O) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Transit District Overlay (TD-O). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Transit District Overlay (TD-O)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Transit District Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\"). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 165\n165/167\nCELL (1, 1):\nRestaurants (with drive through service)\nCELL (1, 2):\nOne (1) space for each four (4) seating\naccommodations, plus one (1) space for each\ntwo (2) employees on the shift of largest\nemployment; and Three (3) stacking spaces\nfor each drive through window.\nCELL (2, 1):\nSchool, Elementary and Middle (both public\nand private):\nCELL (2, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each classroom and\nadministrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee and one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (3, 1):\nSchool, High School (both public and private)\nCELL (3, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each fifteen (15)\nstudents for which the building was designed,\nplus one (1) parking space for each classroom\nand administrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee, plus one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (4, 1):\nShopping Centers, large and small\nCELL (4, 2):\nOne (1) space for each three hundred (300)\nsquare feet of gross floor area.\nCELL (5, 1):\nSingle Family, Duplex, Condominiums,\nManufactured Homes, and similar residential\nCELL (5, 2):\nTwo (2) spaces per dwelling unit\nCELL (6, 1):\nTerminals, Bus\nCELL (6, 2):\nOne (1) space for each employee and one (1)\nspace for each bus loading ramp and track.\nCELL (7, 1):\nStadiums, Theaters, and similar uses\ninvolving the assembling of persons:\nCELL (7, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each four (4) seats\nin the largest assembly room.

Parking requirements may be satisfied using on-street parking, shared rear-lot parking areas\nor small scale parking lots adjacent to buildings. Buildings in the village center should have similar massing,\nvolume, frontage, scale, and architectural features. Transitions from residential areas should be accomplished\nthrough proper street design.\n5.1.8: Traditional Neighborhood (TN) - REPEALED June 7, 1999\nThe TN District exists on the current zoning map, but was repealed effective June 7, 1999 and the Code\nprovisions of the district have been consolidated into the Neighborhood Residential and Neighborhood Mixed\nUse Districts.\n5.1.9: Highway Commercial (HC)\nThe Highway Commercial district is coded to provide for the location of auto-oriented and auto-dependent\nuses and/or those uses which have a definable market area which extends beyond the scale of the\nNeighborhood, Village or Town Center. The intent of these provisions is to facilitate convenient access,\nminimize traffic congestion and reduce visual clutter along certain designated commercial corridors in the\nvicinity of the I-77 Exit 28 interchange and Statesville Road (US 21).\n5.1.10: Corporate Office (CO)\nThe Corporate Office District is coded to promote the establishment and operation of office uses with limited\ncommercial and limited residential activities. These districts, in some instances, may serve as transitions\nbetween residential districts and other commercial districts, and they shall provide business centers that\nprovide office uses at increased intensities to promote economic development. The district allows sufficient\nheight to make parking decks a more feasible option and it is hoped the use of height for density will facilitate\ngreater preservation of open space and natural features on these sites. The principal means of ingress and\negress for uses in the districts shall be along collector roads, minor arterials and/or major arterials.\n5.1.11: Business Campus (BC)\nThe Business Campus district is coded to permit the development of campus-style developments that may\ninclude corporate office parks, supporting commercial, and light industrial uses. Because of the presence of a\nhigh number of employees, these developments should be designed in a manner that is pedestrian friendly.\nBusiness Campus districts should consist of institutions of varying types and coordinated office developments.\nThe Business Campus will also function in support of transit opportunities allowing workers and visitors access\nto the facility by permitting the use of parking decks and bus stops.\n5.1.12: Industrial Campus (IC)\nIndustrial Campus districts are coded to permit the development of light industries. Such developments are\ntypically too large in scale to fit within a neighborhood environment and should be buffered from surrounding\nneighborhood uses.\nTOWN OF CORNELIUS LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE\n5 - 2\n1/17/2023\n\n\nNEW PAGE 61\nCHAPTER 5 ZONING & USE REGULATIONS\nSECTION 5.2: OVERLAY DISTRICTS\n5.2.1: Lake Norman Overlay (LN-O)\nIn order to address a moderate to high land use intensity pattern, single-family residential uses are allowed at\na maximum of two (2) dwelling units per acre or 21,780 square feet excluding street right-of-way.
