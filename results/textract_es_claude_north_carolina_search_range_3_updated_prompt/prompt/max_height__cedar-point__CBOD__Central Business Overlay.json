Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Central Business Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CBOD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Central Business Overlay\n(CBOD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Central Business Overlay (CBOD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Central Business Overlay (CBOD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Central Business Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

General Requirements: The following general requirements will apply to the\noverlay district:\n(a) For the purposes of this ordinance, an overlay district is a district that\nsupplements the underlying zoning district established on the site. In\naddition to the requirements of the underlying zoning district(s), the\nrequirements herein shall apply to all new construction, additions,\nalterations or expansions to existing buildings, parking lots or vehicular\nstorage areas, unless explicitly exempted.\n(b)\nAll uses permitted in the underlying zoning districts are allowed as\nregulated by said districts.\n(c)\nThe specific development requirements of a particular overlay district shall\napply uniformly to all property within said district.\n2. Cedar Point Central Business Overlay District Established: The Cedar Point\nCentral Business Overlay District is hereby established as an overlay district.\n(a)\nBoundaries of the Cedar Point Central Business Overlay District: All\nparcels in their entirety shall be included in the overlay if any portion of the\nlot is located within a distance of 3,000 feet from the center intersecting\nnode of North Carolina Highway 58 and North Carolina Highway 24 on the\nPage 68\n\nNEW PAGE 69\nwest side of the centerline of North Carolina Highway 58. In addition, when\na proposed site plan is submitted containing multiple lots and any portion\nof any lot located within the overall development is within the boundaries\nof the overlay district, the entire development will need to meet the\nrequirements of this regulation.\n(b)\nApplicability:\ni.\nApplication: The Cedar Point Central Business Overlay District\nregulations shall apply to all principal buildings on lots or open uses of\nland constructed, reconstructed or established after\nMarch 28, 2006.1\nii.\nExemptions: The Cedar Point Central Business Overlay District\nregulations shall not apply to:\na. Single-family detached dwellings on their own lots.\nb. A change in use that does not result in a building footprint change.\nC. Those buildings and their accessory uses including parking or\nvehicular storage areas existing on March 28, 2006, whose gross\nsquare footage of building, parking area or open use of land is not\nexpanded in excess of 3,000 square feet of that which existed on\nMarch 28, 2006.\nd. Those projects that have an approved Site-Specific Development\nPlan in compliance with Chapter 3.\niii.\nExpansion of Existing Uses: For those buildings, parking areas or open\nuses of land that are expanded in excess of 3,000 square feet of their\ngross square footage after March 28, 2006, the required buffer yard\nregulations in compliance with Section 7.3 for the entire development.\n3. Review Process: All development proposals within the Cedar Point Business\nOverlay District shall submit a plan to the Planning Board to check for compliance\nwith this and any other applicable ordinances.\n(a) Development Plan - The applicant shall, at a minimum, submit plans\ncontaining data and information consistent with all other applicable\nprovisions of this ordinance.\n(b) Waiver of Overlay District Requirements - The applicant shall have the\noption of asking the Planning Board to waive certain aspects of this overlay\nif deemed necessary. The applicant must show the Planning Board and\nBoard of Commissioners that the waiver is the result of site-specific\ncondition and not the result of problems created by the property owner\nand/or developer.\n4. Design Standards: Developments shall comply with all applicable requirements\nof this regulation. In addition, the following design standards shall be followed:\n(In the event of inconsistencies, the standards contained in this section shall\ngovern.)\n(a)\nSigns\ni.\nFreestanding Signs (Figure 1):\na. Number - One freestanding sign shall be permitted per parcel.\n1 The original date of adoption of the regulation.\nPage 69\n\n\nNEW PAGE 70\nb. Height - No freestanding sign shall exceed twenty feet in height.\nFigure 1\n10 ft.\nMonument\n4 ft\n5 ft.\nSign\nGround Level\nii.\nWall Signs:\nThe maximum total area of all allowable signs on the wall of a building\nshall be equal to no more than ten percent of the area of the wall of\nwhich such sign is a part or to which each such sign is attached.\niii.\niii. Total Sign Area and Number of Signs:\nThe maximum aggregate of all allowable signs on each parcel, including\nfreestanding, building or any other signs, shall be equal to 200 square\nfeet. When a zoning parcel contains more than one principal use, the\nentire parcel shall be allowed 400 square feet of signage. The owner is\nresponsible for allocating sign space on the parcel.\niv.\nSigns shall be located such that there is at every street intersection a\nclear view of sight distance between the heights of three feet and ten\nfeet, and all signs shall be setback no less than five (5) feet from the\nright-of-way of any public street. In such case that a freestanding sign\nshall be located on the corner of two (2) rights-of-way, the sign shall\nhave a setback of fifteen (15) feet from both rights-of-way.\nV.\nNo animated sign or moving or flashing signs shall be permitted.\nvi.\nNo portable signs shall be permitted.\nvii.\nNo temporary signs shall be permitted.\nviii.\nNo projecting or suspended signs shall be permitted.\nix.\nNo inflatable signs or tethered balloons shall be permitted.\nX.\nNo beacons shall be permitted.\nxi.\nNo roof signs shall be permitted.\nxii.\nNo off-premises advertising signs (billboards) shall be permitted. Off-\npremises advertising signs existing at the time of the adoption of this\nOrdinance shall be considered conforming, and may be repaired or\nreplaced, as long as it is not abandoned or expanded in size. If the off-\npremises advertising sign is not used for a consecutive period of twelve\n(12) months, it is deemed abandoned.\nxiii.\nFlags used as promotional devices of any type, including but not limited\nto the promotion of goods, services, business establishments, events,\nPage 70\n\n\nNEW PAGE 71\netc., shall be prohibited. National, state and corporate flags may be\nflown.\nxiv.\nComputations:\na. Computation of Area of Individual Signs - The area of the sign face\n(that is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one\nface) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle,\nrectangle or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme\nlimits of the writing, representation, emblem or other display\ntogether with any material or color forming an integral part of the\nbackground of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the\nbackdrop or structure against which it is placed.\nb. Computations of Area of Multi-Faced Signs - The sign area for a\nsign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together\nthe area of all sign faces visible from any one point at the same\ntime, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure\nand are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be\ncomputed by the measurement of one of the faces.\nC.\nComputation of Height - The height of a sign shall be computed as\nthe distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of\nthe highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be\nconstrued to be the lower of:\n(1) existing grade prior to construction or\n(2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of\nany filling, berming, mounding or excavating.\nIn cases where the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined,\nsign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation\nof the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation\nof the nearest point of the crown of a public street or grade of the\nland at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the\nparcel, whichever is lower. (Amended March 23, 2010)\nd. Computation of Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area for a parcel\n- The permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a parcel\nmay not be more than 200 square feet in total, except on parcels\nwith more than one principal use where the maximum permitted\nsum of all signage can be 400 square feet.\n(b)\nExterior Lighting Standards\ni. Standards:\nThe following standards are required of all exterior lighting except the\noutdoor recreational uses specifically exempted below. Many uses have\nthe option of providing a lower light post with a non-cutoff type of\nluminaire or a higher pole, up to 40 feet, with a luminaire that totally\ncuts off light spillover at a cutoff angle smaller than 90 degrees.\na. The maximum height light post permitted is dependent upon the\namount of cutoff provided. This is designed as a protection against\nexcessive glare and light spilling over to neighboring properties.\nPage 71\n\nNEW PAGE 76\nsome cases, the Planning Board and Board of Commissioners may\nallow parking to be located in the front of the commercial structure.\nFigure 4\nNOT THIS\nTHIS\nPlace parking behind buildings.\nh. Normal landscaping and parking requirements as stated in Sections\n7.4 and 7.15 of this Ordinance shall apply to all parking areas. In\naddition, landscaped areas shall be surrounded by a concrete curb\nor other material, such as landscape timbers, in order to protect the\nlandscaped area and to define its borders.\ni. Any parcel of record on the effective date of this regulation that has\nprohibited all vehicular access based on the provisions herein shall\nbe allowed one access point at a location approved by the Planning\nBoard.\n(d)\nUtility Wiring\nWiring for utilities such as telephone, electrical, cable television, etc., or\nrelated functions shall be placed under ground.\n(e)\nBuilding Orientation\ni.\nThe primary building entrance shall be oriented towards a public street.\nii.\nThe primary entrance shall be designed for the pedestrian and be\ndistinguishable from the rest of the building. Such entrances shall\nprovide a sense of entry and add variety to the streetscape. Secondary\nentrances may be oriented toward side or rear parking lots. Service\nentrances for shipping and receiving shall be oriented away from the\npublic street.\nPage 76\n\n\nNEW PAGE 77\niii.\nBuildings should be located on the site SO that services (such as trash\ncollection, dumpsters, outbuildings) are not visible from the street.\n(f)\nScreening and Buffering\ni.\nScreening Standards\na. Dumpsters or trash-handling areas shall always be screened from\nadjacent properties and public view with a minimum six-foot high\nsolid wooden fence or solid (and finished) masonry wall with a\nsolid closeable gate. No chain link fencing may be used to comply\nwith any part of this section. Dumpsters shall not be allowed in any\nrequired setback or yard space.\nb. Dumpster or mechanical equipment may not be placed in any yard\nthat has access to a public street.\nC.\nMechanical equipment shall be screened from the public street by\nwalls, fencing and/or landscaping. Mechanical equipment on\nrooftops shall be screened from the view of the public street. No\nchain link fencing may be used to comply with any part of this\nsection.\nd. A developer may choose to substantially screen from public view\na parking area by utilizing an earthen berm, masonry wall or other\nsuitable means of screening as determined by the Planning Board.\nii.\nBuffering Standards\nWhen any commercially zoned parcel within the jurisdiction of the\nCedar Point Central Business Overlay District abuts and residentially\nzoned parcel, there shall remain a thirty-five (35) foot vegetative buffer\nto be approved by both the Planning Board and Board of\nCommissioners.\n(g)\nConstruction Standards\ni.\nType of Construction:\na. The predominate exterior building materials on a fa\u00e7ade visible\nfrom a public street shall be of brick, textured masonry unit, stucco,\nstone, wood, cement fiber material (such as \"Hardie board\"), glass\nor the equivalent. No concrete masonry units, such as concrete\nblocks or cinder blocks, are permitted when visible from a public\nstreet unless they are textured to give the appearance of rough\nstone.\nb. The use of vinyl or metal siding is prohibited. Residential\nmanufactured homes/units, non-residential manufactured\nhomes/units, mobile, modular and metal units shall be prohibited,\nexcept for temporary use during construction or for storage of\nmaterials during construction.\nii.\nBuilding Mass:\nHistorically, the buildings in Cedar Point were small and pedestrian\nscaled. Recently proposed developments include buildings which are\nmore massive with large big-box stores and expansive parking areas.\nThese developments have lost the human, intimate scale of Cedar Point.\nMany techniques in this regulation provide tools for allowing large\nPage 77\n\n\nNEW PAGE 78\ndevelopment while reducing their perceived massiveness. While the\nfootprint of new commercial development may remain large, massing\nand organization of building forms can help to retain the human scale of\nCedar Point. There is a difference between massively scaled buildings\nand monumentally scaled buildings. Monumental buildings still relate to\nthe human scale but are carefully made larger to exhibit a sense of\nimportance. Buildings such as churches and institutional buildings are\noften built with this kind of scale in mind. Massive buildings are simply\nhuge buildings that dwarf and are not intended to relate to human scale.\nAirplane hangars, for instance, relate to the scale of an airplane and are\ntherefore massive. When large retail stores become as massive as an\nairplane hangar, they lose their relationship to the human user and feel\nunfriendly.\na. Use techniques to reduce the perceived mass of large buildings.\nWhen making transitions to lower density areas, modulate the mass\nof the building to relate to smaller buildings. Heights can be greater\nif the mass is modulated and other scale techniques are adopted.\nReduce height near low density uses.\nb. Use building mass appropriate to the site. Place buildings of the\ngreatest footprint, massing, and height in activity center core areas\nor at the heart of office developments where the impact on adjacent\nuses is the least.\nC. Floor-to-floor heights of a building can have an impact on the mass\nof a building. For instance, typical ceiling heights in a residence are\n8-9 feet. First floors of office buildings or retail shops can range\nfrom 10-15 feet. Upper floors that include residential or office are\ngenerally 8-12 feet in height. Big-box retailers may have floor to\nceiling heights exceeding 15 feet. When actual or implied floor-to-\nfloor heights exceed these dimensions on the exterior, then a\nbuilding may begin to read more massive than human scaled. When\narticulating large buildings, keep these dimensions in mind.\niii.\nBuilding Size Limitations:\nParcels within the Cedar Point Business Overlay District shall be limited\nto only one commercial structure not to exceed 50,000 square feet of\ntotal structural building area, whether on one floor or multiple floors,\nincluding all attached portions, on any single parcel of land to serve as\nthe principal structure. Any additional buildings on a single lot shall\nfollow the requirements of the underlying zoning district.\niv.\nBuilding Elements and Materials:\nThis section addresses the design elements that impact the exterior\nappearance of a building including:\nroof form and articulation;\nfacade articulation;\narchitectural details;\nmaterials and textures; and\nPage 78\n\n\n Output:"}]}
