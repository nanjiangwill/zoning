Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"TRANSITION AREA BUSINESS\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"B-3-T\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If TRANSITION AREA BUSINESS\n(B-3-T) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor TRANSITION AREA BUSINESS (B-3-T). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"TRANSITION AREA BUSINESS (B-3-T)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"TRANSITION AREA BUSINESS\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 11\n\nB-3-T Zone\n\nCELL (2, 1):\nField\nCELL (2, 2):\nValue\nCELL (3, 1):\nmin_lot_size\nCELL (3, 2):\n123456 sq ft\nCELL (4, 1):\nApartment Area\nCELL (4, 2):\n10,000\n\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"CELL (3, 2):\\n123456 sq ft\", 11]],\n    \"rationale\": \"The cell that corresponds to the value for min_lot_size in this table has this answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"123456 sq ft\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 32\n\nSection 6.3 Industrial Area & Dimensional Requirements\n1 Public Sewer or Public Water\n2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\n3 For proposed warehouse/manufacturing uses 35%, for all other uses 25%, subject to\nCommission's authority to permit greater coverage based on landscape, architectural design\nand site development elements that exceed minimum standard of the Regulation\n4\nShall be in addition to requirements of 8.1.2 Landscaping and Buffers\n6-4\n\nCELL (1, 1):\nCELL (1, 2):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 3):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 4):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 5):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 6):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 7):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 8):\nTable 6.3 Area, Height, Coverage and Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (1, 10):\nCELL (2, 1):\nZone\nCELL (2, 2):\nMin\nArea\nCELL (2, 3):\nMin\nWidth\nCELL (2, 4):\nMin\nDepth\nCELL (2, 5):\nMax\nStories\nCELL (2, 6):\nMax\nHeight\nCELL (2, 7):\nMax % Lot\nCoverage\nCELL (2, 8):\nMin\nFront\nYard\nCELL (2, 9):\nMin\nSide\nYard\nCELL (2, 10):\nMin\nRear\nYard\nCELL (3, 1):\nI\nCELL (3, 2):\n20,000\nsq. ft.\nCELL (3, 3):\n100'\nCELL (3, 4):\n100'\nCELL (3, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (3, 6):\n50'\nCELL (3, 7):\nN/A\nCELL (3, 8):\n25'\nCELL (3, 9):\n20'\nCELL (3, 10):\n20'\nCELL (4, 1):\nB-3-T\nCELL (4, 2):\n40,000\nsq. ft. 1\nCELL (4, 3):\n150'\nCELL (4, 4):\n150'\nCELL (4, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (4, 6):\n50'\nCELL (4, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (4, 8):\n50'\nCELL (4, 9):\n20'\nCELL (4, 10):\n20'\nCELL (5, 1):\nB-3-T\nCELL (5, 2):\n60,000\nsq. ft. 2\nCELL (5, 3):\n200'\nCELL (5, 4):\n200'\nCELL (5, 5):\n2 1/2\nCELL (5, 6):\n50'\nCELL (5, 7):\n25%\u00b3\nCELL (5, 8):\n50'\nCELL (5, 9):\n20'\nCELL (5, 10):\n20'4\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"1 Public Sewer or Public Water\", 32],\n        [\"2 Neither Public Sewer nor Public Water\", 32],\n        [\"CELL (4, 2): \\n40,000\\nsq. ft.\", 32],\n        [\"CELL (5, 2): \\n60,000\\nsq. ft.\", 32]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"From this page we can infer that the value is conditional on the presence of a public sewer or water system, and there are two different values for the current zone, depending on that.\",\n    \"answer\": \"40,000 sq ft (if public water or sewer); 60,000 sq ft (otherwise)\"\n}\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 66\n\nB-3-T Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 123 sq ft, side length is 10 ft\n\nNEW PAGE 67\n\nB-3-T Zone - Senior Active Overlay\n\nmin_lot_size is 1523 sq ft\n\nDKEWKWKDS Zone\n\nmin_lot_size is 20,000 sq ft\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"min_lot_size is 123 sq ft\", 66]],\n    \"rationale\": \"The section titled B-3-T says the answer explicitly.

This district is designed to accommodate\ncommercial needs arising in the town's more rural neighborhoods, especially in the\njoint planning transition areas, and which are more appropriately dealt with at the\nneighborhood level than at a community or regional level. To insure compatibility\nbetween B-3-T areas and their associated rural neighborhoods, no B-3-T district shall\nbe greater than five acres, and no areas shall be zoned B-3-T if any portion of a\npre-existing business district lies within one-half mile in any direction. (AMENDED\n11/14/88)\n(9)\nO OFFICE. This district is intended to provide locations for low intensity office and\ninstitutional uses. This district is designed for parcels three (3) acres or less in size.\nRather than have new buildings constructed, it is intended and desired that any\nexisting residential structures within the district be converted and adapted to office or\ninstitutional use. In order to assure compatibility of residential conversions or new\noffice construction with existing and future residential development, specific\nperformance measures to mitigate negative impacts of office development will be\nrequired. Any development within the Office (O) district shall comply with the\nfollowing requirements:\na.\nType A screening will be required between any non-residential use and\nadjacent properties, except for openings necessary to allow pedestrian\nmovement between the office or institutional use and adjacent properties;\nb.\nTo the extent practicable, vehicle accommodation areas associated with uses\non lots in this district shall be located in the rear of buildings SO that parking\nareas are not readily visible from the streets, unless doing SO would adversely\naffect adjoining residential properties;\nC.\nWhenever a new building is erected in this district, (i) the exterior walls shall\nbe constructed of materials commonly used on the exterior walls of\nsingle-family residences (such as brick, stone, wood, or fabricated residential\nlap siding made of hardboard, vinyl, or aluminum); (ii) the pitch of the roof\nshall have a minimum vertical rise of one foot for every five feet of horizontal\nrun; provided that this requirement shall not apply to lots that have frontage\non any street where, within the same block as the property in question, at least\n75% of the buildings (in place on April 16, 1991) that front along the same\nside of the street do not have roofs that comply with this pitched roof standard;\nand (iii) windows shall be of a type commonly used in single-family\nresidences;\nPage #4\n\n\nNEW PAGE 5\nArt.

This\ndistrict is intended to provide employment near residential areas; therefore, the\nrequired development standards are intended to be compatible to adjacent residential\nuses and provide a park-like setting for employment. It is strongly encouraged that\ndevelopment in the Office/Assembly zoning district be designed SO that employees\nmay easily utilize alternative forms of transportation (such riding buses, cycling or\nwalking) to commute to their place of employment. Any development within the\nOffice/Assembly (O/A) district shall comply with the following requirements:\n(AMENDED 5/25/99; 5/28/02)\na.\nNo area less than five contiguous acres may be zoned as an Office/Assembly\ndistrict;\nb.\nThe performance standards (Article XI, Part I) applicable to 4.000\nclassification uses in business zones shall govern uses in an Office/Assembly\nzone;\nC.\nAs shown in Section 15-308, Table of Screening Requirements, screening will\nbe required between non-residential uses in the Office/Assembly district and\nadjacent residential properties;\nd. Manufacturer's specifications for proposed outdoor lighting fixtures (including\ncandlepower distribution) must be included in the submitted plans and maximum\nillumination areas must be delineated on the site plan.

IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\nCommunity's Future community planning effort, completed in May 2016. The intent of Mapping\nOur Community's Future and the HR districts is to:\n(1)\nCreate opportunities for long-term residents to continue living in the\ncommunity and to age in place;\n(2)\nPreserve the socioeconomic and cultural diversity of the neighborhood;\n(3)\nIncrease physical connections within the neighborhood, including for\npedestrians and bicyclists;\n(4)\nRespect and protect the natural character of the neighborhood;\n(5)\nEnsure that new development is consistent with neighborhood character and\nthe vision that residents have developed for its future;\n(6)\nProvide greater residential housing choice, affordability, and diversity;\n(7)\nIncrease economic opportunities within the neighborhood;\n(8)\nIncrease recreational resources within the neighborhood; and\n(9)\nEnsure that new development is adequately served by infrastructure,\nincluding streets, sidewalks, and utilities.\n(b)\nThe HR-R zoning district is designed to protect and preserve the character of\nexisting lower-density areas (minimum lot size 14,520 square feet, or no more than three lots per\nacre) within the neighborhood while providing for compatible new development, including new\nhousing choice options, and increased home occupation opportunities for residents.\n(c)\nThe HR-CC district is designed to provide for a broader range of housing and\nemployment options by concentrating new development into nodes which will balance providing\nareas for desired new uses while protecting the overall neighborhood character. Uses appropriate\nin the HR-CC district include live-work units, flex space, and low-intensity neighborhood-serving\nestablishments such as healthcare, assisted living, elder care, child care, and recreation facilities.\nProperty proposed for rezoning to an HR-CC district shall include no less than 5 contiguous acres.\nThe district may be expanded to include additional parcels of land SO long as such parcels: (i) are\ncontiguous to the district, and (ii) are the same, or part of the same, tracts or parcels of land that\nwere identified in Mapping Our Community's Future for more intensive uses. The development\nof an HR-CC district may include the recombination of existing lots and/or the subdivision of new\nlots that meet the density and dimensional standards outlined in Article XII.\nPage #6\n\n\n Output:"}]}
