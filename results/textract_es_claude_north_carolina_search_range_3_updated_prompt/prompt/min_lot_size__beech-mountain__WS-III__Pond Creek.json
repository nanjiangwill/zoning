Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Pond Creek\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"WS-III\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Pond Creek\n(WS-III) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Pond Creek (WS-III). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Pond Creek (WS-III)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Pond Creek\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found.

Each General Use\nDistrict category serves a different purpose and imposes its own set of requirements and\nrestrictions on the use of land in addition to the general requirements and restrictions imposed on\nall land or uses within the planning jurisdiction. A General Use District may be layered with an\nOverlay District.\n(A) Each district described below constitutes a General Use District.\n(1) Low Density Single-Family Residential District (R-1). The Low Density Single-Family\nResidential District is primarily intended to provide locations for low density residential and related\ntype development in areas where more intense development is not practical. These areas are not\nlikely to have public water and sewer services available and are located away from the main\ndeveloped area of Beech Mountain. The minimum required lot area will be 40,000 square feet\nunless additional land is required for adequate sewage disposal.\n(2)\nSingle-Family Residential District (R-2, R-2A). 1 The Single-Family Residential District is\nprimarily intended to provide locations for single-family residential and supporting uses in areas\nwhere public water and sewer services are available or will likely be provided in the future. This\ndistrict is further intended to protect existing single-family subdivisions from encroachment of\nincompatible land uses and thus does not allow mobile homes or mobile home parks. This district\nwill be applied within those areas designated on the Land Use Plan as Single-Family Residential\nand platted as single-family residential subdivisions.\n29 of 198\n4/30/24,\n\n\nNEW PAGE 30\nFirefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/2050bacc-5248-438d-91..\n(3) Multi-Family High Density Residential District (R-3A and R-3B). These districts are\nintended for a variety of residential uses, including single-family houses, duplexes and multi-family\nbuildings and developments, depending upon the availability of public water and sewer services.\nSome areas within these districts may not have adequate water and sewer services available for\nthe higher densities and will thus be suitable for single-family residential units. Other areas within\nthese districts will have adequate public water and sewer service available and will thus be suitable\nfor higher density uses such as multi-family residential units and Planned Unit Developments.\nThese districts also provide for various recreational and community service uses that will\ncomplement the residential development. These districts will be applied within those areas\ndesignated on the Land Use Plan as Multi-Family Residential, R-3A and R-3B. 2, 3\n(4) Commercial Service Districts (CS-1 and CS-2). The Commercial Service Districts (CS-1)\n(CS-2) are primarily intended to provide suitable locations for clustered commercial development,\nto encourage the concentration of commercial activity in those specified areas with access to major\ntraffic arteries, and to discourage strip commercial development. These districts will usually be\napplied to existing commercial developments on sites within areas designated on the Land Use\nPlan as Commercial Service Centers. These districts may also be applied to suitable areas\nadjacent to existing commercial concentrations to allow for their expansion. CS-2 shall be\ncontiguous to other commercial zones.\n(5) Private-Public Service District (PS and PS-C). The Private-Public Service District (PS) is\nprimarily intended to be an area containing a concentration of private and public service activities\nsuch as schools, recreation parks and emergency services, amidst population centers. This district\nwill apply to those areas designated on the Land Use Plan as Private-Public Service Centers.\n(6) Beech Mountain Resort District (BMR). The Beech Mountain Resort District (BMR) is\nprimarily intended to be an area used as a ski resort, theme park or similar recreational area. This\ndistrict is further intended for activities related to such use.\n4\n(7) MH Mobile Homes; 5\n(8) MP Memorial Park.\n(1989 Code, Title V, Ch. 51, Art.

Projects must minimize\nbuilt-upon surface area, direct storm water away from surface waters and incorporate Best\nManagement Practices to minimize water quality impacts.\n1\nLandfills and sites for the land\napplication of residuals or petroleum-contaminated soils are prohibited in the district. No activity,\nsituation, structure or land use shall be allowed within the WS-II and WS-II-C water supply\nwatersheds which poses a threat to water quality or the public health, safety and welfare. Such\nconditions may arise from (for example) inadequate on-site sewage systems, inadequate\nsedimentation and erosion control measures, the improper storage or disposal of junk, trash or\nother refuse within a buffer area, the improper management of storm water runoff or any other\nsituation found to pose a threat to water quality.\n2\n(2) Buckeye Creek Water Supply Watershed Critical Area WS // C. WS II C is an overlay\ndistrict as shown on the official Zoning Map intended to maintain a predominantly undeveloped land\nuse pattern.

In order to maintain a low to moderate land use intensity, single family\ndetached uses shall develop at a maximum of two dwelling units per acre (2 du/ac). All other\nresidential and non-residential development shall be allowed at a maximum of 24% built-upon area.\nIn addition, new development and expansions to existing development may occupy 10% of the\nbalance of the watershed area with up to 70% built-upon area when approved as a special intensity\nallocation (SIA).

The commercial corridor for the town is an area\npredominantly used for retail, restaurants, inns and other commercial establishments in which the\npublic is typically invited and welcomed to use and enjoy the space. This area is also the face the\ntown puts on to the public, being the area that visitors and guests are exposed to first, and the area\nfrom which their impressions about the town are generated. Good design in this area will increase\nthe value of the town's properties as a whole, and promote the town's goal as a resort destination.\nTherefore, this area has a need to ensure design characteristics that are harmonious with the\ntown's vision for the community and that enhance the quaint, mountain-town character. Accordingly,\nan overlay district has been established in which design regulations are applicable in addition to\nregulations of the underlying base district. Where provisions of this Overlay District are found to be\nin conflict with the underlying base zoning district, the more stringent regulations shall apply.\nArchitectural standards for development in the Commercial Thoroughfare Overlay District are found\nin \u00a7\u00a7 154.120 et seq.\n(C) Other.
