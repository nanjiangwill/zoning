Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Conditional Zoning\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CZ\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Conditional Zoning\n(CZ) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Conditional Zoning (CZ). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Conditional Zoning (CZ)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Conditional Zoning\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found.

Planned Development is generally larger scale projects to ensure sufficient open space can be\nincorporated into the development design. The Planned Development option provides increased design flexibility with varied development and\nhousing types, provided certain enhancements are incorporated into the design of the project.\nB. Conventional Development\nConventional development is a pattern of development that conforms with standard dimensional requirements and typically provides a majority\nof property owners with substantial area on their own property.\nDEVELOPMENT TYPES\nCONVENTIONAL\nPLANNED DEVELOPMENT\nExample Lot Yield: 308 Lots\nExample Lot Yield: 308 Lots\n4.3.1. Planned Development\nA. Intent\nThe intent of a Planned Development (PD) is to promote quality development by providing flexibility in the mixture of uses and in meeting\ndimensional and other requirements of this Ordinance. A PD utilizes exceptional design and best management practices that result in\ndevelopment that is aesthetically pleasing, promotes environmental sensitivity and makes more efficient use of the land, resulting in increased\nopen space.\nB. Planned Development Approval\nPlanned Development projects shall be approved in accordance with the Planned Development approval process found in Section 3.3.3 and the\nsite plan requirements as outlined in Article 3.\nC. Development Intensity\nThe building area coverage and number of dwelling units in a project utilizing the PD development standards shall be calculated as follows:\n1. The building area coverage shall be the dimensional standards of the applicable zoning District (i.e., R-7500, C-LD, etc.). However, the\ndeveloped area may be increased as a result of utilizing exceptional design and/or best management practices as provided in Section 6.1,\nDesign Flexibility. The extent of the allowable increase will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Planning Director (minor site plans)\nor the Planning Board (major site plans) in relation to the extent of the successful use of exceptional design and best management practices\nin the project site plan.\n2. The allowable number of dwelling units in a project shall be determined by dividing the gross site area of the development project by the\nnumber of dwelling units (density) permitted in the underlying district.\nCommentary: For example, the density for R-6000 with water and sewer is 7.3. The allowable number of units for a PD project with 20 acres\nwith an underlying R-6000 district would be up to 143 units, provided all other requirements were satisfied.\n3. Increases in the number of dwelling units permitted in a project may be considered through the density bonus provisions in this article.\nCommentary: There is no guarantee that the maximum density can be achieved on a particular site due to consideration such as required\nopen space, site area devoted to easements or roadways, and other site specific issues.\nD. Uses Permitted within Planned Developments\nUses permitted in the underlying district are permitted in Planned Developments. For residential development, the type of dwellings proposed\n(e.g., single family, multi-family, cottage style, cluster, etc.) shall be approved in conjunction with the PD approval. Mixed use projects are\nencouraged within residential and commercial Planned Developments to reduce travel and maximize the use of land. In residential districts,\n43 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\n\nNEW PAGE 44\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nnon-residential uses are allowed in approved Planned Developments as follows:\n1. Commercial and other non-residential uses within a residentially zoned PD shall be the same as those uses in the Commercial Low Density\n(C-LD) and Neighborhood Commercial (NC) Zoning Districts per Section 5.2.\n2. Business Park uses may be permitted within a PD per Section 5.2 subject to approval by the Planning Board of the specific uses. Decisions by\nthe Planning Board regarding the inclusion of Business Park uses in a PD shall be based on considerations including, but not limited to, the\ntype of proposed uses, size of the proposed operations in relation to the overall development, the character and nature of surrounding area.\n3. No more than twenty percent of the total acreage within a residentially zoned PD may be designated for non-residential, excluding golf\ncourses and other similar facilities.\n4. Non-residential uses within residentially zoned PDs shall be designed and located to be easily accessible to residents of the development. It\nis expected that such uses will also serve patrons from outside the development.\n5. Such use shall, at minimum, have one internal access to the development.\n6. Within non-residentially zoned PDs, the uses shall be the same as those uses in the underlying district along with uses in the C-LD and NC\ndistricts, including residential uses. Business Park uses may be permitted within a non-residentially zoned PDs subject to approval by the\nPlanning Board of the specific uses; provided however such specific approval of uses shall not be required for property zoned C-I or I-G.\nE. Planned Development Requirements\nPlanned Developments are subject to the site plan and improvement requirements of Article 6. Design and Performance Standards. Additionally,\nPDs are also subject to the following general requirements:\n1. Recreation Area\nOpen space and recreation area shall be provided as required in the subject district (per the PD dimensional table). See Section 6.4.4.B.\n2. Water and Wastewater\nGenerally, public or community water and wastewater service shall be required in all PD. However, the Planning Board may waive this\nrequirement during the PD approval process.\n3. Ownership of Development Site\nThe development site to be subdivided may be held in single ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, the site shall\nbe developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.\n4. PD Perimeter Compatibility\nCommentary: Generally, the perimeter buffer is required along all exterior boundaries, even if the adjacent property is vacant. This is intended\nto provide visual protection for residents of the PD and any development which may occur on adjacent properties.\nF. Buffers\n1. It is preferable that all buffers shall be a natural, undisturbed wooded area where possible, and shall count towards the provision of open\nspace for the development. See Section 6.3, Required Buffers.\n2. A project boundary buffer with a minimum opacity of 0.6 shall be required along all boundaries of a PD except portions of the project\nlocated adjoining a street or roadway. Adjustments to the buffering requirements may be allowed by the Planning Director for minor\nPlanned Developments and by the Planning board for major Planned Developments.\n3. A street buffer shall be required along all boundaries of a PD fronting on a street or roadway.\n4. Additional landscaping and buffering requirements may apply. See Section 6.2, Landscaping and Buffering.\nG. Private Utilities\n1. Provision of all utility services, including, but not limited to: gas, water, sewer, electric, cable, and telephone, shall be underground.\n2.\nAdequate easements and rights-of-way for ingress and egress for maintenance shall be provided.\nH. Street/Internal Trafficways\n1. Creative design of circulation routes and trafficways is encouraged. A base characteristic of a PUD is that the internal circulation routes or\nstreets do not follow fixed linear geometric lines as do most streets. Instead, circulation routes are curvilinear and of meandering character,\nto preserve tree and landscape features. Generous use of design elements such as curved streets, private restrictions for extremely low\nspeeds and other features to achieve slower-paced traffic movements are strongly encouraged.\n2. A minimum right-of-way of at least 35 feet in width shall be required for all internal roadways. Additionally right-of-way may be required to\naccommodate wider roads or utilities.\n3. A minimum paved street width of 20 feet shall be required for all internal two-way roadways. One-way roadways shall require a minimum\npaved street width of 14 feet.\n44 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\n\n Output:"}]}
