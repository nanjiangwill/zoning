Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-15\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential\n(R-15) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Residential (R-15). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential (R-15)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Combination Uses. When a combination use comprises two or more principal\nuses that require different types of permits (zoning or special use), then the permit authorizing\nthe combination use shall be:\na) A special use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a special use permit.\nb) A zoning permit in all other cases.\nThis is indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses by the designation Z and S in each of the columns\nadjacent to the 29.000 classification.\n16-10.10.1. Subject to Section 16-10.10.2 when a combination use in an R-6 or R-10 zoning\ndistrict consists of a residential subdivision and a multi-family development, the total density\npermissible on the lot shall be determined by having the developer indicate on the plans the\nportion of the total lot that will be developed for each purpose and calculating the density\nfor each portion as if it were a separate lot.\n16-10.10.2. Notwithstanding Section 16-12.2.2 whenever a combination use consists of a\nstandard residential subdivision and a multi-family development, and the subdivided portion\nof the tract contains lots that exceed the minimum lot size requirements set forth in Section\n16-181, but that do not exceed an average of 30,000 square feet, then the density of the\nportion of the tract developed for multi-family purposes may be increased beyond the\npermissible density calculated in accordance with Section 16-10.10.1. The increase in density\nshall be determined as follows:\na) The minimum lot size requirement for the applicable zoning district shall be subtracted\nfrom each lot that exceeds the minimum lot size, and the remainders totaled.\nb) The sum derived from the calculation in subdivision (1) shall be divided by the minimum\nlot size requirement. Fractions shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.\nc)\nThe product of the calculation in subdivision (2) shall yield the number of additional multi-\nfamily dwelling units that may be located within the portion of tract developed for multi-\nfamily purposes.\n10-5\n\n\nNEW PAGE 100\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n16-10.10.3. When a residential use is combined with a non-residential use in a business\ndistrict, the lot must have at least the minimum square footage required for the residential\nuse alone.\n16-10.10.4. When two principal uses are combined, the total amount of parking required for\nthe combination use shall be determined by cumulating the amount of parking required for\neach individual principal use according to the relative amount of space occupied by that use.\nSection 16-10.11. More Specific Use Controls. Whenever a development could fall within more\nthan one use classification in the Table of Permissible Uses, the classification that most closely\nand most specifically describes the development controls. For example, a small doctor's office\nor clinic clearly falls within the 3.110 classification (Office and service operations conducted\nentirely indoors and designed to attract customers or clients to the premises). However,\nclassification 3.130, \"Physicians and dentists offices and clinics occupying not more than 10,000\nsquare feet of gross floor area\" more specifically covers this use and therefore is controlling.\nSection 16-10.12. Short-Term Rentals. The Board finds that short-term rentals (STRs) are an\nappropriate use given the residential/resort character of Blowing Rock's planning jurisdiction,\nprovided that specific controls are in place to regulate parking, trash, noise, tenant safety, and\nother related effects thereby protecting neighborhood property values, and the health, safety,\nand the general welfare of Town citizens and visitors.\nShort-term rentals are defined as the rental, lease, or offer to make available, any attached or\ndetached residential dwelling unit, or portion thereof, by way of a rental agreement, lease,\nlicense, or any other means, (whether oral or written) for compensation or consideration, for a\nduration that is less than 28 consecutive days. The following standards shall apply to all short-\nterm rentals with the Town's planning jurisdiction:\na) A zoning permit must be initially obtained for a change in use for each dwelling unit that is to\nbe rented for a period of less than 28 days. The permit is not valid until a satisfactory\ninspection is completed.\nb) A local contact person or management company contact information must be clearly posted\non the interior of the dwelling unit, and the person/company shall be available to respond to\ncomplaints or emergencies within one (1) hour.\nc) Sufficient off-street parking must be provided for each bedroom to be rented. The parking\nspace must meet the minimum dimensional requirements in Section 16-20.6. Short-term\nrental units that exist on July 1, 2018, are grandfathered with respect to parking, but each\nbedroom added after this date requires an additional parking space.\nd) Adequate trash and recycling containers must be provided. If collection containers are kept\nin an enclosure bin, the bin must meet minimum design standards defined in the Town Code\n(ex. Placed within 6 to 12 feet of the edge of the street, opaque screening at least four feet\nhigh, etc.).\ne) The dwelling unit must be equipped with operable smoke detectors and carbon monoxide\ndetectors consistent with the NC Building Code.\nf)\nThe 911 address must be posted on the front of the house or dwelling unit with 3.5-inch\nreflective numbers (6-inch reflective number if commercial or multi-family) or on the\n10-6\n\n\nNEW PAGE 101\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nproperty according to Section 7-17 of the Town Code. The 911 address must be clearly posted\non the interior of the dwelling unit to notify tenants in case of emergency.\n16-10.12.1. In addition to those areas zoned to allow short-term rentals (CB, TC, GB, OI), there\nare other areas where short-term rentals are permissible including Chetola Resort and Royals\nOaks Condominiums (Overlay District). There are other properties that were previously\noperating short-term rentals or had permitted vested rights through Watauga or Caldwell\nCounty prior to being annexed or added to the Extraterritorial Jurisdiction. These properties\nhave a legal nonconforming status that provides the opportunity for short-term rental. Each\nproperty owner that applies for a zoning permit for short-term rental use in areas not\npermitted by right or listed herein must provide historical documentation that the\nnonconformity has been legally obtained or a vested right has been legally established under\nNCGS 160D-108.\n10-7\n\nNEW PAGE 120\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\ngas substations; water or wastewater treatment plants; reservoirs; or outdoor\nrecreational uses. Such fences or walls shall not exceed ten feet in height without specific\napproval of the Town Council.\ne) The height shall be measured at the highest point, not including columns or posts, of the\nfence or wall section as measured from the grade on the side nearest the abutting\nproperty or street. Any retaining wall or berm below the fence or wall shall be considered\nas part of the overall height. Safety railings shall not be included in height measurements.\n16-11.2.2. No fence or wall shall be constructed within or upon any street right-of-way or\neasement. In addition, no fence or wall shall be constructed within six feet of the edge of any\nstreet pavement.\n16-11.2.3. No fence or wall shall alter or impede the natural flow of water in any stream,\ncreek, drainage swale, ditch, or drainage easement.\n16-11.2.4. No wall or solid fence higher than 42 inches above grade shall be placed within the\nsight visibility triangle of any public street, private street, or driveway.\n16-11.2.5. Fences or walls shall be constructed of wood, brick, ornamental iron, chain link,\nwire, stone, or other approved masonry. Any fence or wall serving as a retaining wall shall\nbe solid concrete, rock, masonry, or wood and constructed to the standards of the State\nBuilding Code.\n16-11.2.6. Chain link or wire fences with slat weave shall be prohibited. Chain link or wire\nfences are not be permitted in the Central Business (CB), General Business (GB), or Office\nInstitutional (OI) zoning districts. A chain link or wire fence located within the required front\nyard setback in a residential zoning district shall be screened from adjacent properties and\nthe street by an opaque screen, \"Type A\", as described in Section 16-22.6 of the Land Use\nOrdinance.\n16-11.2.7. The finished side of the fence or wall shall face the abutting property. The exposed\nframing of each section of fence, if any, shall face the interior yard or property.\n16-11.2.8. The owner of the property on which the fence or wall is located is required to\nmaintain the fence or wall in a safe and attractive condition and plumb (vertical) to the\nground. Fences or walls that are not maintained in a safe manner through neglect, lack of\nrepair, manner of construction, method of placement, or otherwise shall be repaired,\nreplaced, or demolished.\n16-11.2.9. No fence or wall shall block access from doors or windows. Fences or walls shall\nbe located at least three feet from building walls except where the fences or walls project\nfrom a building wall.\n16-11.2.10. Nothing in this section shall preclude the installation of temporary fences around\nconstruction works, erected or maintained pursuant to the NC Building Code or Section 16-\n264 (Sedimentation and Erosion Control).\n11-2\n\n\nNEW PAGE 121\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n16-11.2.11. A permit shall be obtained from the Planning and Inspections Office prior to the\nconstruction or the erection of any fence or wall to assure compliance with the requirements\nof this section. The fee for the permit shall be the same as for a Miscellaneous Zoning Permit.\n16-11.2.12. The Town Council recognizes that, because of the wide range of properties to\nwhich this Section must apply, it is neither possible nor prudent to establish inflexible\nrequirements related to fence or wall design, placement, or height limitations. Therefore,\nthe Administrator may authorize deviations from the presumptive requirements for fence or\nwall design, placement, or height limitations whenever the Administrator finds that (1) such\ndeviations are necessary because of particular characteristics or circumstances associated\nwith a specific property or project; and (2) such deviations will not be detrimental to the\npublic welfare or contrary to the intent of these regulations. Whenever the Administrator\nallows or requires a deviation from the presumption requirements of this Section, that\ndeviation shall be noted on the face of the fence permit along with the reasons for allowing\nor requiring the deviation. An application for a deviation from the requirements of this\nSection that is denied by the Administrator may be appealed to the Board of Commissioners.\"\n11-3\n\n\nNEW PAGE 122\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nArticle 12 - Density and Dimensional Regulations\nSection 16-12.1.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing standard, the following minimum\nlot widths are required to satisfy the standard set forth in herein. The lot width shall be\nmeasured along a straight line connecting the points at which a line that demarcates the\nrequired setback from the street intersects with lot boundary lines at opposite sides of the\nlot.\n16-12.3.2.

If the street\nright-of-way line is readily determinable (by reference to a reworked map, set irons, or other\nmeans), the setback shall be measured from such right-of-way line. If the right-of-way is not so\ndeterminable, the setback shall be measured from the street centerline.

The board of adjustment may issue a variance to allow a reduction in the minimum\nfront yard setback if it concludes that, because of the topographic features of the lot in\nquestion, it would be impractical to build upon the lot in compliance with the front setback\nrequirements or such compliance would work an unwarranted hardship on the developer.\n16-12.4.2. Whenever a lot in a nonresidential district has a common boundary line with a lot\nin a residential district, and the property line setback requirement applicable to the\nresidential lot is greater than that applicable to the nonresidential lot, then the lot in the\nnonresidential district shall be required to observe the property line setback requirement\napplicable to the adjoining residential lot.\n12-4\nCELL (1, 1): \nZone\nCELL (1, 2): \nMinimum Distance From\nStreet Right-of-Way Line\nCELL (1, 3): \nMinimum Distance From\nStreet Right-of-Way Line\nCELL (1, 4): \nMinimum Distance From\nStreet Centerline\nCELL (1, 5): \nMinimum Distance From\nStreet Centerline\nCELL (1, 6): \nMinimum\nDistance\nFrom Lot\nBoundary\nLine\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nBuilding\nCELL (2, 3): \nSign\nCELL (2, 4): \nBuilding\nCELL (2, 5): \nSign\nCELL (2, 6): \nBuilding and\nSign\nCELL (3, 1): \nR-15\nCELL (3, 2): \n30\nCELL (3, 3): \n20.0\nCELL (3, 4): \n45\nCELL (3, 5): \n50.0\nCELL (3, 6): \n12\nCELL (4, 1): \nR-10\nCELL (4, 2): \n30\nCELL (4, 3): \n15.0\nCELL (4, 4): \n45\nCELL (4, 5): \n45.0\nCELL (4, 6): \n10\nCELL (5, 1): \nR-6\nCELL (5, 2): \n25\nCELL (5, 3): \n12.5\nCELL (5, 4): \n40\nCELL (5, 5): \n42.5\nCELL (5, 6): \n8\nCELL (6, 1): \nR-MH\nCELL (6, 2): \n25\nCELL (6, 3): \n12.5\nCELL (6, 4): \n40\nCELL (6, 5): \n42.5\nCELL (6, 6): \n8\nCELL (7, 1): \nCB\nCELL (7, 2): \nSec. 16-12.6\nCELL (7, 3): \nSec. 16-17.13\nCELL (7, 4): \nSec. 16-12.6\nCELL (7, 5): \nSec. 16-17.13\nCELL (7, 6): \nSec. 16-12.6\nCELL (8, 1): \nGB\nCELL (8, 2): \n20\nCELL (8, 3): \nSec. 16-17.13\nCELL (8, 4): \n35\nCELL (8, 5): \nSec. 16-17.13\nCELL (8, 6): \n8\nCELL (9, 1): \nOI\nCELL (9, 2): \n15\nCELL (9, 3): \nSec. 16-17.13\nCELL (9, 4): \n30\nCELL (9, 5): \nSec. 16-17.13\nCELL (9, 6): \n8\nCELL (10, 1): \nHMC\nCELL (10, 2): \n15\nCELL (10, 3): \nSec. 16-17.13\nCELL (10, 4): \n30\nCELL (10, 5): \nSec. 16-17.13\nCELL (10, 6): \n8\nCELL (11, 1): \nHSG\nCELL (11, 2): \n-\nCELL (11, 3): \nSec. 16-17.13\nCELL (11, 4): \n30\nCELL (11, 5): \nSec. 16-17.13\nCELL (11, 6): \n-\nCELL (12, 1): \nPGS\nCELL (12, 2): \n-\nCELL (12, 3): \nSec. 16-17.13\nCELL (12, 4): \n30\nCELL (12, 5): \nSec. 16-17.13\nCELL (12, 6): \n-\nCELL (13, 1): \nR-A\nCELL (13, 2): \n25\nCELL (13, 3): \n12.5\nCELL (13, 4): \n40\nCELL (13, 5): \n42.5\nCELL (13, 6): \n12\n\n\n Output:"}]}
