Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Historic\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"HD-O\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Historic\n(HD-O) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Historic (HD-O). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Historic (HD-O)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Historic\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\"). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 165\n165/167\nCELL (1, 1):\nRestaurants (with drive through service)\nCELL (1, 2):\nOne (1) space for each four (4) seating\naccommodations, plus one (1) space for each\ntwo (2) employees on the shift of largest\nemployment; and Three (3) stacking spaces\nfor each drive through window.\nCELL (2, 1):\nSchool, Elementary and Middle (both public\nand private):\nCELL (2, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each classroom and\nadministrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee and one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (3, 1):\nSchool, High School (both public and private)\nCELL (3, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each fifteen (15)\nstudents for which the building was designed,\nplus one (1) parking space for each classroom\nand administrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee, plus one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (4, 1):\nShopping Centers, large and small\nCELL (4, 2):\nOne (1) space for each three hundred (300)\nsquare feet of gross floor area.\nCELL (5, 1):\nSingle Family, Duplex, Condominiums,\nManufactured Homes, and similar residential\nCELL (5, 2):\nTwo (2) spaces per dwelling unit\nCELL (6, 1):\nTerminals, Bus\nCELL (6, 2):\nOne (1) space for each employee and one (1)\nspace for each bus loading ramp and track.\nCELL (7, 1):\nStadiums, Theaters, and similar uses\ninvolving the assembling of persons:\nCELL (7, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each four (4) seats\nin the largest assembly room.

Notice, hearing and decision.\nThe Historic District Commission shall follow statutory procedures for evidentiary hearings\nand quasi-judicial decisions in G.S. 160D-406 when approving, approving with conditions, or\ndenying a certificate of appropriateness: prior to the issuance or denial of a certificate of\nappropriateness.\nSection 10.210. Standards.\n(1)\nIn considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the Historic\nDistrict Commission shall first determine that the project is compatible with the\ndistrict as a whole in terms of size, scale, and massing, as well as maintaining a\npedestrian scale and orientation. Further, the Historic District Commission shall\napply the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation (See 36\nCode of Federal Regulations Section 67.7. Hereinafter: \"Secretary's Standards\")\nstated in Sub-section (2) and the principles and standards, referred to in Section\n10.203(2), and adopted by the Historic District Commission. Although the\nHistoric District Commission will use the \"Secretary's Standards\" as its standards,\napproval of a certificate of appropriateness by the Historic District Commission\nshould not be interpreted as approval for any other process such as the Investment\nTax Credits.\nIf the restoration/replacement of an historic feature necessitated in subsection\n(2)(f) (Secretary's Standards) below would encroach into a required yard,\nrequired setback or required buffer, the Zoning Administrator may grant an\nadministrative approval per Section 4.107(4) and 4.107(5).\n10-6\n\n\nNEW PAGE 370\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 2: HISTORIC DISTRICTS\n(Petition No. 2015-094, \u00a7 10.210,(1) 04/18/2016)\n(2)\nSecretary's Standards.\n(Petition No. 2015-094, \u00a7 10.210,(2) 04/18/2016)\n(j)\nNew additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be\n10 - 7\nCELL (1, 1): \n(a)\nCELL (1, 2): \nA property shall be used for its historical purpose or be placed in a new\nuse that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the\nbuilding and its site and environment.\nCELL (2, 1): \n(b)\nCELL (2, 2): \nThe historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved.

All structures within a historic district shall comply with the\nregulations of the underlying zoning district, except where the Historic District\nCommission, in considering an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness,\nshall find that the number of off-street parking spaces and/or design standards for\nparking lots specified in the underlying zoning district would render the site\nincompatible with the historic aspects of the district. In such case, the Historic\nDistrict Commission may recommend to the Board of Adjustment a variance to\nthe provisions of the off-street parking requirements and/or design standards. The\nBoard of Adjustment shall authorize as a variance a reduced standard concerning\noff-street parking provided it finds:\n(a)\nThat the lesser standard will not create serious problems due to increased\non-street parking; and\n(b)\nThat the lesser standard will not create a threat to the public safety.\nSection 10.211. Ordinary maintenance.\nNothing in these provisions should be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance, repair, or\nremoval of any exterior architectural feature in a historic district which does not involve a\nchange in design, material, or outer appearance nor to prevent the construction, reconstruction,\nalteration, restoration, or demolition of any such feature which the building inspector or similar\nofficial shall certify is required for public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition.\nThe Historic District Commission staff shall be consulted and/or the feature shall be well\ndocumented photographically and such documentation shall be made available to the Historic\nDistrict Commission for its files, if appropriate.\nSection 10.212. Demolition or removal.\n(1)\nAfter the designation of a historic district, no building or structure located in that\ndistrict shall be demolished or otherwise removed until the owner of the property\nhas applied for a certificate of appropriateness for demolition or removal. If the\nHistoric District Commission determines that the property does not contribute to\nthe character of the historic district because of age or structural condition, the\nHistoric District Commission may grant a certificate of appropriateness for the\nimmediate demolition or removal of the property. However, if the property is\ndetermined by the Historic District Commission to be a contributing element in\nthe district, the Historic District Commission may delay demolition or removal for\nno more than 365 days. During such 365-day period, the Historic District\nCommission may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort\n10 8\n\n\nNEW PAGE 372\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 2: HISTORIC DISTRICTS\nto find a means of preserving the building.\n(2)\nAn application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the demolition of a\nbuilding or structure within the district may not be denied. However, the effective\ndate of such a certificate may be delayed for a period of up to 365 days from the\ndate of approval. The maximum period of delay authorized by this section shall\nbe reduced by the Historic District Commission where it finds that the owner\nwould suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use of\nor return from such property by virtue of the delay. If the Historic District\nCommission finds that the building has no particular significance or value toward\nmaintaining the character of the district, it shall waive all or part of such period\nand authorize earlier demolition or removal.\n(3)\nIf the Commission has voted to recommend designation of an area as an Historic\nDistrict and final designation has not been made by City Council, the demolition\nor destruction of any building, site, or structure located in the proposed District\nmay be delayed by the Commission for a period of up to 180 days or until City\nCouncil takes final action on the designation, whichever occurs first. Should City\nCouncil approve the designation prior to the expiration of the 180-day delay\nperiod, an application for a certificate of appropriateness for demolition must then\nbe filed; however, the maximum period of delay for such demolition certificate\nshall be reduced by the Commission by the period of delay while the designation\nwas pending.\nSection 10.213. Appeal to Zoning Board of Adjustment.\n(1)\nAn appeal in the nature of certiorari may be taken by any aggrieved party to the\nZoning Board of Adjustment from the Historic District Commission's action\ngranting or denying the certificate of appropriateness pursuant to Chapter 5 of\nthese regulations.\n(2)\nAny appeal must be filed with the Board of Adjustment within thirty days from-\nreceipt of the written notice of the issuance or denial of the certificate. When\nfirst-class mail is used to deliver notice, three days shall be added to the time to\nfile the petition. An appeal from the Board of Adjustment's decision in any such\ncase shall be heard by the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County.\n(3)\nIf it is necessary to have a verbatim transcript prepared for the Board of\nAdjustment, then the petitioner shall pay for that expense and any other\nappropriate, reasonable expenses for the preparation of the record. The transcript\nmust be received by the Zoning Board of Adjustment prior to the appeal hearing\non the Historic District Commission's action granting or denying the certificate of\nappropriateness.
