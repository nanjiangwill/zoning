Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Local Historic Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"LHO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Local Historic Overlay\n(LHO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Local Historic Overlay (LHO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Local Historic Overlay (LHO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Local Historic Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

character and\npurposes of the underlying zoning district.\nB.\nEstablishment of Overlay Zoning Districts\nTable 3.8.1: Overlay Zoning Districts Established, sets out the overlay districts in this

district, the standards governing the overlay district shall control, unless otherwise stated.\n3.\nWhere land is classified into multiple overlay zoning districts and the standards governing one overlay zoning\ndistrict expressly conflict with those governing another overlay district, the more restrictive standard shall\napply.\n3.8.2.\nCOMMERCIAL FISHING OVERLAY (CFO)\nA.\nPurpose and Intent\nThe intent of the Commercial Fishing Overlay (CFO) district is to allow certain commercial fishing uses in the County\nin limited locations and under restrictive circumstances, to ensure that

purpose of home-based commercial fishing are hereby repealed and any lot\nlocated within a commercial fishing overlay district for which a permit was issued shall be considered to have\na\nzoning compliance permit allowing commercial fishing in accordance with this Ordinance.\n3.\nAll lawfully-established home-based commercial fishing uses in operation after February 4, 2019 located on\na lot outside a CFO shall be considered a nonconforming use subject to the standards in Section 8.2.\nNonconforming Uses.\nC.\nMinimum District Size\n1.\nA new CFO district shall consist of an area not less than ten contiguous acres.\n2.\nAdditions to an existing CFO district shall be made in increments of not less than one acre.\nD.\nBuilding Standards\n1.\nWithin one year of the issuance of a zoning
