Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Multiple-Family Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R3\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Multiple-Family Residential\n(R3) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Multiple-Family Residential (R3). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Multiple-Family Residential (R3)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Multiple-Family Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage refers solely to the maximum lot coverage of buildings for primary use and all accessory structures. Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

The building area coverage shall be the dimensional standards of the applicable zoning District (i.e., R-7500, C-LD, etc.). However, the\ndeveloped area may be increased as a result of utilizing exceptional design and/or best management practices as provided in Section 6.1,\nDesign Flexibility.

This calculation is for setback calculation\npurposes only and does not represent any expressed or implied taking of property.\n2. As used herein, the term \"interior lot line\" refers to lot boundaries other than those\nthat abut streets.\n3. As used herein, the term \"building\" includes any substantial structure which by\nnature of its size, scale, dimensions, bulk, or use tends to constitute a visual\nobstruction or generate activity similar to that usually associated with a building.\nWithout limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following structures shall be\ndeemed to fall within this description:\na. Gas pumps and overhead canopies or roofs.\nb. Fences running along lot boundary adjacent to public street rights-of-way if\nsuch fences exceed nine feet (9') in height and are substantially opaque.\nC.

Whenever a lot in a nonresidential district has a common boundary line with a lot in a\nresidential district, and the interior setback requirement applicable to the residential\nlot is greater than that applicable to the nonresidential lot, then the lot in the\nnonresidential district shall be required to observe the interior setback requirement\napplicable to the adjoining residential lot.\nC.

Secondary Height: If expressly allowed, the height limitation may range between the\nprimary height limitation to the secondary height limitation (which is the maximum for\nthe district), subject to the provisions below:\n1. For each foot the height of the structure exceeds the primary height limitation, the\nboundary lot setback applicable to the entire structure shall increase by one foot\n(1').\n2. For each story which exceeds the primary height limitation, the boundary lot\nsetback applicable to the entire structure shall increase by 11 feet (11').\n3.\nIn no case shall the height of a structure exceed the secondary height limitation\nestablished for the district.\nD. In all nonresidential zones and the R3 zone, all structures located within 100 feet of an\nR1 zoned property shall not exceed forty feet (40') in height.\nE. Where a multi-unit or nonresidential structure has a height in excess of twenty feet\n(20') and adjoins a low-density residential district, the structure shall meet an\nadditional setback of one-and one-half feet (1 1/2') for each foot in height above twenty\nfeet (20').\n14-10\n\n\nNEW PAGE 161\nTown of Boone\nUnified Development Ordinance\nArticle 14 Zoning Districts Regulations\nF.

The following features are not included in calculating the height of a structure for the\npurposes of applying the district height limitations set forth in this Article, except that\non a corner lot in any residential district no planting, structures, fence, wall or\nobstruction to vision more than three feet (3') in height measured from the street\ncenter line shall be placed or maintained within the triangular area formed by the\nintersection street lines and a straight line connecting points on said street lines each\nif which is twenty-five feet (25') from the point of intersection.\n1. Belfries, chimneys, church spires, cupolas, domes and similar structural\nappendages not intended or used as places of storage or occupancy; and\n2. Accessory antennas, flagpoles, and similar equipment fixtures and devices\nprovided that such features do not exceed 15% of the maximum height\nrequirements; and\n3. Except as provided at Subsection 14.19.04(F)(7)(b), parapets which do not exceed\nfive feet (5') past the maximum building height; by way of clarification, the height\nof parapets above 5' shall be counted toward the building height for purposes of\napplying building height; and\n4. Elevator and mechanical equipment and penthouses; and\n5. Utility transmission poles and cables; and\n6. Limited structures to enable recreation uses of open rooftops (Accessory Use A-\n27). As used in this provision, \"limited structure\" does not include areas that are\nsimply decking to be used for standing or sitting.\n7. The features listed above are exempt from the height limitations subject to the\nfollowing requirements:\na. Not more than one-third (1/3) of the total roof area may be consumed by\nsuch features.\nb. The features must be set back from the edge of the roof at primary and\nsecondary facades a minimum of one foot for every foot which such features\nextend above the roof surface to which they are attached.\n(Ord.

A \"family\" means individuals related by blood, marriage, domestic partnership, or\nadoption occupying a premise and living as a single, non-profit housekeeping unit,\nwhich may include live-in help but does not include roomers or boarders. A \"single,\nnon-profit housekeeping unit\" means individuals who live and cook together, as with\nor similar to a traditional family, on a single lease if renting the premises.
