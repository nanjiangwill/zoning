Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Mixed Use\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MX\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Mixed Use\n(MX) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Mixed Use (MX). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Mixed Use (MX)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Mixed Use\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING\nA. PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe purpose of this section is to ensure provision of off-street parking and loading facilities in proportion\nto the generalized parking, loading, and transportation demand of the different uses allowed by this\nOrdinance. The standards are further intended to:\n1. Provide for adequate off-street parking, off-street loading, and safe movement of vehicles into, out\nof, and through parking areas;\n2. Allow for flexibility to accommodate alternative solutions to off-street parking and loading needs,\nwhere such flexibility is consistent with the City's adopted policy guidance;\n3.\nReduce the aesthetic impact of surface parking lots in gateway corridors, downtown, and mixed-use\nareas through standards addressing on-site parking lot locations;\n4.\nAvoid excessive paved surface areas and the resulting problems associated with stormwater runoff\nand urban heat islands; and\n5. Protecting compatibility between adjacent uses of land and historic resources.\nB. APPLICABILITY\nThe standards in this section shall apply to all development in the City's jurisdiction, unless exempted in\naccordance with Section 5.1.C, Exemptions.\n1. Generally\nWhenever a building is constructed, an open-air use of land is conducted, or a principal or accessory\nuse is established, the development shall meet the requirements of this section.\n2. Additions and Expansions\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\nWhenever an existing building, open air use of land, or principal or accessory use is enlarged or\nincreased in capacity after November 1, 2019, the development shall comply with the requirements in\nSection 9.6, Nonconforming Site Features.\n3. Changes in Use\na. If the principal use changes, then the new principal use shall meet the requirements of this section,\nexcept that if the use change results in an increase of less than five percent in the required number\nof parking spaces, or less than two additional parking spaces, no additional parking spaces are\nrequired.\nb. In cases where an existing parking lot does not comply with the parking lot configuration\nrequirements of this section, changes in use shall require the parking lot's configuration to be\nbrought into compliance with these standards, to the maximum extent practicable.\n4. Addition of New Parking Spaces\n(AMENDED 6.21.22 UDOTA-3-22)\nNew off-street parking spaces added to a development, lot, or site after November 1, 2019 shall\ncomply with the standards in this section. In cases where the development, lot, or site has existing\noff-street parking spaces that do not comply with these standards, those spaces are subject to Section\n5.1.B.5, Pre-Existing Nonconforming Development. Driveways, aisles, or maneuvering areas serving\nnew off-street parking spaces or connecting new off-street parking spaces to the existing parking\nspaces established prior to November 1, 2019 shall also comply with the requirements in this section.\nNothing shall preclude the use of an administrative adjustment or alternative parking plan as needed\nto ensure continuity and practical connection between different parking areas.\n5. Pre-Existing Nonconforming Development\nLawfully-established off-street parking and loading areas established prior to November 1, 2019, that\ndo not comply with these standards shall be subject to the applicable standards in CHAPTER 9.\nINONCONFORMITIES.\nC. EXEMPTIONS\n1. The following forms of development are exempt from the requirements of this section:\na. Lawfully-established lots of record existing prior to November 1, 2019, that are 33 feet wide or\nless, contain a single-family detached residential structure, and are not served by an alley;\nb. Re-striping an existing parking lot which does not create a deficient number of parking spaces or\na nonconforming situation; and\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \n5-3\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\n\nNEW PAGE 296\nCHAPTER 5 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nSection 5.1 Off-Street Parking and Loading\nC.

OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS\n1. Parking Plan Required\nEvery application for a site plan or building permit shall include a parking plan or plot plan drawn to\nscale and fully-dimensioned as necessary in order to demonstrate compliance with the standards in\nthis Ordinance.\n2. Minimum Off-Street Parking Spaces Required\na. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces required for development shall be in accordance\nwith Table 5.1.D.9, Table of Minimum Off-Street Parking Requirements.\nb. Off-street parking shall be provided to meet the parking demand without the use of streets, except\nas specifically allowed by this section.\n3.
