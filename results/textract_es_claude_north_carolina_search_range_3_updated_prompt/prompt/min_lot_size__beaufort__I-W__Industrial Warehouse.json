Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Industrial Warehouse\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"I-W\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Industrial Warehouse\n(I-W) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Industrial Warehouse (I-W). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Industrial Warehouse (I-W)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Industrial Warehouse\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft).

Uses in this district which require potable water or\nsanitary sewer must be connected to municipal water and municipal sewer.\nC) R-8 Residential Medium Density District.\nPurpose: This residential district is established as a medium density district in which the\nprincipal use of the land is for single-family dwelling units. The regulations of this district are\nintended to provide areas of the community for those persons desiring residences in relatively\nmedium density areas. No buildings, houses, or structures, excepting noncommercial docks or\npiers as specified in section 2-H of this Ordinance, will be erected on the south side of Front\nStreet in this district. Uses in this district which require potable water or sanitary sewer must\nbe connected to municipal water and municipal sewer.\nD) R-8A Residential Single-Family Waterfront District.\nPurpose: This residential district is established to provide a medium density district area in\nwhich the principal use of the land is for single-family residences together with customary\naccessory buildings, structures and docks in conformity with sections 2-F and 2-H of this\nOrdinance. This district is identified on the Town's zoning map and is confined to the existing\nresidential portions on the south side of Front Street. Uses in this district which require potable\nwater or sanitary sewer must be connected to municipal water and municipal sewer.\nE) RC-5 Residential Cluster Development District.\nPurpose: This district is established as a medium to high density district encouraging the\npractice of residential cluster development designed to conserve land, create useable open\nspace, reduce building and infrastructure costs, and provide for more attractive and functional\ncommunities. The regulations of this district are designed to provide greater open space and\nother amenities, while relaxing minimum yard and similar regulations which would apply to a\ntraditional district. Uses in this district which require potable water or sanitary sewer must be\nconnected to municipal water and municipal sewer.\n62\n\n\nNEW PAGE 83\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\nF) RS-5 Residential Single-Family 5 Development District.\nPurpose: This residential district classification is intended for existing or older neighborhoods\ncharacterized by single-family residences on relatively smaller lots and provides reduced\nsetback requirements and a defined street orientation. The purpose of this district is to provide\nrelief to existing lots of record which make them difficult to be developed as single-family\nresidences. The RS-5 district has a fifty percent (50%) lot coverage restriction which must be\nmaintained. No buildings, houses, or structures, excepting noncommercial docks or piers as\nspecified in section 2-H of this Ordinance, will be erected on the south side of Front Street in\nthis district. Uses in this district which require potable water or sanitary sewer must be\nconnected to municipal water and municipal sewer.\nG) TCA Townhomes, Condominiums, Apartments District.\nPurpose: This district is established to provide a high density district in which the primary uses\nare multi-family residences and duplexes. Uses in this district which require potable water or\nsanitary sewer must be connected to municipal water and municipal sewer.\nH) TR Transitional District.\nPurpose: This intent of this district is to serve as a transition between residential and more\nintensive districts. This includes residential and commercial uses with a low noise and traffic\nimpact which would generally be considered compatible with a residential area which may or\nmay not have buffering requirements as documented in section 19 of this Ordinance. Uses in\nthis district which require potable water or sanitary sewer must be connected to municipal\nwater and municipal sewer.\nI) PUD Planned Unit Development.\nPurpose: This district is defined as an area characterized by an orderly integration of\nresidential, commercial (inclusive of offices and institutions), industrial, and open space land\nuses which conform to the design requirements contained herein.\nJ) CS-MU Cedar Street Mixed-Use District.\nPurpose: The reason for this district is to protect, enhance and guide the redevelopment of the\nCedar Street corridor by reducing visual clutter through the implementation of commercial\ndesign standards and selecting the appropriate type of uses for this district. These standards are\ndesigned to improve the aesthetics, traffic congestion and provide for a solid and vibrant tax\nbase as well as promote the public health, safety and welfare of the town.\nK) H-BD Historic Business District.\nPurpose: The intent of this district is to allow land and structures which provide personal\nservices, retailing, and business services compatible with the district's historic character. This\ndistrict should be limited to the Town's Historic Overlay District and may be subject to\nadditional requirements found within the \"Design Guidelines for the Beaufort Historic District\n& Landmarks.' Uses in this district which require potable water or sanitary sewer must be\nconnected to municipal water and municipal sewer.\n63\n\nNEW PAGE 139\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\nE) L-I Light Industrial District.\nThis district is established to provide for the industries and for certain commercial\nestablishments which in their normal operations have little or no adverse effect upon adjoining\nproperties.\n1) Minimum Lot Size.\nAll lots in the L-I district shall be a minimum of eight thousand square feet (8,000 ft2).\n2) Minimum Lot Width.\nAll lots in the L-I district shall have a minimum lot width of eighty feet (80') at the\nminimum building line.\n3) Building Setback and Building Height Requirements and Limitations.\nSubject to the exceptions allowed in this Ordinance, each structure on a lot in this zoning\ndistrict shall be set back from the boundary lines of the lot at least the distances provided\nin the tables set forth in this section.
