Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Watershed Protection Overlay-Critical Area\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"WPO-CA\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Watershed Protection Overlay-Critical Area\n(WPO-CA) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Watershed Protection Overlay-Critical Area (WPO-CA). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Watershed Protection Overlay-Critical Area (WPO-CA)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Watershed Protection Overlay-Critical Area\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

The following Watershed Protection Overlay\nDistricts are established to comply with the rules set forth by the state's Environmental\nManagement Commission for the protection of those water supply watersheds which lie within the\njurisdiction of the town. The specific regulations for these districts are set forth in Article 15,\nWatershed Protection.\n(A) Watershed Protection Overlay District - Critical Area (WPO-CA). The Watershed\nProtection Overlay District - Critical Area (WPO-CA) establishes regulations for protecting those\nportions of the Falls Lake (WS- I IV), Lake Holt (WS- II), and Lake Rogers (WS-II) watersheds which\nlie within the one-fourth mile critical watershed area of those water supply sources as established\nand determined by the state's Environmental Management Commission.\n(B) Watershed Protection Overlay District - General Area (WPO-GA). The Watershed\nProtection Overlay District - General Area (WPO-GA) establishes regulations for protecting those\nportions of the Falls Lake (WS- IV), Lake Holt (WS- II), and Lake Rogers (WS-II) watersheds which\nlie within the remaining balance of the watershed area of those water supply sources as\nestablished and determined by the state's Environmental Management Commission.\n\u00a7 6.5 MIXED-USE ZONING DISTRICTS.\nAmerican Legal\nPublishing\nPublisher's Note: This Section has been AMENDED by new legislation (Ord. LDOTA.24.05,\nadopted 6-6-2024). The text of the amendment will be incorporated below when the ordinance is codified.\n6.5.1 Purpose and intent. The Mixed-Use Districts allow for a mix of nonresidential and\nresidential uses within the same development or building. This type of development is intended to\nencourage the physical design characteristics of pedestrian oriented, storefront-style shopping\nstreets.\n6.5.2 Gateway Districts. The Butner Gateway consists of five Base Zoning Districts described\nin \u00a7 6.5 and three Conditional Zoning Districts described in \u00a7 6.6 within a specific area, the\nGateway, each of which allow a mix of uses. Using a hybrid of form based code and traditional land\nuse based code, these districts create a cohesive, integrated, and unified development consistent\nwith the town's Gateway Small Area Plan adopted December 3, 2015 and the town's current\nComprehensive Plan. The districts are allowed only within the Gateway Area. Before development\nin the Gateway Districts may occur, a concept plan must be reviewed and approved by Town\nCouncil in accordance with division 3.2.6. Uses allowed in each Gateway District are shown in\nTable 7-1, Table of Permitted Uses. Any property in the Gateway area can request a Conditional\nDistrict rezoning to allow a use allowed in another Gateway District.\n(A) Gateway Base Zoning Districts.\n(1) Central Avenue Mixed-Use District (CX). The Central Avenue Mixed-Use District (CX) is\nestablished to accommodate a mix of commercial, office, and supporting higher density residential\n6 of 28\n7/3/2024, 12:56\n\n\nNEW PAGE 7\nFirefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cf7024e7-0dae-4e00-83.\nuses typically within a vertical mixed-use project. It is intended to serve as the Gateway \"Main\nStreet\" promoting a compact urban form. This district utilizes build-to lines as compared to more\ntraditional building setbacks, and minimum building/block standards. Uses which utilize and/or\nincorporate public space into the development (sidewalk cafes, and the like) shall be encouraged\nwithin this district, especially those properties fronting Central Avenue.\n(2) South Interchange Gateway District (SI). The South Interchange Gateway District (SI) is\nestablished to accommodate a mix of convenience retail and restaurants, moderate intensity\ncommercial development, as well as neighborhood serving commercial and professional office\nuses. The district may provide transient uses typically associated with higher volume thoroughfares\nand interstate interchanges. Multi-family residential uses may be provided as part of a vertically\nintegrated mixed-use project.\n(3) North Interchange Gateway District (NI). The North Interchange Gateway District (NI) is\nestablished to accommodate a mix of convenience retail and restaurants, including moderate and\nhigh intensity commercial uses typically associated with higher volume thoroughfares and interstate\ninterchanges. This district may also provide large-scale, big-box oriented uses.\n(4) Central Gateway West District (CW). The Central Gateway West District (CW) is\nestablished to accommodate an economic development and employment generating area including\noffice, industrial, and institutional uses. Institutional uses are intended to be located across from\nMurdoch Center. Office and institutional uses are intended south of 26th Street up the Central\nAvenue Mixed-Use District to act as a transition between the mixed-use area and the more intense\nindustrial uses. The area in between, north of 26th Street and extending across the railroad to the\nleast, is intended to be the primary employment center for the Gateway area. This area focuses on\nnonresidential operations including employment and job generating uses. Uses within this district\nwill likely use the railroad and interstate for the movement of goods. Properties in this area may be\ndeveloped individually or as part of a business or office park. Supporting residential may be\nprovided under limited situations, and shall not be primary uses in this district.\n(5) Central Gateway East District (CE). The Central Gateway East District (CE) is\nestablished to accommodate the connection between the major commercial nodes via the parkway\nwith a mix of uses including primarily office, institutional, and industrial. The district also includes\n\"Opportunity Site A\" which may be developed as either office and institutional or residential\ndevelopments with increased densities. Nonresidential uses within the opportunity site are\nenvisioned to include an academic/healthcare campus concept. Residential uses are envisioned as\nan age-targeted neighborhood and/or a variety of housing types and styles including attached and\nlimited detached housing. Consistent with the Central Gateway West District, properties north of\n26th Street and its continuation to Telecom Drive comprise the Gateway Area's primary\nemployment center.\n6.5.3 Gateway Base Zoning District Standards.\n(A) Concept plan required. A concept plan is required prior to the use or development of any\nGateway Zoning District.\n(B) Preservation of environmentally sensitive areas. All areas of wetlands, steep slopes,\nfloodways, and other environmentally sensitive areas must be preserved as open space.\n(C) Density. The maximum residential density within the Butner Gateway districts shall be ten\ndwelling units per acre except where regulated by the single-family lot size set forth in division\n6.5.3(D) below.\n(D) Lot standards.\n7 of 28\n7/3/2024, 12:56\n\n\n Output:"}]}
