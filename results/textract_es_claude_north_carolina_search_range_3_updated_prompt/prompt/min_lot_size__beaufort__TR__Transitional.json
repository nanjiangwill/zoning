Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Transitional\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"TR\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Transitional\n(TR) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Transitional (TR). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Transitional (TR)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Transitional\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

The Town recognizes the PUD as a special district where the\ndeveloper/owner proposes an integrated expansion of land combining mixed uses. The PUD\nwill be divided into sub-districts with each sub-district being one of the recognized districts\nwithin this Ordinance. Development within such sub-districts must be consistent with the\nrequirements and limitations of the normal district it correlates with, and this PUD section and\nits chapters and subchapters, the most stringent will apply.\nPUD developers are required to submit a site plan for review, as established in section 18 of\nthis Ordinance, in order for the planning board and Board of Commissioners (BOC) to look at\nthe relationships between the mixed use development. There are no minimum lot sizes or\nsetback requirements in this district however when the PUD comes for review, those items will\nbe evaluated to make sure they conform to the standards set forth in this section of this\nOrdinance.\nDuring consideration and approval of the master plan for a PUD project, or a preliminary plat\nfor a section of the master plan of the PUD project, the BOC, following a recommendation\nfrom the planning board, may vary the minimum requirements of this Ordinance or the Town\nof Beaufort Subdivision Ordinance. The master plan or preliminary plat applicant must show\nhow the PUD will be enhanced aesthetically, the environment will be better protected, or for\nany other reason the BOC determines appropriate, as long as the BOC determines such\nvariance does not harm the public interest. Density within a mixed use district may be varied\nfrom the limit specified within the district as long as the maximum overall density limit of six\ndwelling units per acre is maintained.\n1) Accessory Building Setback Requirements.\nAll accessory buildings must comply with the setback requirements as set forth in section\n2-F, section 6, section 15, and all sections of this Ordinance.\n2) Building Height Limitations.\nThe maximum building height for this district is forty feet (40').\n3) Permitted Uses.\nAll uses are allowed in the PUD District as a Special Use.\n4) PUD Minimum Size.\nFifteen acres.\n5) Maximum Overall Density.\nSix dwelling units per acre.\n101\n\nNEW PAGE 205\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\na screen/buffer yard may be composed of various combinations of wall, fence, planted\nvegetation, and existing vegetation.

In no case shall a fence or wall over four feet (4') high be\nextended closer to the street right-of-way line or easement which parallels the front\nproperty line, than the front corner of the main building situated on the lot or twenty-five\nfeet (25') from said street right-of-way or easement. No fence may be constructed on or\ninto a public street right-of-way or easement. Side and rear yards may be enclosed by\nfences or walls six feet (6') high. Unless otherwise specified, metal fences shall not\nexceed four feet (4') in height and shall have a mesh smaller than five inches (5\").\nWooden or other privacy-type fences may not exceed six feet (6') in height. All fences\nin the historic district must be approved by the Historic Preservation Commission\n(BHPC).\n2) Only conforming nonresidential land uses with the exception of the TR District, may have\na solid or open fence or wall erected to a maximum height of ten feet (10') except as\nrequired by this Ordinance. An open fence or wall is one which has openings throughout\nand where clear vision is possible from one side to the other on a horizontal plane and\nsuch openings occupy fifty percent (50%) or more of the area of the fence or wall. A\nfence or wall which does not qualify as an open fence or open wall shall maintain a\nsetback at entrances and exits of the site to provide an adequate sight distance easement\nas depicted in subsection E-3 of this section.\n3)\nA fence or wall which does not qualify as an open fence or open wall shall maintain a\nsetback at entrances and exits of the site to provide an adequate sight distance easement.\nSuch easement shall be established as an isosceles triangle having legs thirty-five feet\n(35') in length on each corner side of the entrance or exit. The same sight distance\neasement shall be applied to the corners of nonresidential lots which are typified by a\nstreet intersection.\n4) The setback and yard requirements of this Ordinance shall not apply to a retaining wall\nnot more than five feet (5') high, as measured from the lowest ground elevation to the top\nof the wall. The Board of Adjustment (BOA) may permit a retaining wall greater than\nfive feet (5') high due to the topography of the lot if such wall is necessary.\nF) Screening/Buffering of Open Storage Areas.\nAny open storage area not enclosed within the confines of a building, such as boxes, crates,\ntrash piles, machinery, and merchandise with open display (windows) which result from the\ncommercial operation it is associated with, shall be enclosed or hidden from view along any\nproperty lines adjacent to a residential zone by a wall, fence, and/or screening/buffering in a\nmanner acceptable to the zoning administrator. This provision shall apply in any\nnonresidential use adjacent to a residential zone and all properties affected by this provision\nshall comply within three years after adoption of this Ordinance. In the TR and General\nBusiness (B-1) districts, there shall be no open storage as an accessory or other use.\nG) Location of Buffer Yards.\nBuffer yards should be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, extending to the lot's\nboundary line. Buffer yards may be located in whole or in part within any side yard, and rear\nyard setbacks. Buffer yards shall not be located on any portion of a public or private road\nright-of-way and/or utility easement unless written approval is obtained by the Town's Public\nWorks Department and/or the easement holder.\n183\n\nNEW PAGE 208\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\nH) Responsibility for Development of a Buffer Yard.\n1) The owner or developer of the permitted use of land shall be responsible for submitting\na\nbuffer yard plan to the Planning and Inspections Department as mandated in subsection\nM of this section. The owner or developer is also responsible for providing and\nmaintaining the required buffer yard and screening. If the replacement of screening\nmaterial becomes necessary to continue its effectiveness, the owner or developer\nis\nresponsible for such replacement.\n2) When screening for outdoor storage is required, the owner, developer, tenant, or occupant\nshall be required to submit a buffer yard plan to the Planning and Inspections Department\nand to install and maintain the required buffer yard and screening.\n3)\nThe owner of a subdivision or PUD may either submit a buffer yard plan for each lot or\none for the entire subdivision or PUD. Should one plan be submitted for the entire\nsubdivision or PUD, the owner or developer may either install the entire buffer yard at\nonce or install the buffer yard for each phase of construction in conjunction with the\nbuilding permit issuance for the phase.\nI) Maintenance of a Buffer Yard.\n1) Vegetation.\nThe property owner, developer, tenant, and occupant shall be jointly and severally\nresponsible for maintaining all vegetation required by this section in a healthy condition\nand as set forth in section N of this section.\n2) Fencing.\nNo fence shall have more than twenty percent (20%) of its surface area covered with\ndisfigured, racked or missing materials, or peeling paint. No fence shall be allowed to\nremain with bent or broken supports or be allowed to stand more than fifteen degrees\n(15\u00b0) away from the perpendicular. Support structures of the fence/wall, other than those\nused to enhance its appearance, shall be seen, if at all, by the use responsible for building\nand maintaining the buffer and not by the adjacent use. Replacement or repair of fencing\nshall occur upon written notification from the zoning administrator within a period of no\nmore than thirty successive days.\n3) Pruning.\nPruning shall follow the guidelines set in section 14 of this Ordinance and shall not\ncompromise the minimum height requirements at the time of the original planting.\nJ) Requirements for Refuse Collection Areas.\n1)\nScreening/buffering is required for all refuse collection areas designed for commercial\nuse. A location for refuse collection shall be shown on all site plans. An area specifically\ndesignated for recycling is strongly recommended and in some cases required per North\nCarolina General Statutes.\n2) If a refuse collection area is provided for unmanned uses (e.g. cemeteries or public or\nprivate utilities such as power, water, or communication facilities) which do not generate\na lot of refuse, the requirements of this section shall apply.\n3) Refuse collection areas shall be screened on three sides by an opaque fence or wall SO it\nis not visible from any surrounding properties or streets. In rare circumstances where site\nconditions support the refuse collection area(s) facing a right of way, the fourth side\nwould require screening/buffering in the form of an opaque gate (chain link fencing is\nprohibited). Collection areas shall be designed SO waste removal trucks can easily access\nthe waste containers.\n184\n\n\n Output:"}]}
