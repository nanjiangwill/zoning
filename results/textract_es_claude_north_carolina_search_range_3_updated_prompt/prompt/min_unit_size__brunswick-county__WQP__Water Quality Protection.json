Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Water Quality Protection\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"WQP\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Water Quality Protection\n(WQP) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Water Quality Protection (WQP). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Water Quality Protection (WQP)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Water Quality Protection\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 74\nArticle 4 Zoning Districts\n4.5 Commercial Zoning Districts\n4.5.4.\nSpecial Standards in the WQP Zoning District\nD.\nOpen Space\nOpen space requirements for the residential portion of a multifamily or mixed commercial-residential\nproject shall be the same and conform to the requirements for multifamily developments in the MR-\n4-12\nCELL (1, 1):\nUse\nCELL (1, 2):\nDistrict\nCELL (1, 3):\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 4):\nMinimum\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 5):\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 6):\nMinimum\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 7):\nCELL (1, 8):\nYard\n(ft.)\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (2, 1):\nCELL (2, 2):\nCELL (2, 3):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 4):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 5):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 6):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 7):\nFront\nCELL (2, 8):\nRear\nCELL (2, 9):\nSide\nCELL (3, 1):\nAll residential, except\nCELL (3, 2):\nWQP\nCELL (3, 3):\n60\nCELL (3, 4):\n60\nCELL (3, 5):\n6,000\nCELL (3, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (3, 7):\n25\u00b3\nCELL (3, 8):\n63\nCELL (3, 9):\n51,2\nCELL (4, 1):\nmultifamily\nCELL (4, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (4, 3):\n75\nCELL (4, 4):\n75\nCELL (4, 5):\n7,500\nCELL (4, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (4, 7):\n253\nCELL (4, 8):\n253\nCELL (4, 9):\n102\nCELL (5, 1):\nMultifamily/ Mixed\nCELL (5, 2):\nWQP\nCELL (5, 3):\n100\nCELL (5, 4):\n150\nCELL (5, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (5, 6):\n15,000\nCELL (5, 7):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 8):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 9):\nCELL (6, 1):\ncommercial- residential\nCELL (6, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (6, 3):\n100\nCELL (6, 4):\n100\nCELL (6, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (6, 6):\n7,000\nCELL (6, 7):\nCELL (6, 8):\nCELL (6, 9):\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"CELL (2, 5):\\nWith\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 5):\\n6,000\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (2, 6):\\nWithout\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 6):\\n10,000\" 74]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"For district WQP, the section provides the information for min_unit_size.

AHC: Airport Height Control Overlay\nA. The Airport Height Control Overlay is intended to regulate construction and restrict the location of certain uses within proximity to an airport\ndue to the facts that:\n1. Airport hazards endanger the lives and property of users of airports and occupants and owners of property in their vicinity;\n2. The creation or establishment of an airport hazard injures the community served by the airport;\n3. In the interest of public health, safety, and general welfare, it is necessary to prevent the creation or establishment of airport hazards;\n4. The prevention of these obstructions should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of police power without\ncompensation.\nB. Standards applicable in the Airport Height Control Overlay can be obtained from the Brunswick County Planning Department or on the County's\nwebsite: www.brunswickcountync.gov.\n4.8.4. ED: Economic Development\nA. Intent\n1. The Economic Development Overlay District is intended to provide locations for a wide range of agricultural industry, light and heavy\nmanufacturing, office, institutional and research uses with no adverse impacts beyond the space occupied by the use.\n2. The Economic Development Overlay District shall only be applied to lands in close association with Major Thoroughfares and over lands in\nthe RR Rural Low Density Residential District. This District is designed to support specific public policy objectives stated in the Coastal Area\nManagement Act Land Use Plan.\nB. Application Criteria\nTen acres shall be required to initiate an Economic Development Overlay District.\nC. Applicability\nThe following standards shall apply to all development within an ED overlay district. In addition to the standards contained in this Section, all\nother provisions in this Ordinance and all other applicable laws shall apply.

PD projects are subject to the approval process in Section 3.1.6 and the\nsite plan requirements outlined in Article 6.\n4.8.6. TO: Transitional Office\nA. Purpose\nThe Transitional Office Overlay is established to allow an orderly transition of land use from residential use to relatively small-scale office use of\nlots and parcels fronting major roadways, while maintaining a predominantly residential property appearance and building scale.\nB. Designation of Transitional Office Overlay\n1. A Transitional Office Overlay may only be established as a zoning map change in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.8, Rezoning.\n2. A Transitional Office Overlay may only be established in any residential base district, and may be established over more than one residential\nbase district.\nC. Permitted Uses\n1. Any use permitted by right, subject to limitations, or through special use permit in the underlying base districts shall be allowed in the\noverlay.\n2. The following uses or use categories shall be permitted in addition to the uses permitted in the underlying residential zoning district:\ni. Upper-story residential;\nii. Medical facilities (other than hospitals);\niii. Offices;\niv. Animal hospitals and veterinary clinics (all without outdoor pens or runs). Kennels shall not be permitted in a TO unless they are\npermitted in the base district;\nV. Artist galleries and studios.\n3. No retail sales shall be permitted as a primary use in the TO overlay.\nD. Applicability\nThe following standards shall apply to all development within a TO overlay district. In addition to the standards contained in this Section, all\nother provisions in this Ordinance and all other applicable laws shall apply.

Brunswick County has numerous waterways, marshes, Carolina Bays, pocosins, and other water courses that contribute to the County's\nscenic character and serve as a reminder of the important place these water courses hold in the County's history.\n2. The water courses are also an important natural resource and amenity to residents of and visitors to Brunswick County, and the scenic views\nassociated with these watercourses are an important attraction to residents and visitors to Brunswick County, which in large part is\neconomically dependent upon tourism.\n3.\nThe intent of the Viewshed Protection Overlay is to protect and enhance the scenic character of Brunswick County's riparian areas and water\ncourses, with the broader goal of ensuring the preservation of views from within these scenic areas as well as views of these areas from\nadjacent lands.\nB. Designation of Viewshed Protection Overlay\n1. A Viewshed Protection Overlay may only be established as a zoning map change in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.8,\nRezoning.\n2. The ordinance adopting the overlay district shall clearly designate the name and geographic limits of the watercourse to be protected (i.e.\ncan't just say Intercoastal Waterway, it must specify the extents of the district along the length of the watercourse).\n3. The following watercourses are designated (VS) Viewshed Protection Overlays:\nC. Applicability\n1. Generally, the requirements of this Viewshed Protection Overlay District apply to all structures within 300 feet of the normal high water line\nof a designated watercourse.\n2. However, the Planning Director may waive these requirements for structures related to an industrial use that is located in the RU-I or I-G\nzoning districts.\n3. These requirements shall not apply to water oriented commercial uses (see Section 5.1.4.)).\nD. Development Standards\n1. Portions of structures facing a protected watercourse that exceed 50 feet in height shall be set back a minimum of two feet for each\nadditional one foot in height above 50 feet. The Planning Director shall have the authority to determine which portions of a structure are\nconsidered to be \"facing\" the protected watercourse for the purposes of these regulations.\n2. With the exception of Water Oriented Commercial Uses (see Section 5.1.4.J), and permitted height obstructions (see Section 5.4.13.C) the\nmaximum height of any structure may not exceed 75 feet.\n4.8.8. WQP: Water Quality Protection\nA. Purpose and Intent\n1. It is the intent of Brunswick County to bolster those regulations of state and federal government as to the unique quality of the water of the\nLockwood Folly River associated with naturally occurring shellfish beds.\n2. The quality of these defined waters has been affected by such activities as forestry, farming, construction of roads, growth of towns, and\nrural and suburban residential development, as well as industrial processes associated with the fishing industry.\n3. Numerous types of water pollutants have been identified by state studies. No one or even several types or causes of such degradation have\nbeen determined as having more impact than any other.\n59 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\nCELL (1, 1): \nWatercourse\nCELL (1, 2): \nFrom\nCELL (1, 3): \nTo\nCELL (2, 1): \nName\nCELL (2, 2): \nLocation\nCELL (2, 3): \nLocation\nCELL (3, 1): \nIntracoastal Waterway (IWW)\nCELL (3, 2): \nBorder with New Hanover County\nCELL (3, 3): \nSouth Carolina State Line\nCELL (4, 1): \nLockwood Folly River\nCELL (4, 2): \nGenoes Point to Mullet Creek\nCELL (4, 3): \nTo and across the Intracoastal Water to\nSheep Island\nCELL (5, 1): \nTown Creek\nCELL (5, 2): \nUS Hwy 17\nCELL (5, 3): \nNC 133\nCELL (6, 1): \nShallotte River\nCELL (6, 2): \nUnincorporated Areas of Brunswick County\nCELL (6, 3): \n\nNEW PAGE 60\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n4. The intent of this Water Quality Protection District is to apply a set of regulations for water quality protection, to specifically described areas\nof land abutting a specifically described water area; which is encompassed by a line drawn to extend across the Lockwood Folly River from\nGenoe's Point to Mullet Creek, southly to and across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway.\nB. Applicability\n1. The requirements and standards of the WQP- Water Quality Protection Overlay shall apply to all lands shown on a special Zoning Overlay\nMap made a part of this District, whereby all land parcels of public record included are clearly shown. This District includes an area extending\n575' landward of the mean high water line, with any lot or parcel falling within such distance being included entirely within this overlay zone.\n2. Parcels smaller than one acre in size shall be exempt from the requirements of this Section.\n3. Such waters have been defined by the State as being those waters south from a line extending from Genoes Point to Mullet Creek, to and\nacross the Intracoastal Water to Sheep Island.\nC. Incorporation of Studies by Reference\n1. Among the specific studies establishing the WQP District have been the March, 1989 publication entitled \"Report on Coastal Resource Waters\n- Intensive Study,\" by the Division of Environmental Management, N.C. Department of Natural Resources and Community Development, and\nthe August, 1989, publication entitled \"Lockwood Folly River Basin Water Quality Evaluation Report.\" Those studies are included by reference.\n2. The State of North Carolina has concluded the quality of the waters within the boundaries of the District had so declined there could be no\nassurance the proposed regulations would result in the goal of these waters being open full seasons for shell fishing. The Environmental\nManagement Commission did, under N.C. Administrative Code, Subordinance 2B, Surface Water Standards, Monitoring, Section .0219, Water\nQuality Management Plans, sub-section (b) establish a defined area of the mouth of this river, as above described, to be protected by a\nWater Quality Management Plan with specific actions which became effective January 1, 1990, included herein by reference.\nD. Application Requirements\nApplications for all development meeting the applicability requirements in the paragraph above shall require an approved Sedimentation\nErosion Control Plan be filed.\nE. Development Standards\nAll development within a WQP- Water Quality Protection Overlay shall:\n1. Limit the built upon impervious area to no more than 25% of the lot;\n2. Provide a buffer zone of at least 30' from any wetland or water line;\n3. Limit any structures to being at least 75' from the mean high water line; and\n4. Comply with any additional standards imposed by State or Federal regulations.\n4.9 VOLUNTARY AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT PROGRAM\nCommentary: The Voluntary Agricultural District is not an overlay zoning district, and is not implemented in the same was as a zoning district would\nbe.\n4.9.1. Authority\nThe standards and provisions of this Voluntary Agricultural District Program are established pursuant to the authority conferred by G.S. 106-735\nthrough 106-743 and Chapter 160D.\n( Ord. No. UDO-21-01, \u00a7 20, 5-17-21)\n4.9.2. Purpose\nThe purpose of this Program is to promote the health, safety, rural agricultural values, and general welfare of the County, and more specifically,\nincrease identity and pride in the agricultural community, its way of life, and its importance in preserving the agrarian heritage of the county;\nencourage the economic and financial health of farming; increase protection from undesirable, non-farm development: and increase the protection\nof farms from nuisance suits anti other negative impacts on properly managed farms.\n4.9.3. Initial Participation is Voluntary\nNothing contained within this Section shall require a landowner to initiate participation in the Program. Upon participation in the Program,\ncompliance with the requirements of this Section shall be required to maintain status.\n4.9.4. Implementation of Program\nIn order to implement the purposes stated in above, this Program provides for the creation of Voluntary Agricultural Districts (VADs) as follows:\nA. Application\n60 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\nNEW PAGE 170\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nCommentary: In order to prevent the possibility of ending up with random leftover slivers of land and the inefficient provision of open space,\nprojects not meeting the threshold requirements below are not required to dedicate open space.\nA. Applicability\n1. Projects with 10 or more dwellings shall provide open space and recreation area in conformance with this Section. Only the portion of the\nproject devoted to residential use shall be used in determining the minimum open space requirement. Non-residential elements of projects\nshall be exempt from the requirements of this Section.\nCommentary: This is to capture phased or separate developments that may, when taken in part fall under the thresholds, but taken in whole will\nmeet the threshold.\nB. Amounts of Open Space and Recreation Area to be Provided\nWhen required, open space shall be provided in the amounts indicated in the tables below.\nUnless specifically reduced by the Planning Director, at least 15% of the required open space must be in the form of usable recreation area\n(see Section 6.4.4.C.2.i, below)\nC. Open Space and Recreation Area Standards\n1. Open Space Standards\ni. All open space shall be unoccupied or predominately unoccupied by buildings or other impervious surfaces. Unoccupied or\npredominately unoccupied by buildings or other impervious surfaces shall mean that not more than five percent of the area of any\nrequired open space shall be occupied by such surfaces. Open space shall be identified on plats as being permanently set aside. Except\nin the RR district, open space shall be exclusive of any individual lots.\nii. In order to be included in the calculation for required open space, the following minimum dimensions shall be satisfied:\n(a) Open space shall have a minimum horizontal dimension of 15 feet.\n(b) No individual open space shall have a minimum area of less than 2,000 square feet.\niii. Uses of open space may include the following:\n(a) Conservation areas for natural, archeological or historical resources;\n(b) Ecologically sensitive wetlands such as marsh, Carolina Bays, pocosins and swamps;\n(c) Bona fide agriculture, horticulture, silviculture or pasture uses, provided that all applicable best management practices are used to\nminimize environmental impacts;\n(d) Walking or bicycle trails, provided they are constructed of pervious paving materials;\n(e) Water trails;\n(f) Landscaped stormwater management facilities;\n(g) Easements for drainage, access, and underground utility lines; and\n(h) Other conservation-oriented uses compatible with the purposes of these regulations.\n(i) Up to 100% of a golf course may be included in the calculations for useable open space.\niv. Open space does not include the following:\n(a) Roads, parking lots and impervious surfaces, except as specifically authorized; and\n(b) Agricultural and forestry activities not conducted according to accepted best management practices.\n2.

The County's goal is to create and maintain a positive ambiance and community image and identity by providing for architectural and site design\ntreatments that will enhance the visual appearance of certain commercial development and the quality of life.\nD. The applicable commercial development depends on high visibility from public streets. In turn, design of certain commercial buildings and sites\ndetermines much of the image and attractiveness of the streetscapes and character of the community. Massive, duplicative or generic projects\nthat do not contribute to, or integrate with, the community in a positive manner can be detrimental to a community's image and sense of place.\nE. This Section incorporates a basic level of architectural design which, in conjunction with site design, landscaping, lighting and sign treatments\nlocated elsewhere in this Ordinance, is intended to result in a comprehensive scheme for building design and site development. However, this\nSection is not intended to require any specific style of architecture.\nF. This Section is also intended to:\n1. Promote high standards in architectural design and the construction of creative, innovative, aesthetically pleasing structures;\n2. Encourage landowners, designers and developers to look closely at local conditions and the development site, and produce new\ndevelopment that enhances and complements both the built and natural environment;\n3. Ensure that development and building design is sensitive to the specific site, consistent with the existing and proposed character of the area,\nincluding residential and nonresidential uses in the surrounding area, and does not detract from the positive elements existing\nneighborhood characteristics.\n6.7.2. Large Scale Commercial Defined\nLarge scale commercial developments are considered to be any structure or group of structures that share common walls that have an enclosed\ngross floor area of 75,000 square feet or more.\n6.7.3.
