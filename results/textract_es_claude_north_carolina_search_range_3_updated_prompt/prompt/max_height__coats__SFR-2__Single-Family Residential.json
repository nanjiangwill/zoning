Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Single-Family Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"SFR-2\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Single-Family Residential\n(SFR-2) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Single-Family Residential (SFR-2). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Single-Family Residential (SFR-2)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Single-Family Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

The temporary construction easement shall pass to all successive owners until\nthe guaranteed improvements have been constructed/installed and approved or\naccepted by the Town and shall be recorded in the office of the Harnett County\nRegister of Deeds with recording fees to be paid by the applicant/landowner.\n2.15-3 Failure to Perform. Failure to initiate construction of the improvements within one\nyear of the date the performance guarantee was accepted by the Town of Coats may\nresult in the Town constructing the improvements, with the cost to be paid from the\nperformance guarantee account.

The Town at\nits discretion may spend such portion of said funds as deemed necessary to complete all\nor any portion of the required improvements. The Town shall return to the property\nowner/developer any funds not spent in completing the improvements. Default on a\nproject does not release the developer from responsibility for the completion of the\nimprovements. The Town may release a portion or all of any security posted as the\nimprovements are completed and approved by the Town. In the event that the amount\nof the performance guarantee on hand is insufficient to pay for the completion of the\nimprovements, the property owner shall pay to the Town of Coats the total amount of\nthe insufficiency. If the Town is not paid, the amount of the insufficiency shall\nconstitute a lien on the property in favor of the Town.
