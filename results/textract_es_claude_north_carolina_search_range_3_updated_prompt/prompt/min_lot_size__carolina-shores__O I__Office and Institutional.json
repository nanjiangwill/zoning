Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Office and Institutional\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"O I\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Office and Institutional\n(O I) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Office and Institutional (O I). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Office and Institutional (O I)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Office and Institutional\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

A certificate of occupancy may not be issued until the final plat has been approved and recorded.\n(2) After the effective date of this Unified Development Ordinance, it shall be illegal for any person being the owner or agent of the owner\nof any land located within the territorial jurisdiction of this Unified Development Ordinance, to subdivide his or her land in violation of this\nUnified Development Ordinance or to transfer or sell land by reference to, exhibition of or any other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the\nland before the plat has been properly approved under the terms of this Unified Development Ordinance.\n(3) The description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transferring\nland shall not exempt the transaction from this penalty. The Board of Commissioners, through its attorney or other official so designated, may\nenjoin an illegal subdivision, transfer or sale of land by action for injunction. Further, violators of this Unified Development Ordinance shall be\nsubject, upon conviction, to fine and/or imprisonment as provided by G.S. \u00a7 14-4. Civil penalties may be issued in accordance with \u00a7 91.14.\n(I) Roadway acceptance procedure.\n(1) At the time of submittal of a preliminary plat with streets proposed to be dedicated for acceptance by the town as public, the Board of\nCommissioners will decide if it will approve the dedication, subject to the street or streets complying with all requirements for acceptance. The\ntown is not obligated to accept a street for maintenance.\n(2) Before a request for acceptance by the town is made, the petitioner(s) for street dedication must provide the following to the UDO\nAdministrator:\n(a) Town Engineer's certification that the street(s) have been properly constructed to town specifications;\n(b) As-built drawings of all street, drainage and other improvements;\n(c) All easement agreements;\n(d) Lien waiver executed by all providers of materials and services; and\n(e) Deed for roadway right-of-way conveyance.\n(3) If the town agrees to accept the offer of dedication, it will be obligated to maintain the street. The obligation to maintain the street\ndoes not impose any requirement on the town to immediately make improvements to the street in question. Necessary improvements to the\nstreet in question will be made by the town as funds are available.\n(4) The warranty period shall run for a minimum of one year from the date of acceptance by the Board of Commissioners. Warranty\ninspections will be conducted by the Town Engineer at six months and 12 months after acceptance or at any time that deficiencies are\ndiscovered. All repairs will require an additional one-year warranty.\n(5) Acceptance of roadway dedication will be provided by adoption of a resolution of acceptance by the Town Board of Commissioners.\n(J) School site reservation. If the Board of Commissioners and the Brunswick County Board of Education have jointly determined the\nspecific location and size of any school sites to be reserved in accordance with the town comprehensive plan, staff shall immediately notify\nthe Board of Education in writing whenever a sketch plan for a subdivision is submitted which includes all or part of a school site to be\nreserved. The Board of Education shall promptly decide whether it still wishes the site to be reserved. If the Board of Education does wish to\nreserve the site, the subdivision shall not be approved without such reservation. The Board of Education shall then have 18 months beginning\non the date of final approval of the subdivision within which to acquire the site by purchase or by initiating condemnation proceedings. If the\nBoard of Education has not purchased or begun proceedings to condemn the site within 18 months, the developer may treat the land as freed\nof the reservation.\n(K) Dedication of land for park, recreation and open space. Every subdivider who proposes a subdivision of land for residential purposes\nshall dedicate for public or private use a portion of land or pay a fee in lieu thereof, in accordance with this section, for public park, greenway,\nrecreation and open space sites to serve the recreational needs of the residents of the subdivision or development. The town prefers that\nownership and maintenance of parks, recreation or open space lands be by a private entity, such as a property owners' association.\nDedication of land, or fee in lieu of, must be approved by the Board of Commissioners prior to approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning\nBoard.\n(1) At least one-thirty-fifth of an acre shall be dedicated for each dwelling unit planned or proposed in the subdivision plat or\ndevelopment.\n(2) The minimum amount of land which shall be dedicated for a public park, recreation or open space site shall be no less than two acres\nin size. When the area to be provided is less than two acres, the subdivider may be required to make payment in lieu of the dedication to be\nused for the acquisition or development of recreation, park or open space sites which would serve the needs of the residents of the\nsubdivision.\n(3) Except as otherwise required by the Board of Commissioners, all dedications of land shall meet the following criteria.\n(a) The dedicated land shall form a single parcel of land, except where the Board of Commissioners determines that two or more\nparcels would be in the best interest of the public, given the type and distribution of open spaces needed to adequately serve the proposed\ndevelopment. In these cases, the Board of Commissioners may require that the parcels be connected by a dedicated strip of land at least 30\nfeet in width.\n(b) Two-thirds of the dedicated land shall be usable for active recreation. Furthermore, lakes and other bodies of water may not be\n\n\nNEW PAGE 34\nincluded in computing any of the dedicated land area. Land dedicated only for greenways need not follow the requirements of this division (J)\n(3)(b).\n(c) The shape of the portion of the dedicated land which is deemed suitable for active recreation shall be sufficiently square or round to\nbe usable for any or all recreational facilities and activities, such as athletic fields and tennis courts, when a sufficient amount of land is\ndedicated to accommodate the facilities. Land dedicated only for greenways need not follow the requirements of this division (J)(3)(c).\n(d) The dedicated land shall be located so as to reasonably serve the recreation and open space needs of residents of the subdivision.\n(e) Public access to the dedicated land shall be provided either by adjoining public street frontage or by a dedicated public easement, at\nleast 30 feet wide, which connects the dedicated land to a public street or right-of-way. Gradients adjacent to existing and proposed streets\nshall allow for reasonable access to the dedicated land. Where the dedicated land is located adjacent to a street, the developer or subdivider\nshall remain responsible for the installation of utilities, sidewalks and other improvements required along that street segment.\n(f) Dedicated parks, recreation and open space areas shall have a sufficient natural or human-made buffer or screen to minimize any\nnegative impacts on adjacent residents.\n(4) The payment of fees, in lieu of the dedication of land, may occur at the request of the subdivider or developer. However, the decision\nto require the dedication of land for recreational purposes, or a payment of a fee in lieu, shall be made by the Board of Commissioners prior to\npreliminary plat approval after having received a recommendation from the Planning Board and having evaluated the proposed dedication and\nthe relationship the dedication would have with the town's overall recreational needs.\n(a) The fees in lieu of dedication shall be paid prior to final plat approval.\n(b) The amount of the payment shall be the product of:\n1. The number of acres to be dedicated, as required by this division (J); and\n2. The assessed value for property tax purposes of the land being subdivided, adjusted to reflect its current fair market value at the\ntime the payment is due to be paid.\n(c) Procedures for determining the amount of the payment are as follows.\n1. An appraisal of the land in the development shall be performed by a professional land appraiser selected by the developer from an\napproved list maintained by the Board of Commissioners. Professional land appraiser refers to a land appraiser who, in the opinion of the\nBoard of Commissioners, has the expertise and/or certification to perform an adequate appraisal.\n2. The appraisal shall not be done prior to submission of the preliminary plat. The cost of the appraisal shall be borne by the\ndeveloper.\n(5) At the time of filing a preliminary plat, the subdivider shall designate thereon the area or areas to be dedicated pursuant to this\nsection. If the subdivider desires to make a payment in lieu of the dedication of land, a letter to that effect shall be submitted with the\npreliminary plat. The Board of Commissioners reserves the right to approve or disapprove dedication of parcels for public park, recreation or\nopen space, or payment in lieu of.\n(6) Where a dedication of land is required, the dedication shall be shown on the final plat when submitted, and the plat shall be\naccompanied by an executed general warranty deed conveying the dedicated land to the town. Where a payment in lieu of dedication is\napproved by the Board of Commissioners, the payment will be made before the final plat is signed and recorded.\n(7) The Board of Commissioners shall have the authority to sell land dedicated pursuant to this section. The proceeds of the sale shall be\nused for the acquisition and/or development of other recreation, park or open space sites, or for sidewalk development serving the subdivision\nor more than one subdivision in the immediate area.\n(8) The town encourages neighborhood or property owner associations or management to construct, operate and maintain private parks\nand recreation. The construction, operation or maintenance of the private facilities shall not, however, diminish or eliminate the responsibility\nand obligations of the subdivider under this section.\n(9) Greenways may be credited against the requirements of this section, provided that the greenways are part of the town's greenway\nplan and dedicated to public use.\n(10) This chapter may not require a power line to be buried if the line existed above ground when the development's plat or development\nplan was initially approved (even if the power line was subsequently relocated) and the power line is located outside the parcel of land\ncontaining the subdivision or development plan.\n(L) Street construction. To provide for the orderly growth and development of the town, and to coordinate the streets and highways within\nproposed subdivisions with existing or planned streets and highways, a subdivider or developer may be required in lieu of required street\nconstruction and as a condition to plat approval, to provide funds which the town may use for the construction of roads to serve the occupants,\nresidents, or invitees of the subdivision or development and these funds may be used for roads which serve more than one subdivision or\ndevelopment within the area. All funds received by the town pursuant to this division shall be used only for development of roads, including\ndesign, land acquisition, and construction. The town may undertake these activities in conjunction with the North Carolina Department of\nTransportation under an agreement between the town and the Department of Transportation. Any formula adopted to determine the amount\nof funds the subdivider or developer is to pay in lieu of required street construction shall be based on the trips generated from the subdivision\nor development. A combination of partial payment of such funds and partial dedication of constructed streets may be required when the Board\nof Commissioners determines that such a combination is in the best interests of the public in the area to be served.\n(Ord. eff. 9-6-2012, \u00a7 5.7; Am.

Detailed use\ntables are provided in \u00a7 91.74 showing the uses allowed in each district. The following describes the processes of each of the categories that\nthe uses are subject to:\n(A) Permitted by right. Administrative review and approval subject to district provisions and other applicable requirements only;\n(B) Permitted with supplemental regulations. Administrative review and approval subject to district provisions, other applicable\nrequirements and supplemental regulations outlined in \u00a7\u00a7 91.80 through 91.104; and\n(C) Special uses.

Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n91.72 PRIMARY ZONING DISTRICTS.\nFor the purposes of this Unified Development Ordinance, the town is hereby divided into the following primary zoning districts.\n(A) R-15 Residential District. The R-15 Residential District is intended as a single-family residential area with a low to medium population\ndensity. Certain structures and uses of governmental, educational, religious and noncommercial recreational natures are either permitted\noutright or are subject to special conditions intended to preserve and protect the residential character of this district.\n(B) R-12 Residential District. The R-12 Residential District is intended as a single-family residential area with a low to medium population\ndensity. Certain structures and, uses of governmental, educational, religious and noncommercial recreational natures are either permitted\noutright or are subject to special conditions intended to preserve and protect the residential character of this district.\n(C) R-8 Residential District. The R-8 Residential District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for single-family,\ntwo-family and multi-family residences. The regulations of this district are intended to provide areas of the community for those persons\ndesiring residence and multi-family structures in medium density neighborhoods. The regulations are intended to discourage any use which\nbecause of its character would interfere with the residential nature of this district.\n(D) R-6 Residential District. The R-6 Residential District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for single-family,\ntwo-family and multi-family residences. The regulations of this district are intended to provide areas in the community for those persons\ndesiring small residences and multi-family structures in relatively high density neighborhoods. The regulations are intended to discourage any\nuse which because of its character would interfere with the residential nature of this district. The R-6 District was in effect prior to the date of\nadoption of this Unified Development Ordinance and shall continue in effect for those areas following the date of adoption of this Unified\nDevelopment Ordinance. It is the intention of the town that there will be no additional R-6 zoning.\n(E) MFH I Manufactured Home District I. The MFH I Manufactured Home District I is established as a district in which the principal use of\nland is for double-wide manufactured homes Class \"A.\"\n(F) MFH // Manufactured Home District II. The MFH II Manufactured Home District II is established as a district in which the principal use of\nland is for Class \"B\" manufactured homes.\n(G) O/I Office and Institutional District. This district is established primarily for office and institutional uses which cause no offensive noises,\nodors, smoke, fumes, excessive traffic or other objectionable conditions. This district may serve as a buffer between residential and\ncommercial/industrial districts.\n(H) NB Neighborhood Business District. The regulations for this district are designed to permit a concentrated development of permitted\nfacilities which are normally adjacent to non-federal highways and routinely adjacent to residential areas.\n(I) HC Highway Commercial District. The HC Highway Commercial District is established primarily for those businesses that serve the\ntraveling public, require large areas for displays of goods, and are not oriented to the pedestrian shopper.\n(J) ID Industrial District. The ID Industrial District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for industries which can be\noperated in a relatively clean and quiet manner and which will not be obnoxious to adjacent residential or business districts. The regulations\nare designed to prohibit the use of land for heavy industry, which should be properly segregated, and to prohibit any other use that would\nsubstantially interfere with the development of industrial establishments in the district.\n(K) CRD Conservation Recreation District. This district is established as a district intended to preserve Carolina Shores' essential open\nspace areas, by protecting/preserving natural resources such as: floodplain areas, existing and proposed residential areas, recreational\nresources; and limiting impervious surfaces, thereby reducing stormwater runoff. Conservation zoning may be incorporated into surrounding\ndevelopments. Large lot zoning for single-family residential development is conditionally allowed as an effective way to preserve natural and\ncommunity open space resources.\n(L) PRD Planned Residential District. A Planned Residential District (PRD) is planned and developed as an integral unit in a single\n\n\nNEW PAGE 36\ndevelopment phase or several phases in accord with an initially approved development plan.\n(M) AD Agricultural District. The purpose of this district is to provide for areas where the principal use of land is for low density residential\nand agricultural\npurposes. The regulations of this district are intended to protect the agricultural sections of the community from an influx of uses likely to\nrender them undesirable for farms and future residential development.\n(Ord. eff. 9-6-2012, \u00a7 6.3; Am. Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n\u00a7 91.73 CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICT.\n(A) The large site conditional zoning district (CZD) allows a site to be developed with a mixture of land uses according to an approved\noverall site plan. For example, a large tract may be developed with a mix of single-family and multi-family housing, with part of the site also\ndevoted to commercial and office uses. The CZD allows for greater flexibility in dimensional standards (such as lot sizes and setbacks) upon\napproval of an overall master plan for the entire development. The district does not require a rigid separation of different land uses. Uses are\nlimited to the uses identified in \u00a7 91.74 Table of Permitted/ Special Uses. All of the site-specific standards and conditions, including a site plan,\nare incorporated into the zoning district regulations for the CZD. Approval of the site plan will establish all zoning requirements for the subject\nproperty. A large site CZD district shall not be less than three acres in area. Within the MLK-O overlay district, lots smaller than three acres in\nsize may apply for CZD zoning.\n(B) This negotiated approach to a legislative decision allows maximum flexibility to tailor regulations to a particular site and project. But it\nalso has great potential for abuse - both in terms of impacts on individual landowners seeking approval and their neighbors and on the public\ninterests zoning is supposed to promote. Thus, special restrictions have been placed on conditional zoning. Conditional Zoning Districts may\nonly occur at the owner's request and cannot be imposed without the owner's agreement. The individual conditions and site-specific standards\nthat can be imposed are limited to those that are needed to bring a project into compliance with town ordinances and adopted plans and to\nthose addressing the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by use of the site. The town must assure that all of the factors defining\nreasonable spot zoning are fully considered and that the public hearing record reflects that consideration.\n(C) Conditional zoning provides important opportunities to carefully tailor regulations to address the interest of the landowner, the\nneighbors, and the public. The town may use conditional zoning when it concludes that a particular project should be approved but that the\nstandards in the comparable conventional zoning district(s) are insufficient to protect neighbors or public interests (perhaps because the\nconventional zoning allows other uses not suitable for the site or dimensional standards inadequate to preserve the neighborhood).\nConditional zoning often allows a developer to proceed with a project in a way that addresses site-specific concerns of neighbors and the\nTown of Carolina Shores. The petitioner must consent in writing to all conditions imposed by the conditional zoning.\n(Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n\u00a7 91.74 TABLE OF PERMITTED/SPECIAL USES.\nPS - Permitted Use with
