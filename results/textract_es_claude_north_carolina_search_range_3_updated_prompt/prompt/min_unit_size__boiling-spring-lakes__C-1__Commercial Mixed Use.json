Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Commercial Mixed Use\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"C-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Commercial Mixed Use\n(C-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Commercial Mixed Use (C-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Commercial Mixed Use (C-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Commercial Mixed Use\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft).

Its purpose is to insure that proposed developments do not\nadversely affect the highway network and to identify any traffic problems associated with\naccess from the site to the existing transportation network. The purpose of the study is also to\nidentify solutions to potential problems and to present improvements to be incorporated into\nthe proposed development.\n7.17.2 Conduct\nA traffic impact study shall be prepared by a qualified professional traffic engineer and/or\ncertified transportation planner with previous traffic study experience. The procedures and\nstandards for the traffic impact study are set forth in Section 7.7.5 of this Article. The traffic\nimpact study shall be referred to NCDOT for review and comment.\nPrior to the preparation of a traffic impact study, a scoping meeting shall be held, including the\nplanning staff, the applicant, and the preparer of the study. The discussion at this meeting\nshould set the study parameters, including the study area, planned and committed roadway\nimprovements (by NCDOT or others), road links and intersections to be analyzed, preliminary\ntraffic distribution, other planned developments to be considered, traffic growth rate, available\ndata, periods for which analysis is to be performed, and other staff concerns. The qualifications\nof the preparer may be discussed at or prior to this meeting.\n7.17.3 Applicability\nExcept as described below, a traffic impact study shall be required for all development that\nmeet the following criteria:\n(A)\nSpecialUsePermit, Site Planor ubdivisionPlatRequired\nEstimated traffic generated by the development exceeds 1,500 trips/day.\nDevelopments that produce more than 1,500 trips per day traffic may be exempted from the\nrequirements to prepare and submit a traffic impact study if: (1) a traffic impact study has\npreviously been prepared for this particular project or development, and (2) there is to be no\nchange in land use or density that would increase travel, (3) there is to be no change in access\nto the external street system, or (4) material is submitted to demonstrate that traffic created by\nthe proposal when adding to existing traffic will not result in a need for transportation\nimprovements. The Board of Adjustment will review material submitted in support of an\n7-25\n\n\nNEW PAGE 156\nARTICLE 7. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nexemption and will determine from that material whether or not to grant the exemption. All\nexemptions shall be concurred with by the NCDOT District 3 Office. If an exemption is granted,\ndocumentation of the exemption will be submitted as part of the staff recommendation.\n7.17.4 Capacity Analysis of the Existing System\nAn indication of the adequacy of the existing street system is a comparison of traffic volumes\nversus the ability of the streets to move traffic freely at a desirable speed. The ability of a street\nto move traffic freely, safely, and efficiently with a minimum delay is controlled primarily by the\nspacing of major devices utilized. Thus, the ability of a street to move traffic can be increased\nby restricting parking and turning movements, using proper sign and signal devices, and by the\napplication of other traffic engineering strategies.\nCapacity is the maximum number of vehicles which has a \"reasonable expectation\" of passing\nover a given section of roadway, during a given time period under prevailing roadway and\ntraffic conditions. The relationship of traffic volumes to the capacity of the roadway will\ndetermine the level of service (LOS) being provided. Six levels of service have been selected for\nanalysis purposes. They are given letter designations from A to F with LOS A representing the\nbest operating conditions and LOS F the worst.\n7-26\nCELL (1, 1): \n(A)\nCELL (1, 2): \nLOS A. Describes primarily free flow conditions. The motorist experiences a high level of\nphysical and psychological comfort. The effects of minor incidents of breakdown are\neasily absorbed. Even at the maximum density, the average spacing between vehicles is\nabout 528 feet or 26 car lengths.\nCELL (2, 1): \n(B)\nCELL (2, 2): \nLOS B. Represents reasonably free flow conditions. The ability to maneuver within the\ntraffic stream is only slightly restricted. The lowest average spacing between vehicles is\nabout 330 feet or 18 car lengths.\nCELL (3, 1): \n(C)\nCELL (3, 2): \nLOSC.\nProvides for stable operations, but flows approach the range in which small\nincreases will cause substantial deterioration in service. Freedom to maneuver is\nnoticeably restricted. Minor incidents may still be absorbed, but the local decline in\nservice will be great. Queues may be expected to form behind any significant blockage.\nMinimum average spacing's are in the range of 220 feet or 11 car lengths.\nCELL (4, 1): \n(D)\nCELL (4, 2): \nLOS D. Borders on unstable flow. Density begins to deteriorate somewhat more quickly\nwith increasing flow. Small increases in flow can cause substantial deterioration in\nservice. Freedom to maneuver is severely limited, and the driver experiences drastically\nreduced comfort levels. Minor incidents can be expected to create substantial queuing.\nAt the limit, vehicles are spaced at about 165 feet or nine car lengths.\nCELL (5, 1): \n(E)\nCELL (5, 2): \nLOS E. Describes operation at capacity. Operations at this level are extremely unstable,\nbecause there are virtually no usable gaps in the traffic system. Any disruption to the\ntraffic stream, such as a vehicle entering from a ramp, or changing lanes, requires the\n\n\n Output:"}]}
