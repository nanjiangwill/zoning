Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Conditional\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Conditional\n(CD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Conditional (CD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Conditional (CD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Conditional\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

They are intended to support high-quality, walkable, mixed-use, and\nconnected neighborhoods and districts that allow for some flexibility in development standards to\nhelp achieve these outcomes.\n(2) Frontage types. Frontage types establish the desired development form along the street\nedge to shape the experience from the public right-of-way. Each development shall provide a\nregulating plan in map form that identifies which of the following frontage types it will use along\neach street and developed area throughout the project.\ni. Shopfront. This frontage type is marked by storefronts with large display windows on\nthe first floor of multistory buildings that are pulled up to the back of the sidewalk to help create an\nengaging experience for pedestrians.\nii. Walk-up. This frontage type is marked by multi-story residences pulled up to the back\nof the sidewalk to help create a main street feel.\niii. Green. This frontage type is marked by multi-story residences with a modest setback\nfilled with green space to help create a downtown residential feel. This frontage type is often found\non streets just off the main street.\niv. Detached. This frontage type is marked by single-family residences with a front yard to\nhelp create an intown residential neighborhood feel.\n21 of 28\n7/3/2024, 12:56 PM\n\n\n Output:"}]}
