Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Planned Unit Development\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"PUD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Planned Unit Development\n(PUD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Planned Unit Development (PUD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Planned Unit Development (PUD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Planned Unit Development\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_lot_size is typically between 1,000 and 2,000,000 sq ft or 0.02 and 50 acres. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft).

Ten copies of such site development plan shall be submitted to the county.\nThe site development plan must show, at a minimum, the following:\n(1) All proposed public or private street rights-of-way;\n(2) The proposed location of all single-family residential development;\n(3) The proposed location of all multi-family development;\n(4) The proposed location of all recreational amenities:\n(5) The proposed location of all office and professional facilities;\n(6) The proposed location of all commercial facilities;\n(7) The proposed location of all utility facilities; and\n(8) The proposed density of development for each site designated single-family residential, for each site designated\nmulti-family residential, for each site designated for office and professional utilization, and for each site designated for\ncommercial utilization. Furthermore, the development plan shall include the gross acreage for the project, the gross\nresidential density (including recreational and open spaces), and the impervious surface limitations for each office,\nprofessional, and commercial site.\n(B) The Commissioners may designate property PUD if the Commissioners determine that the proposed development\nplan is in the best interest of the county because the plan meets the requirements of this chapter and represents a\ncomprehensive and coordinated approach to land planning and use on the property so designated. Adoption of a PUD\nzoning classification for a developmental site shall authorize the processing of all subdivision plans within the designated\ntract in accordance with the PUD provisions of the county subdivision and this chapter.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-1994)\n\u00a7 154.26 CHANGE IN PLANS.\nThe owner of each tract designated PUD shall be allowed to submit plats for subdivision approval that are inconsistent\nwith particular site designations as shown on the master plan; however, if any such changes are deemed material by the\nAdministrator as defined in \u00a7 153.04, the applicant may be requested to provide to the county an updated master\ndevelopment plan for the entire property, which updated plan must conform with all limitations contained within this chapter.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-1994)\n\n\n Output:"}]}
