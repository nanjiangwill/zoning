Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential Agricultural\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-2\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential Agricultural\n(R-2) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Residential Agricultural (R-2). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential Agricultural (R-2)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential Agricultural\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Accessory uses and structures that are clearly related to and incidental to the permitted principal use or structure on\nthe lot (Section 9-3-33).\n2. Fences and walls. Fences consisting of masonry, rock, wire or wooden material and hedges may be installed on the\nboundaries of any residential lot, provided that the height of such fencing, walls or hedges shall be limited to a maximum\nheight of five (5) feet between the street right-of-way line and the normal building line for that section adjacent to the street.\nFencing, walls and hedges on all other boundaries of residential property shall be limited to a maximum of eight (8) feet in\nheight. Retaining walls and required screenings shall not be subject to the above height requirements.

However, all new development on the south side of Centennial Boulevard shall construct sidewalk.\nAll new sidewalks shall meet the following requirements:\n1. Concrete sidewalks, minimum five (5) feet wide, shall be built along all street frontages of the lot according to city\nspecifications (four (4) inches thick except at non-residential driveways it shall be six (6) inches thick). The sidewalk shall be\nseparated from the street by a minimum four (4) foot wide planting strip unless on-street parking is provided. The planting\nstrip width may be reduced when there is insufficient right-of-way on existing streets. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02)\nSec. 9-3-39 Transportation impact study.\nA transportation impact study (TIS) may be required by the City of Claremont for any development or property that\nexperiences a change in zoning classification after the effective date of this chapter and is projected to generate one\nthousand (1,000) daily trips. A TIS shall be required for all development that experiences a change in zoning classification\nafter the effective date of this chapter and is projected to generate one thousand five hundred (1,500) daily trips. A TIS may\nbe required by the City of Claremont for any redevelopment or change in use of an existing occupied development that has\nexperienced a change in zoning classification after the effective date of this chapter that would generate one thousand\n(1,000) additional daily trips, and shall be required when the subject development is expected to generate one thousand five\nhundred (1,500) additional daily trips, subject to the exception set out below.\nWhen sufficient information on the proposed development is available for the City of Claremont to determine that the\naforementioned criteria is met, a TIS shall be submitted with all preliminary plats, site plans, site plan revisions, and special\nuse permit applications. The trip rates shall be based on trip generation rates contained in the latest edition of Trip\nGeneration published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers or any local trip generation rates either published or\napproved by the City of Claremont. Additional trips shall be determined by subtracting the gross trip generation of the\nexisting use from the gross trip generation of the proposed use. The additional trip calculation shall apply to property that is\noccupied at the time of submittal or has been occupied at any time prior to submittal.\nIf a development or property experiences a change in zoning classification after the effective date of this chapter and\nspecial circumstances exist, the City of Claremont may require a TIS without regard to the expected trip generation of the\ndevelopment. Factors that would warrant such a requirement are:\n1. There are existing levels of service deficiencies in the area of the proposed development. (\"Level of Service\" as\ndefined in the Highway Capacity Manual - Transportation Research Board Special Report 209) and/or\n2. Available accident data and/or operational and geometric factors indicate safety concerns.\nNotwithstanding the above, a TIS shall not be required if the property to be rezoned or developed has been the subject of\na TIS within the previous three (3) years and the projected trip generation of the newly proposed development is equal to or\nless than the previous study performed and the trip distribution has not significantly changed. As a part of subdivision, site\nplan and driveway permit approval, the City of Claremont may require needed transportation improvements for the property\nrequesting development approval; however, a TIS shall not be utilized as a means for staff to require the party developing\nthe property to make needed transportation improvements remote from the property for which the TIS is submitted, nor shall\nidentified deficiencies in level of service automatically preclude approval of the proposed development.\nThe TIS shall address the proposed land use, the trip generation therefrom, site access, modal splits if appropriate,\nimpacts on the transportation system from the proposed development, and physical improvements or enforceable\nmanagement strategies to mitigate negative impacts. At a minimum, the TIS shall identify the improvements necessary to\n\n\nNEW PAGE 21\nmaintain Level of Service D for streets and intersections as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual - Transportation\nResearch Board Special Report 209. Any TIS, whether required or voluntarily prepared, must be prepared by a licensed\nengineer in accordance with city guidelines. Additionally, the TIS should be reviewed and approved by city staff before being\nconsidered by City Council or any planning agency of the city.\nDevelopments/properties that have not experienced a change in zoning classification since the effective date of this\nchapter are not required to prepare a TIS as a part of their site plan approval.
