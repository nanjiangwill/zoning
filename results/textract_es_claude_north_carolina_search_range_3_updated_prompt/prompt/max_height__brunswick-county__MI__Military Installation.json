Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Military Installation\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MI\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Military Installation\n(MI) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Military Installation (MI). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Military Installation (MI)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Military Installation\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Planned Development is generally larger scale projects to ensure sufficient open space can be\nincorporated into the development design. The Planned Development option provides increased design flexibility with varied development and\nhousing types, provided certain enhancements are incorporated into the design of the project.\nB. Conventional Development\nConventional development is a pattern of development that conforms with standard dimensional requirements and typically provides a majority\nof property owners with substantial area on their own property.\nDEVELOPMENT TYPES\nCONVENTIONAL\nPLANNED DEVELOPMENT\nExample Lot Yield: 308 Lots\nExample Lot Yield: 308 Lots\n4.3.1. Planned Development\nA. Intent\nThe intent of a Planned Development (PD) is to promote quality development by providing flexibility in the mixture of uses and in meeting\ndimensional and other requirements of this Ordinance. A PD utilizes exceptional design and best management practices that result in\ndevelopment that is aesthetically pleasing, promotes environmental sensitivity and makes more efficient use of the land, resulting in increased\nopen space.\nB. Planned Development Approval\nPlanned Development projects shall be approved in accordance with the Planned Development approval process found in Section 3.3.3 and the\nsite plan requirements as outlined in Article 3.\nC. Development Intensity\nThe building area coverage and number of dwelling units in a project utilizing the PD development standards shall be calculated as follows:\n1. The building area coverage shall be the dimensional standards of the applicable zoning District (i.e., R-7500, C-LD, etc.). However, the\ndeveloped area may be increased as a result of utilizing exceptional design and/or best management practices as provided in Section 6.1,\nDesign Flexibility. The extent of the allowable increase will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Planning Director (minor site plans)\nor the Planning Board (major site plans) in relation to the extent of the successful use of exceptional design and best management practices\nin the project site plan.\n2. The allowable number of dwelling units in a project shall be determined by dividing the gross site area of the development project by the\nnumber of dwelling units (density) permitted in the underlying district.\nCommentary: For example, the density for R-6000 with water and sewer is 7.3. The allowable number of units for a PD project with 20 acres\nwith an underlying R-6000 district would be up to 143 units, provided all other requirements were satisfied.\n3. Increases in the number of dwelling units permitted in a project may be considered through the density bonus provisions in this article.\nCommentary: There is no guarantee that the maximum density can be achieved on a particular site due to consideration such as required\nopen space, site area devoted to easements or roadways, and other site specific issues.\nD. Uses Permitted within Planned Developments\nUses permitted in the underlying district are permitted in Planned Developments. For residential development, the type of dwellings proposed\n(e.g., single family, multi-family, cottage style, cluster, etc.) shall be approved in conjunction with the PD approval. Mixed use projects are\nencouraged within residential and commercial Planned Developments to reduce travel and maximize the use of land. In residential districts,\n43 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\n\nNEW PAGE 44\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nnon-residential uses are allowed in approved Planned Developments as follows:\n1. Commercial and other non-residential uses within a residentially zoned PD shall be the same as those uses in the Commercial Low Density\n(C-LD) and Neighborhood Commercial (NC) Zoning Districts per Section 5.2.\n2. Business Park uses may be permitted within a PD per Section 5.2 subject to approval by the Planning Board of the specific uses. Decisions by\nthe Planning Board regarding the inclusion of Business Park uses in a PD shall be based on considerations including, but not limited to, the\ntype of proposed uses, size of the proposed operations in relation to the overall development, the character and nature of surrounding area.\n3. No more than twenty percent of the total acreage within a residentially zoned PD may be designated for non-residential, excluding golf\ncourses and other similar facilities.\n4. Non-residential uses within residentially zoned PDs shall be designed and located to be easily accessible to residents of the development. It\nis expected that such uses will also serve patrons from outside the development.\n5. Such use shall, at minimum, have one internal access to the development.\n6. Within non-residentially zoned PDs, the uses shall be the same as those uses in the underlying district along with uses in the C-LD and NC\ndistricts, including residential uses. Business Park uses may be permitted within a non-residentially zoned PDs subject to approval by the\nPlanning Board of the specific uses; provided however such specific approval of uses shall not be required for property zoned C-I or I-G.\nE. Planned Development Requirements\nPlanned Developments are subject to the site plan and improvement requirements of Article 6. Design and Performance Standards. Additionally,\nPDs are also subject to the following general requirements:\n1. Recreation Area\nOpen space and recreation area shall be provided as required in the subject district (per the PD dimensional table). See Section 6.4.4.B.\n2. Water and Wastewater\nGenerally, public or community water and wastewater service shall be required in all PD. However, the Planning Board may waive this\nrequirement during the PD approval process.\n3. Ownership of Development Site\nThe development site to be subdivided may be held in single ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, the site shall\nbe developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.\n4. PD Perimeter Compatibility\nCommentary: Generally, the perimeter buffer is required along all exterior boundaries, even if the adjacent property is vacant. This is intended\nto provide visual protection for residents of the PD and any development which may occur on adjacent properties.\nF. Buffers\n1. It is preferable that all buffers shall be a natural, undisturbed wooded area where possible, and shall count towards the provision of open\nspace for the development. See Section 6.3, Required Buffers.\n2. A project boundary buffer with a minimum opacity of 0.6 shall be required along all boundaries of a PD except portions of the project\nlocated adjoining a street or roadway. Adjustments to the buffering requirements may be allowed by the Planning Director for minor\nPlanned Developments and by the Planning board for major Planned Developments.\n3. A street buffer shall be required along all boundaries of a PD fronting on a street or roadway.\n4. Additional landscaping and buffering requirements may apply. See Section 6.2, Landscaping and Buffering.\nG. Private Utilities\n1. Provision of all utility services, including, but not limited to: gas, water, sewer, electric, cable, and telephone, shall be underground.\n2.\nAdequate easements and rights-of-way for ingress and egress for maintenance shall be provided.\nH. Street/Internal Trafficways\n1. Creative design of circulation routes and trafficways is encouraged. A base characteristic of a PUD is that the internal circulation routes or\nstreets do not follow fixed linear geometric lines as do most streets. Instead, circulation routes are curvilinear and of meandering character,\nto preserve tree and landscape features. Generous use of design elements such as curved streets, private restrictions for extremely low\nspeeds and other features to achieve slower-paced traffic movements are strongly encouraged.\n2. A minimum right-of-way of at least 35 feet in width shall be required for all internal roadways. Additionally right-of-way may be required to\naccommodate wider roads or utilities.\n3. A minimum paved street width of 20 feet shall be required for all internal two-way roadways. One-way roadways shall require a minimum\npaved street width of 14 feet.\n44 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\nNEW PAGE 54\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nNotes:\n1\nCompletely opaque walls with a minimum height of six feet shall be required if the abutting land is in a residential district (see Section\n8.7.5).\n2\nStructures exceeding 30 feet or three stories in height shall provide at least three means of fire apparatus access. North Carolina\nBuilding Codes apply. Structures above 75 feet subject to Fire Marshal approval.\n3\nAdditional Building Height above the maximum up to 75 feet is allowed by right and above 75 feet with Planning Board approval at the\nfollowing rates:\nNon-Viewshed Protection Overlay areas at a rate of one additional foot of height for every one foot of additional yard depth (front, rear,\nand sides);\nViewshed Protection Overlay (see Section 4.8.7) areas at a rate of one additional foot of height for every two feet of additional yard depth\n(front, rear, and sides).\nInternational Fire Code with appendices and International Building Code with North Carolina Amendments apply.\n(Ord.

In the I-G District\nIf the Zoning Administrator finds that the CAMA Land Use Plan identifies hazardous or fragile areas or features in close proximity to the land in\nquestion in the application, or where other natural and manmade environmental impacts are anticipated, the Zoning Administrator shall\nwithhold action on the application and present it to the Planning Board at the next available meeting. The Planning Board shall make a\ndetermination of whether additional information will have to be filed. The nature and detail expected in the study may include a filing for\napproval of an Environmental Impact Statement to national standards and requirements, which may require an amended application upon the\nbasis of studies.\nB. RU-I District\n1. In addition to the requirements for rezoning listed in Section 3.8, an application for a rezoning to the RU-I District shall be accompanied by a\nstudy which meets the most current requirements and guidelines for preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (E.I.S.) under\nfederal law. Prior to initiation of the required study, the Zoning Administrator shall establish the scope and required details of the required\nstudy. This scope shall be approved by the Planning Board and the Board of County Commissioners. All costs associated with the\npreparation of the required study shall be borne by the applicant. Action on the rezoning application shall not be considered until the\nrequired study has been received and approved by the Planning Board and Board of County Commissioners.\n54 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\nCELL (1, 1): \nLot area (min. ac.)\nCELL (1, 2): \n1\nCELL (1, 3): \n100\nCELL (2, 1): \nLot width (min. ft.)\nCELL (2, 2): \n200\nCELL (2, 3): \n500\nCELL (3, 1): \nYards (min. ft.)\nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (4, 1): \nFront Yard\nCELL (4, 2): \n50\nCELL (4, 3): \n100 1\nCELL (5, 1): \nRear Yard\nCELL (5, 2): \n50\nCELL (5, 3): \n100 1\nCELL (6, 1): \nSide yard\nCELL (6, 2): \n10\nCELL (6, 3): \n100\nCELL (7, 1): \nStreet Side Yard\nCELL (7, 2): \n25\nCELL (7, 3): \n100\nCELL (8, 1): \nHeight (maximum feet)\nCELL (8, 2): \n50\n2,3\nCELL (8, 3): \n50\n2,3\n\n\nNEW PAGE 55\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n2.

CP - Conservation and Protection\nA. Intent\nThe Conservation and Protection District (CP) is intended to be used for the permanent protection and preservation of environmentally sensitive\nlands, and historical, cultural, and archeological areas of Brunswick County. Generally, activities within a CP district are limited to very low\nintensity uses, agricultural and silvicultural activities, parks, open space and natural habitat preservation, and very limited residential uses.\nConstruction and land disturbing activities should be limited in nature and scope and should have a very low impact on the environment and the\nsurrounding setting. Public or community water or wastewater facilities are generally discouraged in order to deter development pressure.\nB. Permitted Uses\nOnly uses specifically listed in the use table in Section 5.2 as a permitted use (\"P\"), permitted subject to limited use standards (\"L\"), or permitted\nsubject to special use permit (\"SUP\") shall be allowed in a CP District.\nC. Standards\n1. Applicability\ni. The following standards shall apply to all development within a CP district with the exception of bona fide farms. However, bona fide\nfarms are encouraged to comply with these requirements to the extent possible to ensure that impacts on the land and the surrounding\nenvironment are minimal.\nii. In addition to the standards contained in this Section. All other provisions in this Ordinance and all other applicable laws shall apply,\nexcept those that are incompatible with the provisions contained herein.\n2. Dimensional Standards\nProjects shall meet the following standards.\nNotes:\n1\nAdditional Building Height above 40 feet up to a maximum height of 75 feet is allowed at the following rates:\nNon-Viewshed Protection Overlay areas at a rate of one additional foot of height for every one foot of additional yard depth (front, rear,\nand sides);\nViewshed Protection Overlay (see Section 4.12.6.) areas at a rate of one additional foot of height for every two feet of additional yard\ndepth (front, rear, and sides).\nNorth Carolina Building Codes apply.\n3. Development Standards\nIn order to reduce the impact of development on the existing natural environment, the following standards apply to all land disturbing\nactivities within a CP district:\ni. With the exception of a pedestrian trail or a fence, no land disturbing activities may occur within a required yard or within 100 feet of:\n(a) All lands located within a 100-year floodway;\n(b) All site area under the jurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) or the North Carolina Department of Natural\nResources, Division of Water Quality (DWQ);\n(c) All lands located within a CAMA shoreline buffer;\n55 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\nCELL (1, 1): \nMinimum Lot\nArea\nCELL (1, 2): \nMinimum Lot\nWidth\nCELL (1, 3): \nMinimum\nFront Yard\nCELL (1, 4): \nMinimum\nSide Yard\nCELL (1, 5): \nMinimum\nRear Yard\nCELL (1, 6): \nMaximum\nHeight\nCELL (2, 1): \n5 Acres\nCELL (2, 2): \n300 feet\nCELL (2, 3): \n50 feet\nCELL (2, 4): \n100 feet\nCELL (2, 5): \n50 feet\nCELL (2, 6): \n40\n\n\nNEW PAGE 56\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(d) All lands located below the high water line of an existing pond, lake, or stream; and\n(e) All lands with slopes steeper than 25%.\nii. The requirement for mandatory connection to public water and sewer facilities (see Brunswick County Water and Sewer Use Policy) shall\nbe waived.\n4. Development Guidelines\nIn order to reduce the impact of development on the existing natural environment, the following guidelines apply to all activities within a CP\ndistrict. As guidelines, they provide an increased degree of flexibility.\ni. If development is anticipated to occur, the plan for such development should prioritize the preservation of natural habitat and sensitive\nenvironmental features such as large stands of trees, wetlands, Carolina Bays, pocosins, watercourses, marshes, and tidal areas.\nii. The use of Low Impact Design, stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) and other alternative construction principles is strongly\nencouraged.\niii. All site clearing and preparation, and construction activities should avoid removing existing trees and disturbing existing vegetation to\nthe extent possible.\niv. Although fencing is allowed, such fencing should be designed to allow for easy movement of wildlife. If more impervious fencing is\ndesired, it is recommended that such fencing be limited to the areas around inhabited or occupied structures so that remaining portions\nof the property allow easy movement of wildlife.\n(Ord. No. UDO-19-02, \u00a7 11, 9-19-19)\n4.7.2. MI - Military Installation\nA. Intent\n1. The purpose of the Military Installation District (MI) is to recognize the location of major single use and multiple use military facilities in\nBrunswick County.\n2. While federal government areas are not subject to local zoning and other codes, they occupy large land areas in the County. These areas\ntherefore are identified on the zoning map as a Special Purpose District to differentiate them from other areas that are covered by the\nregulations in this Ordinance.\n3. The main objective of this District is to identify specific resources not otherwise identified where protection can be considered in the public's\ninterest; identify interests relating to land use planning that impact County policy on industry, the environment and residential land uses in\ngeneral; minimize substantial development impacts of these facilities; and develop a coordinated, planning/zoning process to include all\nfederal entities.\nB. Permitted Principal Uses and Structures\nThe uses specified as permitted uses include any uses authorized by, and located in, official Military Installations of the U.S. Government.\nC. Development Coordination Required/Encouraged\n1. Notification Required\nWhen an ordinance amendment or modification would result in a rezoning or change or affect the list of permitted uses within five miles of a\nmilitary base, comments and analysis of the base commander shall be included in the consideration before making a final determination\n(N.C.G.S. 160D-601). Mailed notification shall be provided prior to any such action as specified in Section 9.1.B.3.iv.\n2.

Overlays are zoning districts which are applied only in conjunction with a Base Zoning District, and may grant additional use and development\nrequirements upon the underlying Base Zoning Districts. The effect is to have both the Overlay and the underlying Base Zoning District\nstandards control the use and development of land placed into any Overlay.\nCommentary: Some overlays provide additional restrictions on top of the underlying base district standards, while others may provide relief\n56 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\n\nNEW PAGE 57\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nfrom certain underlying base district standards.\nB.
