Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Open Space\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"os\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Open Space\n(os) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Open Space (os). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Open Space (os)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Open Space\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found.

The Town recognizes the PUD as a special district where the\ndeveloper/owner proposes an integrated expansion of land combining mixed uses. The PUD\nwill be divided into sub-districts with each sub-district being one of the recognized districts\nwithin this Ordinance. Development within such sub-districts must be consistent with the\nrequirements and limitations of the normal district it correlates with, and this PUD section and\nits chapters and subchapters, the most stringent will apply.\nPUD developers are required to submit a site plan for review, as established in section 18 of\nthis Ordinance, in order for the planning board and Board of Commissioners (BOC) to look at\nthe relationships between the mixed use development. There are no minimum lot sizes or\nsetback requirements in this district however when the PUD comes for review, those items will\nbe evaluated to make sure they conform to the standards set forth in this section of this\nOrdinance.\nDuring consideration and approval of the master plan for a PUD project, or a preliminary plat\nfor a section of the master plan of the PUD project, the BOC, following a recommendation\nfrom the planning board, may vary the minimum requirements of this Ordinance or the Town\nof Beaufort Subdivision Ordinance. The master plan or preliminary plat applicant must show\nhow the PUD will be enhanced aesthetically, the environment will be better protected, or for\nany other reason the BOC determines appropriate, as long as the BOC determines such\nvariance does not harm the public interest. Density within a mixed use district may be varied\nfrom the limit specified within the district as long as the maximum overall density limit of six\ndwelling units per acre is maintained.\n1) Accessory Building Setback Requirements.\nAll accessory buildings must comply with the setback requirements as set forth in section\n2-F, section 6, section 15, and all sections of this Ordinance.\n2) Building Height Limitations.\nThe maximum building height for this district is forty feet (40').\n3) Permitted Uses.\nAll uses are allowed in the PUD District as a Special Use.\n4) PUD Minimum Size.\nFifteen acres.\n5) Maximum Overall Density.\nSix dwelling units per acre.\n101\n\n\n Output:"}]}
