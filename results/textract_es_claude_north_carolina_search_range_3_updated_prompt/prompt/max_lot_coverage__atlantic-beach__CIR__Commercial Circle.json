Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Commercial Circle\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CIR\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Commercial Circle\n(CIR) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Commercial Circle (CIR). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Commercial Circle (CIR)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Commercial Circle\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage refers solely to the maximum lot coverage of buildings for primary use and all accessory structures. Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

Gross floor area (GFA) shall be defined as the sum in square feet of all floors of the building\nmeasured from the exterior face of the exterior walls. The gross floor area shall include or exclude areas as\nindicated below:\n1.\nAreas Included in Gross Floor Area.\na.\nAll enclosed habitable space.\nb.\nElevators, hallways, and stairwells on stories containing habitable space.\nC.\nOn stories containing both enclosed habitable space and off-street parking, the pro-rata portion of the area of\nthe elevators, hallways, and stairwells on that story apportioned to the enclosed habitable space function.\n2.\nAreas Excluded from Gross Floor Area.\na.\nUnenclosed porches or decks.\nb.\nOff-street parking areas, including the elevators, hallways, mechanical equipment, and stairwells on stories\ncontaining off-street parking.\nC.\nUtility services areas devoted to the electric service, the potable water service, the wastewater system, the\ntelephone service, the cable service, or to a backup generator.\nd.\nMechanical areas and uninhabited enclosed spaces on tops of roofs not intended for general storage.\ne.\nOn stories containing both enclosed habitable space and off-street parking, the pro-rata portion of the area of\n327 of 355\n4/13/24, 12:13\n\n\nNEW PAGE 328\nAtlantic Beach, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nthe elevators, hallways, and stairwells on that story apportioned to the off-street parking function.\nG.\nFloor Area Ratio. The ratio of a building's total floor area to the size of the lot upon which it is built. The terms\ncan also refer to limits imposed on such a ratio.\nH.\nHeight.\n1.\nMeasurement.\na.\nBuilding height shall be measured from the existing grade elevation prior to any land-disturbing activities.\nb.\nWithin the CIR District, height shall be measured from the adjacent street level of the fronting street. In cases\nwhere the BFE is established at a height above street level, height may be measured from the BFE.\n2.\nMaximum Height. Building height is calculated from the existing grade elevation to the highest point of the\nroof.\n3.\nExceptions.\na.\nResidential Construction. Spires, belfries, cupolas, domes, and chimneys, and similar features located above\nthe roof level for decorative purposes and not intended for human occupancy or general storage may exceed\nmaximum height requirements by no more than five (5) feet (see Figure 18.10.2.H Height).\nb.\nNon-residential Construction. Water tanks, ventilators, elevator housing, mechanical equipment or other\nstructures placed above the roof level and not intended for human occupancy or general storage may exceed\nmaximum height requirements by no more than ten (10) feet.\nC.\nCIR District. Spires, belfries, cupolas, chimneys, water tanks, ventilators, elevator housing, mechanical\nequipment, or other structures placed above the roof level and not intended for human occupancy or general\nstorage may exceed the maximum height requirements by up to ten (10) feet in the B and C Sub-Area Zones,\nand up to twenty (20) feet in the A and A-1 Sub-Area Zones.\n4.\nStory. That portion of a building included between the surface of any floor and the surface of the floor next\nabove it, or if there is no floor above it, then the space between the floor and the ceiling next above it.\n5.\nExemptions. Height limitations of this article shall not apply to government buildings, schools, hospitals,\nwater towers, public utilities, or similar structures provided such structures meet the required NC State\nBuilding Code.\nFIGURE 18.10.2.H HEIGHT\n328 of 355\n4/13/24, 12:13\n\n\nNEW PAGE 329\nAtlantic Beach, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nDome\nHigh Point\nof Flat Roof\nHEIGHT\nGrade\nHEIGHT\nGrade\nSpire\nDeck\nLine\nSkylight\nHEIGHT\nHEIGHT\nGrade\nI.\nLot Coverage. That portion of a lot occupied by buildings, structures and/or improvements, including paving\nand/or surface treatment materials that are impervious. Unless subject to an approved CAMA Major Permit,\nimpervious surfaces located waterward of the CAMA Normal High Water line, but located within the lot\nboundaries, shall be counted towards lot coverage.\nJ.\nSlope and Elevation.\n1.\nSlope. The degree of deviation of the ground surface from a flat, horizontal elevation, usually expressed in\npercent or degrees of deviation from horizontal.\n2.\nBase Flood Elevation. A determination of the water surface elevations of the base flood as published in the\nFlood Insurance Study. When the BFE has not been provided in a \"Special Flood Hazard Area\", it may be\nobtained from engineering studies available from a Federal, State, or other source using FEMA approved\nengineering methodologies. This elevation establishes the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation.\n3.\nFinished Grade. The established grade following grading, excavation, or other land-disturbing activity.\n4.\nNatural Grade. The level of the ground elevation prior to the commencement of development or land-\ndisturbing activity (see Figure 18.10.2.J: Grade Determination).\nFIGURE 18.10.2.J: GRADE DETERMINATION\n329 of 355\n4/13/24. 12:13\n\n\nNEW PAGE 330\nAtlantic Beach, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nHEIGHT\nBase Flood Elevation\nFinished Grade\nExisting or Natural Grade\nK.\nParking Space Calculation.\n1.\nRounding. When computation of the number of required parking spaces results in a fraction, the fraction shall\nbe rounded up to the next whole number.\n2.\nMultiple and Mixed Uses. Unless otherwise approved, development containing more than one (1) principal\nuse shall provide off-street parking in an amount equal to the total requirements of all individual uses, unless\nthe UDO Administrator determines that a lower standard would be adequate because of differences in peak\noperating hours.\n3.\nSeat Based Standards. Where the minimum number of off-street parking spaces is based on the number of\nseats, all computations shall be based on the design capacity of the areas used for seating.\n4.\nEmployee Based Standards. When the minimum number of off-street parking spaces is based on the number\nof employees, the computations shall be based on the number of employees on the largest shift.\n5.\nFloor-Area Based Standards. Where the minimum number of off-street parking spaces is based on square feet\nof floor area, all computations shall be based on gross floor area. The square footage shall include outdoor use\narea.\n6.\nDriveways Used to Satisfy Requirements. Driveways may be used to satisfy minimum off-street parking\nstandards for single-family detached, townhouse, and duplex dwellings, provided sufficient space is available\nto satisfy the standards of this Ordinance.\nL.\nLandscaping.\n1.\nDetermining Tree Size at Time of Planting.\na.\nTrees under Four (4) Inches in Caliper.
