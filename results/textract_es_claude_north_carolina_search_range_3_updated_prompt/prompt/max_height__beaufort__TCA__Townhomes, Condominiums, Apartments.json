Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Townhomes, Condominiums, Apartments\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"TCA\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Townhomes, Condominiums, Apartments\n(TCA) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Townhomes, Condominiums, Apartments (TCA). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Townhomes, Condominiums, Apartments (TCA)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Townhomes, Condominiums, Apartments\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

In no case shall a fence or wall over four feet (4') high be\nextended closer to the street right-of-way line or easement which parallels the front\nproperty line, than the front corner of the main building situated on the lot or twenty-five\nfeet (25') from said street right-of-way or easement. No fence may be constructed on or\ninto a public street right-of-way or easement. Side and rear yards may be enclosed by\nfences or walls six feet (6') high. Unless otherwise specified, metal fences shall not\nexceed four feet (4') in height and shall have a mesh smaller than five inches (5\").\nWooden or other privacy-type fences may not exceed six feet (6') in height. All fences\nin the historic district must be approved by the Historic Preservation Commission\n(BHPC).\n2) Only conforming nonresidential land uses with the exception of the TR District, may have\na solid or open fence or wall erected to a maximum height of ten feet (10') except as\nrequired by this Ordinance. An open fence or wall is one which has openings throughout\nand where clear vision is possible from one side to the other on a horizontal plane and\nsuch openings occupy fifty percent (50%) or more of the area of the fence or wall. A\nfence or wall which does not qualify as an open fence or open wall shall maintain a\nsetback at entrances and exits of the site to provide an adequate sight distance easement\nas depicted in subsection E-3 of this section.\n3)\nA fence or wall which does not qualify as an open fence or open wall shall maintain a\nsetback at entrances and exits of the site to provide an adequate sight distance easement.\nSuch easement shall be established as an isosceles triangle having legs thirty-five feet\n(35') in length on each corner side of the entrance or exit. The same sight distance\neasement shall be applied to the corners of nonresidential lots which are typified by a\nstreet intersection.\n4) The setback and yard requirements of this Ordinance shall not apply to a retaining wall\nnot more than five feet (5') high, as measured from the lowest ground elevation to the top\nof the wall. The Board of Adjustment (BOA) may permit a retaining wall greater than\nfive feet (5') high due to the topography of the lot if such wall is necessary.\nF) Screening/Buffering of Open Storage Areas.\nAny open storage area not enclosed within the confines of a building, such as boxes, crates,\ntrash piles, machinery, and merchandise with open display (windows) which result from the\ncommercial operation it is associated with, shall be enclosed or hidden from view along any\nproperty lines adjacent to a residential zone by a wall, fence, and/or screening/buffering in a\nmanner acceptable to the zoning administrator. This provision shall apply in any\nnonresidential use adjacent to a residential zone and all properties affected by this provision\nshall comply within three years after adoption of this Ordinance. In the TR and General\nBusiness (B-1) districts, there shall be no open storage as an accessory or other use.\nG) Location of Buffer Yards.\nBuffer yards should be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, extending to the lot's\nboundary line. Buffer yards may be located in whole or in part within any side yard, and rear\nyard setbacks. Buffer yards shall not be located on any portion of a public or private road\nright-of-way and/or utility easement unless written approval is obtained by the Town's Public\nWorks Department and/or the easement holder.\n183\n\n\n Output:"}]}
