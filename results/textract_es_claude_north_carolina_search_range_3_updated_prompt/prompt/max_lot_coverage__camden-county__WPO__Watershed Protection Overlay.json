Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Watershed Protection Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"WPO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Watershed Protection Overlay\n(WPO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Watershed Protection Overlay (WPO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Watershed Protection Overlay (WPO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Watershed Protection Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage refers solely to the maximum lot coverage of buildings for primary use and all accessory structures. Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

It shall\nnot be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use\ncan be made of the property.\n2.\nThe hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location,\nsize or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as\nhardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general\npublic, may not be the basis for granting a variance.\n3.\nThe hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The\nact of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the\ngranting of the variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.\n4.\nThe requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the ordinance,\nsuch that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.\nb.\nOther Considerations\nIn addition to the making the required findings in subsection (a) above, the BOA may also consider\nthe following:\n1.\nThe variance approval is the minimum necessary to make possible the reasonable use of\nthe land, building, or structure;\n2.\nAll property taxes on the land subject to the variance application have been paid in full;\n3.\nNone of the following may be used as the basis for approving a variance:\nA.\nNeither the nonconforming use of lands, buildings, or structures in the same\nzoning district, or the permitted use of lands, buildings, or structures in other\nzoning districts, or personal circumstances;\nB.\nA request for a particular use that is expressly, or by inference, prohibited in the\nzoning district;\nC.\nHardships resulting from factors other than application of the relevant standards\nof this Ordinance;\nD.\nThe fact that land or a structure may be utilized more profitably or be more\nmarketable with a variance;\nE.\nThe citing of other conforming or nonconforming uses of land or structures in the\nsame or other zoning districts; or\nF.\nFinancial hardship.\n2.\nSpecial Flood Hazard Area Variance Review Standards\nThe standards for variance to the special flood hazard area provisions is in Section 2.3.26.C, Variance\nProcedure.\n3.\nWatershed Protection Variance Review Standards\nDecisions or recommendations on applications to the watershed protection standards shall be based on the\nfollowing three findings (subsections a-c), which shall be supported by written findings of fact and\nconclusions of law:\na.\nThere are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter\nof the Ordinance. In order to determine that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary\nhardships, the BOA must find that all of the five following conditions exist.\n1.\nIf he or she complies with the provisions of this Ordinance, the applicant can secure no\nreasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of, his property. Merely proving that\nthe variance would permit to be made from the property will not be considered adequate\nto justify the BOA in granting a variance. Moreover, the BOA shall consider whether the\nvariance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of this Ordinance that will make\npossible the reasonable use of his or her property.\n2.\nThe hardship results from the application of the Ordinance to the property rather than from\nother factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship.\n3.\nThe hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such as its size,\nshape, or topography, which is different from that of neighboring property.\n4.\nThe hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly\nviolates this Ordinance, or who purchases the property after the effective date of the\nOrdinance, and then comes to the BOA for relief.\nCamden County\n2-63\nLast Updated:\nUnified Development Ordinance\nFebruary 4, 2019\n\n\n Output:"}]}
