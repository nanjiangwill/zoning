Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Highway Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"B-3\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Highway Business\n(B-3) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Highway Business (B-3). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Highway Business (B-3)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Highway Business\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

To maintain public safety and traffic safety by ensuring that signs are properly designed, constructed, installed, and\nmaintained;\n2. To minimize the distractions and obstruction of view that contribute to traffic hazards and endanger public safety;\n3. To protect existing development and promote high standards of quality in new development by encouraging\nappropriately designed, placed, and sized signage;\n4.

In addition, a certificate of\noccupancy for the change in the use of property shall require compliance with Article I. Not withstanding the above, changing\nor replacing the permanent copy on an existing lawful sign shall not require a permit, provided the copy change does not\nchange the nature of the sign so as to render it in violation of this chapter.

Maintenance of signs. All signs shall be maintained in good structural and aesthetic condition. Deficiencies such as\nchipped paint, broken plastic, missing letters and exposed light bulbs shall be evidence of a lack of maintenance.\n4. Content. Content of message, commercial or non commercial, is not regulated by this chapter.\n5. No sign shall be placed so as to obstruct the clear sight triangle at a street intersection.\n6.

Wall mounted signs.\na. One or a combination of the wall sign types below may be used on a building. Wall sign area is the total of the square\nfootage of all wall signs associated with a business or structure.\nb. A flush wall sign is mounted or applied directly to the building wall, generally on the fascia. It may in no instance\nextend above the parapet; in the residential and mixed use districts, it must be located below the parapet.\nC. A hanging sign is also a wall sign.
