Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Conservancy\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Conservancy\n(CD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Conservancy (CD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Conservancy (CD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Conservancy\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\"). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 165\n165/167\nCELL (1, 1):\nRestaurants (with drive through service)\nCELL (1, 2):\nOne (1) space for each four (4) seating\naccommodations, plus one (1) space for each\ntwo (2) employees on the shift of largest\nemployment; and Three (3) stacking spaces\nfor each drive through window.\nCELL (2, 1):\nSchool, Elementary and Middle (both public\nand private):\nCELL (2, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each classroom and\nadministrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee and one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (3, 1):\nSchool, High School (both public and private)\nCELL (3, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each fifteen (15)\nstudents for which the building was designed,\nplus one (1) parking space for each classroom\nand administrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee, plus one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (4, 1):\nShopping Centers, large and small\nCELL (4, 2):\nOne (1) space for each three hundred (300)\nsquare feet of gross floor area.\nCELL (5, 1):\nSingle Family, Duplex, Condominiums,\nManufactured Homes, and similar residential\nCELL (5, 2):\nTwo (2) spaces per dwelling unit\nCELL (6, 1):\nTerminals, Bus\nCELL (6, 2):\nOne (1) space for each employee and one (1)\nspace for each bus loading ramp and track.\nCELL (7, 1):\nStadiums, Theaters, and similar uses\ninvolving the assembling of persons:\nCELL (7, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each four (4) seats\nin the largest assembly room.

SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES.\nSexually oriented businesses are some of the uses which, because of their very nature,\nmay have serious objectionable characteristics, particularly when several of them are\nconcentrated in one area, thereby having a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas, or\nwhen the uses are proposed to be located in or near sensitive areas or land uses.\nSpecial regulation of sexually oriented businesses is necessary to ensure that these\nadverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding\nneighborhood. These special regulations and applicable criteria are contained in this\nsection.\nSexually oriented businesses shall be allowed only in the C(P) Planned Commercial\nDistrict and M(P) Planned Industrial District subject to the following:\nA. Sexually oriented businesses shall not be located within 2500 feet of another\nsexually oriented business. The measurement shall be taken from the exterior walls of\nthe building(s) containing such regulated use.\nB. No sexually oriented business shall be located within 3,000 feet of any area zoned\nfor residential use or from the property line of residential unit(s), religious worship\nactivity, nursery school, day care facility, any recreation and amusement not regulated\nherein, and any public or private school regardless of the zoning district, and shall be\nmeasured from the property line(s) containing such regulated use.\nC. Buffering complying with the standards of Section 1102.G shall be placed around\nthe entire perimeter, including road frontage, for all sexually oriented businesses.\nD. No nude or seminude service or entertainment of any kind shall be allowed\noutside the building of such use.\nE.

LOT REGULATION.\nUnless otherwise established in the County Subdivision Ordinance, the general lot\nregulations shall apply as herein set forth.\nA. One Principal Structure Per Lot. Every principal structure hereafter erected shall\nbe located on a lot as herein defined. In no case shall there be more than one main\nresidential building and its accessory buildings on one lot of record unless otherwise\nprovided for in this ordinance and the County Subdivision Ordinance. Residential uses in\nthe A1 Agricultural District that are considered accessory to the principal bona fide\nfarming use are not limited in number when associated with the farm use as exempted\nby Section 109.\nB. Street Access. No structure shall be erected on a lot, subject to regulation under\nthe County Subdivision Ordinance, which does not abut a public street or approved\nprivate street (see County Subdivision Ordinance for private street provisions) for at\nleast 20 feet, such frontage (abutting) to be continuous from the property line to the\nfront yard building setback line. Those lots or tracts, not regulated by the County\nSubdivision Ordinance shall provide, at a minimum, proof of a 20-foot deeded access\neasement, which has been properly and legally recorded with the County Register of\nDeeds, to serve the said lot or tract.\nC. Reduction of Lot Size Prohibited. No lot shall be reduced in area so that lot and/or\nyard areas below the minimum required under this ordinance shall result. Lots 50 feet\nor more in width may be treated as recorded lots less than the minimum requirement\n(sub-section D below).\nD. Recorded Lots Less Than Minimum Requirement. Where any lot of record on the\neffective date of this ordinance or amendment thereto for the zoning area in a district\nwhich allows residential uses does not contain sufficient land to permit conformance to\nthe dimensional requirements of this ordinance, such lot may be used as a building site\nfor a single-family residence, provided that the lot area and yard dimensions are not\nreduced below the minimums specified in this ordinance by more than 17 percent in the\nRR, R15, R7.5, R6, R6A and R5 residential districts; or below the dimensional\nrequirements of the RR Rural Residential District in the A1 Agricultural District.\nE.

Building Lines on Irregularly Shaped Lots. The Coordinator shall determine\nlocations of front, side, and rear building lines on irregularly shaped lots. In no case,\nshall a setback line be measured from any part of any tract that does not meet the\nminimum width requirement for the individual district as listed in Section 1104. Such\ndeterminations shall be based on the spirit and intent of the district regulations to\nachieve spacing and location of buildings or groups of buildings on individual lots.\nG. Corner Lots. Principal structures on corner lots in residential districts on which\ndwelling units are to front on each of the intersecting streets shall observe the front\nyard requirements on each of the intersecting streets if they are constructed and\nlocated within developments recorded after the effective date of this ordinance, or any\namendment to said ordinance. With the exception of the R6A Residential district,\nprincipal structures on corner lots in residential districts that observe the front yard\nrequirements of the two intersecting streets may reduce the required rear yard by 20\nfeet.\nH. Lot Area Exception in Conservancy Districts. In the CD Conservancy District, the\narea may be used as part of any contiguous zoning district for calculating density of an\nentire development and satisfying setback requirements for lots within the\ndevelopment. That portion of such lots within the development falling within the CD\nDistrict shall only be used for open space uses, and no principal or accessory structures\nshall be permitted, except boat landing piers when permitted by applicable Federal,\nState, or local regulations.\n(Amd. 01-19-10)\nSECTION 1102. YARD REGULATION.\nA. Projection Into Yard Space. Every part of a required yard shall be open from its\nlowest point (grade level) to the sky, unobstructed except for the ordinary projections of\nsills, belt courses, buttresses, cornices, ornamental features, sundecks, balconies, open\nporches and leaves; provided that none of the above projections shall project into a\nrequired yard more than four feet. Canopies, leaves and marquees may extend into a\nrequired yard in a commercial or industrial district provided that no more than ten\npercent of the square footage within the required yard is covered by such canopies,\nleaves and marquees, and provided further that supports for such canopies, leaves and\nmarquees shall not be solid and shall not interfere with the free movement of traffic,\nthe required off-street parking, and the sight view of adjacent properties.\n126\nJune 20, 2005 County Zoning Ordinance\nw/ Amendments through January 16, 2024\n\n\nNEW PAGE 139\nOpen fire escapes, outside stairways, open wheelchair ramps, the ordinary\nprojections of chimneys and flues, swimming pools, flag poles, decorative fountains and\nother similar items may be erected in required yards when placed so as not to obstruct\nlight and ventilation necessary for the structure. To minimize encroachment of\nwheelchair ramps into the required yard, turning platforms are encouraged.\nB. Determination of Front Yard Setback. The front yard requirements of this\nordinance shall not apply on lots where the average depth of existing front yards on\ndeveloped lots, located within 100 feet on each side of a lot, within the same block and\nzoning district as such lot, is greater or lesser than the minimum required front lot\ndepth. In such cases, the depth of the front yard on such lot shall not be less than the\naverage front yard depth on such developed lots. This provision shall not require a\nstructure to be set back from the street or road a greater distance than the distance set\nforth in this ordinance or the setback line observed by the closer of the two existing\nprincipal structures on immediately adjoining lots. In no case, however, shall any\nresidential structure be placed closer than 50 feet from the centerline of a street on\nwhich it faces or within 40 feet from the centerline of a side street. The location of a\nresidential structure with respect to the street line in any commercial or industrial\ndistrict shall not be used as a factor in determining the required setback from the street\nline for any new structure to be erected in such districts.\n((Amd. 01-19-10)\nC. Fences and Walls. The setback requirements of this ordinance shall not apply to\nany retaining wall. Open fences and walls may be erected to any height. Solid fences and\nwalls shall be limited to three feet in height when projecting into or enclosing a\nminimum front yard and shall be limited to seven feet in height when projecting into or\nenclosing a minimum side and/or rear yard. When a corner lot follows two front yard\nsetbacks, as determined by the Coordinator, a solid fence or wall greater than three feet\nin height, but not exceeding seven feet in height, may not be erected within 20 feet of\nthe right-of-way on the street deemed the secondary front yard by the Coordinator. The\nstreet on which the house is addressed is usually considered the primary street on\nwhich the house must follow the full front yard setback unless otherwise determined by\nthe Coordinator. Exceptions to location criteria are as follows:\n1. Fences or walls that are within or enclose the minimum side and/or rear yard\nof a subdivision lot which is situated on a peripheral boundary of a subdivision in which\nit is a part;\n2. Rear yards on through lots may have a privacy fence erected up to the rear\nproperty line, as determined by a platted \"no access easement\" or up to 20 feet from\nthat line in the absence of a \"no access easement\";\n127\nJune 20, 2005 County Zoning Ordinance\nw/ Amendments through January 16, 2024\n\nNEW PAGE 140\n3. Fences erected in conjunction with a buffer, as required by sub-section G,\n\"Buffer Requirements\" below, shall be set back a sufficient width from the property line\nto allow for the proper maintenance and upkeep of the vegetative buffer; and\n4. When a principal structure is permitted closer than 25 feet to a public right-of-\nway line, the fence or wall will be permitted no closer to the road right-of-way than the\npermitted location of the principal structure.\n(Amd. 11-20-06; Amd. 02-19-08; Amd. 01-19-10)\nD. Corner Visibility. In all districts, no fence, wall, shrubbery, sign or other\nobstruction to vision between the heights of three and 15 feet shall be permitted within\n20 feet of the intersection of two streets.\nE. Rear Yards on Through Lots. The depth of rear yards on through lots shall be at\nleast equal to the minimum required front yards for the district in which it is located,\nand no accessory buildings shall be located in the rear yard on through lots.\nF. No Other Building in Required Yard Space. No part of a yard or other open space\nrequired about any structure for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this\nordinance shall be included as part of a yard or other open space required under this\nordinance for another structure. When two or more uses occupy the same building,\nsufficient off-street parking areas, yard widths, lot area, open space, etc., must be\nprovided so that the dimensional requirements pertaining to each of the uses will be\nmet in full.\nG. Screening Buffer Requirements.\n1. A solid buffer shall be installed:\na. When a non-residential use abuts a residentially zoned property along the side\nand/or rear property lines;\nb. When any commercial off-street parking or loading space abuts a residential\ndistrict along the side or rear property lines;\nC. When any use permitted in a residential or agricultural district other than a\nsingle- or multi-family dwelling abuts a residential district along the side or rear property\nlines;\nd. When any multi-family development of more than three residential units\nabuts a residential district or an existing single-family dwelling along the side or rear\nproperty lines; and\n128\nJune 20, 2005 County Zoning Ordinance\nw/ Amendments through January 16, 2024\n\n\n Output:"}]}
