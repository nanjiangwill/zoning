Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Rural Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"RR\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Rural Residential\n(RR) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Rural Residential (RR). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Rural Residential (RR)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Rural Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

The district is intended to accommodate residential\ndevelopment in ways that will not interfere with agricultural activity\nor negatively impact the rural character of the County. One of the\nRural\nprimary tools for character protection is the requirement to\nconfigure residential subdivisions of more than five lots as\nconservation subdivisions. The conservation subdivision approach\nseeks to minimize the visibility of new residential development from\nadjacent roadways through proper placement and screening. The\nResidential\ndistrict accommodates several differing agricultural uses and\nsingle-family detached homes. It also allows supporting uses like\neducational facilities, parks, public safety facilities, and utilities.\nDistrict regulations discourage uses that interfere with the\ndevelopment of residential dwellings or that are detrimental to the\nrural nature of the district.\nCamden County\nUnified Development Ordinance\n3-18\nLast Updated:\nAugust 1, 2022\nCELL (1, 1): \nB.\nCELL (1, 2): \nDimensional Requirements\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (2, 1): \n#\nCELL (2, 2): \nSTANDARD TYPE\nCELL (2, 3): \nREQUIREMENTS FOR\nTRADITIONAL\nDEVELOPMENT\nCELL (2, 4): \nREQUIREMENTS FOR\nCONSERVATION\nSUBDIVISIONS [1]\nCELL (3, 1): \nA\nCELL (3, 2): \nMinimum Development Size (acres)\nCELL (3, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (3, 4): \n10\nCELL (4, 1): \nB\nCELL (4, 2): \nMaximum Residential Density (units/acre)\nCELL (4, 3): \n0.5\nCELL (4, 4): \n1\nCELL (5, 1): \nC\nCELL (5, 2): \nMinimum Lot Area (acres)\nCELL (5, 3): \n2\nCELL (5, 4): \n1\nCELL (6, 1): \nD\nCELL (6, 2): \nMinimum Lot Width (feet) [2]\nCELL (6, 3): \n125\nCELL (6, 4): \n60\nCELL (7, 1): \nE\nCELL (7, 2): \nMaximum Lot Coverage (% of lot area) [3]\nCELL (7, 3): \n24\nCELL (7, 4): \n72\nCELL (8, 1): \nF\nCELL (8, 2): \nMinimum Open Space (% of development size) [4]\nCELL (8, 3): \nNone\nCELL (8, 4): \n50\nCELL (9, 1): \nG\nCELL (9, 2): \nMinimum Front Setback (feet)\nCELL (9, 3): \n50\nCELL (9, 4): \n20\nCELL (10, 1): \nH\nCELL (10, 2): \nMinimum Corner Side Setback (feet)\nCELL (10, 3): \n50\nCELL (10, 4): \n20\nCELL (11, 1): \nI\nCELL (11, 2): \nMinimum Interior Side Setback (feet)\nCELL (11, 3): \n25\nCELL (11, 4): \n10\nCELL (12, 1): \nCELL (12, 2): \nMinimum Rear Setback (feet)\nCELL (12, 3): \n25\nCELL (12, 4): \n15\nCELL (13, 1): \nK\nCELL (13, 2): \nMinimum Distance Between Buildings, Front-to-Back (feet) [5]\nCELL (13, 3): \n20\nCELL (13, 4): \n10\nCELL (14, 1): \nL\nCELL (14, 2): \nMinimum Distance Between Buildings, Side-to-Side (feet) [5]\nCELL (14, 3): \n15\nCELL (14, 4): \n5\nCELL (15, 1): \nM\nCELL (15, 2): \nMinimum Accessory Building Setback (feet)\nCELL (15, 3): \n10\nCELL (15, 4): \n3\nCELL (16, 1): \nN\nCELL (16, 2): \nMaximum Building Height (feet)\nCELL (16, 3): \n35 [6]\nCELL (16, 4): \n35\n\nNEW PAGE 109\nARTICLE 151.3 Zoning Districts\nSection 3.5 Residential Districts\n3.5.3 Rural Residential (RR) District\nNOTES:\n[1] Residential developments of five or more lots shall be configured as a conservation subdivision in accordance with the standards in\nSection 6.5.

The district has a one-acre minimum lot area\nrequirement, which is the basic threshold size for lots with on-\nsite wastewater systems. Use of the conservation subdivision\nSuburban\nconfiguration is optional for residential subdivisions. While the\ndistrict allows single-family detached homes, mobile homes on\nindividual lots are prohibited. Nonconforming mobile homes\nmay remain but may not be expanded or replaced with another\nmobile home. The district accommodates equestrian uses,\nResidential\nutilities, as well as various neighborhood-supporting\ninstitutional uses such as parks, schools, and public safety\nfacilities. District regulations discourage uses that interfere\nwith the development of residential neighborhoods or that are\ndetrimental to the suburban nature of the district.\nB.\nDimensional Requirements\nNOTES:\n[1] Residential developments of five or more lots may be configured as a conservation subdivision in accordance with the standards in\nSection 6.5, Conservation Subdivision.\nCamden County\n3-22\nLast Updated:\nUnified Development Ordinance\nAugust 1, 2022\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (2, 1): \n#\nCELL (2, 2): \nSTANDARD TYPE\nCELL (2, 3): \nREQUIREMENTS FOR\nTRADITIONAL\nDEVELOPMENT\nCELL (2, 4): \nREQUIREMENTS FOR\nCONSERVATION\nSUBDIVISIONS\nCELL (3, 1): \nA\nCELL (3, 2): \nMinimum Development Size (acres)\nCELL (3, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (3, 4): \n10\nCELL (4, 1): \nB\nCELL (4, 2): \nMaximum Residential Density (units/acre)\nCELL (4, 3): \n1\nCELL (4, 4): \n2\nCELL (5, 1): \nC\nCELL (5, 2): \nMinimum Lot Area (acres)\nCELL (5, 3): \n1\nCELL (5, 4): \n0.5\nCELL (6, 1): \nD\nCELL (6, 2): \nMinimum Lot Width (feet) [2]\nCELL (6, 3): \n125\nCELL (6, 4): \n60\nCELL (7, 1): \nE\nCELL (7, 2): \nMaximum Lot Coverage (% of lot area) [3]\nCELL (7, 3): \n24\nCELL (7, 4): \n72\nCELL (8, 1): \nF\nCELL (8, 2): \nMinimum Open Space (% of development size) [4]\nCELL (8, 3): \nNone\nCELL (8, 4): \n50\nCELL (9, 1): \nG\nCELL (9, 2): \nMinimum Front Setback (feet)\nCELL (9, 3): \n25\nCELL (9, 4): \n20\nCELL (10, 1): \nH\nCELL (10, 2): \nMinimum Corner Side Setback (feet)\nCELL (10, 3): \n25\nCELL (10, 4): \n20\nCELL (11, 1): \nI\nCELL (11, 2): \nMinimum Interior Side Setback (feet)\nCELL (11, 3): \n10\nCELL (11, 4): \n10\nCELL (12, 1): \nJ\nCELL (12, 2): \nMinimum Rear Setback (feet)\nCELL (12, 3): \n10\nCELL (12, 4): \n10\nCELL (13, 1): \nK\nCELL (13, 2): \nMinimum Distance Between Buildings, Front-to-Back (feet) [5]\nCELL (13, 3): \n15\nCELL (13, 4): \n10\nCELL (14, 1): \nL\nCELL (14, 2): \nMinimum Distance Between Buildings, Side-to-Side (feet) [5]\nCELL (14, 3): \n10\nCELL (14, 4): \n5\nCELL (15, 1): \nM\nCELL (15, 2): \nMinimum Accessory Building Setback (feet)\nCELL (15, 3): \n10\nCELL (15, 4): \n3\nCELL (16, 1): \nN\nCELL (16, 2): \nMaximum Building Height (feet)\nCELL (16, 3): \n35\nCELL (16, 4): \n35\n\n\n Output:"}]}
