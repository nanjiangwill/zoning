Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"B\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Business\n(B) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Business (B). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Business (B)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Business\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

All solar farms must be set back from an adjacent highway right-of-way at least 50 feet.\nSimilarly, a side or rear set-back distance of 30 feet from any property line is required.\n2. A vegetative buffer consisting of either one or two rows of staggered evergreen vegetation\nis required as per the vegetative buffer design specification sheet available from the\nColumbus County Planning Department. A vegetative buffer may be constructed using any\nof those evergreen varieties identified or an approved equivalent. A staggered two row\nbuffer is to be located between any solar farm fencing and an adjacent highway. Similarly,\na two-row vegetative buffer is required to screen the farm from the direct view of adjacent\nresidential housing units. Where required, a single row vegetative buffer is required along\nperimeter fencing as noted in item three (3) below.\n3. A vegetative buffer consisting of one row of evergreen vegetation is required along all\nperimeter areas not covered under item number 2 above (i.e. where two-row vegetative\nbuffering is called for) but with the following exceptions:\na.\nWhere a natural vegetative buffer already exists on the property and which allows\nfor said natural vegetative buffer to remain and be maintained in an undisturbed\nnatural state which provides adequate screening to adjacent parcels on the side or\nsides, or along the back fence line of the solar farm.\nb. When a solar farm is located over 250 feet from an adjacent highway such that only\nminimal vegetative screening is needed to prevent the farm from becoming a\ndistraction to drivers on the adjacent highway or to adjacent landowners.\n4. Vegetative buffers may be located within the required setback areas.\n5. The maximum height for a ground mounted solar system under these guidelines is 15 feet\nabove ground level.\n6.
