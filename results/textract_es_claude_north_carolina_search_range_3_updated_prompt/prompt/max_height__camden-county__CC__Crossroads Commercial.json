Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Crossroads Commercial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CC\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Crossroads Commercial\n(CC) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Crossroads Commercial (CC). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Crossroads Commercial (CC)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Crossroads Commercial\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

The district's small scale and limited range of use\ntypes provides convenient access to basic goods and services to\nnearby residents in ways that protect the County's scenic\ncharacter and rural character. The district allows restaurants,\noffices, personal services, indoor recreation, retail, and visitor\nCrossroads\naccommodation uses, as well as agricultural support uses, and\ninstitutional uses. As a means of providing additional housing\noptions, the district allows live/work dwellings and upper story\nresidential. Industrial development, single-family homes, and\nhigher density residential uses are not permitted. The district is\nCommercial\nlimited in size (up to four acres) and must be within 500 linear\nfeet of a significant street intersection. New commercial\ndevelopment is built close to the street and subject to\ncommercial design standards to raise the bar for development\nquality. District regulations discourage uses that are too intense\nor that draw the majority of their patrons from outside the\nimmediate area.\nCamden County\nUnified Development Ordinance\n3-36\nLast Updated:\nAugust 1, 2022\nCELL (1, 1): \nB.\nCELL (1, 2): \nDimensional Requirements\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nREQUIREMENT\nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (3, 1): \n#\nCELL (3, 2): \nSTANDARD TYPE\nCELL (3, 3): \nNONRESIDENTIAL\nDEVELOPMENT\nCELL (3, 4): \nRESIDENTIAL AND MIXED-\nUse DEVELOPMENT\nCELL (4, 1): \nA\nCELL (4, 2): \nMaximum District Size (acres)\nCELL (4, 3): \n4\nCELL (4, 4): \nCELL (5, 1): \nB\nCELL (5, 2): \nMaximum Residential Density (units/acre)\nCELL (5, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (5, 4): \n1.4 [1]\nCELL (6, 1): \nC\nCELL (6, 2): \nMinimum Lot Area (square feet)\nCELL (6, 3): \n40,000\nCELL (6, 4): \n30,000 [2]\nCELL (7, 1): \nD\nCELL (7, 2): \nMinimum Lot Width (feet)\nCELL (7, 3): \n125\nCELL (7, 4): \n100\nCELL (8, 1): \nE\nCELL (8, 2): \nMaximum Lot Coverage (% of lot area)\nCELL (8, 3): \n24 [3]\nCELL (8, 4): \n24 [3]\nCELL (9, 1): \nF\nCELL (9, 2): \nMinimum Open Space (% of development area)\nCELL (9, 3): \n15\nCELL (9, 4): \nCELL (10, 1): \nG\nCELL (10, 2): \nMinimum Front Setback (feet)\nCELL (10, 3): \n20\nCELL (10, 4): \n25\nCELL (11, 1): \nH\nCELL (11, 2): \nMinimum Corner Side Setback (feet)\nCELL (11, 3): \n20\nCELL (11, 4): \n25\nCELL (12, 1): \nI\nCELL (12, 2): \nMinimum Interior Side Setback (feet)\nCELL (12, 3): \n10\nCELL (12, 4): \n10\nCELL (13, 1): \nCELL (13, 2): \nMinimum Rear Setback (feet)\nCELL (13, 3): \n10\nCELL (13, 4): \n10\nCELL (14, 1): \nK\nCELL (14, 2): \nMin.

The district requires\nurban-style open space (greens, seating areas, plazas, pocket parks, roof\nCommercial\ngardens, etc.) to be included as a part of new development. In addition to\ncommercial uses, the district allows a variety of moderate-density residential\ndevelopment.
