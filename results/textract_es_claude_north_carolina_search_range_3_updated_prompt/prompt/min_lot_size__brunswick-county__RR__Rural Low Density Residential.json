Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Rural Low Density Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"RR\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Rural Low Density Residential\n(RR) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Rural Low Density Residential (RR). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Rural Low Density Residential (RR)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Rural Low Density Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found.

Residential District Intent Statements\nA. RR: Rural Low Density Residential\nThe Rural Low Density Residential District is intended to accommodate nonresidential agricultural uses and low density residential development,\nas well as limited nonresidential uses that are supportive of the County's traditional agricultural orientation including farming, silviculture\noperations and related activities. Development in this District should rely predominantly on individual wells and septic tank systems for\ndomestic water supply and sewage disposal, respectively, although clustered residential development served by public water and wastewater\nsystems may be allowed.\nB. R-7500, R-6000, and SBR-6000\nThe R-7500, R-6000, and SBR-6000 districts are established to provide for orderly suburban residential development. A limited number of\ncommercial and civic uses are allowed, subject to the restrictions necessary to preserve and protect the residential character of the\nneighborhood. A special permit process for higher intensity development is also allowed, using discretion to balance issues of higher density\nwith improved amenities. Due to the higher intensity developments contained in this district, it is intended to be applied to properties served by\npublic sewer and water systems.\nC. MR-3200\nThis district is established as an area in which the principal use of the land is for high density residential purposes, not to exceed fourteen\ndwelling units per acre. The district also provides for the development of less intensive residential uses, as well as for compatible supporting\nnon-residential uses. Due to the higher intensity developments contained in this district, it is intended to be applied only to properties served by\npublic sewer and water systems.\n4.4.2. Permitted Uses\nOnly uses specifically listed in the use table in Section 5.2 as a permitted (\"P\"), permitted subject to limited use standards (\"L\"), or permitted subject\nto special use permit (\"SUP\") shall be permitted in Residential districts.\n4.4.3. Accessory Structures and Uses\n48 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\n\nNEW PAGE 49\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nThe following accessory structures and uses shall be permitted in any residential district. All accessory structures and uses shall meet the applicable\nstandards as set forth in Section 5.4, Accessory Uses.\n1. Accessory use customarily associated with a principal use.\n2. Accessory dwellings subject to the provisions of Section 5.4.2.\n3. Accessory structures subject to provisions of Section 5.4.1.\n4. Home occupations subject to the provisions of Section 5.4.4.\n5.\nRecycling drop-off collection stations subject to the requirements of Section 6.18.1.\n6. Fences and walls subject to the provisions of Section 6.10.\n4.4.4. Nonresidential Uses in Residential Districts\nA. Dimensional Standards\nUnless specifically modified in Section 5.3, Limited Use Standards, permitted nonresidential uses in a residential district shall meet the following\nstandards:\n1\nAdditional building height above the maximum up to 75 feet is allowed by right and above 75 feet with the Planning Board approval at\nthe rate of one additional foot of height for every one foot of additional yard depth (side, front, and rear) unless located in a Viewshed\nProtection Overlay where two additional feet of yard depth shall be required for each additional foot in height (see Section 4.8.7).\n2 Buildings or facilities exceeding 30 feet or three stories in height shall provide at least three means of fire apparatus access for each\nstructure.
