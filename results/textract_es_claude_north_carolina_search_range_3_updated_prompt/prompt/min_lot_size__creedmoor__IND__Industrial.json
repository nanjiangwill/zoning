Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"IND\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Industrial\n(IND) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Industrial (IND). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Industrial (IND)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Industrial\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found.

INTENT: The US 15 COMMERCIAL DISTRICT (C-15) is established to provide opportunities for\ncompatible and sustainable development along the US 15 corridor where future Creedmoor\nneighborhoods will interconnect with this Bypass type roadway corridor without negatively\ndissecting the community. Development standards in the US 15 Commercial District\nacknowledge that the automobile is the primary mode of transportation. Development and\ndesign standards encourage pedestrian scale development along a secondary street network\nserving larger projects. Goals of the US 15 Commercial District include providing a pleasant\nenvironment for motorists, a safe environment for pedestrians along the secondary network\nof streets and pedestrian facilities; ensuring the safety of motorists and pedestrians; and\npreserving the capacity of the Bypass to accommodate high traffic volumes at higher speeds.\nUses in this district include services, employment, and industrial.

INTENT: The INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT (IND) is established to provide locations for industrial uses\nthat, due to the scale of the buildings and/or the nature of the use, cannot be integrated into\nthe community. Uses within the Industrial District are buffered from adjacent uses. The\ndominant uses in this district are manufacturing and warehouse storage. Small scale\nmanufacturing and storage that is compatible with less intensive uses can and should be\nlocated in other non-residential or mixed use districts. The Industrial District is reserved for\nuses which require very large buildings and/or large parking and loading facilities.

To the City of Creedmoor and accepted by it for park, open space, agricultural, or\nother specified use or uses, provided that the conveyance is approved by the City\nCouncil; or\nb. To a nonprofit organization whose principal purpose is the conservation of open\nspace, to a corporation or trust owned or to be owned by the owners of lots or\ndwelling units within the development, or to owners of shares within a cooperative\ndevelopment. If such a corporation or trust is used, ownership shall pass with the\nconveyances of the lots or dwelling units.

No more than fifteen (15) percent of the street-planting yard may be used for walkways serving\nindividual lots, except in the MS, and MSP districts. Parking, merchandise display, and off-street\nloading are prohibited in the street-planting yard.\n11.6-3 PARKING LOT PLANTING AREAS.\nA. Applicability. Parking lot landscaping buffers shall be required to separate parking areas from\nadjacent uses for new and/or expanding parking lots with six (6) or more spaces.
