Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Conservation District\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CON\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Conservation District\n(CON) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Conservation District (CON). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Conservation District (CON)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Conservation District\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Height\n1. Other than the provisions listed in this Section, buildings and structures shall not exceed the\nmaximum heights established in Article 3 - Zoning Districts of this ordinance.\n2. The height of a building is the vertical distance measured from the mean elevation of finished\ngrade at the front of the building to the highest point of the building.\n3. A story includes any floor above the mean elevation of finished grade at the front of the\nbuilding. Where floor levels are staggered, the number of stories is the number of floors\ncounting vertically from the point of the mean elevation of finished grade at the building front.\n4. Roofs with slopes greater than seventy-five (75) percent are regarded as walls.\n5. Chimneys, church spires, water tanks, elevator shafts, scenery lofts\n6. and similar structural appendages not intended as places of occupancy are exempt from the\nheight limitation set forth in this Section,\n7. provided that not more than one-third (1/3) of the roof area is covered by such structures.\n8. Heating and air conditioning equipment, solar collectors and similar equipment, fixtures and\ndevices are exempt from the height limitation set forth in this Section, provided that they are\nset back from the edge of the roof a minimum distance of one (1) foot for every foot the\n9. feature extends above the roof surface. Screen or parapet walls shall\n10. be constructed to the height of any fixture taller than three (3) feet in height that would be\nvisible from a street or residential property abutting the property.\n11.

Setbacks Required. No portion of any building, excluding leaves, decks, patios, steps and\nuncovered porches may be located on any lot closer to any lot line or to the street right-of-\nway line than is authorized in Article 3 - Zoning Districts of this ordinance. All setbacks are\nexpressed in feet and are minimum setbacks unless otherwise noted. Additional setbacks\nmay be required to meet parking, landscaping, buffers or other standards specified in this\nArticle, the specific use standards of Article 4 - Individual Use Standards of this UDO.\n2.\nAllowed Setback Encroachments. A step, stoop, open porch, lawnings or other\nappurtenances may extend up to five (5) feet into the front setback, provided such features\ndo not impede pedestrian circulation or extend more than twenty-five (25) percent into the\nminimum setback. Attached and detached carports are permitted in the front yard setback\nand must meet the front setback requirements of the underlying zoning district and have an\nimproved driveway surface. Where approved by the Administrator, wheelchair ramps may\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-2\nADOPTION DATE: APRIL 12, 2021\n\n\nNEW PAGE 58\nARTICLE 5\nencroach up to 6 inches from any property line as long as there is no impact to the sight\ntriangle at a driveway or intersection.\n3. Setback Measurement\na.\nSetback distances shall be measured from the property line or street right-of-way line to\na point on the lot that is directly below the nearest extension of any part of the building\nthat is substantially a part of the building itself and not a mere appendage to it (such as a\nflagpole, etc.).\nb. If the street right-of-way line is readily determinable (by reference to a recorded map, set\nirons, or other means), the setback shall be measured at a right angle to such right-of-\nway line. If the right-of-way line is not so determinable, the setback shall be measured\nfrom the street centerline.\nC. All setbacks are subject to compliance with adopted applicable fire code provisions.\nC. Relationship of Building to Lot\nIn no case shall there be more than one principal building and its customary accessory buildings\non a lot except in the case of a designed complex of professional, residential or commercial\nbuildings in an appropriate zoning district.\nD. Street Access\nNo building shall be erected on a lot which does not abut a street or have access to a street,\nprovided that in a planned development, a building may be erected adjoining a parking area or\ndedicated open space which has access to a street used in common with other lots.\nE. Infill Development Standards\nInfill development is any new development on land that has been previously developed or vacant\nland where development has occurred around the vacant land.\n1.\nStreet Frontages. New structures should orient windows, main entrances, and other\nprimary building fa\u00e7ade elements toward the street. Care should be taken to avoid the\nappearance of buildings turning their backs or sides toward the street.\n2.\nFront Setback Pattern. The minimum front setback required may be reduced by the\nAdministrator for any lot where the average established front yard setback on developed lots\nlocated within 300 feet on each side of such lot, and fronting on the same street as such lot,\nis less than the minimum required yard setback. In such cases, the minimum front or street\nyard setback may be less than that required but not less than the average of the existing\nfront yard setbacks on the developed lots within 300 feet of each side. In addition, for new\nlots created from existing larger lots, the lot width at the frontage line and the side yard\nsetbacks shall be consistent with the immediately adjacent neighboring parcels on the same\nside of the street.\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-3\nADOPTION DATE: JANUARY 13, 2020\n\n\nNEW PAGE 59\nGENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\n3.\nDriveways.
