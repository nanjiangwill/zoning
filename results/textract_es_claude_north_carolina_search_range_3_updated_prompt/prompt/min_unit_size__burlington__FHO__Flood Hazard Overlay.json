Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Flood Hazard Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"FHO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Flood Hazard Overlay\n(FHO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Flood Hazard Overlay (FHO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Flood Hazard Overlay (FHO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Flood Hazard Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 74\nArticle 4 Zoning Districts\n4.5 Commercial Zoning Districts\n4.5.4.\nSpecial Standards in the FHO Zoning District\nD.\nOpen Space\nOpen space requirements for the residential portion of a multifamily or mixed commercial-residential\nproject shall be the same and conform to the requirements for multifamily developments in the MR-\n4-12\nCELL (1, 1):\nUse\nCELL (1, 2):\nDistrict\nCELL (1, 3):\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 4):\nMinimum\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 5):\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 6):\nMinimum\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 7):\nCELL (1, 8):\nYard\n(ft.)\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (2, 1):\nCELL (2, 2):\nCELL (2, 3):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 4):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 5):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 6):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 7):\nFront\nCELL (2, 8):\nRear\nCELL (2, 9):\nSide\nCELL (3, 1):\nAll residential, except\nCELL (3, 2):\nFHO\nCELL (3, 3):\n60\nCELL (3, 4):\n60\nCELL (3, 5):\n6,000\nCELL (3, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (3, 7):\n25\u00b3\nCELL (3, 8):\n63\nCELL (3, 9):\n51,2\nCELL (4, 1):\nmultifamily\nCELL (4, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (4, 3):\n75\nCELL (4, 4):\n75\nCELL (4, 5):\n7,500\nCELL (4, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (4, 7):\n253\nCELL (4, 8):\n253\nCELL (4, 9):\n102\nCELL (5, 1):\nMultifamily/ Mixed\nCELL (5, 2):\nFHO\nCELL (5, 3):\n100\nCELL (5, 4):\n150\nCELL (5, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (5, 6):\n15,000\nCELL (5, 7):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 8):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 9):\nCELL (6, 1):\ncommercial- residential\nCELL (6, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (6, 3):\n100\nCELL (6, 4):\n100\nCELL (6, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (6, 6):\n7,000\nCELL (6, 7):\nCELL (6, 8):\nCELL (6, 9):\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"CELL (2, 5):\\nWith\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 5):\\n6,000\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (2, 6):\\nWithout\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 6):\\n10,000\" 74]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"For district FHO, the section provides the information for min_unit_size.

Density rounding is permitted to the tenths place but is not permitted to the hundredths place.\nC. Land area associated with floodplains and riparian buffers may be included in the calculation of\nthe square footage of a tract or site for the purposes of determining the maximum residential\ndensity.\nd. Land area located within a right-of-way shall not be included in the calculation of allowable density.\ne. Maximum residential density in a particular zoning district may be increased beyond the amount\nstated in CHAPTER 3. ZONING DISTRICTS, in accordance with the standards in Section 7.6,\nSustainability Incentives.\n2. Calculation of Maximum Number of Lots\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\nThe maximum number of lots is calculated by dividing the total square footage of a lot or tract by the\nminimum lot area for the type of use proposed, the resulting number (the quotient) is then rounded\ndownwards to the next lowest whole number to produce the total number of lots permissible for the\ntype of use proposed. The effective density of a lot or tract may differ based on the type of use being\nproposed.\ni.\nExample 1: 67,000 Square-foot Site in the MDR District for Single-family\nDetached Dwelling Lots\na) Lot size: 67,000 square feet.\nb) Minimum lot area for a single-family detached dwelling: 9,000 square feet.\nc) Maximum number of single-family detached dwelling lots: 67,000 / 9,000 = 7.44, or 7\nsingle-family detached lots (fractions are rounded downwards).\nii. Example 2: 67,000 Square-foot Site in the MDR district for Single-family\nAttached Dwelling lots\na) Lot size: 67,000 square feet.\nb) Minimum lot area for single-family attached dwelling: 9,000 square feet + 1,600 square\nfeet for each unit.\nc) Maximum number of single-family attached dwelling lots: (67,000 - 9,000) / 1,600 = 36.25\nor 36 single-family attached lots (fractions are rounded downwards).\n3. Calculation of Allowable Residential Yield\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\nAllowable residential yield is the lesser of the maximum allowable density or the maximum number of\nlots for a given site.\ni.\nExample 1: 67,000 Square -foot Site in the MDR District for Single-Family\nDetached Dwelling lots\na) Maximum density (based on Example 1 in Sub-section 1 above): 8 units.\nb) Maximum number of lots (based on Example i in Sub-section 2 above): 7 lots.\nc) Allowable residential density = 7 units.\nii. Example 2: 67,000 Square -foot Site in the MDR District for Single-Family\nAttached Dwelling lots\na) Maximum density (based on Example 1 in Sub-section 1 above): 8 units.\nb) Maximum number of lots (based on Example ii in Sub-section 2 above): 36 lots.\nc) Allowable residential density = 8 units.\n4. Density Equivalence\na. Accessory dwelling units associated with a single-family residential principal use shall not be\ncounted towards the maximum allowable residential density.\nb. When calculating the density for a private dormitory associated with an educational use, two\nbedrooms in a private dormitory shall be equivalent to one regular dwelling unit.\nC. Maximum density amounts do not apply to student housing or lodging on college or university\ncampuses when the housing is owned or operated by the college or university. In these instances,\nresidential land uses are considered as an accessory to the college or university principal use.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \n8-14\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\n\nNEW PAGE 527\nCHAPTER 8 MEASUREMENT AND DEFINITIONS\nSection 8.3 Rules of Measurement\nG.
