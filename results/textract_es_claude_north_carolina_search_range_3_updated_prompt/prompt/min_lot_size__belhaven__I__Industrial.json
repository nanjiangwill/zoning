Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"I\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Industrial\n(I) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Industrial (I). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Industrial (I)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Industrial\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found.

WATER USE DISTRICT (W-1)\n152.120 DISTRICT DESCRIPTION\nThe Water Use District (W-1) is established to provide for the safe and orderly use of public trust waters\nwithin the zoning jurisdiction of the Town. The Water Use District (W-1) is intended to provide for a\nwide range of activities and uses while protecting the public rights of access, health and safety.\n152.121 PERMITTED USES\n(a) Private bulkheads and piers which have received a permit under the North Carolina Coastal Area\nManagement Act.\n(a) Traditional water activities, such as bathing, fishing and boating.\n152.122 SPECIAL USES\n(a) Special events, such as boat races, regattas, water ski ishows, boat parades, and historic\nreenactments.\n(b) Commercial marinas only in the Marine Business District as regulated by sections 152.071 TO\n152.072.\n152.123 MOORING OF BOATS\n(a) The unattended mooring of vessels within the zoning jurisdiction of the Town for periods longer\nthan seven days is prohibited subject to those allowed in section 152.123(b). The occupancy of\nvessels within the zoning jurisdiction of the Town for longer than seven days is prohibited.\nThe mooring of boats within public trust waters creates safety hazards for boat traffic and can\ninterfere with public rights access to, and use of, navigable waters and public resources. The\nlong- term occupancy of moored vessels within the public trust waters is a hazard to water\nquality and public health. All temporarily moored boats must be lighted between sunset and\nsunrise.\n(b) Permanent, privately owned moorings are hazardous to navigation, increase congestion of the\npublic trust waters, and create potential water quality degradation. Therefore, no privately\nowned permanent mooring shall be allowed.\nARTICLE XIV.
