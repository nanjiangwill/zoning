Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Medical Educational\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"M-E\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Medical Educational\n(M-E) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Medical Educational (M-E). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Medical Educational (M-E)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Medical Educational\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

For the purpose of this chapter, the town and its extraterritorial jurisdiction is hereby divided into the following\ndesignated districts:\n(1) R-1, Low-Density Residential District;\n(2) R-1-U, Single-Family Residential District;\n(3) R-2, General Residential District;\n(4) C-1, Central Business District;\n(5) C-1P, Central Business District with Parking;\n(6) HDO, Heritage District Overlay;\n(7) C-2, General Business District;\n(8) RC, Resort Commercial District;\n(9) G-O, Governmental-Office District;\n(10) M-E, Medical Educational District;\n(11) M-1, Industrial District;\n(12) M-U, Mixed Use District;\n(13) CUD, Conditional Use District; and\n(14) CZD, Civic Zoning District.\n(B) District boundaries. The boundaries of the district enumerated in $152.026 of this chapter are hereby established as shown\non the map entitled \"Official Zoning Map, Town of Banner Elk, North Carolina, and the Area Comprising Its Extraterritorial\nJurisdiction\" adopted by the Town Council and certified by the Town Clerk. Said map and all explanatory matter thereon\naccompanies and is hereby, made a part of this chapter as if fully written herein. Said map shall be retained in the office of the\nTown Clerk and also shall be recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds of the county.\n(C) Interpretation of district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts\nas shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply.\n(1) Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways, streams or rivers,\nstreet right-of-way lines or such lines extended, such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.\n(2) Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be\nsaid boundaries.\n(3) Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets or highways, or\nrights-of-ways of same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance there from as\nindicated on the zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on said\nzoning map.\n(4) Where a district boundary line divides a lot of single ownership, the district requirements for the least restricted portion of\nsuch lot shall be deemed to apply to the whole thereof; provided that, such extensions shall not include any part of such a lot more\nthan 35 feet beyond the district boundary line.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 306)\n\u00a7 152.027 INTENT.\n(A) General. It is the intent of this subchapter that if any use or class of use is not specifically permitted in a district as set forth in\nthe sections below, it shall be prohibited in that district unless similar uses are described in the ordinance. Should an applicant\npetition the town for approval of a use not covered specifically in this chapter, the application may be considered as a conditional\nuse. Factors to be considered to determine if the use is in harmony with the keeping of the public health, safety and welfare of the\ncitizens of the town are the impacts of anticipated amounts of traffic, noise, light, density, vibration, odor and the bearing these may\nhave on adjoining neighbors and the community. The Town Council specifically finds that industrial uses of property, such as\nmanufacturing and other heavy industry, are incompatible with the quiet and peaceful mountain resort and retirement community\nenjoyed by the citizens. The Town Council further finds that high impact uses of property, including, but not limited to, racetracks,\nshooting ranges and other noise emitting activities, are incompatible with the quiet and peaceful community expected and enjoyed\nby the citizens of the town.\n(B) R-1, Low-Density Residential District. The R-1 Low-Density Residential District is established as a district in which the\nprincipal use of land is for single-family dwellings on large parcels of land. It is the intention of these regulations to provide for\nlimited residential development in areas where police and fire protection, protection against flooding by storm water and dangers\nfrom excessive erosion are not possible without excessive costs to the community. It is also the intent to maintain and preserve a\n\n\nNEW PAGE 18\ntranquil residential community with the flexibility to accommodate conditional uses compatible with residential use.\n(C) R-1-U, Single-Family Residential District. The R-1-U District is established for developments where the existing pattern of\ndevelopment has been established by a subdivision intended and used principally for single-family dwellings on traditional lots. The\nmore defined urban pattern offers limited use for optional non-residential development and provides justification for a more\nrestrictive residential zone.\n(D) R-2, General Residential District. The R-2 General Residential District is established as a district in which the principal use of\nland is for residential purposes.\n(E) C-1, Central Business District. In order to protect and improve the main shopping area in the town and to discourage uses\nwhich do not require a central location which are not compatible with the function of the area as the primary shopping and office\narea, a Central Business District is hereby established.\n(F) C-2, General Business District. The purpose of this district is to provide for general and commercial activity along major\nthoroughfares and at other convenient points in the area. Regulations are designed to preserve the traffic carrying capacity of the\nstreets and to provide for off-street parking. It is not the intent of this district to encourage extensive strip commercial development,\nrather to provide concentrations of general commercial activities.\n(G) M-E, Medical Educational District. The district is established to provide for the specific circumstances and needs of the\nmedical and educational institutions within the town's jurisdiction. The uses permitted within this district shall be limited to those of a\nmedical and educational nature, and closely related uses supportive of medical and educational institutions.\n(H) C-1P, Central Business District with Parking. The Central Business District with Parking is created to provide an expanded\ncentral commercial area that will maintain the character of the existing C-1 District, but will require that all uses in the district\nconform to the off-street parking requirements of this chapter.\n(I) RC, Resort Commercial District. The Resort Commercial District is established to provide specific areas within the town\njurisdiction where specific and limited resort activities can be developed in a more rural setting. The district will have conditions and\nstandards for uses in the district that will provide protection for any adjacent residential areas while providing a more rural, rustic\nsetting for resort commercial activities.\n(J) M-1, Industrial District. This district is established to provide areas for manufacturing, warehousing and similar uses.\n(K) G-O, Governmental-Office District. The Governmental-Office District includes property owned by governmental entities, such\nas, but not limited to, the town and county and their respective subdivisions. It includes the Town Maintenance Facility; the Tate-\nEvans Park; the Banner Elk Daycare Facility; the Wastewater Treatment Plant; Town Hall; the Police Department; the Banner Elk\nVolunteer Fire Department; professional offices; and any other such properties which may heretofore be designated for similar\nuses.\n(L) Heritage District Overlay. (Boundary descriptions established on 2-7-2005.) The purpose of the Heritage District Overlay is to\nprotect, preserve and encourage the architectural, cultural, village atmosphere and historical significance of the downtown core of\nthe town. Its boundaries shall be defined as established on the official zoning map of the town. As an overlay district, the permitted\nand special uses, as well as dimensional requirements, shall conform to those of the underlying, except where additional\nrequirements are noted herein.\n(M) Mixed Use District. This district is designed to encourage integration of mixed land uses (residential and commercial) to\npromote high density, low impact development of communities with alternatives modes of transportation, such as walking and\nbiking. The commercial and residential uses should compliment each other. The district is intended to promote nodal development\nas opposed to strip development and can be located away from main thoroughfares, if the Town Council agrees that the location is\nconsistent with the vision for the town.\n(N) CUD, Conditional Use District. This district is designed to allow a zoning district with no permitted uses at all; all\ndevelopment is subject to acquiring a special use permit. This can only be established at the property owner's request. The\nlegislative rezoning to apply the CUD is generally done concurrently with the quasi-judicial issuance of a SUP by the Board of\nAdjustment.\n(O) Civic Zoning District. The Civic Zoning District is established to enable property owned by governmental entities, including\nthe town, to operate in a way that is beneficial to the residents of the town and protects the historical integrity of the property while\nsupporting the maintenance of the property. This district is to focus on permissible uses that are compatible with the community\nwith some that are within the broad definition of \"civic use\".

The Planned Residential Development is established to encourage a more creative approach in land and building site\nplanning for residential uses, to encourage an efficient, aesthetic and desirable use of open space, and to achieve flexibility and\nincentives for residential development which will produce a wider range of choice in satisfying the changing need for residential\ndevelopment in the town area.\n(B) Uses permitted. Within a planned residential development, a building or premises shall be used for the following purposes\nonly:\n(1) Single-family dwelling unit, excluding manufactured homes;\n(2) Multi-family dwelling units;\n(3) Customary accessory buildings, including private garages, non-commercial workshops, greenhouses, clubs, inns and\nlodges which are accessory to the primary residential function of the development, and which are an integral part of the planned\ndevelopment;\n(4) Private, non-commercial recreational facilities and buildings which are accessory to the primary residential function of the\ndevelopment, and which are an integral part of the planned development; and\n(5) Mixed uses may be included with limited commercial activities, which complement the residential development. Integration\nof commercial uses may be considered upon a recommendation of the Planning Board and at the determination of the Board of\nAdjustment as a conditional use. No commercial uses are permitted by right. Only neighborhood type service and light retail uses\ncan be considered with a limit of 40% of the total building(s) square footage being commercial.\n(C) Dimensional requirements. The Architectural Review Committee and the Board of Adjustment shall evaluate the site\ndevelopment plan in order to determine that the proposed site design and density of the project is acceptable regarding health,\nsafety and general welfare for residential living. All buildings and structures shall conform to the minimum setback requirements for\nthe district in which the development is located along the exterior boundaries of the site.\n(D) Density and building coverage. The development shall not exceed the density of the district in which the development is\nlocated, rounded to the lowest whole dwelling unit. The total project density shall be determined on the basis of the gross square\nfootage of the proposed site, less any part of the proposed site in any street or highway right-of-way. The Board of Adjustment may\nrequire a lower density within a development in order to protect the physical environment, and ensure adequate access and\nservices to the project and adjacent properties. The total building coverage space (including parking or storage areas and all\nimpervious surfaces) shall not exceed 40% of the gross square footage of the proposed site. If the Board of Adjustment deems\nnecessary, all or part of the boundaries of the development shall be provided with a 15-foot wide buffer strip, upon which evergreen\ntrees or shrubs shall be planted which at maturity shall be at least ten feet in height.\n(E) Responsibility of the applicant. When the applicant proposes to construct two or more principal buildings (residential), he or\nshe shall proceed with the following schedule:\n(1) Apply in writing to the Board of Adjustment requesting a conditional use for a Planned Residential Development. Attached\nto the application shall be the following information to be reviewed by the Planning Board:\n(a) A site plan map showing the location of all proposed buildings and accessory uses, parking facilities, open space, utility\neasements and drainage, proposed buffer strips and topographic relief (contour interval of five feet) map to be at an appropriate\nscale; and\n(b) Gross acreage and/or square footage of the proposed development, the number and types of dwelling units and\naccessory buildings, and the percentage of acreage and/or square footage of all covered space (including covered parking or\nstorage areas and all impervious surfaces) in the proposed development.\n(2) Appear in person (or send a duly appointed representative affiliated with the proposed development) at the Architectural\nReview Committee and the Board of Adjustment meetings at which the proposed application is to be discussed, in order to answer\nall pertinent questions which the Architectural Review Committee and the Board of Adjustment may feel necessary to have\nanswered, in order to review said application.\n(F) Streets and utilities. All developments containing streets and utilities designated or planned for acceptance by the town\n(whether for immediate or for future acceptance) shall first be reviewed by the Architectural Review Committee before the planned\nresidential development is approved by the Board of Adjustment. All streets and utility lines proposed shall be designated and\nconstructed in accordance with, but not limited to, standards as shown in the subdivision regulations of the town.
