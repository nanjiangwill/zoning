Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Parks and Conservation\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"PC\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Parks and Conservation\n(PC) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Parks and Conservation (PC). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Parks and Conservation (PC)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Parks and Conservation\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\"). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 165\n165/167\nCELL (1, 1):\nRestaurants (with drive through service)\nCELL (1, 2):\nOne (1) space for each four (4) seating\naccommodations, plus one (1) space for each\ntwo (2) employees on the shift of largest\nemployment; and Three (3) stacking spaces\nfor each drive through window.\nCELL (2, 1):\nSchool, Elementary and Middle (both public\nand private):\nCELL (2, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each classroom and\nadministrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee and one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (3, 1):\nSchool, High School (both public and private)\nCELL (3, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each fifteen (15)\nstudents for which the building was designed,\nplus one (1) parking space for each classroom\nand administrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee, plus one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (4, 1):\nShopping Centers, large and small\nCELL (4, 2):\nOne (1) space for each three hundred (300)\nsquare feet of gross floor area.\nCELL (5, 1):\nSingle Family, Duplex, Condominiums,\nManufactured Homes, and similar residential\nCELL (5, 2):\nTwo (2) spaces per dwelling unit\nCELL (6, 1):\nTerminals, Bus\nCELL (6, 2):\nOne (1) space for each employee and one (1)\nspace for each bus loading ramp and track.\nCELL (7, 1):\nStadiums, Theaters, and similar uses\ninvolving the assembling of persons:\nCELL (7, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each four (4) seats\nin the largest assembly room.

The off-site parking is located within 1,000 feet from the use it serves, as measured from the\nentrance of the use to the nearest off-site parking space;\nb. A sidewalk or paved pedestrian walkway is provided to the off-site parking area from the use;\nC. In cases where the off-site parking is located on land under separate ownership from the use it\nserves, the off-site parking shall be subject to a written agreement executed by the owners\ninvolved and filed with the Planning Director prior to the use of off-site parking facilities. The\nagreement shall guarantee the long-term availability of the off-site parking in question; and\nd. Should an off-site parking agreement cease, then the use shall be considered a nonconformity\nsubject to the standards in CHAPTER 9. NONCONFORMITIES, unless the use is brought into\ncompliance with the minimum off-street parking requirements of this section.\n4. Shared Parking\nThe required off-street parking for a use may be met with shared use of the required off-street parking\nspaces of another use, only in accordance with the following standards:\na. The use of shared off-street parking spaces shall be subject to a shared parking agreement\nexecuted by the landowners of the uses involved, approved by the Planning Director, and recorded\nin the office of the Register of Deeds for the county where the development is located;\nb. The shared parking agreement shall guarantee the long-term availability of the shared parking\nspaces in question. Nothing shall limit the percentage of required off-street parking spaces that\nmay be provided through a shared parking agreement;\nC. The shared parking is located within 1,000 feet, as measured from the entrance of the use to the\nnearest shared parking space;\nd. A sidewalk or paved pedestrian walkway is provided to the shared parking area from the use;\ne. The uses served by the shared parking must have different peak parking demands, differences in\nhours or days of operation, or otherwise operate such that the uses sharing parking have access\nto the required minimum number of off-street parking spaces when in operation; and\nf. Should the shared parking agreement cease, then the use(s) formerly served by shared parking\nshall be considered a nonconformity subject to the standards in CHAPTER 9. NONCONFORMITIES,\nunless the use(s) is brought into compliance with the minimum off-street parking requirements of\nthis section.\n5. Alternative Surfacing\nThe use of pervious or semi-pervious parking area surfacing materials-including, but not limited to,\n\"grass-crete,\" \"turfstone,\" cellular reinforced paving systems, porous concrete, crushed stone, or\nrecycled materials such as glass, rubber, used asphalt, brick, block, and concrete-may be proposed\nfor required off-street parking spaces, drive aisles, or vehicular surface areas on a site, provided such\nareas are properly maintained. Where possible, such materials should only be used in areas proximate\nto and in combination with on-site stormwater control measures or tree protection measures.\nK. OFF-STREET LOADING\n1. Loading Facilities Required\nEvery application for a non-residential use shall ensure that adequate off-street loading facilities are\nprovided so that loading vehicles do not occupy required off-street parking spaces, block vehicular\naccess, or prevent appropriate on-site maneuvering.\n2. Minimum Off-Street Loading Space Requirements\na. A minimum number of off-street loading spaces is not established; however, if off-street loading\nspaces are provided, they shall be provided and maintained in sufficient numbers to adequately\nhandle the needs of a non-residential use.\nb.\nFailure to provide or maintain off-street loading spaces when they are necessary to serve the\ndevelopment is a violation of this Ordinance.\nC.\nIn no instance shall an off-street loading space occupy a required off-street parking space or\ninterrupt the safe operation of vehicles or circulation of pedestrian or bicycles.\nd. Each off-street loading space shall be designed with an appropriate means of vehicular access to\na street or alley in a manner that will least interfere with traffic circulation.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \n5-18\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\n\nNEW PAGE 311\nCHAPTER 5 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nSection 5.1 Off-Street Parking and Loading\n3.
