Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Central Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"C-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Central Business\n(C-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Central Business (C-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Central Business (C-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Central Business\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Building Rooflines\nIn order to create visual continuity within commercial districts, roofs shall be compatible with neighboring buildings'\narchitectural styles. Roof planes shall be varied and contain dormers or other architectural elements to provide buildings\nwith visual interest. The appearance of a flat roof is prohibited and monolithic expanses of roof on large scale buildings\nshall be avoided through the use of elements such as gables and parapets. Rooftop mechanical and electrical equipment\nshall be screened from public view. See graphic, Section 802\nSection 809. Building Height\nThe vertical distance from the average grade elevation taken at the fronting street side of a structure to the top of any\nparapet structure or roofline of a flat roof, the midpoint from the leaves to the ridgeline of a pitched roof, or the top of a\nmansard roof.

As a general rule, front facades in the C-1 district should be at least 80 percent\nbrick and stone. Side facades should be at least 50 percent brick and stone. Rear facades do not have a\nminimum requirement for primary materials and where appropriate may consist entirely of secondary materials\n(e.g., stucco). Tertiary materials (i.e., wood and metal) should be used for decorative elements and trim only.\n2. Exterior building materials on the primary structure shall not include smooth-faced concrete block, tilt-up\nconcrete panels, or prefabricated steel panels.\n3.\nThe following types of building materials shall not be used: highly reflective, shiny, or mirror-like materials; mill-\nfinish (non-colored) aluminum metal windows or door frames; exposed, unfinished foundation walls; exposed\nplywood or particle board; and un-plastered, exposed concrete masonry blocks.\n4. Material or color changes generally should occur at a change of plane. Piecemeal embellishment and frequent\nchanges in material should be avoided.\n5.\nA horizontal accent stripe (e.g., a foot wide stripe of different color) may be used to help reduce the appearance\nof monotonous colors and break up the appearance of large building walls.\n6. Facade colors shall be low reflectance, and subtle, neutral, or earth-tone colors. High-intensity colors, metallic\ncolors, black, or fluorescent colors shall not be used. Building trim and accent areas may feature brighter colors,\nprovided that the width of the trim shall not exceed four feet.\n7. Building colors shall be carefully chosen so that each building color complements that of its neighbors. Colors\nare classified as the \"base\" color (used on the majority of the building surface), \"trim\" color (used on the\nwindow trim, fascia, balustrades, and posts), and \"accent\" color (used on signs, awnings, and doors). The base\ncolor should consist of more subdued earth tones or brick shades. Trim colors should have contrasting lighter or\ndarker shade than the base color. If natural brick is used, it should not be painted.\nSection 811. Awnings\n1.\nThe use of awnings on buildings is recommended to provide protection from sun, wind, and rain, and to improve\nthe aesthetics of building exteriors.\n2. It is recommended that awnings be constructed with a durable frame, covered by a canvas material. Awnings\nthat are backlit through translucent materials may be acceptable but are not particularly encouraged.\nAluminum and other metal canopies are acceptable in most instances, particularly when integrated into\nshopping center designs. Flameproof vinyl, canvas or metal awnings and canopies may be permitted.\n3. Solid colors are preferred over striped lawnings, but striping may be permitted if colors complement the\ncharacter of the structure or group of buildings.\n4. Awnings are encouraged for first floor retail uses to provide architectural interest and to encourage pedestrian\nactivity. Where awnings are used, they should be designed to coordinate with the design of the building and\nany other awnings along the same block.\n38\n\nNEW PAGE 83\nORDINANCE NO. 2022.08.11.02\nORDINANCE AMENDING THE TEXT OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE TOWN OF BURNSVILLE,\nTHE ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE TOWN OF BURNSVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA\nWHEREAS, the Town has proposed text amendments to the Burnsville Zoning Ordinance for the\nfollowing articles:\n1.\nArticle 4 Section 401-Definitions: The following definition shall be added as section\n401.52.1 Light Industrial- The indoor manufacturing, processing, fabrication,\nassembly, treatment, and packaging of products, and incidental storage, sales and\ndistribution of such products, which does not produce noise, odors, vibration,\nhazardous waste materials, or particulate that will disturb or endanger neighboring\nproperties.\n2.\nArticle 6 Section 601-Table of Uses.
