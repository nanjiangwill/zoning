Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Neighborhood Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"NB\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Neighborhood Business\n(NB) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Neighborhood Business (NB). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Neighborhood Business (NB)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Neighborhood Business\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESS (NB) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Neighborhood Business (NB) district is intended for low intensity,\nneighborhood-serving commercial and mixed-use development around\nsignificant roadway intersections along the edges of neighborhoods. The\ndistrict allows offices, personal services, and small-scale retail and a\nvariety of institutional uses. As a means of providing additional housing\noptions, the district allows live/work dwellings and upper story\nresidential. Industrial development and higher density residential uses\nare not permitted. New commercial development is built close to the\nstreet and subject to commercial design standards to raise the bar for\ndevelopment quality. District regulations discourage uses that are too\nintense or that draw the majority of their patrons from outside the\nimmediate area.\nB.

when the\nbuilding wall abutting the lot line includes an opening (such as for a door or window), the setback shall be at least 5 feet.\n[15] Development in the AHO is subject to maximum building heights in Section 3.20.B, Airport Height Overlay (AHO) District.\nCity of Burlington\nUnified Development Ordinance\n3-38\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (1, 6): \nCELL (1, 7): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (2, 5): \nREQUIREMENT\nCELL (2, 6): \nCELL (2, 7): \nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nSTANDARD\nCELL (3, 3): \nSingle-Family\nDetached\nCELL (3, 4): \nSingle-Family\nAttached [1]\n(AMENDED 10.20.20\nUDOTA-03-20)\nCELL (3, 5): \nMulti-\nFamily\n(AMENDED\n1.4.22\nUDOTA-1-22)\nCELL (3, 6): \nMixed\nUse\nCELL (3, 7): \nNon-\nresidential\nCELL (4, 1): \nA\nCELL (4, 2): \nMaximum Residential Density (units/acre)\nCELL (4, 3): \n4.84 [2]\nCELL (4, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (4, 5): \n4.0\nCELL (4, 6): \n2\nunits/\nbldg.\nCELL (4, 7): \nN/A\nCELL (5, 1): \nB\nCELL (5, 2): \nMinimum Lot Area (square feet)\nCELL (5, 3): \n9,000 [3]\nCELL (5, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (5, 5): \n9,000\nper unit\nCELL (5, 6): \nCELL (5, 7): \nNone\nCELL (6, 1): \nC\nCELL (6, 2): \nMaximum Lot Coverage (% of lot area) [4]\nCELL (6, 3): \n35 [5]\nCELL (6, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (6, 5): \n35 [6]\nCELL (6, 6): \nCELL (6, 7): \nNone\nCELL (7, 1): \nD\nCELL (7, 2): \nMaximum Building Footprint (gross square feet)\nCELL (7, 3): \nCELL (7, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (7, 5): \nCELL (7, 6): \nCELL (7, 7): \n3,500 [7]\nCELL (8, 1): \nE\nCELL (8, 2): \nMinimum Lot Width (linear feet)\nCELL (8, 3): \n75 [8]\nCELL (8, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (8, 5): \n75 [6]\nCELL (8, 6): \nCELL (8, 7): \nNone\nCELL (9, 1): \nF\nCELL (9, 2): \nMinimum Open Space Set Aside (% of lot area)\nCELL (9, 3): \n10 [9] [10]\nCELL (9, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (9, 5): \n10 [10]\nCELL (9, 6): \n5 [10]\nCELL (9, 7): \n8\nCELL (10, 1): \nG\nCELL (10, 2): \nMinimum Street Setback (linear feet) [11] [12]\nCELL (10, 3): \n15 [13]\nCELL (10, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (10, 5): \n15\nCELL (10, 6): \nCELL (10, 7): \n15\nCELL (11, 1): \nH\nCELL (11, 2): \nMinimum Side Setback (linear feet) [12]\n(AMENDED 06.21.22 UDOTA-03-22)\nCELL (11, 3): \n5 [13]\nCELL (11, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (11, 5): \n5\nCELL (11, 6): \nNone [14]\nCELL (11, 7): \nNone [14]\nCELL (12, 1): \nI\nCELL (12, 2): \nMinimum Rear Setback (linear feet) [12]\n(AMENDED 06.21.22 UDOTA-03-22)\nCELL (12, 3): \n15 [13]\nCELL (12, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (12, 5): \n15\nCELL (12, 6): \nNone [14]\nCELL (12, 7): \nNone [14]\nCELL (13, 1): \nCELL (13, 2): \nMinimum Perimeter Setback in a Multi-building\nDevelopment (linear feet)\nCELL (13, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (13, 4): \nCELL (13, 5): \n15\nCELL (13, 6): \nSame as rear\nCELL (13, 7): \nSame as rear\nsetback\nCELL (14, 1): \nK\nCELL (14, 2): \nMinimum Spacing Between Buildings in a Multi-\nbuilding Development (linear feet)\nCELL (14, 3): \nIn accordance with the North Carolina Building Code\nCELL (14, 4): \nIn accordance with the North Carolina Building Code\nCELL (14, 5): \nIn accordance with the North Carolina Building Code\nCELL (14, 6): \nIn accordance with the North Carolina Building Code\nCELL (14, 7): \nIn accordance with the North Carolina Building Code\nCELL (15, 1): \nL\nCELL (15, 2): \nMaximum Building Height (feet/stories) [15]\nCELL (15, 3): \n36/3\nCELL (15, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (15, 5): \n36/3\nCELL (15, 6): \nCELL (15, 7): \n36/3\n\n\nNEW PAGE 161\nCHAPTER 3 ZONING DISTRICTS\nSection 3.13 Neighborhood Business (NB) District\nC.

DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Office Institutional (OI) District is established to accommodate\noffice uses, research and development facilities, corporate\nheadquarters, and multi-family residential uses in high quality single-\nbuilding and multi-building developments. The district also\naccommodates the ancillary service uses necessary to support the\npredominant office development, but is not intended as a retail\n920\ndistrict. Retail, personal service, and other commercial uses\npermitted as accessory to an office or institutional use should not\noccupy more than 10 percent of the floor area and should be\nconfigured to minimize visibility from off-site areas.
