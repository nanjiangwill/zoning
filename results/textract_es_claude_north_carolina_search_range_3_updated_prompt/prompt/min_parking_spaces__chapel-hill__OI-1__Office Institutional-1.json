Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Office Institutional-1\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"OI-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Office Institutional-1\n(OI-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Office Institutional-1 (OI-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Office Institutional-1 (OI-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Office Institutional-1\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

Once a LI-CZD is established, a property owner may submit final plans applications to the town manager for review and approval in\naccordance with the standards of this appendix and the conditions and rezoning plan attached to the conditional zoning district rezoning approval.\nb) Purpose.\nThe LI-CZD district is intended to support and encourage job-creating uses that fit Chapel Hill's character and desired brand of being a place for creative, sustainable and entrepreneurial\ncompanies to start, grow or relocate. Encouraged uses include research activities; manufacturing, light; food processing, light and flex space, and associated support functions serving both the\nneeds of the community and region. A LI-CZD may only be applied to areas designated as innovative, light industrial opportunity area on the land use plan as adopted and amended by the town\ncouncil.\nA LI-CZD is intended to be applied to areas within the Town limit so that municipal services can be provided to properties containing innovative, light industrial uses that will need the full range of\nmunicipal services such as police, fire, public works, transit, and building inspections. It is further intended to increase the town's non-residential tax base, provide a place for innovative, light industrial\nbusinesses to locate, and to promote a healthy and sustainable economy in order to provide the range of services desired by the community and necessary to maintain public health, safety, and welfare.\nc) Standards applicable to development in a LI-CZD.\n1) Intent: The standard conditions applicable to a LI-CZD are intended to foster an efficient use of land-enabling productive use of limited developable land in Chapel Hill and allowing for\nenhanced protection of environmentally-sensitive areas that may be present on a lot. Development in a LI-CZD shall be designed in a manner that provides a mix of non-residential uses which\narea integrated, interrelated, and linked by non-vehicular connections and vehicular connections consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan and its various adopted elements.\nDevelopment shall be designed in a manner to be congruent with adjacent land uses, and mitigate impacts to surrounding properties to the full extent required by this appendix.\n2) Standard conditions:\nA. The following standard conditions, contained within subdivisions (c)(3)-(c)(8), apply to development within a LI-CZD and shall be included in a conditional zoning district rezoning approval.\nB.

The town council, in approving a conditional zoning district rezoning may determine that additional and/or alternate standards are appropriate provided that the intent of the LI-CZD\nstandards have been met to an equal or greater degree.\n3) Stormwater management performance criteria.\nA. Stormwater management is required in accordance with section 5.4 \"Stormwater Management\" of this appendix except as listed below to provide additional protections to ensure that the\nimpacts of innovative, light industrial development are mitigated on surrounding properties and the community as a whole.\nB. Stormwater detention capacity: Stormwater detention/retention shall be designed to provide an additional ten (10) percent storage capacity above the volume required to meet the\nstormwater runoff rate criteria established for the 25-year 24-hour storm event in section 5.4.6(c) of this appendix.\nC.\nTotal suspended solids (TSS) removal: Notwithstanding section 5.4.6(a) of this appendix the minimum impervious area treated for eighty-five (85) percent average annual TSS removal shall\nbe fifty (50) percent of the post-construction total impervious area within the project's limits of land disturbance.\n4) Landscape buffer requirements.\nA. Landscape buffers are required in accordance with section 5.6.6 of this appendix except as listed below.\nB. Proposed development that directly abuts a railroad track, does not require a buffer on that lot line.\nC.\nProposed development that abuts a lot within the innovative, light industrial opportunity area, as shown on the land use plan does not require a buffer on that lot.\nD. Proposed development abutting a non-Interstate, arterial street, shall require a Type B buffer on that lot line.\nE. Proposed development abutting vacant land zoned MU-R-1 or MU-OI-1 shall require a Type B buffer on that lot line.\n5) Landscape protection plan.\nA.
