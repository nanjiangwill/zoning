Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Flood Damage Prevention Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"FDP-O\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: building coverage, building area as % of lot, coverage, lot coverage, max lot coverage, pervious surface. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Flood Damage Prevention Overlay\n(FDP-O) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_lot_coverage\nfor Flood Damage Prevention Overlay (FDP-O). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Flood Damage Prevention Overlay (FDP-O)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Flood Damage Prevention Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_lot_coverage extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, the max_lot_coverage refers solely to the maximum lot coverage of buildings for primary use and all accessory structures. Impervious surface coverage, such as pavement, is not included in this value. If the document specifies that impervious surface is included or simply refers to maximum lot coverage generally, which may contain other impervious surfaces, DO NOT include it.\n\nThe range for max_lot_coverage is typically between 5% and 100% (0.05 to 1). Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_lot_coverage and provide the answer as a whole number (e.g., 50% or 0.5 should be 50). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 125\nNew Bern, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(Ord.

The building area coverage shall be the dimensional standards of the applicable zoning District (i.e., R-7500, C-LD, etc.). However, the\ndeveloped area may be increased as a result of utilizing exceptional design and/or best management practices as provided in Section 6.1,\nDesign Flexibility.

The top of the lowest floor for structures within special flood hazard areas designated as\nZone A1-A30, AE, A, A99 or AO.\nRegulatory flood protection elevation. The base flood elevation plus the freeboard. In special flood hazard\nareas where base flood elevations (BFEs) have been determined, this elevation shall be the BFE plus two feet of\nfreeboard. In special flood hazard areas where no BFE has been established, this elevation shall be at least two feet\nabove the highest adjacent grade.\nRemedy a violation. To bring the structure or other development into compliance with State and community\nfloodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways\nthat impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages,\nimplementing the enforcement provisions of the FDP-O or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or\nreducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.\nRiverine.

The land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of\nbeing flooded in any given year.\nStart of construction. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued,\nprovided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other\nimprovement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of\npermanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the\nconstruction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home\non a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling;\nnor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement,\nfootings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the\nproperty of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main\nstructure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall,\nceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions\nof the building.\nStructure. A walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, or a gas, liquid, or liquefied gas storage tank\nthat is principally above-ground.\nSubstantial damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure during any one-year period whereby the\ncost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market\nvalue of the structure before the damage occurred. See definition of substantial improvement. Substantial damage\nalso means flood-related damage sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for\nwhich the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the\nmarket value of the structure before the damage occurred.\nSubstantial improvement. Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other\nimprovement of a structure, taking place during any one-year period for which the cost equals or exceeds 50\npercent of the market value of the structure before the \"start of construction\" of the improvement. This term\nincludes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
