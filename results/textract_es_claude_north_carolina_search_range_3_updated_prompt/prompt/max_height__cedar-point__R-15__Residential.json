Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-15\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential\n(R-15) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Residential (R-15). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential (R-15)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Computation of Area of Individual Signs - The area of the sign face\n(that is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one\nface) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle,\nrectangle or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme\nlimits of the writing, representation, emblem or other display\ntogether with any material or color forming an integral part of the\nbackground of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the\nbackdrop or structure against which it is placed.\nb. Computations of Area of Multi-Faced Signs - The sign area for a\nsign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together\nthe area of all sign faces visible from any one point at the same\ntime, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure\nand are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be\ncomputed by the measurement of one of the faces.\nC.\nComputation of Height - The height of a sign shall be computed as\nthe distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of\nthe highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be\nconstrued to be the lower of:\n(1) existing grade prior to construction or\n(2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of\nany filling, berming, mounding or excavating.\nIn cases where the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined,\nsign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation\nof the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation\nof the nearest point of the crown of a public street or grade of the\nland at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the\nparcel, whichever is lower. (Amended March 23, 2010)\nd. Computation of Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area for a parcel\n- The permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a parcel\nmay not be more than 200 square feet in total, except on parcels\nwith more than one principal use where the maximum permitted\nsum of all signage can be 400 square feet.\n(b)\nExterior Lighting Standards\ni. Standards:\nThe following standards are required of all exterior lighting except the\noutdoor recreational uses specifically exempted below. Many uses have\nthe option of providing a lower light post with a non-cutoff type of\nluminaire or a higher pole, up to 40 feet, with a luminaire that totally\ncuts off light spillover at a cutoff angle smaller than 90 degrees.\na. The maximum height light post permitted is dependent upon the\namount of cutoff provided. This is designed as a protection against\nexcessive glare and light spilling over to neighboring properties.\nPage 71\n\n\nNEW PAGE 72\nThe exceptions that are permitted provide adequate protection for\nhighway corridors and neighboring residential property.\nb.
