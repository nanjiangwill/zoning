Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Village Commercial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"VC\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Village Commercial\n(VC) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Village Commercial (VC). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Village Commercial (VC)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Village Commercial\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft).

Ground-level retail and personal services\nthat promote pedestrian activity along the street are highly encouraged and\nlarge, monolithic, automobile-oriented developments are prohibited. New\nVillage\ndevelopment in the district is located close to the street, provides passers-by\nwith clear views into the building's ground floor, and fosters sidewalk dining,\noutdoor seating, and interaction among pedestrians. The district requires\nurban-style open space (greens, seating areas, plazas, pocket parks, roof\nCommercial\ngardens, etc.) to be included as a part of new development. In addition to\ncommercial uses, the district allows a variety of moderate-density residential\ndevelopment. New commercial, mixed-use, and multi-family developments\nin the district are subject to the design standards in ARTICLE 151.5\nDEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.\nNOTES:\n[1] Maximum residential density may be increased to 4.35 units per acre on lots served by public sewer.\n[2] Minimum lot area per unit may be reduced to 10,000 square feet on lots served by public sewer.\nCamden County\n3-40\nLast Updated:\nUnified Development Ordinance\nAugust 1, 2022\nCELL (1, 1): \nB.\nCELL (1, 2): \nDimensional Requirements\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nREQUIREMENT\nCELL (2, 5): \nCELL (3, 1): \n#\nCELL (3, 2): \nSTANDARD TYPE\nCELL (3, 3): \nRESIDENTIAL\nDEVELOPMENT\nCELL (3, 4): \nMIXED-USE\nDEVELOPMENT\nCELL (3, 5): \nNONRESIDENTIAL\nDEVELOPMENT\nCELL (4, 1): \nA\nCELL (4, 2): \nMaximum Residential Density (units/acre)\nCELL (4, 3): \n2.17 [1]\nCELL (4, 4): \n4.35\nCELL (4, 5): \nN/A\nCELL (5, 1): \nB\nCELL (5, 2): \nMinimum Lot Area (square feet)\nCELL (5, 3): \n20,000 per unit\n[2]\nCELL (5, 4): \n40,000\nCELL (5, 5): \nCELL (6, 1): \nC\nCELL (6, 2): \nMinimum Lot Width (feet)\nCELL (6, 3): \n100 [3] [4] [5]\nCELL (6, 4): \n100 [3] [6]\nCELL (6, 5): \n100 [3] [6]\nCELL (7, 1): \nD\nCELL (7, 2): \nMaximum Lot Coverage (% of lot area) [7]\nCELL (7, 3): \n24 [8]\nCELL (7, 4): \n24\nCELL (7, 5): \nCELL (8, 1): \nE\nCELL (8, 2): \nMinimum Open Space (% of development area)\nCELL (8, 3): \nCELL (8, 4): \n15\nCELL (8, 5): \nCELL (9, 1): \nF\nCELL (9, 2): \nMinimum Front Setback (feet) [10]\nCELL (9, 3): \n10 [11]\nCELL (9, 4): \nNone\nCELL (9, 5): \nNone\nCELL (10, 1): \nG\nCELL (10, 2): \nMaximum Front Setback (feet)\nCELL (10, 3): \nNone\nCELL (10, 4): \n35\nCELL (10, 5): \n35 [9]\nCELL (11, 1): \nH\nCELL (11, 2): \nMinimum Corner Side Setback (feet) [10]\nCELL (11, 3): \n10\nCELL (11, 4): \n15\nCELL (11, 5): \n15\nCELL (12, 1): \nI\nCELL (12, 2): \nMinimum Interior Side Setback (feet) [11] [12]\nCELL (12, 3): \n10\nCELL (12, 4): \n5; 10 from residential development\nCELL (12, 5): \n5; 10 from residential development\nCELL (13, 1): \nJ\nCELL (13, 2): \nMinimum Rear Setback (feet)\nCELL (13, 3): \n10 [11]\nCELL (13, 4): \n10\nCELL (13, 5): \nCELL (14, 1): \nK\nCELL (14, 2): \nMin.

These standards may be modified by other applicable sections of this Ordinance.\n10.2.2.\nMEASUREMENTS, GENERALLY\nA.\nStraight Lines\nUnless otherwise stated in this Ordinance, distances specified in this Ordinance are to be measured as the length of\nan imaginary straight line joining two points.\nB.\nRounding\nAll calculations that result in a fractional unit or part of a whole number, the number shall be rounded up to the next\nhighest whole number, unless otherwise provided in this section or elsewhere in this Ordinance.\nC.\nIrregular Shapes\nIn cases where an irregular shape complicates the application of these standards, the UDO Administrator shall\ndetermine the applicable dimensional, setback, or bulk standards.\nD.\nSeparation\n1.\nLot to Lot\nWhen the provisions of this Ordinance require separation between two or more lots, or a lot and another\nfeature, separation shall be measured by drawing straight lines from the nearest point of one lot line to the\nnearest point of the lot line subject to the separation requirement (see Figure 10.2.2.D: Separation).\n2.\nUse Type to Use Type\nWhen the provisions of this Ordinance require one use type to be separated from another use type,\nseparation shall be measured by drawing straight lines from the nearest point of the wall of the existing or\nproposed principal structure to the nearest point of the wall of the existing or proposed structure subject to\nthe separation requirement.\nFIGURE 10.2.2.D: SEPARATION\nA\nLEGEND\nA\nLot-to-Lot Separation\nB Use Type-to-Use\nType Separation\nB\nLot Line\nCELL (1, 1): \nCamden County\nCELL (1, 2): \n10-5\nCELL (1, 3): \nLast Updated\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nFebruary 4, 2019\n\nNEW PAGE 392\nARTICLE 151.10 Definitions & Measurement\n10.2 Rules of Measurement\n10.2.3 Lot Dimensions\n10.2.3.\nLOT DIMENSIONS\nA.\nLot Measurements\n1.\nMinimum Lot Area\nThe minimum amount of required land area, measured horizontally, that must be included within the lines of\na lot (see Figure 10.2.3.A: Lot Measurement).
