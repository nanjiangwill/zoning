Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"I\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Industrial\n(I) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Industrial (I). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Industrial (I)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Industrial\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

An \"Inverted U\" or other bicycle parking rack that supports the bicycle at two (2) points\non the bicycle frame is the minimum standard for fulfillment of the bicycle parking\nstandards. A single inverted U rack will count as two (2) bicycle parking spaces. Long\nterm bicycle parking, such as bike lockers and locked rooms, may be provided for use by\nemployees and students and may count toward fulfillment of one-half (0.5) of the bicycle\nparking requirements.\n3. Bicycle racks shall be located no closer than three (3) feet from any wall.\n4. Bicycle parking shall be placed along a major building approach line and clearly visible\nfrom the approach and no more than fifty (50) feet from building entrances or no further\nthan the closest motor vehicle parking space, whichever is less.\n5. Uses with several public entrances shall locate a portion of the required bicycle parking at\neach entrance.\n6. The provided bicycle parking shall allow for bicyclists to secure their vehicle against\ntheft.\nF. Parking studies. Some uses have widely varying parking demand characteristics, making it\nimpossible to specify a single off-street parking standard. A developer proposing to develop\nor expand such a use may be required to submit a parking study clearly showing the need for\nthe number of off-street parking spaces proposed. The Zoning Code Administrator shall\nreview this study and any other traffic engineering and planning data relevant to the\nestablishment of an appropriate off-street parking standard for the proposed use. A parking\nstudy must include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute\nof Traffic Engineers (ITE) and/or other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of\nuses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be\ndetermined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study must\ndocument the source of data used to develop the recommendations. After reviewing the\nparking study, the Zoning Code Administrator shall establish the off-street parking standard\nfor the proposed use.\nG.

At the points of ingress or egress, acceleration and deceleration lanes shall be provided to\nfacilitate the continuous flow of traffic to and from the theater.\nSECTION 11.2\nOFF-SITE AND OVERFLOW PARKING\nA. All parking facilities provided on a non-contiguous lot with the principal use shall be held in\nfee simple by the owner of the use served, or in another manner that binds the parking\nfacilities to the use for which the parking facilities are accessory.\nB. Off-Site Required Parking. If the number of required parking spaces cannot be provided on\nthe same or contiguous lot with the principal use, additional spaces may be authorized by a\nspecial use permit (refer to Article 9, Section 9.4 Special Uses') for an off-site parking lot.\nApplication for such a site shall be submitted with the following information and in\naccordance with these standards:\n1. A layout drawn to scale of traffic aisles and driveways, entrances, exits and turn-off\nlanes, parking spaces, setbacks, drainage facilities, and landscaping.\n2. The type of lighting and pavement proposed.\n3. Buffering and setback requirements of the respective zoning district.\n4. Compliance with other parking requirements of this ordinance or other more restrictive\nconditions imposed by the Special Use Permit to protect residential districts and maintain\nat a minimum the disturbance to nearby residential uses.\nC. Overflow Parking. Overflow Parking Lots are allowed as long as no parking space is more\nthan five hundred (500) feet from the main entrance to the principal use. Parking spaces\nfarther than 500 feet require a special use permit (refer to Article 9, Section 9.4 Special\nUses').\nSECTION 11.3\nCOMMERCIAL PARKING\nCommercial Parking Lots are allowed by special use permit only (refer to Article 9, Section\n9.4 'Special Uses'). Application for such a site shall be submitted with the same information\nrequired in Sections 11.2.B.1-4.\nArticle 11 - Off-Street Parking And Off-Street Loading Requirements\nPage 9 of 11\nAmended 2021-6-28\n\n\nNEW PAGE 192\nSECTION 11.4\nOFF-STREET LOADING\nA. Location. All required loading spaces shall be located on the same lot and shall have the\nsame zoning as the use it serves. No off-street loading space shall be located in a required\nfront yard or within a triangular sight distance. Loading facilities shall be constructed SO that\nall maneuvering will take place entirely within the property lines of the facility. Interior off-\nstreet loading spaces may be located inside the structure it serves provided that the other\nprovisions of this Article, such as size and access, are met.\nB. Size. For uses handling goods in quantity, off-street loading spaces shall have a minimum\nwidth of twelve (12) feet and a minimum length of forty-five (45) feet, exclusive of aisles\nand maneuvering space. For uses not handling goods in quantity, off-street loading spaces\nshall have a minimum width of twelve (12) feet and a minimum length of twenty-five (25)\nfeet, exclusive of aisles and maneuvering space. In all cases loading spaces shall have a\nminimum vertical clearance of fifteen (15) feet.\nC. Surfacing. All off-street loading spaces shall be paved with concrete or asphalt material.\nD. Repair and service. No motor vehicle repair work or service of any kind shall be permitted in\nconjunction with loading facilities, except emergency repair service necessary to relocate a\nvehicle to a normal repair facility.\nE. Utilization. Off-street loading space shall not be used to satisfy the space requirements for\noff-street parking facilities or portions thereof, nor vice versa.\nF. Similar use applicable. The Zoning Code Administrator shall apply the off-street loading\nrequirements for the most similar use listed herein to an unspecified use.\nG. Access. Each off-street loading space shall be provided with unobstructed ingress and egress\nto a public or private street.\nH. Off-street loading requirements\n1. Uses handling goods in quantity. Uses which normally handle large quantities of goods\nincluding, but not limited to, industrial plants, wholesale establishments, storage\nwarehouses, freight terminals, and hospitals or sanitariums, shall provide off-street\nloading facilities in the following amounts.\nTable 11.4 Off-Street Loading Requirements For Uses Handling Goods In Quantity\nArticle 11 - Off-Street Parking And Off-Street Loading Requirements\nPage 10 of 11\nAmended 2021-6-28\nCELL (1, 1): \nGross Floor Area Of Establishment (in\nsquare feet)\nCELL (1, 2): \nRequired Number Of Loading Spaces\nCELL (2, 1): \nLess than 5,000\nCELL (2, 2): \nN/A\nCELL (3, 1): \n5,000 to 24,499\nCELL (3, 2): \n1\n\n\nNEW PAGE 193\nFor each additional one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet of gross floor area, at\nleast one (1) additional loading space shall be provided.\n2.
