Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-12\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential\n(R-12) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Residential (R-12). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential (R-12)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 74\nArticle 4 Zoning Districts\n4.5 Commercial Zoning Districts\n4.5.4.\nSpecial Standards in the R-12 Zoning District\nD.\nOpen Space\nOpen space requirements for the residential portion of a multifamily or mixed commercial-residential\nproject shall be the same and conform to the requirements for multifamily developments in the MR-\n4-12\nCELL (1, 1):\nUse\nCELL (1, 2):\nDistrict\nCELL (1, 3):\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 4):\nMinimum\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 5):\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 6):\nMinimum\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 7):\nCELL (1, 8):\nYard\n(ft.)\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (2, 1):\nCELL (2, 2):\nCELL (2, 3):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 4):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 5):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 6):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 7):\nFront\nCELL (2, 8):\nRear\nCELL (2, 9):\nSide\nCELL (3, 1):\nAll residential, except\nCELL (3, 2):\nR-12\nCELL (3, 3):\n60\nCELL (3, 4):\n60\nCELL (3, 5):\n6,000\nCELL (3, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (3, 7):\n25\u00b3\nCELL (3, 8):\n63\nCELL (3, 9):\n51,2\nCELL (4, 1):\nmultifamily\nCELL (4, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (4, 3):\n75\nCELL (4, 4):\n75\nCELL (4, 5):\n7,500\nCELL (4, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (4, 7):\n253\nCELL (4, 8):\n253\nCELL (4, 9):\n102\nCELL (5, 1):\nMultifamily/ Mixed\nCELL (5, 2):\nR-12\nCELL (5, 3):\n100\nCELL (5, 4):\n150\nCELL (5, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (5, 6):\n15,000\nCELL (5, 7):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 8):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 9):\nCELL (6, 1):\ncommercial- residential\nCELL (6, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (6, 3):\n100\nCELL (6, 4):\n100\nCELL (6, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (6, 6):\n7,000\nCELL (6, 7):\nCELL (6, 8):\nCELL (6, 9):\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"CELL (2, 5):\\nWith\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 5):\\n6,000\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (2, 6):\\nWithout\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 6):\\n10,000\" 74]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"For district R-12, the section provides the information for min_unit_size.

It is the intent of this subchapter to permit these nonconforming uses to continue until they are removed, discontinued or\ndestroyed, but not to encourage such continued use, and to prohibit the expansion of any nonconformance.\n(Ord. eff. 9-6-2012, \u00a7 8.1; Am. Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n\u00a7 91.111 INONCONFORMING USES.\nA nonconforming use is a use of land, buildings or structures that was lawfully established prior to the effective date of this Unified\nDevelopment Ordinance, or any amendment thereto, but which does not conform to the regulations for the zoning classification in which it is\nlocated. Nonconforming uses may be continued subject to the limitations noted herein. For purposes of determining whether a right to\ncontinue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section, all buildings, activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to\nbe considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building or one space in a\nnonconforming manufactured home park for 90 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as\nthe apartment building or manufactured home park as a whole is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a\nnonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter.\n(A) Expansions: no nonconforming use shall be extended, expanded, enlarged or moved to occupy a different or greater area of land,\nbuildings or structures than was occupied by such use at the time it became nonconforming; provided, however, a nonconforming use may be\nextended throughout any parts of a building which were specifically designed and arranged for such use at the time it became nonconforming.\n(B) No building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered\nunless such building or structure is thereafter devoted to a conforming use; provided, however, such building or structure may be enlarged or\nextended upon prior authorization from the Board of Adjustment, which authorization shall not be granted unless the Board of Adjustment\nmakes each of the following findings of fact.\n(1) The proposed enlargement or extension shall be minor or insignificant in relation to the existing building or structure.\n(2) The proposed enlargement or extension shall not increase the intensity of the nonconforming use, which is to say, it will not result in\nan increase in dwelling units for a residential use nor in gross floor area for a nonresidential use.\n(3) The proposed enlargement or extension is designed so that it will not render the use of the property any less compatible than it is in\nits existing circumstances.\n(4) The authorization of such proposed enlargement or extension is not otherwise contrary to the public health, safety or welfare.\n(C) (1) A nonconforming use of a structure may not be changed to another nonconforming use unless such change is authorized by the\nBoard of Adjustment. In order to authorize a change in nonconforming use, the Board of Adjustment shall consider the relative impacts of the\n\n\nNEW PAGE 65\nexisting nonconforming use and the proposed nonconforming use with regard to traffic, noise, pollution, visual appearance and compatibility\nwith the neighborhood, and shall make each of the following findings.\n(a) The proposed use is expected to result in impacts which are less than those associated with the existing use.\n(b) The proposed use will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than is the existing use.\n(c) Approval of the change in nonconforming use serves the public health, safety and general welfare.\n(d) Failure to approve the change in nonconforming use would result in a hardship to the owner of the property on which the\nnonconforming use is situated.\n(2) An existing nonconforming use shall be discontinued within 60 days of the date of approval of a change in nonconforming use.\nSubsequent to that time, such existing use shall become unlawful.\n(D) Where a nonconforming use ceases for 90 consecutive days, then the use shall not be re-established or resumed, and any subsequent\nuse of the land or structure shall conform to the requirements of this Unified Development Ordinance. Vacancy and non-use of the building or\nstructure, regardless of the intent of the owner, shall constitute discontinuance under this provision.\n(E) When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this Unified Development Ordinance is vacant or discontinued on September 6,\n2012, the 90-day period for purposes of this section begins to run on September 6, 2012.\n(F) Where a building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use is damaged to the extent of 50% or more of its current value, such\nbuilding or structure, if restored, shall thereafter be devoted to conforming uses.\n(Ord. eff. 9-6-2012, \u00a7 8.2; Am.

Except as set forth in the above, in any district in which single-family dwellings are\npermitted, any lot of record existing at the time of the adoption of these regulations that has dimensions that are less than required by these\nregulations may be used as a building site for a single-family dwelling providing the lot area and width are not less than 80% of the\nrequirements in the district. If the lot is smaller or narrower, a variance may be requested of the Board of Adjustment.\n(C) Yard requirements modified. Except as set forth in division (A) above, where a lot has width or depth less than that required in the\ndistrict in which it is located, the UDO Administrator shall be authorized to reduce the yard requirements for such lot by not more than 20%.\nAdditional or other forms of yard modification may be permitted with a variance granted by the Board of Adjustment.\n(D) Enlargement of nonconforming structures.
