Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Office and Institutional\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"OP\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Office and Institutional\n(OP) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Office and Institutional (OP). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Office and Institutional (OP)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Office and Institutional\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft).

In cases where a boundary line is located within a street or alley right-of-way, railroad or\nutility right-of-way or easement, canal, navigable or unnavigable water body, it will be\nconsidered to be in the center of the street or alley right-of-way, railroad or utility\neasement, canal or water body. If the actual location of the right-of-way, easement, canal\nor water body varies slightly from the location as shown on the map, then the actual\nlocation will control.\nB. Where a district boundary is shown to approximately coincide with a property line or city\nlimit line, the property line or city limit line will be considered to be the district\nboundary, unless otherwise indicated.\nC. In cases where a district boundary does not coincide or approximately coincide with any\nstreet or alley, railroad, water body or canal or property line, and no dimensions are\nshown, the location of the boundary will be determined by the use of the scale appearing\non the map.\n\n\nNEW PAGE 4\nZoning\n4\n\u00a7 154.007 BONA FIDE FARMS EXEMPT.\nIn accordance with NCGS 160D-903, this chapter shall in no way regulate, restrict,\nprohibit or otherwise deter any bona fide farm and its related uses, within any extraterritorial\njurisdiction established by this Town.\n\u00a7 154.008 ZONING DISTRICTS.\nFor the purposes of this chapter, the incorporated areas and extraterritorial jurisdiction of\nthe Town of Bogue as shown on the Official Zoning Map, are divided into Zoning Districts RA,\nR-20, R-15, R-15M, B-1, OI and IW.\nThe zoning districts available under the Town of Bogue Zoning Chapter shall be those set forth\nbelow:\n1.

R-15 (Residential District, 15,000 square foot minimum lot size): A residential district\nrequiring a minimum of 15,000 square feet per lot if water or sewer is available and a\nminimum of 20,000 square feet if no public services are available.\n4.

I-W (Industrial and Wholesale District): A district suited for the location of\nmanufacturing and other related uses which would be incompatible with business and\nresidential areas.\n7.\nOP (Office and Institutional District): A district established to provide office,\ninstitutional, and professional development complexes.\n\u00a7 154.009 ZONING AFFECTS EVERY BUILDING AND USE.\nNo building, structure or land may be used or occupied, and no building, structure or part\nthereof may be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, enlarged or structurally altered unless\n\nNEW PAGE 5\nZoning\n5\nin conformity with all the regulations of this chapter for the district in which it is located, except\nas otherwise provided by this chapter.\n\u00a7 154.010 ROUNDING OFF FRACTIONS.\nWhen a requirement of this chapter results in a fraction of a unit, a fraction of one-half or\nmore will be rounded off and considered a whole unit. Fractions of less than one-half will be\nrounded off to the nearest lower number of units. For example, when the determination of the\nnumber of dwelling units permitted on a lot results in a fraction of a dwelling unit, a fraction of\none-half or more will be considered a dwelling unit and a fraction of less than one-half will be\ndisregarded.\n\u00a7 154.011 LOTS DIVIDED BY ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.\nIn the event that a district boundary line on the Zoning Map divides a lot or tract of single\nownership, each part of the lot may only be used in conformity with the regulations established\nby this chapter for the district in which each part is located.

In addition it is not intended that this chapter will in any way repeal, annul or interfere\nwith any rules, regulations or zoning permits which were legally adopted or issued under\nprevious ordinances for the use or development of land or structures.\n\u00a7 154.015 ZONING BOUNDARIES OVER SURFACE WATERS.\n\nNEW PAGE 6\nZoning\n6\nSince NCGS 160D-702(a), as amended, permits a town to regulate development over\nestuarine waters and over lands covered by navigable waters owned by the state pursuant to\nNCGS 146-12, within the bounds of that town, the zoning boundaries for waterfront parcels\nshall be extended linearly 400 feet waterward of the mean high water mark. This water surface\nzoning shall not unreasonably infringe on the right to navigation protected by the federal\ngovernment or on other rights, such as shell fishing rights, allowed by state government.\n\u00a7 154.016 RULES OF CONSTRUCTION AND DEFINITIONS.\nFor the purposes of this Ordinance, certain words shall be interpreted as follows.
