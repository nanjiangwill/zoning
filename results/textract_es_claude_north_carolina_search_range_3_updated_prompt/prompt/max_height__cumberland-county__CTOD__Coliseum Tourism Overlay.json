Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Coliseum Tourism Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"CTOD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Coliseum Tourism Overlay\n(CTOD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Coliseum Tourism Overlay (CTOD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Coliseum Tourism Overlay (CTOD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Coliseum Tourism Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

A use that would cause a high concentration of people, such as: indoor\nrecreation, schools, medical facilities and the like;\nC.

Part 77). In the event, the FAA's acknowledgement\nindicates the proposed development would provide an obstruction and/or a hazard to\nair navigation, the developer must provide either written consent from the Airport\nDirector as related to the proposed development or seek a variance under the\nprovisions of this chapter.

The FAA height\nlimitations generally include the following:\n1. Approach Zone. Height limitations for Approach Zones shall be determined\nby measuring outward and upward at a 50:1 slope for Runway 4/22 and a slope of 50:1\nfor Runway 10/28. This measurement is commenced from the end of and at the same\nelevation as the end of the respective runway centerline to the prescribed horizontal\ndistance.\n2.\nTransitional Zone. Height limitations for the Transitional Zone shall be\ndetermined by measuring outward and upward at a 7:1 slope from the sides of and at\nthe same elevation as the Approach Surface and extending to the point of intersection\nwith a horizontal surface or conical surface.\n3. Conical Zone. Height limitations in the Conical Zone are established by\nmeasuring from the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above elevation\noutward and upward at a 20:1 slope to a height of 350 feet above airport elevation.\n4. Horizontal Zone. Height limitations in the Horizontal Zone are established at\n150 feet above airport elevation (190 MSL).\nE. Notice and Disclosure of Noise Impact. Any site plan, preliminary or final plat for\nproperty located within the AOD that is submitted for review and approval under the\nterms of this ordinance and/or the County Subdivision Ordinance shall contain the\nfollowing notice:\n\"Property shown on this plan/plat is within the Cumberland County\nAirport Overlay District and all or a portion of the property described\nhereon is within an area that is subject to an average noise level near to\nor exceeding 65 dnl.\"\nF. Lighting/Marking.\n1. Any allowed use, subdivision, or other development located within the AOD\nshall not have outdoor lighting or illumination arranged and/or operated in such a\nmanner as to be misleading or pose a danger to aircraft operations and in no case shall\nlighting be in contradiction to the provisions of Section 1102.M of this ordinance.\n2.

Property owners and residents of properties in which is\nencumbered by the avigation easement, recorded in Deed Book 520, page 186, at the\nCumberland County Register of Deeds, shall not restrict the access of the Fayetteville\nRegional Airport Director or the director's designee to enter said properties for\npurposes of carrying out the provisions of the easement see Appendix 1 for sketch map\nof easement location.\n(Amd. 01-19-10)\nH.

Impermissible replacement is defined as maintenance,\nconstruction or re-construction of a nonconforming structure or part thereof or\nstructure housing a nonconforming use within the district that is damaged by fire, storm\nor other causes including natural deterioration to an extent exceeding 40 percent of the\nstructure's reproducible value or its bulk (including foundations).\na. All nonconforming uses not carried on within a structure, except those\nwhich are specifically allowed as an accessory, ancillary or incidental to an allowed uses\nsubject to the provisions of this section, shall be discontinued within one calendar year\nfrom the effective date of this ordinance, regardless whether or not the nonconforming\nuse status applies to structure(s) and premises in combination with the nonconforming\noutdoor use - any subsequent use of the land and structures placed thereon shall\nconform to the provisions of this section.\nb.
