Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"WPO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay\n(WPO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay (WPO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay (WPO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft).

The district allows\na wide range of housing types, including duplexes, triplexes, quadraplexes, upper-\nstory residential, single-family attached, and single-family detached dwellings. The\ndistrict also allows pocket neighborhoods and bungalow courts. As a means of\ncreating compact, functional neighborhoods, the district also allows a wide variety\nof\ninstitutional uses, including community centers, day care, schools, assisted living,\nreligious institutions, parks, and utilities. Mixed use development is also allowed in\nlocations where negative impacts can be minimized.

WATER SUPPLY WATERSHED PROTECTION OVERLAY (WPO) DISTRICT\n1. District Established\nThe Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay (WPO) district is hereby established in accordance\nwith Section 143-214.5 of the North Carolina General Statutes and this section.\n2. Purpose and Intent\nThe purpose of the Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay (WPO) district is to ensure the\navailability of public water supplies at a safe and acceptable level of water quality. More specifically,\nthese standards are intended to:\na.\nEnsure compliance with all applicable State and federal laws governing the protection of water\nsupply watersheds;\nb. Protect those portions of designated water supply watersheds which lie closest to existing and\nproposed water supply reservoirs from activities which could degrade water quality in the\nreservoirs;\nC. Minimize pollution entering drinking water sources to assure the public health; and\nd. Encourage a low intensity of land development in the most sensitive portions of the water supply\nwatershed.\n3. Applicability\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\nExcept for development exempted in accordance with Section 3.20.F.4, Exemptions, the standards in\nthis section shall apply to all development on land located within the WPO as indicated on the Official\nZoning Map and North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality's Water Supply Watershed Map.\n4. Exemptions\nAn existing vacant lot owned by the same individual prior to the effective date of these WPO standards\nmay be developed for single-family residential purposes without complying with these standards.\n5. Effective Date\nThe standards in this section became effective on March 5, 1996.\n6. Watershed Areas Distinguished\na. The Lake Mackintosh Watershed is the only water supply watershed in the City's jurisdiction\nsubject to these standards, and it is divided into two distinct areas based on proximity to potable\nwater intake facilities that deliver water to the area. The two distinct areas are:\ni. The WS-IV-CA Watershed Critical Area (WCA); and\nii. The Balance of the Watershed (BOW).\nb. The WCA and BOW are depicted on the map entitled \"Watershed Protection Map of Burlington,\nNorth Carolina\", which is hereby adopted and incorporated by reference into these regulations.\nC. The Watershed Protection Map is on file and is available for public inspection in the offices of the\nPlanning Department during normal working hours.\nd. The WCA is closer to the water intake facility, and as such has more restrictive standards on\ndevelopment density and configuration.\n7. Procedures for Development\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\na. Any development proposed inside the WPO shall require a Water Supply Watershed Protection\nPermit as described in Section 2.4.Z, Water Supply Watershed Protection Permit.\nb. No building or built-upon area shall be erected, moved, enlarged, or structurally altered, nor shall\nany building permit be issued nor shall any change in the use of any building or land be made\nuntil a watershed protection permit has been issued by the Stormwater Administrator.\nC.\nApplicants for development inside the WPO may request to reduce or deviate from the standards\ndescribed in Section 3.20.F, Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay (WPO) District, by\nfollowing the procedure described in Section 2.4.AA, Water-Related Variance.\n8. Principal Use Provisions\nAll land within the WPO shall comply with the following allowable and prohibited use requirements.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \n3-85\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\n\nNEW PAGE 208\nCHAPTER 3 ZONING DISTRICTS\nSection 3.20 Overlay Districts\na.
