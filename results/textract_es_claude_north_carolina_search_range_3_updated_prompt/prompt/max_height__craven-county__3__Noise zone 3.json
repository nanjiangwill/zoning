Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Noise zone 3\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"3\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Noise zone 3\n(3) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Noise zone 3 (3). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Noise zone 3 (3)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Noise zone 3\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this division, no structure may be built within any zoned area established by this\ndivision which in any way endangers or interferes with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.\nIn the interest of aviation and public safety, the Coastal Carolina Regional Airport Authority will ensure that all aircraft operating\nwithin the zonal areas of this division comply with the Federal Aviation Administration requirements for normal flight activity in the\n33 of 47\n4/22/24, 19:19\n\n\nNEW PAGE 34\nCraven County, NC Code of Ordinances\nimmediate vicinity of the airport.\n(2) Airport height restriction zones map attached. In order to carry out the provisions of this division, there are hereby created and\nestablished certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal\nsurfaces, and conical surfaces as they apply to Coastal Carolina Regional Airport. Such zones are shown on the Craven County\nZoning and Height Control Map consisting of one sheet, prepared by Holland Consulting Planners, Inc., and dated July 1, 2006,\nwhich is by reference made a part of this division. A lot located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in\nthe zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various height restriction zones are hereby established and defined as\nfollows:\n(a)\nUtility runway non-precision instrument approach zone (runway) 13 and runway 31). The inner edge of this approach zone\ncoincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width\nof 2,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline\nof the runway.\n(b) Non-precision instrument approach zone (runway 22). The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the\nprimary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal\ndistance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.\n(c) Precision instrument runway approach zone (runway 4). The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the\nprimary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a horizontal\ndistance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.\n(d) Transitional zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces.\n(e) Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet radii for all runways designated utility or\nvisual and 10,000 feet for all others from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the\nadjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.\n(f) Conical zone. The conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends\noutward from the horizontal zone at a slope of 20 to one for a distance of 4,000 feet.\n(3) Airport height zone restrictions. Except as otherwise provided in this division, no structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained\nin\nany zone created by this division, to a height in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for such zone. Such\n34 of 47\n4/22/24, 19:19\n\n\nNEW PAGE 35\nCraven County, NC Code of Ordinances\napplicable height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows:\n(a) Utility runway visual approach zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same\nelevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.\n(b) Non-precision instrument approach zone. Slopes 34 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the\nsame elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway\ncenterline.\n(c) Precision instrument runway approach zone. Slopes 50 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the\nsame elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway\ncenterline; thence slopes outward 40 feet horizontally for each foot vertically to an additional horizontal distance of 40,000 feet\nalong the extended runway centerline.\n(d) Transitional zone. Slopes seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the\nprimary surface and the approach surface and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation, which is 19.0 feet\nabove mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot\nupward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface and extending to where they intersect the\nconical surface. Where the precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are established\nheight limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the\napproach surface and extending a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90-degree angles to the extended runway\ncenterline.\n(e) Horizontal zone. Established at 150 feet above the airport elevation or at a height of 169.0 feet above mean sea level.\n(f) Conical zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet\nabove the airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation, 369.0 feet above mean sea level.\n(g) Excepted height limitations. Nothing in this division shall be construed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any\nstructure to a height up to 50 feet above the surface of the land. This exception would only apply to construction or\nmaintenance of structures outside of the approach surface.\n(4) Airport zoning and height control zones. In order to carry out the provisions of this division, there are hereby created and\nestablished certain zones for the purpose of regulating zoning to prohibit uses which may be hazardous to the safe operation of\n35 of 47\n4/22/24, 19:19\n\nNEW PAGE 36\nCraven County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\naircraft. Such zones are shown on the Craven County Zoning and Height Control Map consisting of one sheet, prepared by Holland\nConsulting Planners, Inc., and The LPA Group of North Carolina, P.A., and dated July 1, 2006, which is by reference made a part of\nthis division. A lot located in more than one zoning and height control zone is considered to be only in the zone with the more\nrestrictive limitation; the airport zone is more restrictive than the airport development - mixed-use zone. The various zoning and\nheight control zones are hereby established and defined as follows:\n(a) Airport zone. This zone is intended to be applied to properties which lie within the runway protection zones (RPZ), building\nrestriction line, and all property owned by the airport. The zone is intended to regulate the development of land uses which are\nincompatible with safe airport operation.\n(b)\nAirport development-Mixed-use zone. This zone allows the development of mixed land uses which will not be hazardous or in\nany way detrimental to safe airport operation. The purpose of the zone is to protect the safety and welfare of the airport and\nthe residents of Craven County.\n(5) Airport zoning and height control zone restrictions. Airport and airport development-mixed use zones shall allow permitted uses as\ndefined by this section. All uses not specifically allowed as permitted uses are prohibited unless allowed as a special use as\nspecified in subsection (a)(2) of this subsection.\n(a) Airport zone.\n1. Airport zone permitted uses. The following uses are permitted by right unless the use would violate the height limitations\nas defined in subsection (4):\na. All agricultural uses including the commercial raising of animals or fowl which would not adversely affect safe airport\noperations.\nb. Landscape nursery, cemetery, and low intensity or open recreation areas, which do not include buildings or structures.\nC. Roadways, parking areas, and storage yards when located in such a manner that vehicle lights will not make it difficult\nfor pilots to distinguish between landing lights and vehicle lights, result in glare, or in any other way impair visibility in\nthe vicinity of the landing approach.\nd. Game preserve or reservation.\ne. Pipeline.\nf.\n36 of 47\n4/22/24, 19:19\n\n\n Output:"}]}
