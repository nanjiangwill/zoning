Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Office Institutional-4\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"OI-4\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Office Institutional-4\n(OI-4) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Office Institutional-4 (OI-4). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Office Institutional-4 (OI-4)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Office Institutional-4\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

No. 2020-10-28/0-10, \u00a7 8)\n3.5.2 Office/Institutional-4\n(a) Purpose and intent.\nThe purpose and intent of the office/institutional-4 district (OI-4) is to establish procedural and substantive standards for the town council's review and approval of development on large tracts of land\nwhere the predominant use is to be college, university, hospital, clinics, public cultural facilities, and related functions.\nThe objective of this section and the OI-4 district is to allow for growth and development while protecting the larger community, nearby neighborhoods, and the environment from impacts accompanying\nmajor new development. A key feature of this district is the preparation of a development plan that would allow the property owner, immediate neighbors, and the larger community to understand\nspecifically what levels of development are being proposed, and what impacts would likely accompany the development, so that mitigation measures can be designed and implemented.\n(b) Overview of Development Review Procedures.\nProcedures in this zoning district are designed to facilitate:\nArticulation of development plans that involve multiple buildings in multiple locations over an extended time period on a given tract of land, as defined in a development plan;\nIdentification of total infrastructure needs for such proposed development as specified in a development plan and cumulative impacts resulting from full development as specified in a\n10 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 11\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\ndevelopment plan; and\nProvision of measures to mitigate the negative impacts, including off-site construction of parking decks as described in subsection (d)(2), phased in a manner appropriate with the pace of\nconstruction.\nTo this end, owners of property zoned OI-4 are encouraged to prepare detailed development plans, as described below, for review and approval by the town council. For buildings that are included in an\napproved development plan, site development permits for individual buildings are to be issued by the town manager, following a determination by the town manager that such individual building plans are\ngenerally consistent with the town council-approved development plan.\nFor development proposed within an OI-4 zoning district that is not included in a town council-approved development plan, but is a minor modification according to the provisions of subsection (j) of this\nsection, the town manager may approve a change to the development plan and issue a site development permit. For development proposed within an OI-4 zoning district that is not included in a town\ncouncil-approved development plan and that cannot be considered a minor modification to the plan according to subsection (j) of this section, such development shall be considered to be a special use, and\nsubject to the special use permit procedural requirements of section 4.5 of this appendix. In the alternative, the applicant may apply to the town council for an amendment to the development plan.\nOnce a property is zoned office/institutional-4, all regulations, standards, and procedures prescribed for the previously-applicable zoning district shall apply until (1) a development plan is approved; or\n(2) six (6) months have elapsed, whichever comes first.\n(c) Concept plan review. Prior to submittal of a development plan or modification of development plan, a concept plan review shall be conducted by the Town Council. It is the intent of the\nconceptual development plan process to provide an opportunity for the Town Council, Town Manager and citizens to review and evaluate the impact of the proposed development on the\ncharacter of the area in which it is proposed to be located.\n(1) Submittal requirements. Applications for conceptual development plan review shall be filed with the Town Manager. The Town Manager shall prescribe the form(s) on which information shall\nbe submitted. Application submittal requirements shall include the following:\nA. Descriptions of proposed development with building locations, building sizes, parking arrangements, and description of building heights with consideration of impact on adjacent areas.\n(d) Development Plan.\nA development plan shall address issues such as general location and size of new facilities, parking, utilities, stormwater management, impervious surface, and access/circulation. A development plan\nshall identify the general location, size, and proposed uses of buildings. A development plan shall project anticipated impacts on streets, water and sewer facilities, stormwater runoff, air quality, noise, and\nlighting.\n(1) Submittal requirements. Application submittal requirements shall include the following:\nA. Specific descriptions of proposed development with building locations, building sizes, parking arrangements, and description of building heights with consideration of impact on adjacent\nareas.\nB. Analysis of impacts resulting from proposed development, along with options to mitigate impacts relating to:\nTransportation management (traffic, transit, parking, bikes, pedestrians, air quality);\nStormwater management analysis (quantity and quality); and\nNoise and lighting analysis.\nIndividual effects must be evaluated in the context of the whole development plan and not in isolation. Impacts shall be evaluated in accordance with guidelines endorsed for use by the town\ncouncil.\nC. Preliminary timetable and sequencing schedule for building construction and for related mitigation measures.\n(2) Off-site components. Mitigation measures involving construction of parking decks may need to be developed outside the boundaries of the development plan. Notwithstanding any other\nprovision of this Land Use Management Ordinance, a parking deck proposed to mitigate impacts of a development plan, and approved by the town council as part of a development plan, may\nbe located on a site not within the boundaries of an OI-4 zoning district. Any such facility shall be reviewed as a site development permit according to the provisions of subsection (i)(2) of this\nsection.\n(e) Permitted uses and development intensities.\nPermitted uses shall be identical with uses listed in the use matrix (section 3.7) as being permitted in OI-3, except that place of assembly shall be considered to be a permitted use and not a special use.\nThe maximum floor area allowed shall be as provided in a development plan that is approved by the town council. Special restrictions apply in perimeter transition areas (see subsection (g)).\nFor purposes of calculating compliance with a specified maximum floor area, the following land uses shall not be counted as floor area: new residential development (including Dwellings and residence\nhalls), and new public cultural facilities.\n(f) Standards.\nDevelopment in the OI-4 zoning district shall be designed in a manner that provides a mix of uses which are integrated, interrelated and linked by pedestrian ways, bikeways, and other transportation\nsystems. Development plans shall, as practical and consistent with applicable laws and regulations, include measures to encourage reduction of automobile use and promote alternative modes of\ntransportation; to mitigate adverse environmental impacts; to promote conservation of non-renewable energy resources; and to achieve visual continuity in the siting and scale of buildings. Specifically, a\ndevelopment plan shall address the following:\n(1) Noise: Noise levels from development proposed in the development plan shall not exceed those allowed by the Town of Chapel Hill Noise Ordinance.\n(2) Environment: Development proposed in the development plan shall minimize impacts on natural site features, and be accompanied by measures to mitigate those impacts.\n(3) Transportation: Development proposed in the development plan shall be accompanied by measures to mitigate transportation impacts that are caused by the development.\n(4) Stormwater management: Development proposed in the development plan shall be accompanied by measures to mitigate stormwater impacts (quantity and quality) that are caused by the\ndevelopment.\n(5) Public utilities: There shall be a general demonstration that water, sewer, and other needed utilities can be made available to accommodate development proposed in the development plan.\n(6) Historic districts: The provisions of section 3.6.2 of this appendix shall apply to any development proposed within one of Chapel Hill's Historic Districts.\n(g) Perimeter transition areas.\nA development plan shall designate a perimeter transition area establishing appropriate standards at borders of the development plan, necessary to minimize impacts of development proposed in\nthe development plan on adjacent property, to be approved by the town council as part of the development plan. Standards shall address:\n(1) Screening mechanical equipment,\n(2) Exterior lighting,\n(3) Height limits,\n(4) Landscaping.\n(h) Procedures for approval of development plans.\n11 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\n\nNEW PAGE 12\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nApplications for a development plan, special use permit, or site development permit shall be filed with the town manager.\n(1) Application submittal requirements. The town manager shall prescribe the form(s) of applications as well as any other material he/she may reasonably require to determine compliance with\nthis section. Applications shall include information described in subsection (d)(1).\n(2) Process for review.\nA.\nApplications for development plan approval may be reviewed by the planning commission, and the planning commission may conduct a preliminary forum to review the application and\nthe town manager's report and to provide comments to the applicant.\nB. Applications for development plan approval will be considered at an evidentiary hearing. Relevant evidentiary procedures for such hearings are as set forth in NCGS 160D-406. Notice of\nthe date, time, and place of the Town Council evidentiary hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the planning jurisdiction once a week for two (2) successive\nweeks, with the first notice to be published not less than ten (10) nor more than twenty-five (25) days prior to the date of the hearing.\nC.\nPresentation of Evidence. The applicant, the town council, and any person who would have standing to appeal the decision under NCGS 160D-1402(c) shall have the right to participate as\na party at the evidentiary hearing.

The mayor shall rule on any objections,\nand the mayor's rulings may be appealed to the full town council. These rulings are also subject to judicial review pursuant to NCGS 160D-1402. Objections based on jurisdictional issues\nmay be raised for the first time on judicial review.\nD. The applicant shall bear the burden of presenting evidence sufficient to establish persuasively that the proposed development will comply with the determinations required in subsection\n(h)(3).\nE. A record of the proceedings of the hearing shall be made and shall include all documentary evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing. Town council action on an application for\ndevelopment plan approval shall occur within one hundred twenty (120) days of the date of submittal of a complete application.\n(3) Town council action.\nA. The town council shall approve a development plan unless it finds that the proposed development would not:\nMaintain the public health, safety, and general welfare; or\nMaintain the value of adjacent property; or\nComply with all required regulations and standards of this chapter, including all applicable provisions of article 2 and with all other applicable regulations; or\nConform with the general plans for the physical development of the Town as embodied in this chapter and in the comprehensive plan.\nB. Town council action shall be to:\nApprove;\nApprove with conditions; or\nDeny.\n(i) Actions after decision on development plan.\n(1) Recording approval. If the application for approval of a development plan is approved or approved with conditions, the town manager shall issue the approval in accord with the action of the\ntown council. The applicant shall record such approval in the office of the county register of deeds. The development plan, including all conditions attached thereto, shall run with the land and\nshall be binding on the original applicant as well as all successors, assigns, and heirs.\n(2) Individual site development permits. If the development plan is approved, or approved with conditions, the town manager may then accept applications for individual site development\npermits for specific buildings that are described in the development plan. No work on a building identified on the development plan may begin until a site development permit has been\nissued. The town manager shall prescribe the form(s) of applications as well as any other material he/she may reasonably require to determine compliance with the development plan. Any\napplication for a site development permit in a perimeter transition area shall include provisions for mailed notification to property owners within one thousand (1,000) feet of the proposed\ndevelopment. If the town manager finds that the application is consistent with the development plan, he/she shall approve the application and issue the site development permit within fifteen\n(15) working days of the submittal of a complete application. If the town manager finds that the application is not consistent with the development plan he/she shall deny the application\nwithin fifteen (15) working days of the acceptance of the application and refer the applicant to the special use permit process described in section 4.5 of this appendix. Alternatively, the\napplicant may apply for an amendment to the development plan.\n(3) Expiration, abandonment, revocation of development plan. If an application for a site development permit pursuant to an approved development plan has not been submitted to the town\nmanager within two (2) years of the date of approval of the development plan, the approval shall automatically expire. On request by the holder of an approved development plan, the town\ncouncil shall approve the abandonment of the plan if it determines that no subsequent development approvals have been granted and no construction activity has taken place pursuant to the\ndevelopment plan. If material conditions of a development plan are violated, and remain in violation after giving the property owner a reasonable amount of time to correct such violation, the\ntown council may revoke the plan after notification to the property owner and opportunity for property owner response at a public meeting of the town council.\n(j) Process for amending the development plan.\nThe town manager is authorized to approve minor modifications and changes in the ordering of phases in an approved development plan, as long as such changes continue to be in compliance with the\napproving action of the town council and all other applicable requirements, and result in a configuration of buildings that is generally consistent with the approved development plan. The town manager\nshall not have the authority to approve changes that constitute a major modification of the development plan.\nBefore making a determination as to whether a proposed action is a minor or major modification, the town manager shall review the record of the proceedings on the original application for the\ndevelopment plan and any subsequent applications for modifications of the development plan, and shall use the following criteria in making a determination:\n(1) A change in the boundaries of the development plan approved by the town council shall constitute a major modification;\n(2) A substantial change in the floor area or number of parking spaces approved by the town council shall constitute a major modification. (General rule: more than a 5% increase in overall net\nnew floor area or parking in a development plan approved by the town council would be considered substantial.);\n(3)\nSubstantial changes in pedestrian or vehicular access or circulation approved by the town council shall constitute a major modification. (General rule: changes that would affect access or\ncirculation beyond the boundaries of a development plan would be considered substantial.); and\n(4) Substantial change in the amount or location of open areas approved by the town council shall constitute a major modification.\nIf the proposed action is determined to be a major modification, the town manager shall require the filing of an application for approval of the major modification, following procedures outlined in this\nsection for initial approval of a development plan.\n(Ord.

Dimensional standards.\nPurpose statement: It is the intent of this article to provide for performance standards which serve to define the development character of an area, and to ensure the compatibility of development both\nwith the environmental characteristics, accessibility levels, and special amenities offered by the development site and with surrounding land uses and development intensities. It is further intended that the\nestablishment of intensity regulations reflect the protection of critical environmental areas and the suitability of land for a particular level of development intensity, in accord with the goals and objectives of\nthe comprehensive plan.\nThe setback and height regulations established in the dimensional matrix are intended to ensure adequate solar access, privacy, and ventilation; access to and around buildings, off-street parking areas,\nloading space, and service areas; space for landscaping; and spacing between buildings and portions of buildings to reduce potential adverse effects of noise, odor, glare, or fire. Adequate solar access is\ndeemed to consist of varying levels of access ranging from rooftop solar access in high-intensity zoning districts to south wall solar access in low-intensity zoning districts.\n3.8.1 Establishment and General Applicability of Dimensional Regulations.\nExcept as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, regulations governing the dimensions of lots and buildings are hereby established as described in section 3.8.2 and shown in Table 3.8-1.\n(a) No land or structure shall be used or occupied, and no structure, or part thereof, shall be constructed, erected, altered, or moved except in compliance with the dimensional regulations herein\nspecified for each zoning district.\n(b)\nNo portion of land used in connection with an existing or proposed structure or use of land and necessary for compliance with the dimensional regulations of this article shall also be used,\nthrough sale or otherwise, as part of the land required in connection with any other development.\n(c) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, dimensional regulations applicable to OI-3 and OI-4 zoning districts and planned development zoning lots shall be applied to the district or lot as a\nwhole and not to individual parts thereof.\n3.8.2 Dimensional Regulations.\nAbout the Building Envelope. Sections (f)-(j) define the three-dimensional building envelope. All structures, or portions thereof, must be placed within the building envelope and may not encroach the\nbuilding envelope unless specifically exempted by this Appendix.\nDivisions (f) and (g) regulate the setback height and core height, respectively, which together define the vertical extent of the building envelope.\nDivisions (h)-(j) regulate the street, interior, and north setback lines, respectively, which together define the perimeter setback line and horizontal extent of the building envelope.\nDefinitions. Refer to Appendix A for definitions of applicable terms.\n(a) Zoning District. Column (A) refers to the applicable Zoning District. The requirements set forth in sections (b)-(i) below, relate to the zoning district specified in the row under Column (A),\n(b) Minimum Lot Size. Column (B) is expressed in square feet of gross land area.\nNotes:\n(1) Where a zoning lot is located in more than one zoning district, the minimum gross land area required of such zoning lot shall be the sum of the areas derived by multiplying the minimum\ngross land area required for each represented district by the proportion of the zoning lot located within that district.\n(2) For all uses that consist of three (3) or more dwelling units, the minimum lot size is two (2) times the figure shown in Column (B).\n(c) Minimum Frontage. Column (C) is the minimum width of the lot measured along the street.\nNotes:\n(1) Where a zoning lot fronts on two (2) or more streets, minimum street frontage width requirements shall be considered met if the frontage along any one of such streets meets the minimum\nstreet frontage width requirements.\n(2) Where a zoning lot fronts on a turning circle of a cul-de-sac or at a point of a street where the radius of the curvature of the right-of-way is less than ninety (90) feet, the minimum street\nfrontage width requirement shall be thirty-five (35) feet.\n(d) Minimum Lot Width. Column (D) is the minimum width of the lot, expressed in feet, measured at least twenty-five (25) feet interior from the minimum street setback. No portion of a lot, created\nas part of a subdivision, between a street setback and the opposite interior (rear) setback, shall be less than twenty (20) feet in width.\nException:\n(1) Authorized flag lots, created as part of a subdivision and subject to the lot layout standards in section 5.2, may contain areas between a street setback and the opposite interior (rear) setback\nthat are less than twenty (20) feet in width. Authorized flag lots shall reach the minimum lot width at a point not to exceed two hundred (200) feet from the street right-of-way.\nNotes:\n(2) Where a zoning lot fronts on two (2) or more streets, minimum lot width requirements shall be considered met if the lot width at the street setback from any one of such streets meets the\nminimum lot width requirement.\n(3)\nWhere a zoning lot fronts on a turning circle of a cul-de-sac or at a point of a street where the radius of the curvature of the right-of-way is less than ninety (90) feet, the minimum lot width\nshall be reached at a distance derived by the following formula: D = 50 (W)(35) 50, where W = minimum required lot width, and D = maximum distance from street right-of-way to where the\nlot width equals the minimum required width for that district.\n(e) Maximum Setback Height: Column (E) is the maximum allowable height at the perimeter setback line of a zoning lot, as defined by the minimum street, interior, and solar setbacks.\n(1)\nHeight shall be measured from mean finished grade, along the street fa\u00e7ade of the building. Where a structure fronts more than one (1) street, height shall be measured from the lower, more\nrestrictive mean finished grade.\n(2)\n42 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\n\nNEW PAGE 43\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nTo determine mean finished grade, take the spot elevations from the highest and lowest points of the foundation. The average of these two (2) spots elevations is the mean finished grade and the elevation\nfrom which height measurements are made.\n(3) The entire structure, and all portions thereof, is subject to the maximum setback height.\nExceptions:\nA. The structure or part thereof is below the allowable core height, as described in division (g) below.\nB. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted in section 3.8.3 Exceptions to Setback and Height Requirements, below.\nC. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted as provided elsewhere in this Appendix.\n(4) For purposes of applying setback and height regulations to development within an OI-3 or OI-4 zoning district or within a townhouse development or a planned development, all contiguous\nland within the district, townhouse development, or planned development shall be considered as a single zoning lot.\n(f) Maximum Core Height: Column (F) is the maximum allowable height in the interior or core area of a lot. The core height provides additional allowable height on the interior of a zoning lot based\non the horizontal distance measured away from the perimeter setback line of the lot. The allowable core height increases with the distance interior to the lot, measured from the perimeter\nsetback line at a rate described below.\n(1) In all Zoning Districts, except those explicitly named in subdivision (2), the allowable core height increases at a rate of one (1) foot in height for every two (2) feet of distance interior to the lot,\nmeasured away from the perimeter setbacks. This is equivalent to a slope of 1/2 (rise/run) or 1:2.\n(2) In the Town Center 1 to 3, Office/Institutional 3 to 4 zoning districts the allowable core height increases at the following rates:\nA. Street and interior setbacks: one (1) feet in height for every one (1) feet of distance interior to the lot, measured away from the street and interior setbacks. This is equivalent to a slope of\n1/1 (rise/run) or 1:1.\nB. Solar setbacks: one (1) feet in height for every one (1) foot and seven-tenths of a foot (1.7 feet) of distance interior to the lot, measured away from the street and interior setbacks. This is\nequivalent to a slope of 1/1.7 (rise/run) or 1:1.7.\n(3) No structure, or part thereof, shall project beyond the allowable core height of a structure or part thereof.\nExceptions:\nA. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted in section 3.8.3 Exceptions to Setback and Height Requirements, below.\nB. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted as provided elsewhere in this Appendix.\n(4) If a structure is located in the vicinity of an airport, the height limitations set forth in Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 77, or successor regulations, shall apply where such limitations are\nstricter than those established in this appendix.\n(g) Minimum Street Setback. Column (G) establishes a minimum setback from the street right-of-way line. Where a zoning lot fronts on a street with a right-of-way width not meeting the standards of\nthis appendix, street setback shall be measured from a line running parallel to the centerline of the street at a distance from such centerline equal to one-half (1/2) the standard right-of-way width\nof the street.\nException:\n(1) The town manager or town council may exempt lots from this requirement upon making one (1) of the following findings:\nA. Where a building line has already been established by existing structures along the block which are situated on lots comprising at least twenty-five (25) percent of the street frontage, the\nbuilding may be constructed at the established building line; or\nB. The existing right-of-way is adequate to encompass any anticipated need for widening of the street or other improvements and widening of the right-of-way to town standards would\ncreate nonconforming street setbacks for other structures on the street.\n(h) Minimum Interior Setback. Column (H) establishes a minimum setback measured from the interior lot lines.\nException:\n(1) The interior setback requirements may be reduced to zero (0) under certain conditions (see section 5.2.8.).\nNote:\n(2) Side setbacks are set at zero (0) in many non-residential districts in order to encourage the formation of a street wall, as is found in traditional commercial centers such as the TC district along\nFranklin Street.\n(i) Minimum Solar Setback. Column (I) establishes a minimum setback measured from north lot lines. Where a solar setback and either a street or interior setback both apply to the same portion of a\nlot line, the required minimum setback shall be the greater of the two (2).\nExceptions:\n(1) The solar setback may be reduced to zero (0) under certain conditions (see section 5.2.8).\n(2) Minimum solar setback requirements shall not apply to any structure, or part thereof, when the proposed height of the structure is ninety (90) percent, or less, of the maximum allowed\nsetback height. In such cases, the lesser interior setback may be used instead.\n(j)\nMaximum Impervious Surface Ratio. Column (J) establishes the maximum ratio of impervious surface on a lot. The maximum amount of impervious surface area is divided by multiplying the gross\nland area of the lot by the ratio established in Column (K) and as described below:\n(1) Single-family and two-family residential development: (.50)\n(2) Multifamily developments, fraternities and sororities, non-residential, or mixed-use development: (.70).\nException:\n(3) Impervious surface restrictions shall not apply to town center zoning districts.\n(k) Maximum Floor Area Ratio. Maximum floor area allowed shall be the number of square feet derived by multiplying gross land area by the applicable floor area ratio (FAR) as shown in Table 3.8.1.\nExceptions:\n(1) A maximum floor area ratio shall not apply to:\nA. Dwelling Units, Single-Family\nB. Dwelling Units, Single-Family with Accessory Apartment\nC. Dwelling Units, Single-Family with Cottage\nD. Public Cultural Facilities\n(2) For two-family dwellings on a single zoning lot, the floor area shall be .40 in all zones and overlay zones, except where the overlay zone establishes a more restrictive floor area ratio for\nduplexes.\n(3)\nFor public elementary and secondary schools, the maximum floor area ratio shall be 0.174 unless a higher floor area ratio is established in Column (L).\n43 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\n\nNEW PAGE 44\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(4) Where a lot is partially within the resource conservation district, the maximum allowable floor area of the portion of the lot outside of the resource conservation district shall be calculated\nthe sum of:\nas\nA. The product of, and\n(i) The floor area ratio of the portion of the zoning lot outside the resource conservation district, and\n(ii) The area, in square feet, of the portion of the zoning lot outside the resource conservation district.\nB. The product of\n(i) The floor area ratio applicable to a permitted use in the resource conservation district, and\n(ii) The area, in square feet, of the portion of the zoning lot within the resource conservation district.\n( Ord.
