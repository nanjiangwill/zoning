Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Manufactured Homes\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MH\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Manufactured Homes\n(MH) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Manufactured Homes (MH). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Manufactured Homes (MH)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Manufactured Homes\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

The\nCZC for the use of any building, structure, or property where off-street parking or loading\nspace is required should be withheld by the Zoning Code Administrator until provisions of\nthis Article are fully met. If at any time such compliance ceases, any CZC which shall have\nbeen issued for the use of the property shall immediately become void and of no effect.\nFlex Space: In order to reduce the burden on property owners regarding the required Parking\nPlan as described in this article, the Zoning Code Administrator may consider non-residential\nproperties (or a collection of non-residential properties) that function as a whole with\nmultiple uses to qualify as a Flex Space property. Flex Space properties are designated\nsolely for the purpose of this provision. The acceptance of a property or multiple properties\nbeing classified as Flex Space will be at the discretion of the Zoning Code Administrator.\nProperties that qualify as Flex Space shall provide one (1) space for every 150 square feet of\ngross floor area, or the property owner may submit a Parking Plan (with the required CZC\napplication) that indicates the amount of square footage for each use listed in the Off-Street\nParking Schedule and provide at least the minimum number of parking spaces that\ncorresponds to those uses. Property owners or developers seeking to classify their property\nas Flex Space shall submit a request to the Zoning Code Administrator in the form of a letter\nthat indicates the proposed amount of square footage for each use listed in the Off-Street\nParking Schedule in order to approve that the proposed uses are indeed a mix of the uses\nlisted in the Off-Street Parking Schedule. The Flex Space property must be built in\naccordance with the Parking Plan, but future changes of use will not be required to submit a\nrevised Parking Plan with the required CZC application for the change of use; however,\napproval of the CZC application for the change of use will be at the discretion of the Zoning\nCode Administrator and depends on whether the change of use has the potential to create a\nparking space deficiency by significantly altering the original Flex Space plan.\nN. Vehicle movement. All off-street parking areas shall be arranged SO that ingress and egress\nis by the forward motion of the vehicle, with the exception of residential lots or units located\nin an R-10, R-15, MF, or MH zone where individual driveways are provided for each lot or\nunit.\nSection 11.1.2 Off-Street Parking Schedule\nA.
