Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Planned Development\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"PD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Planned Development\n(PD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Planned Development (PD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Planned Development (PD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Planned Development\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft).

Modifications to an existing Planned Development (Section 3.3.3.B.15); or\n3. An existing Major Subdivision (Section 3.4.12), except in situations where the Planning Director is authorized to approve the modification\nadministratively.\nCommentary: Examples of situations where a neighborhood meeting is required include a change in land use from open space to single-\nfamily or single-family to multi-family.\nC. The purpose of the neighborhood meeting is to inform the neighborhood of the nature of the proposed land use and development features,\nexplain the plan (if applicable), and receive comments. Comments from the neighborhood are not binding on the applicant. However, the\napplicant may elect to revise elements of the project to incorporate suggestions.\nD. When a neighborhood meeting is required, a neighborhood meeting verification form shall be obtained from the Planning and Community\nDevelopment Department prior to holding said meeting.\n(Ord.

Maximum Parking Permitted\n1. No use shall provide more than 150% of the required parking shown in the table above unless any parking above the 150% threshold is\npervious or is provided through use of structured parking.\n2. Where a project is intended to be developed in phases, the Planning Director may approve development of a parking area intended to serve\ncurrent and future development.\nC. Modifications\nThe Planning Board may reduce the required number of spaces by up to 20% if for reasons of topography, mixes of uses, ride sharing programs,\navailability of transit, or other conditions specific to the site, provided the reduction in the required number of parking spaces satisfies the intent\nof this Section.\n(Ord. No. UDO-16-02, \u00a7 29, 3-7-16; Ord. No. UDO-18-02, \u00a7 2, 3-19-18)\n6.12.7. Alternative Parking Plans\nA. General\nInnovative approaches which reduce the amount of impervious cover within Brunswick County are encouraged when the public interest is\nserved and protected. The Planning Director or Planning Board, as specified, may reduce the minimum amount of off-street parking required\n(beyond that permitted by Sec. 6.12.6.C, Modifications) where developer-submitted parking data, prepared and sealed by a registered engineer\nwith transportation expertise, illustrates that the standards of this section do not accurately apply to the specific development. The data\nsubmitted for an alternative parking plan shall include, at a minimum, the size and type of the proposed development, the mix of uses, the\nanticipated rate of parking turnover and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads of all uses. The following factors may also be considered.\nB. Factors Considered in Alternative Parking Plans\n1. Public Parking\nUp to 35% of the required off-street parking spaces may be waived by the Planning Director if publicly-controlled-parking is located within a\n500 foot walking distance along public walkways from the main entrance of the proposed use and the Planning Director also determines that\nadequate parking spaces are available within the publicly-controlled parking area to accommodate the anticipated use. Reductions below\n35% of the required off-street parking spaces may be approved by the Planning Board.\n2. Off-Site and Cooperative Parking\ni. Cooperative provision of required parking space and other innovative parking arrangements which protect and serve the public interest\nare encouraged.\n191 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\nCELL (1, 1): \nIndustrial\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (2, 1): \nHeavy Industrial\nCELL (2, 2): \nAll Heavy Industrial, except as listed below\nCELL (2, 3): \n1 per 1,000 SF enclosed floor area\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nJunkyard\nCELL (3, 3): \n1 per 10,000 SF yard area\nCELL (4, 1): \nLight Industrial\nCELL (4, 2): \nAll light industrial\nCELL (4, 3): \n1 per 1,000 SF enclosed floor area\nCELL (5, 1): \nResource Extraction\nCELL (5, 2): \nAll Resource Extraction, except as listed\nbelow\nCELL (5, 3): \n1 per 2 employees, minimum 3\nCELL (6, 1): \nCELL (6, 2): \nMining Operations, Class I\nCELL (6, 3): \nAs required by the Planning Director\nCELL (7, 1): \nCELL (7, 2): \nMining Operations, Class II\nCELL (7, 3): \nCELL (8, 1): \nWarehouse and Storage\nCELL (8, 2): \nAll Warehousing and Storage\nCELL (8, 3): \n1 per 5,000 SF of floor area\nCELL (9, 1): \nWaste Related Services\nCELL (9, 2): \nAll Waste Related Services\nCELL (9, 3): \n1 per 500 SF enclosed floor area + 1 per\n5,000 SF outside storage area\nCELL (10, 1): \nWholesale Sales and Service\nCELL (10, 2): \nAll Wholesale Sales and Service\nCELL (10, 3): \n1 per 1,000 SF floor area\n\n\n Output:"}]}
