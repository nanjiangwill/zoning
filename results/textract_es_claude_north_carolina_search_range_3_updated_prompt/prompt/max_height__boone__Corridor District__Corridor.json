Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Corridor\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"Corridor District\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Corridor\n(Corridor District) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Corridor (Corridor District). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Corridor (Corridor District)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Corridor\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

When a development is proposed on land with more than one zoning classification, the\nelements of the development, including but not limited to parking, recreation and\nstorage, must be located on those portions of the development with zoning\ndesignations which allows the use as a principal use or is otherwise specifically\nauthorized.

However, when an owner of property\nwhich is either partly or wholly above the depicted line files an application for development\nto take place within the presumed viewshed, and contends that the property is not within\nthe viewshed, the Administrator or his designee shall determine if the development, as\nproposed, can be seen during any season of the year from one of the major traffic corridors.\nIf the Administrator determines that the property cannot be thus seen, the requirements\nof the overlay district shall not apply.\nCELL (4, 1): \n14.42.03\nCELL (4, 2): \nThe requirements for the development of properties wholly or partly within the Viewshed\nProtection District shall be as follows:\nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nA. The maximum allowable land disturbance on property within the viewshed shall be as\nfollows:\nCELL (6, 1): \nCELL (6, 2): \n1. Property up to two (2) acres in size shall be limited to three-quarters (3/4) of an\nacre of land disturbance. Therefore, a three-quarter (3/4) acre or smaller property\nin the viewshed is unrestricted by this Section with regard to land disturbing\nactivity.\nCELL (7, 1): \nCELL (7, 2): \n2. The maximum allowable land disturbance for property in the viewshed which is\nlarger than two (2) acres shall be limited to three-quarters (3/4) of an acre for the\n\n\nNEW PAGE 259\nTown of Boone\nUnified Development Ordinance\nArticle 14 Zoning Districts Regulations\nfirst two (2) acres, plus thirty percent (30%) of the additional property. For\nexample, a tract of land of four (4) acres can be developed with three-quarters (3/4)\nacre, or 32,670 square feet, of land disturbed based upon the first two acres, and\nan additional thirty percent (30%), or 26,136 square feet of land disturbed, based\non the additional two (2) acres. Therefore, a total of 58,806 square feet can be\ndisturbed in the development of the four (4) acres, and this total amount of land\ndisturbance may be consolidated in one area of the property. In this example, the\nland in one (1) acre can be 100% disturbed, in a second acre, partly disturbed, and\nin the remaining two (2) acres, undisturbed.\n3.\nLand disturbance of portions of a property below the viewshed are unrestricted by\nthis Section, but do not increase the amount of land disturbance which can take\nplace on the portion of the property in the viewshed.\nB. The intensity of development of property zoned RA within the viewshed shall be as\nestablished for the RA district. The intensity, including height limitations, of\ndevelopment of property in all other zoning districts within the viewshed shall be as\nestablished for the R1 zoning district.\nC. With respect to development existing before the effective date of this amendment:\n1. When the intensity of the existing development does not exceed the limits\nestablished by Subsection 14.42.03(B), the existing development may be increased\nin size up to ten percent (10%) greater than the limits established by Subsection\n14.42.03(B).\n2. When the intensity of the existing development already exceeds the limits\nestablished by Subsection 14.42.03(B), additional development is permitted up to\na size 10% greater than the existing structure, and likewise, an additional ten\npercent (10%) of impervious surface may be created.\n3. The limits on land disturbing activity created by Subsection 14.42.03(A) shall be\ncalculated as if no development on the property has yet taken place. In other\nwords, the Administrator shall exclude from the calculations of allowable land\ndisturbance that portion of the property upon which an impervious surface exists\nat the time this amendment is effective. For example, if a house with a 2,000 square\nfoot footprint and 2,000 square feet of driveway already exists on a three (3) acre\ntract, and the owner wishes to construct an addition, the Administrator will first\nadd the square footage of the house's footprint and the square footage of the\ndriveway to determine that there is already 4,000 square feet of impervious surface\non the property. This existing square footage of impervious surface will be\nsubtracted from the total land area of the property to calculate how much of the\nremaining property can be disturbed. In the example, the property will be viewed\nnot as a three (3) acre tract, but as a tract of two (2) acres, plus 39,560 square feet\n(an acre = 43,560 square feet, minus 4,000 square feet of existing impervious\n14-109\n\n\n Output:"}]}
