Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Mini Farm Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MFO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Mini Farm Overlay\n(MFO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Mini Farm Overlay (MFO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Mini Farm Overlay (MFO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Mini Farm Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

The Official Zoning Map is on file with the City Clerk and the\nPlanning, Zoning and Subdivision Administrator at the Creedmoor City Hall.\n1.13-2\nMAP CERTIFICATION AND CHANGES. The Official Zoning Map shall be attested by the City Clerk and shall\nbear the seal of the City together with the effective date of the adoption of this Ordinance. If changes are\nmade in district boundaries or other matters portrayed on the Official Zoning Map, such changes shall be\nentered on the Official Zoning Map.\n1.14\nInterpretation of District Boundaries\n1.14-1 BOUNDARY INTERPRETATION. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on\nthe Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply in the interpretation of area boundaries and the\nlocation of lines shown on the map:\nA.\nCENTERLINE: Where a boundary line lies within and follows a street or alley right-of-way, a railroad\nright-of-way, or utility easement, the boundary shall be construed to be in the center of such street\nor alley right-of-way, railroad right-of-way, or utility easement. If such a street or alley right-of-way,\nrailroad right-of-way, or utility easement forming the boundary between two separate zoning\ndistricts is abandoned or removed from dedication, the district boundaries shall be construed as\nfollowing the centerline of the abandoned or vacated road bed or utility easement.\nB. LOT LINE: Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines shall be construed as following\nsuch lot lines. In the event that a district boundary line divides a lot or tract, each part of the lot or\ntract so divided shall be used in conformity with the regulations established by this Ordinance for the\ndistrict in which said part is located. Split zoning of lots should be avoided to the extent possible, with\nzoning boundaries following lot lines where feasible.\nC.\nCITY LIMITS: Boundaries indicated as approximately following the City limits or extraterritorial\nboundary lines of the City of Creedmoor shall be construed as following the City limits or\nextraterritorial boundary lines.\nD.\nWATERCOURSES: Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers,\ncanals, lakes, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such center lines and shall be\nconstrued to reflect the naturally occurring changes to the location of the watercourse which may\noccur over time.\nE.\nEXTENSIONS: Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of street or alley rights-of-way,\nchannelized waterways, railroad rights-of-way, utility easements, lot lines, City limits, county lines,\nor extraterritorial boundaries shall be so construed.\nF.\nSCALING: In a case where a district boundary does not coincide with any boundary lines as above and\nno distances are described by specific ordinance; the boundary shall be determined by the use of the\nscale appearing on the map. In the case of Flood Hazard Area, Corps of Engineering work maps, if\navailable, shall be used for scaling.\nG. OTHER: Where the actual location of existing physical or natural features vary with those shown on\nthe Official Zoning Map, or in other circumstances not addressed in this section, the Planning Board\nArticle 1 - Page 5\n\n\nNEW PAGE 6\nshall have the authority to interpret the district boundaries.\n1.15\nState of Emergency\nThese rules may be temporarily suspended during federal disaster \"state of emergency\" declarations by the\nExecutive Office of the President and/or Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) and/or during\n\"Imminent Threat Alert\" declared by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security by resolution adopted by the\nBoard of Commissioners during a regular, continued, special or emergency meeting of the Board of\nCommissioners. The Planning, Zoning and Subdivision Administrator may suspend the application of all or part\nof these rules during a state of emergency declared either by the Governor of the State of North Carolina, or by\nthe Mayor of the City of Creedmoor.\nUpon the conclusion, lifting, and/or resending of the declared \"state of emergency\" by the authorized federal\nand/or state official, these rules are reinstated without further action by the City and shall be in full force and\neffect.\nArticle 1 - Page 6\n\n\nNEW PAGE 7\nARTICLE 2\nGeneral Provisions\n[Amended Sept. 21, 2015, per Ord. 2015-0-20, ZTA-2015-02]\n[Amended June 1, 2021 per Ord. 2021-0-10, ZTA-2021-02]\n[Amended April 5th, 2022 per Ord. 2022-0-01, ZTA-2022-01]\n2.1\nGeneral Requirements\nUpon the adoption of this Ordinance, no structure shall be erected nor use established in conflict with:\nA. the district regulations of Article 8;\nB. the building and lot regulations of Article 9;\nC. the street regulations of Article 13;\nD. the off-street parking regulations of Article 12;\nE. the landscape regulations of Article 11;\nF. the open space regulations of Article 21;\nG. the general provisions of Article 2; or\nH. the sign regulations of Article 17.\n2.2\nStreet Frontage Required\nAny lot on which a building (or buildings) is to be erected or use is to be established shall abut a public street\nwith the following exceptions:\nA.\nAny lot for which a residential use has been legally established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance\nprovided the lot is served by a private and exclusive recorded easement of at least 15 feet in width\nconnecting said lot to a public street, may be used as if it abutted a street, provided that it is served by a\ndriveway located on said easement.
