Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Light Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"B-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Light Business\n(B-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Light Business (B-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Light Business (B-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Light Business\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft).

It is typically located in\nareas with good access to surface transportation by trucks and rail. Development takes place on larger\nlots and is often enclosed by security fencing. The district accommodates large-scale industrial uses\nincluding outdoor operations or storage with extensive movement of vehicles, materials, and goods,\ntruck traffic and greater potential for adverse environmental and visual impacts on neighboring lands.\nThe district also allows limited forms of heavier commercial use types, but residential development is\nprohibited (except for caretaker quarters as an accessory use).

LIGHT BUSINESS (B-1) DISTRICT\nA.\nB-1 DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENT\nThe mixed-use Light Business (B-1) district is intended for low intensity, neighborhood-serving commercial and\nneighborhoods. The B-1 district provides employment, shopping, personal service, and entertainment\ndevelopment around significant roadway intersections located along the edges of\nuses for the benefit of nearby residents in a compact context. The district allows offices, personal\nservices, and small-scale retail and a variety of institutional uses. As a means of providing additional\nfloor housing options, the district allows two-family, multi-family, and upper story residential over ground-\nnon-residential uses. Non-residential buildings are small-scale, with small footprints, and with\nis building heights around two stories. Buildings are proximate to the street edge and off-street parking\nwell-screened from lower intensity uses. Industrial development and higher density residential\ntheir are not permitted. District regulations discourage uses that are too intense or that draw the majority uses of\npatrons from outside the immediate area. In order to maintain compatibility with surrounding\nStandards. uses and ensure a high quality of development, all activities shall comply with the standards in Article 6.\nB.\nB-1 EXAMPLE DEVELOPMENT\nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nUnified Development Ordinance\nPage\n148\nLAST AMENDED\n5.2.22\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nCELL (6, 1): \nCELL (6, 2): \nCELL (7, 1): \nCELL (7, 2): \nCELL (8, 1): \nMES\nCELL (8, 2): \nCELL (9, 1): \nCELL (9, 2): \n\nNEW PAGE 149\nARTICLE 3.

LIGHT INDUSTRIAL (M-1) - DISTRICT\nA.\nM-1 DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENT\nThe Light Industrial (M-1) district is established to accommodate agricultural and light manufacturing\nuses, including assembly, fabrication, processing, distribution, storage, and wholesales sale of finished\nor semi-finished products from previously prepared materials. The district also allows commercial\nactivities intended to serve the primary businesses in the district and their employees. Uses allowed in\nthe district do not require large amounts of land or large building areas for operation nor large yard\nareas for isolation or protection from adjoining premises or activities. Activities take place almost\nentirely indoors and result in minimal exterior movement of vehicles, materials, and goods in areas\naround the district. Buildings are situated so as to have minimal visual impacts and are well-screened\nfrom adjacent lower intensity uses.
