Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"TNDO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay\n(TNDO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay (TNDO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay (TNDO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

Buildings shall have no more than 50% of the 1st floor in residential use.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 22\n\n\nNEW PAGE 192\n(B.) Architectural Standards.\n(1.) Principles:\n(a.) To perpetuate the unique building character of the Town and its environs, and\nto re-establish its local identity, development shall generally employ building\nstyles that are compatible with the architectural vocabulary of the area in their\nexternal treatment.\n(b.) Building elevations fronting or visible from public streets shall be clad with\nmasonry, wood, stucco, or similar material. Vinyl siding shall not comprise a\nstreet fronting building face to maintain compatibility with structures within\nthe Town.\n(c.) The front elevations facing the street, and the overall massing shall\ncommunicate an emphasis on the human scale and the pedestrian environment\nto maintain compatibility with structures within the Town.\n(d.) Each building should be designed to form part of a larger composition of the\narea in which it is situated. Adjacent buildings should thus be of similar scale,\nheight, and configuration to maintain compatibility with structures within the\nTown.\n(e.) Drive-through customer services, if permitted in the district, must be located\nat the rear of the building or on a side which does not abut a street to maintain\ncompatibility with structures within the Town.\n(f.) Trailers (mobile and/or manufactured units) may not be used as permanent\nworkplace buildings.\n(2.) Configurations:\n(a.) Two wall materials may be combined horizontally on one facade. The\n\"heavier\" material should be below the \"lighter\" material and the \"heavier\"\nmaterial can cover the first floor only (i.e. brick below wood siding) to\nmaintain compatibility with structures within the Town.\n(b.) Street level windows adjacent to public sidewalks shall be un-tinted to\nmaintain compatibility with structures within the Town. Tinted glass with a\nminimum visual transmittance factor of 35 is permitted in all other instances.\nMirrored or reflective glass is not permitted in any location.\n(c.) Windows shall be of square or vertical proportion. Special windows may be\ncircular or regular polygons.\n(3.) Techniques:\n(a.) Windows should be set to the inside of the building face wall to maintain\ncompatibility with structures within the Town.\n(b.) All rooftop equipment shall be screened from view from public Right-of-\nWays by a building material that matches the structure or is visually\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 23\n\n\nNEW PAGE 193\ncompatible with the structure. The screening apparatus should be\nincorporated as part of the architectural theme to maintain compatibility with\nstructures within the Town.\n9.7\nUrban Workplace Lot and Building Type\n9.7-1 Description. The urban workplace building may be a large structure (15,000+ square\nfeet) and can have one or multiple tenants. Office, light industrial, and commercial\ntenants are typical. Southern mill villages often provide examples of how these\nbuildings can reasonably coexist with other businesses and homes. These buildings\nserve as employment centers and commercial service locations. The buildings will\nprovide space for industry and large offices, as well as hotels, conference facilities,\nand large retail uses such as a full service grocery store. Structures shall be designed\nto serve as key focal points and to establish the design template for the area. When\nlocated at the end of a block or other appropriate location, structures shall be designed\nto terminate vistas.\nThe photograph below is an example for illustration purposes only and is not intended\nto regulate lot/building styles, patterns, or forms.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 24\n\nNEW PAGE 194\n9.7-2 Urban Workplace Lot Type.\n(A.) Building Placement, Parking, and Vehicle Access.\n(1.) Buildings will range from 10' to 18' behind the street curb-line in Mixed Use\n(\"MU\"), Main Street (\"MS\"), and \"TNDO\" districts. Within the limits described\nabove, front setbacks will vary depending upon site conditions. Special site\nconditions such as topography, pattern of lot widths, or setbacks of existing\nbuildings on the same block permit a larger setback. Setbacks should be used in a\nmanner that encourages pedestrian activity. For example, squares or spatially\ndefined plazas within building setback areas can act as focal points for\npedestrians.\n(a.) Corners: Setback at street corners will generally replicate frontage conditions.\nSide setbacks on a minor residential street may be less than the front\ndimension.\n(2.) Side and rear setbacks will vary according to side and rear buffer requirements as\nset forth in Article 11, with a minimum 0-foot setback when no buffer is required.\n(3.) Front and rear building facades shall be generally parallel to frontage property\nlines. The fa\u00e7ade shall be determined by the massing of the building. Buildings\nin all locations should relate the principal fa\u00e7ade to the sidewalk and public space\nof the street.\n(4.) Parking shall be located primarily to the rear of the building; side-yard parking\nshall occupy no more than 35% of the primary frontage line and shall not be\nplaced in any side-yard abutting an intersecting street. Where dimensions of\nexisting lots restrict parking behind buildings, the limitations on side-yard parking\nmay be modified.\n(5.) Hedges, garden walls, or knee walls may be built on property lines or as the\ncontinuation of building walls. A garden wall, hedge or knee wall a minimum 2.5'\nin height, maximum 3.5' in height, shall be installed along any street frontage\nadjacent to parking areas. Knee walls should be built of brick, stone or other\ndecorative masonry material, or should be built of wrought iron or other\ndecorative metal, and shall generally match the architectural style of Coats.\n(6.) Parking areas on adjacent lots shall be connected with vehicular and pedestrian\nconnections wherever practical.\n(7.) Trash containers shall be located in a rear parking area (see Parking Regulations,\nArticle 12) and shall be screened from the right-of-way with a Type D Buffer\nYard per standards and specifications set forth in Article 11.\n(8.) Mechanical equipment at ground level shall be placed on the parking lot side of\nthe building away from buildings on adjacent sites and shall be screened from\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 25\n\n\nNEW PAGE 195\nview by either an opaque screen or fence, or a Type D Buffer Yard per standards\nand specifications set forth in Article 11.\n(9.) Building facades at street frontage lines shall be pedestrian oriented and of\npedestrian scale. The building's design shall promote pedestrian activity and\npedestrian-driven commerce. The sidewalk shall be an extension of the street\nlevel businesses' operations. As such, pedestrians should be able to preview\nbusinesses' merchandise and/or dine from the sidewalk. Business activities shall\nnot impede on the required pedestrian travel widths and shall not encroach more\nthan 5 feet into the sidewalk.\n(B.) Encroachments and Pedestrian Access to Building.\n(1.) Balconies, bay windows, arcades, awnings and porches at an upper level and their\nsupports are permitted and encouraged within the sidewalk as shown by the un-\nshaded area. Encroachments affixed\nto the building and horizontally\nprotruding more than 6\" from the face\nPARKING\nof the building must have a minimum\n7'6\" clearance from the finished\ngrade. Encroaching canopies should\ncover the entire sidewalk within the\npermitted distance shown by the un-\n5' MAX BALCONY/PORCH\nshaded area.\nENCROACHMENT\n(2.) Primary pedestrian access into the\nROW\nbuilding shall be from the street\nSIDEWALK\nSTREET\nfrontage line (indicated by larger\narrow). Secondary access may be from parking areas indicated by smaller\narrows).\n9.7-3 Urban Workplace Building Type.\n(A.) Permitted Height and Use Limitations.\n(1.) For buildings with flat roofs, building height shall be measured as the vertical\ndistance from the mean elevation of the existing grade to the highest finished roof\nsurface. The height of parapet walls is not counted in the building height\ncalculations and may vary depending upon the need to screen mechanical\nequipment.\n(2.) For buildings with pitched roofs, building heights shall be measured as the\nvertical distance from the mean elevation of the finished grade to a point\nrepresenting the midpoint of the peak and leave heights.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 26\n\n\nNEW PAGE 196\n(3.) Building height to the ridge may vary depending on the roof pitch.\n(4.) Buildings shall have no less than 2 stories. Buildings shall have no more than 3\nstories, unless the building is in a \"TNDO\" district, in which case the maximum\nnumber of\nstories and\nmaximum\nbuilding\nheight is\nregulated by\n45' MAX\nthe procedure\nfor \"TNDO\"\napproval in\nArticle 7 of\nthis\n5' MAX\nENCROACHMENT\nOrdinance.\n(5.) Buildings shall have no more than 50% of the 1st floor in residential use.\n(B.) Architectural Standards.\n(1.) Principles:\n(a.) To perpetuate the unique building character of the Town and its environs, and\nto re-establish its local identity, development shall generally employ building\nstyles that are compatible with the architectural vocabulary of the area in their\nexternal treatment.\n(b.) Building elevations fronting or visible from public streets shall be clad with\nmasonry, wood, stucco, or similar material. Vinyl siding shall not comprise a\nstreet fronting building face to maintain compatibility with structures within\nthe Town.\n(c.) The front elevations facing the street, and the overall massing shall\ncommunicate an emphasis on the human scale and the pedestrian environment\nto maintain compatibility with structures within the Town.\n(d.) Each building should be designed to form part of a larger composition of the\narea in which it is situated. Adjacent buildings should thus be of similar scale,\nheight, and configuration to maintain compatibility with structures within the\nTown.\n(e.) Drive-through customer services, if permitted in the district, must be located\nat the rear of the building or on a side which does not abut a street to maintain\ncompatibility with structures within the Town.\n(f.) Trailers (mobile and/or manufactured units) may not be used as permanent\nworkplace buildings.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 27\n\n\nNEW PAGE 197\n(2.) Configurations:\n(a.) Two wall materials may be combined horizontally on one facade. The\n\"heavier\" material should be below the \"lighter\" material and the \"heavier\"\nmaterial can cover the first floor only (i.e. brick below wood siding) to\nmaintain compatibility with structures within the Town.\n(b.) Street level windows adjacent to public sidewalks shall be un-tinted to\nmaintain compatibility with structures within the Town. Tinted glass with a\nminimum visual transmittance factor of 35 is permitted in all other instances.\nMirrored or reflective glass is not permitted in any location.\n(c.) Windows shall be of square or vertical proportion. Special windows may be\ncircular or regular polygons.\n(3.) Techniques:\n(a.) Windows should be set to the inside of the building face wall to maintain\ncompatibility with structures within the Town.\n(b.) All rooftop equipment shall be screened from view from public Rights-of-\nWay by a building material that matches the structure or is visually\ncompatible with the structure. The screening apparatus should be\nincorporated as part of the architectural theme to maintain compatibility with\nstructures within the Town.\n9.7-4 Building Standards and Anti-Monotony Standards for Urban Workplace Buildings.\n(A.) Massing and Rhythm\n(1.) To insure a consistent scale and compatible character of each and every building,\nmassing and rhythm shall be considered in the site design. Examples of\nappropriate height to width ratios are depicted in the following below. A single\nlarge dominant building mass shall be avoided in new buildings and, to the extent\nreasonable and feasible, in development projects involving changes to the mass of\nexisting buildings.\n1:3\n1:1\n1:2\n1:1.25\n(2.) Horizontal masses shall not exceed a height-width ratio of 1:3 without substantial\nvariation in massing that includes a change in height and projecting or recessed\nelements. Changes in mass shall be related to entrances, the integral structure,\nand/or the organization of interior spaces and not merely for cosmetic purposes.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 28\n\n\n Output:"}]}
