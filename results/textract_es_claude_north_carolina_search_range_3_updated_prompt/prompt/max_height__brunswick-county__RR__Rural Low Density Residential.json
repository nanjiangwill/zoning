Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Rural Low Density Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"RR\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Rural Low Density Residential\n(RR) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Rural Low Density Residential (RR). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Rural Low Density Residential (RR)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Rural Low Density Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Residential District Intent Statements\nA. RR: Rural Low Density Residential\nThe Rural Low Density Residential District is intended to accommodate nonresidential agricultural uses and low density residential development,\nas well as limited nonresidential uses that are supportive of the County's traditional agricultural orientation including farming, silviculture\noperations and related activities. Development in this District should rely predominantly on individual wells and septic tank systems for\ndomestic water supply and sewage disposal, respectively, although clustered residential development served by public water and wastewater\nsystems may be allowed.\nB. R-7500, R-6000, and SBR-6000\nThe R-7500, R-6000, and SBR-6000 districts are established to provide for orderly suburban residential development. A limited number of\ncommercial and civic uses are allowed, subject to the restrictions necessary to preserve and protect the residential character of the\nneighborhood. A special permit process for higher intensity development is also allowed, using discretion to balance issues of higher density\nwith improved amenities. Due to the higher intensity developments contained in this district, it is intended to be applied to properties served by\npublic sewer and water systems.\nC. MR-3200\nThis district is established as an area in which the principal use of the land is for high density residential purposes, not to exceed fourteen\ndwelling units per acre. The district also provides for the development of less intensive residential uses, as well as for compatible supporting\nnon-residential uses. Due to the higher intensity developments contained in this district, it is intended to be applied only to properties served by\npublic sewer and water systems.\n4.4.2. Permitted Uses\nOnly uses specifically listed in the use table in Section 5.2 as a permitted (\"P\"), permitted subject to limited use standards (\"L\"), or permitted subject\nto special use permit (\"SUP\") shall be permitted in Residential districts.\n4.4.3. Accessory Structures and Uses\n48 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\n\nNEW PAGE 49\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nThe following accessory structures and uses shall be permitted in any residential district.

Where a lower ranked alternative is proposed, the applicant must file\nrelevant information as indicated in paragraph 4 below, including, but not limited to an affidavit by a radio frequency engineer\ndemonstrating that despite diligent efforts to adhere to the established hierarchy within the Geographic Search area, as determined\nby a qualified radio frequency engineer, higher ranked options are not technically feasible, practical, or justified given the location of\nthe proposed WTF and the existing land uses of the subject property and surrounding properties within 300 feet of the subject\nproperty.\n(c) The WTF and all supporting cables and anchors shall be contained within one parcel.\n124 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\nCELL (1, 1): \nPreference\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nSiting\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \n1\nCELL (2, 3): \nAttached to an existing WTF.\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \n2\nCELL (3, 3): \nAttached to a Utility Infrastructure (such as an overhead power\ntransmission line)\nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \n3\nCELL (4, 3): \nAttached as a Stealth WTF to an existing building or structure in a\nnon-residential zoning district.\nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \n4\nCELL (5, 3): \nAttached to an existing building or structure in a nonresidential zoning\ndistrict.\nCELL (6, 1): \nCELL (6, 2): \n5\nCELL (6, 3): \nLocated as a freestanding Stealth WTF in a nonresidential zoning\ndistrict.\nCELL (7, 1): \nCELL (7, 2): \n6\nCELL (7, 3): \nLocated as a Monopole in a nonresidential zoning district.\nCELL (8, 1): \nCELL (8, 2): \n7\nCELL (8, 3): \nLocated as a freestanding-guyed WTF in a nonresidential zoning\ndistrict\nCELL (9, 1): \nCELL (9, 2): \n8\nCELL (9, 3): \nAttached as a Stealth WTF to an existing nonresidential building or\nstructure in a residential zoning district.\nCELL (10, 1): \nCELL (10, 2): \n9\nCELL (10, 3): \nAttached to an existing nonresidential building or structure in a\nresidential zoning district.\nCELL (11, 1): \nCELL (11, 2): \n10\nCELL (11, 3): \nLocated as a freestanding Stealth WTF on a lot of a nonresidential use\nwithin a residential zoning district.\nCELL (12, 1): \nCELL (12, 2): \n11\nCELL (12, 3): \nLocated as a Monopole on a lot of a nonresidential use within a\nresidential zoning district.\nCELL (13, 1): \nCELL (13, 2): \n12\nCELL (13, 3): \nLocated as a freestanding-guyed WTF on alot of a nonresidential use\nwithin a residential zoning district.\n\n\nNEW PAGE 125\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\n(d) When located in an SBR-6000 zoning districts, no minimum lot size shall be required, provided the proposed WTF is attached to an\nexisting WTF or an existing building or structure.\niii. Dimensions\nWTFs shall conform to the following dimensional requirements:\n(a) Height\n(1) Attached WTF: The top of the WTF may not be more than 30 feet above the building or structure to which it is attached.\n(2) Freestanding WTF Measurement: This measure shall include the foundation of the WTF, but exclude lightning rods for the\ndissipation of lighting or lights required by the FAA that do not provide support for any antennae.\n(3) Freestanding WTF in Residential Districts: In the RR District, the maximum height shall be 250 feet. In the R-7500, R-6000, and\nSBR-6000 Districts, the maximum height shall be 200 feet. However, increases in height of up to 20% may be allowed by Board of\nAdjustment as part of the special use permit approval with a certification by a registered engineer that the setbacks provide\nadequate fall area in case of a tower collapse.\n(4)\nFreestanding WTF in Nonresidential Districts: In the N-C District, the C-I and C-LD, and all other nonresidential districts\nthe\nmaximum height shall be 300 feet. However, increases in height of up to 20% may be allowed by Board of Adjustment as part of\nthe special use permit approval with a certification by a registered engineer that the setbacks provide adequate fall area in case\nof a tower collapse.\n(5) Mitigation of an existing WTF (see paragraph 6 \"Mitigation\" on page 5-50). The maximum height of a new WTF arising from\nmitigation shall not exceed 125% of the height of the tallest WTF that is being mitigated.\n(b) Setbacks\n(1) Attached WTF: The building or structure to which the WTF will be attached shall maintain the normal setbacks of the district.\n(2) Freestanding Concealed WTF: In the N-C district and all residential districts, setbacks shall be determined according to the\nunderlying zoning district, plus an additional six inches for every one-foot of tower height. In all other districts, setbacks for WTFs\nshall be determined according to the underlying zoning district.\n(3) Freestanding Nonconcealed WTF: Setbacks for WTFs shall be determined according to the underlying zoning district, plus an\nadditional six inches of setback (on each side) for every one-foot of tower height. The Board of Adjustment may approve\nreductions to this setback requirement as a part of the special use permit approval with a certification by a registered engineer\nthat the resulting setbacks provide adequate fall area in case of a tower collapse.\n(4)\nMitigation of an existing WTF: A new WTF approved as mitigation shall not be required to meet setback requirements so long as\nthe new WTF is no closer to any property lines or dwelling units as the WTF being mitigated.\nCommentary: Refer to Section 4.3.3.B for the underlying zoning district setbacks for WTFs proposed in residential zoning districts. See\nSection 4.5.3.B for the underlying zoning district setbacks in commercial zoning districts. See Section 4.6.3.B for the underlying zoning\ndistrict setbacks in industrial zoning districts.\n(c) Buffers\n(1) A landscaped buffer shall surround the base of the WTF equipment compound. Existing trees and shrubs on the site should be\npreserved and may be used in lieu of required landscaping where approved by the Planning Director. Grading shall be minimized\nand limited only to the area necessary for the new WTF.\n(2) If the proposed WTF is the principal use of the property then landscaping per Section 6.2, Landscaping and Buffering, shall apply.\nAdditionally, when a freestanding nonconcealed WTF is located in a residential district, a buffer with opacity 0.8 (80%) shall be\nprovided around the WTF equipment compound.\n(3) If the proposed WTF is to be located in front of an existing structure on the same lot, a street buffer (see Section 6.3.2.A) shall also\nbe required.\niv. Aesthetics\n(a) Stealth attached WTFs, including feed lines and antennae, shall be designed so as to be compatible with the facade, roof, wall or\nstructure on which it is affixing so that it matches the existing structural design, color and texture.\n(b)\nFreestanding WTFs shall be designed so as to be compatible with neighboring structures and landscapes to the extent feasible with\nspecific design considerations as to height, scale, color and texture.\n(c) Commercial messages may not be displayed on any WTF.\n4. Application Requirements\nIn addition to all of the requirements of Section 3.2, Site Plan Review, and Section 3.5, Special Use Permit (if required), the following\ninformation must be supplied with the site plan and special exception permit (if required) application for WTFs:\n125 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\n\n Output:"}]}
