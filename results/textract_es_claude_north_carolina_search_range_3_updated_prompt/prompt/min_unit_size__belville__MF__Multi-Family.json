Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Multi-Family\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MF\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Multi-Family\n(MF) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Multi-Family (MF). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Multi-Family (MF)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Multi-Family\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 74\nArticle 4 Zoning Districts\n4.5 Commercial Zoning Districts\n4.5.4.\nSpecial Standards in the MF Zoning District\nD.\nOpen Space\nOpen space requirements for the residential portion of a multifamily or mixed commercial-residential\nproject shall be the same and conform to the requirements for multifamily developments in the MR-\n4-12\nCELL (1, 1):\nUse\nCELL (1, 2):\nDistrict\nCELL (1, 3):\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 4):\nMinimum\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 5):\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 6):\nMinimum\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 7):\nCELL (1, 8):\nYard\n(ft.)\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (2, 1):\nCELL (2, 2):\nCELL (2, 3):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 4):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 5):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 6):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 7):\nFront\nCELL (2, 8):\nRear\nCELL (2, 9):\nSide\nCELL (3, 1):\nAll residential, except\nCELL (3, 2):\nMF\nCELL (3, 3):\n60\nCELL (3, 4):\n60\nCELL (3, 5):\n6,000\nCELL (3, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (3, 7):\n25\u00b3\nCELL (3, 8):\n63\nCELL (3, 9):\n51,2\nCELL (4, 1):\nmultifamily\nCELL (4, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (4, 3):\n75\nCELL (4, 4):\n75\nCELL (4, 5):\n7,500\nCELL (4, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (4, 7):\n253\nCELL (4, 8):\n253\nCELL (4, 9):\n102\nCELL (5, 1):\nMultifamily/ Mixed\nCELL (5, 2):\nMF\nCELL (5, 3):\n100\nCELL (5, 4):\n150\nCELL (5, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (5, 6):\n15,000\nCELL (5, 7):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 8):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 9):\nCELL (6, 1):\ncommercial- residential\nCELL (6, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (6, 3):\n100\nCELL (6, 4):\n100\nCELL (6, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (6, 6):\n7,000\nCELL (6, 7):\nCELL (6, 8):\nCELL (6, 9):\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"CELL (2, 5):\\nWith\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 5):\\n6,000\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (2, 6):\\nWithout\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 6):\\n10,000\" 74]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"For district MF, the section provides the information for min_unit_size.

An applicant may\napply to the Zoning Code Administrator for up to twenty-five (25) percent of parking over\nthe maximum, provided that the following conditions are met:\n1. All parking in excess of essential site improvements shall comply with the provisions of\nthis Article;\n2. The applicant requesting the additional parking shall submit information clearly showing\nthe need for the additional number of parking spaces being proposed, including estimates\nof parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers and/or\nother reliable data, and all such information shall document the source of data used to\ndevelop the recommendation; and\n3. The applicant demonstrates that no other parking alternatives exist, including shared\nparking opportunities with neighboring properties.\nE. Bicycle parking. With the exception of the provisions in Article 7 for Overlay Districts, all\nproperties shall provide bicycle parking in accordance with the Bicycle Parking Schedule in\nthis Article. Bicycle parking is not required for Single Family Dwellings, Townhouses, and\nMulti-Family Dwellings of less than four (4) units per building. Where fewer than two (2)\nspaces are required, at least two (2) bicycle parking spaces or one rack must be provided.\n1.

An \"Inverted U\" or other bicycle parking rack that supports the bicycle at two (2) points\non the bicycle frame is the minimum standard for fulfillment of the bicycle parking\nstandards. A single inverted U rack will count as two (2) bicycle parking spaces. Long\nterm bicycle parking, such as bike lockers and locked rooms, may be provided for use by\nemployees and students and may count toward fulfillment of one-half (0.5) of the bicycle\nparking requirements.\n3. Bicycle racks shall be located no closer than three (3) feet from any wall.\n4. Bicycle parking shall be placed along a major building approach line and clearly visible\nfrom the approach and no more than fifty (50) feet from building entrances or no further\nthan the closest motor vehicle parking space, whichever is less.\n5. Uses with several public entrances shall locate a portion of the required bicycle parking at\neach entrance.\n6. The provided bicycle parking shall allow for bicyclists to secure their vehicle against\ntheft.\nF. Parking studies. Some uses have widely varying parking demand characteristics, making it\nimpossible to specify a single off-street parking standard. A developer proposing to develop\nor expand such a use may be required to submit a parking study clearly showing the need for\nthe number of off-street parking spaces proposed. The Zoning Code Administrator shall\nreview this study and any other traffic engineering and planning data relevant to the\nestablishment of an appropriate off-street parking standard for the proposed use. A parking\nstudy must include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute\nof Traffic Engineers (ITE) and/or other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of\nuses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be\ndetermined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study must\ndocument the source of data used to develop the recommendations. After reviewing the\nparking study, the Zoning Code Administrator shall establish the off-street parking standard\nfor the proposed use.\nG.
