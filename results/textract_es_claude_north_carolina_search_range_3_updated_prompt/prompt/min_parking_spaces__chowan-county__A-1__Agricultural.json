Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Agricultural\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"A-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Agricultural\n(A-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Agricultural (A-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Agricultural (A-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Agricultural\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\"). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 165\n165/167\nCELL (1, 1):\nRestaurants (with drive through service)\nCELL (1, 2):\nOne (1) space for each four (4) seating\naccommodations, plus one (1) space for each\ntwo (2) employees on the shift of largest\nemployment; and Three (3) stacking spaces\nfor each drive through window.\nCELL (2, 1):\nSchool, Elementary and Middle (both public\nand private):\nCELL (2, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each classroom and\nadministrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee and one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (3, 1):\nSchool, High School (both public and private)\nCELL (3, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each fifteen (15)\nstudents for which the building was designed,\nplus one (1) parking space for each classroom\nand administrative office, plus one (1) parking\nspace for each employee, plus one (1) large\nspace for each bus.\nCELL (4, 1):\nShopping Centers, large and small\nCELL (4, 2):\nOne (1) space for each three hundred (300)\nsquare feet of gross floor area.\nCELL (5, 1):\nSingle Family, Duplex, Condominiums,\nManufactured Homes, and similar residential\nCELL (5, 2):\nTwo (2) spaces per dwelling unit\nCELL (6, 1):\nTerminals, Bus\nCELL (6, 2):\nOne (1) space for each employee and one (1)\nspace for each bus loading ramp and track.\nCELL (7, 1):\nStadiums, Theaters, and similar uses\ninvolving the assembling of persons:\nCELL (7, 2):\nOne (1) parking space for each four (4) seats\nin the largest assembly room.
