Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Single-family residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-8\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Single-family residential\n(R-8) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Single-family residential (R-8). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Single-family residential (R-8)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Single-family residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

These uses are declared by this chapter to be\nincompatible with permitted uses in the districts in which they are located. It is the intent of this section to encourage\nconformance without prohibiting the reconstruction of a nonconforming residential structure within the structure's original\nfootprint destroyed by fire, explosion, tornado, earthquake, hurricane or similar uncontrollable cause.\n(B) It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformances shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, or\nused as grounds for adding other structures, or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.\n(Ord. passed 6-8-78; Am.

Variance of area, width, and yard requirements\nshall be obtained only through action of the Board of Adjustment.\n(B) If two or more lots or combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of\nrecord at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots do not meet at least 80% of the\nrequirements for lot width and area, for the zone in which they are located, as established by this chapter, the land involved\nshall be considered to be an undivided parcel, for the purpose of this chapter, and no portion of the parcel shall be used or\nsold which does not meet width and area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of the parcel be\nmade which leaves remaining any lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this chapter.\n(Ord. passed 6-8-78; Am.

Using the entirety of each adjacent structure with all attached above-ground level features,\nthe surveyor preparing the proposed building plan shall identify, by survey measurement, the point on each structure that is\nfarthest from the street lot line. The surveyor will prepare a certified line between those points, that will establish the build-to-\nline. Existing fences and walkways over the dunes shall not be used in the survey measurement. Elevated stairs leading\nfrom the principal structure to a walkway are, in their entirety, considered part of the structure. Stairs leading from the\nprincipal structure or attached porch/deck to the ground are, in their entirety, considered part of the structure and shall be\nconsidered in the build-to-line measurement. For purposes of identifying the build-to-line, transitions from residential\nstructure to walkway wider than six feet shall be considered part of the structure.\n(C) Applicability.\n(1) All above-ground construction and placement of structures, including but not necessarily limited to housing, exterior\ndecks, walkways, docks and viewing and seating platforms detached from housing shall be subject to the build-to-line\nprovisions established by this section. No decking, stairs, or at-grade improvements exceeding six inches in height shall be\npermitted ocean-ward or marsh-ward of the build-to-line except as provided in division (D), Exemptions.\n(2) For purposes of this section, structures include buildings, screened enclosures, fences, above-ground swimming\npools and/or man-made facilities or infrastructure that is principally above ground.\n(D) Exemptions. The following shall be permitted beyond the build-to-line subject to the standards provided.\n(1) Walkways, viewing platforms, docks, stairs to the beach, and similar appurtenances.\n(a) Walkways (including associated stairs) connecting the principal structure to beach and marsh walkways and\ndetached seating and viewing platforms shall occur as close as possible to the natural, undisturbed contour of the terrain,\nbut no lower than provided for by CAMA rules, so as to minimize intrusion into the natural features and beauty of the town's\nlandscape. Stairs leading from a walkway to a ground level feature, which may include an in-ground pool, beach, marsh, or\nsimilar, are permitted.\n(b) To minimize intrusion into the health and natural beauty of the dunes, residential walkways must follow, within\nreason, the shortest straight-line path from the structure to the beach. The maximum allowed width for a walkway from a\nresidential structure is six feet. The walking surface of the walkway deck shall be no greater than 18 inches above the\nhighest point of the natural, undisturbed peak of the terrain under the proposed path of the structure.\n(c) A viewing platform, with a total footprint not to exceed 200 square feet may be attached to the walkway. The\nplatform shall be immediately adjacent to the walkway with a transition from walkway to deck not to exceed four feet. The\nwalking surface of the platform may not be elevated above the walking surface of the walkway.\n(d) 1. Hand railings or guard railings on residential walkways shall be no higher than required by the NC Building\nCode. Where elevation requires fall protection, walkway railings must provide at least 50% open space, measured between\nthe vertical pilings. Where code mandates fall protection due to elevation, vertical or horizontal balusters shall be used in a\nmanner conforming to NC Building Code and shall be sized and spaced to provide at least 50% open space, measured\nbetween the vertical pilings. Lattice type closure on railings is not permitted.\n2. For example, a guard rail constructed with a top rail five inches tall, with one and one-half inch vertical or\nhorizontal balusters spaced three and four-fifths inches apart, and a bottom runner that is three and one-half inches tall will\nprovide more than 54% open space.\n(e) Under no circumstances shall a detached platform, walkway, or dock, be roofed, enclosed or have a second story.\n(2) Swimming pool fences. Pool security fences mandated by NC Building Code may be placed on the perimeter of the\npool at the minimum height required by code. Such fences shall be at minimum 70% transparent.\n(3) Construction of minor ornamental features.
