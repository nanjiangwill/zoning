Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Main Street\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MS\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Main Street\n(MS) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Main Street (MS). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Main Street (MS)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Main Street\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

Flags, provided that in commercial and civic zoning\ndistricts (C-15, C-56, IND, MS, CIV) they do not exceed fifty (50) square feet in size, that no more than six\n(6) flags are displayed per property, and that three (3) flagpoles be allowed at a height not to exceed fifty\n(50) feet.

Signs extending over vehicular travel areas shall maintain a minimum clear distance between\nthe finished grade surface material and any portion of the sign and its associated support structure of\nfourteen (14) feet.\n17.7-2 PERMANENT SIGN REQUIREMENTS. The following tables and text provide the design, construction,\nand dimensional requirements for permanent signs that require a permit. Requirements include copy\narea, number, type of illumination, and letter height for both attached and freestanding signs. Setback\nand height requirements are established for freestanding signs and detailed design requirements are\nprovided for monument and pole signs.\nAdditionally:\nA. Only one general attached sign (blade, V-type, or flat) is allowed per street or parking frontage.\nB. Only one monument or pole freestanding sign is allowed per street frontage.\nC. Height of freestanding signs shall be measured from the elevation of the ground at the point of\nArticle 17 - Page 3\n\n\nNEW PAGE 210\ncontact with the sign provided that the grade of the site is not artificially altered to increase the\nallowable height of the sign. For sloping sites, the applicable point of contact shall be the point\nhaving the highest elevation.\nD. One general attached sign per approved home occupation, not to exceed four square feet in area,\nand which must be attached to the building.\nE.\nChangeable copy signs are allowed as either attached or freestanding signs provided they are\nincorporated into the general or attached signage allowed for a nonresidential property and not\nmore than one such sign is allowed per occupancy.

Digitally changing signs shall have the light\nintensity of the display low enough so as not to negatively impact surrounding residents, property\nowners, or drivers of motor vehicles. Digitally changing signs that incorporate continuous or fluid\nmotion of content on the digital sign shall have the motion reasonable enough so as not to\nnegatively impact surrounding persons, distract the drivers of motor vehicles, or be confused with\nany authorized traffic sign, signal, or device.\nF.\nAll streets shall be named, and signs conforming to City standards shall be posted at intersections\nshowing the name of every street. New streets which are obviously in alignment with others already\nexisting and named shall bear the names of the existing streets where practical. In no case shall the\nnames of new streets phonetically resemble existing street names. Streets shall be named in\naccordance with the standards for street naming established by Granville County Addressing & GIS\nand must be approved by Granville County's Address Coordinator. All subdivisions requiring the\ndevelopment of new public roads within the Single Family Residential District (SFR), the Residential /\nMain Street Transitional District, and Agriculture District (AG) must be named. Subdivision names or\nidentification shall not duplicate or closely approximate phonetically the names of existing streets\nand subdivisions in the City of Creedmoor or its area of planning and zoning jurisdiction and must\nbe approved by Granville County's Address Coordinator.

The following materials are acceptable for use in pole\nsigns, singly or in combination:\n1. Wood\n2. Metal\n17.8\nTemporary Signs\nThe following sections provide the design, dimensional, and time of display requirements for temporary signs.\nAdditionally: Nonconforming temporary signs shall not be grandfathered (see section 17.12 of this Article).\n17.8-1 REQUIREMENTS FOR TEMPORARY SIGNS THAT REQUIRE A PERMIT.\nThe temporary signs listed in this section require a permit and shall comply with the indicated zoning\nlocation and other requirements.
