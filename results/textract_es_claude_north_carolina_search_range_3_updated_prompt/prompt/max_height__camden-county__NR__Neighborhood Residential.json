Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Neighborhood Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"NR\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Neighborhood Residential\n(NR) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor Neighborhood Residential (NR). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Neighborhood Residential (NR)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Neighborhood Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

The district is\nintended to accommodate single-family detached\nhomes in a neighborhood setting at moderate\ndensities. Mobile and manufactured homes on\nindividual lots, conservation subdivisions, and\nNeighborhood\nagricultural uses are limited in order to preserve the\ndistrict's neighborhood character. Manufactured\nhomes are not allowed on lots within 5,280 linear feet\nof a village center boundary. The district's 40,000-\nResidential\nsquare-foot minimum lot area may be reduced when\nlots are within one mile of a designated village center\nboundary and served by public sewer. District\nregulations discourage uses that interfere with the\ndevelopment of residential neighborhoods or that are\ndetrimental to the district's single-family detached\nneighborhood character.\nNOTES:\n[1] Maximum residential density may be increased to 1.45 units per acre on lots served by public sewer and within 5,280 linear feet of a\ndesignated village center.\nCamden County\nUnified Development Ordinance\n3-26\nLast Updated:\nAugust 1, 2022\nCELL (1, 1): \nB.\nCELL (1, 2): \nDimensional Requirements\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (2, 1): \n#\nCELL (2, 2): \nSTANDARD TYPE\nCELL (2, 3): \nREQUIREMENT\nCELL (3, 1): \nA\nCELL (3, 2): \nMaximum Residential Density (units/acre)\nCELL (3, 3): \n1.08 [1]\nCELL (4, 1): \nB\nCELL (4, 2): \nMinimum Lot Area (square feet)\nCELL (4, 3): \n40,000 [2]\nCELL (5, 1): \nC\nCELL (5, 2): \nMinimum Lot Width (feet) [3]\nCELL (5, 3): \n125 [4]\nCELL (6, 1): \nD\nCELL (6, 2): \nMaximum Lot Coverage (% of lot area)\nCELL (6, 3): \n24 [5]\nCELL (7, 1): \nE\nCELL (7, 2): \nMinimum Open Space (% of development area)\nCELL (7, 3): \n5\nCELL (8, 1): \nF\nCELL (8, 2): \nMinimum Front Setback (feet)\nCELL (8, 3): \n25 [6]\nCELL (9, 1): \nG\nCELL (9, 2): \nMinimum Corner Side Setback (feet)\nCELL (9, 3): \n25 [6]\nCELL (10, 1): \nH\nCELL (10, 2): \nMinimum Interior Side Setback (feet)\nCELL (10, 3): \n10\nCELL (11, 1): \nI\nCELL (11, 2): \nMinimum Rear Setback (feet)\nCELL (11, 3): \n10\nCELL (12, 1): \nCELL (12, 2): \nMinimum Distance Between Buildings, Front-to-Back (feet) [7]\nCELL (12, 3): \n15\nCELL (13, 1): \nK\nCELL (13, 2): \nMinimum Distance Between Buildings, Side-to-Side (feet) [7]\nCELL (13, 3): \n10\nCELL (14, 1): \nL\nCELL (14, 2): \nMinimum Accessory Building Setback (feet)\nCELL (14, 3): \n10\nCELL (15, 1): \nM\nCELL (15, 2): \nMaximum Building Height (feet)\nCELL (15, 3): \n35\n\nNEW PAGE 117\nARTICLE 151.3 Zoning Districts\nSection 3.5 Residential Districts\n3.5.5 Neighborhood Residential (NR) District\n[2] Minimum lot area may be reduced to 30,000 square feet on lots served by public sewer and located within 5,280 liner feet from a designated\nvillage center boundary.\n[3] Lots on a cul-de-sac street shall maintain a minimum frontage of 35 feet and shall maintain 80 percent of the required minimum lot width at a\npoint located 50 feet from the street right-of-way edge.\n[4] May be reduced to 100 feet on lots on lots served by public sewer and located within 5,280 feet from a designated village center boundary.\n[5] The maximum lot coverage may be increased with approval from NCDEQ and compliance with all applicable stormwater management\nrequirements.\n[6] Setbacks are increased to 50 feet for lots along an arterial street (US 17, NC 34, NC 343, Old Swamp Road, Sandy Hook Road, and the\nportion of US 158 least of the railroad tracks).\n[7] Applied in cases where there are two or more principal buildings on the same lot.\nCamden County\n3-27\nLast Updated:\nUnified Development Ordinance\nAugust 1, 2022\n\nNEW PAGE 118\nARTICLE 151.3 Zoning Districts\nSection 3.5 Residential Districts\n3.5.5 Neighborhood Residential (NR) District\nCamden County\nUnified Development Ordinance\n3-28\nLast Updated:\nAugust 1, 2022\nCELL (1, 1): \nC.\nLot Pattern Example\nCELL (1, 2): \nD.\nCELL (1, 3): \nDistrict Dimensional Standards\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (3, 1): \nE.\nPreferred Development\nExamples\nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (4, 3): \nL\nF\nH\nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nCELL (5, 3): \nB\nI\nD\nCELL (6, 1): \nCELL (6, 2): \nCELL (6, 3): \nE\n\n\nNEW PAGE 119\nARTICLE 151.3 Zoning Districts\nSection 3.5 Residential Districts\n3.5.5 Neighborhood Residential (NR) District\nF.\nDevelopment Configuration Example\nCamden County\nUnified Development Ordinance\n3-29\nLast Updated:\nAugust 1, 2022\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \nC\nF\nH\nI\nCELL (2, 2): \n\n\nNEW PAGE 120\nARTICLE 151.3 Zoning Districts\nSection 3.5 Residential Districts\n3.5.6 Village Residential (VR) District\n3.5.6.\nVILLAGE RESIDENTIAL (VR) DISTRICT\nA.\nPurpose Statement\nThe Village Residential (VR) district is established to\naccommodate a wide range of residential and institutional use\nVR\ntypes at modest densities on lots within and adjacent to\ndesignated village centers. The district allows duplexes, live/work\nunits, single-family attached, and single-family detached\ndwellings, but does not allow mobile homes, manufactured\nhomes, or conservation subdivisions. As a means of creating\nVillage\ncompact, functional neighborhoods, the district also allows a wide\nvariety of institutional uses, including community centers, day\ncare, schools, assisted living, religious institutions, parks, and\nutilities. Lots served by public sewer may have reduced minimum\nlot sizes and building height is measured from the base flood\nResidential\nelevation. District regulations are intended to support the\nCounty's investment in infrastructure by encouraging the\ndevelopment of compact, vibrant neighborhoods with a variety of\nhouse sizes and types that are located in close proximity to\ncomplementary institutional uses.
