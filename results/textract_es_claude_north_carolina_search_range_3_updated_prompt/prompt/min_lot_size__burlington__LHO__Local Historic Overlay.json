Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Local Historic Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"LHO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Local Historic Overlay\n(LHO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Local Historic Overlay (LHO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Local Historic Overlay (LHO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Local Historic Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

DETERMINATION OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP BOUNDARIES\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\nThe Planning Director shall be responsible for determination of boundaries on the Official Zoning Map in\naccordance with the standards in Section 2.4.F, Determination, and the following standards:\n1. Boundaries shown as approximately following a utility line or a street, alley, railroad, or other public\naccessway shall be interpreted as following the centerline of the right-of-way or easement for\nthe\nutility line or accessway.\n2. If a street, alley, railroad, or utility easement forming the boundary between two separate zoning\ndistricts is abandoned or removed from dedication, the district boundaries shall be construed as\nfollowing the centerline of the abandoned or vacated roadbed or utility easement.\n3. Boundaries shown as approximately following a lot line shall be interpreted as following the lot line as\nit existed when the boundary was established. If a subsequent minor adjustment (such as from\nsettlement of a boundary dispute or overlap) results in the lot line moving 10 feet or less, the zoning\nboundary shall be interpreted as moving with the lot line.\n4. Boundaries shown as approximately following a river, stream, canal, lake, or other watercourse shall\nbe interpreted as following the centerline of the watercourse as it actually exists, and as moving with\nthat centerline to the extent the watercourse moves as a result of natural processes (flooding, erosion,\nsedimentation, etc.).\n5. Boundaries shown parallel to or as extensions of features indicated in this subsection shall be\ninterpreted as such.\n6. Boundaries shown as following the boundary of the City limits shall be interpreted as following the\nboundary of municipal incorporation.\n7. Wherever a single lot is located within two or more different zoning districts, each portion of the lot\nshall be subject to all the regulations applicable to the zoning district where it is located.\n8.\nIf the specific location of a depicted boundary cannot be determined from application of the above\nstandards, it shall be determined by using the Official Zoning Map's scale to determine the boundary's\ndistance from other features shown on the map.\n9. Where the actual location of existing physical or natural features vary from that shown on the Official\nZoning Map, or in other circumstances that are not covered by this subsection, the Planning Director\nshall have the authority to determine the district boundaries.\nCity of Burlington\n3-7\nUnified Development Ordinance\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\nNEW PAGE 130\nCHAPTER 3 ZONING DISTRICTS\nSection 3.2 Official Zoning Map\n10.

REFORESTATION\nA. PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThis section is proposed to ensure that the City's jurisdiction includes areas of mature tree canopy cover\nduring and after development. These standards are further intended to:\n1. Promote sequestration of carbon dioxide through the establishment of new trees or the retention of\nexisting trees on lots following the development process;\n2. Protect species diversity and habitat through the establishment of connected or linked areas of\nprotected forest;\n3. Encourage the retention of existing trees during the development process through accelerated credit\ntowards landscaping requirements; and\n4. Establish tree protection requirements for trees voluntarily proposed for retention during the\ndevelopment process.\nB. APPLICABILITY\nUnless exempted in accordance with Section 7.2.C, Exemptions, the standards in this section shall apply\nto all lands and development, including subdivisions of land for single-family detached residential\ndwellings, in the City's jurisdiction.\nC. EXEMPTIONS\nThe following activities are exempt from the standards of this section:\n1. Activity on a bona fide farm;\n2. Tree removal associated with normal forestry activity that is conducted:\na.
