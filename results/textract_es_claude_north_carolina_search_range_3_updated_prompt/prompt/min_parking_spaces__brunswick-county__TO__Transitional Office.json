Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Transitional Office\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"TO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Transitional Office\n(TO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Transitional Office (TO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Transitional Office (TO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Transitional Office\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

Development Guidelines\nIn order to reduce the impact of development on the existing natural environment, the following guidelines apply to all activities within a CP\ndistrict. As guidelines, they provide an increased degree of flexibility.\ni. If development is anticipated to occur, the plan for such development should prioritize the preservation of natural habitat and sensitive\nenvironmental features such as large stands of trees, wetlands, Carolina Bays, pocosins, watercourses, marshes, and tidal areas.\nii. The use of Low Impact Design, stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) and other alternative construction principles is strongly\nencouraged.\niii. All site clearing and preparation, and construction activities should avoid removing existing trees and disturbing existing vegetation to\nthe extent possible.\niv. Although fencing is allowed, such fencing should be designed to allow for easy movement of wildlife. If more impervious fencing is\ndesired, it is recommended that such fencing be limited to the areas around inhabited or occupied structures so that remaining portions\nof the property allow easy movement of wildlife.\n(Ord. No. UDO-19-02, \u00a7 11, 9-19-19)\n4.7.2. MI - Military Installation\nA. Intent\n1. The purpose of the Military Installation District (MI) is to recognize the location of major single use and multiple use military facilities in\nBrunswick County.\n2. While federal government areas are not subject to local zoning and other codes, they occupy large land areas in the County. These areas\ntherefore are identified on the zoning map as a Special Purpose District to differentiate them from other areas that are covered by the\nregulations in this Ordinance.\n3. The main objective of this District is to identify specific resources not otherwise identified where protection can be considered in the public's\ninterest; identify interests relating to land use planning that impact County policy on industry, the environment and residential land uses in\ngeneral; minimize substantial development impacts of these facilities; and develop a coordinated, planning/zoning process to include all\nfederal entities.\nB. Permitted Principal Uses and Structures\nThe uses specified as permitted uses include any uses authorized by, and located in, official Military Installations of the U.S. Government.\nC. Development Coordination Required/Encouraged\n1. Notification Required\nWhen an ordinance amendment or modification would result in a rezoning or change or affect the list of permitted uses within five miles of a\nmilitary base, comments and analysis of the base commander shall be included in the consideration before making a final determination\n(N.C.G.S. 160D-601). Mailed notification shall be provided prior to any such action as specified in Section 9.1.B.3.iv.\n2. Coordination Encouraged\nIn areas of MI Districts not affected by military security in areas where commercial, residential, or mixed use developments are proposed,\nand in areas where joint public/private development may be explored, the federal government and Brunswick County is encouraged to\nestablish a coordinated planning process to achieve both federal and local benefits, to minimize development impacts, and to help meet the\nobjectives and policies of the Land Use Plan of Brunswick County\nOrd.

Overlays are zoning districts which are applied only in conjunction with a Base Zoning District, and may grant additional use and development\nrequirements upon the underlying Base Zoning Districts. The effect is to have both the Overlay and the underlying Base Zoning District\nstandards control the use and development of land placed into any Overlay.\nCommentary: Some overlays provide additional restrictions on top of the underlying base district standards, while others may provide relief\n56 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\n\nNEW PAGE 57\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nfrom certain underlying base district standards.\nB. Overlays support specific public policy objectives as are to be found in the CAMA Land Use Plan and any other adopted County land use\ndocuments.\n4.8.2. Reserved\nEditor's note- Ord. No. UDO-21-01, \u00a7 77, adopted May 17, 2021, repealed \u00a7 4.8.2, which pertained to XCZ: Conditional Zoning and derived from the March 16,\n2015 revision.\n4.8.3. AHC: Airport Height Control Overlay\nA. The Airport Height Control Overlay is intended to regulate construction and restrict the location of certain uses within proximity to an airport\ndue to the facts that:\n1. Airport hazards endanger the lives and property of users of airports and occupants and owners of property in their vicinity;\n2. The creation or establishment of an airport hazard injures the community served by the airport;\n3. In the interest of public health, safety, and general welfare, it is necessary to prevent the creation or establishment of airport hazards;\n4. The prevention of these obstructions should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of police power without\ncompensation.\nB. Standards applicable in the Airport Height Control Overlay can be obtained from the Brunswick County Planning Department or on the County's\nwebsite: www.brunswickcountync.gov.\n4.8.4. ED: Economic Development\nA. Intent\n1. The Economic Development Overlay District is intended to provide locations for a wide range of agricultural industry, light and heavy\nmanufacturing, office, institutional and research uses with no adverse impacts beyond the space occupied by the use.\n2. The Economic Development Overlay District shall only be applied to lands in close association with Major Thoroughfares and over lands in\nthe RR Rural Low Density Residential District. This District is designed to support specific public policy objectives stated in the Coastal Area\nManagement Act Land Use Plan.\nB. Application Criteria\nTen acres shall be required to initiate an Economic Development Overlay District.\nC. Applicability\nThe following standards shall apply to all development within an ED overlay district. In addition to the standards contained in this Section, all\nother provisions in this Ordinance and all other applicable laws shall apply. In cases where there is a conflict between provisions found\nelsewhere in this Ordinance and the standards of this Section, this Section shall supersede unless otherwise noted.\nD. Standards\n1. No uses shall be located in an Area of Environmental Concern, as defined by the N.C. Coastal Area Management Act.\n57 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\n\nNEW PAGE 58\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\n2.

The sign standards of the RR Districts shall apply.\n5. The Performance Standards of the C-I District shall apply.\nE. The more liberal requirements of the underlying Zoning District and of the Overlay Zoning District shall apply in any interpretive construction of\nthis Section.\n4.8.5. PD: Planned Development\nThe Planned Development option is outlined in Section 3.3.3 of this Article. PD projects are subject to the approval process in Section 3.1.6 and the\nsite plan requirements outlined in Article 6.\n4.8.6. TO: Transitional Office\nA. Purpose\nThe Transitional Office Overlay is established to allow an orderly transition of land use from residential use to relatively small-scale office use of\nlots and parcels fronting major roadways, while maintaining a predominantly residential property appearance and building scale.\nB. Designation of Transitional Office Overlay\n1. A Transitional Office Overlay may only be established as a zoning map change in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.8, Rezoning.\n2. A Transitional Office Overlay may only be established in any residential base district, and may be established over more than one residential\nbase district.\nC. Permitted Uses\n1. Any use permitted by right, subject to limitations, or through special use permit in the underlying base districts shall be allowed in the\noverlay.\n2. The following uses or use categories shall be permitted in addition to the uses permitted in the underlying residential zoning district:\ni. Upper-story residential;\nii. Medical facilities (other than hospitals);\niii. Offices;\niv. Animal hospitals and veterinary clinics (all without outdoor pens or runs). Kennels shall not be permitted in a TO unless they are\npermitted in the base district;\nV. Artist galleries and studios.\n3. No retail sales shall be permitted as a primary use in the TO overlay.\nD. Applicability\nThe following standards shall apply to all development within a TO overlay district. In addition to the standards contained in this Section, all\nother provisions in this Ordinance and all other applicable laws shall apply. In cases where there is a conflict between provisions found\nelsewhere in this Ordinance and the standards of this Section, this Section shall supersede unless otherwise noted.\nE. Development Standards\n1. New buildings in the Transitional Office Overlay shall maintain a single-family detached residential appearance and scale. Residential\nappearance and scale shall expressly include details from residential uses within 150 feet of the overlay area. Such details may include the\nfollowing features:\ni. Roof type, including extent of leaves, if any;\nii. Porches or other similar articulation of the front facade;\niii. Size, pattern and location of windows and doors; and\niv. Garage or parking location.\n2. The underlying district dimensional standards shall be met, except where expressly modified in this paragraph.\ni. The maximum length of a new building shall not exceed 80 feet.\nii. The maximum floor area of any nonresidential use in the overlay or aggregation of multiple nonresidential uses in a single building shall\nbe 10,000 square feet.\n3. All nonresidential activity (except that allowed within a residential district) shall occur within a completely enclosed building.\n4. The residential appearance of buildings shall be furthered by the retention of front lawns free of vehicle parking. All off-street parking spaces\nshall be located no closer to the principal street than the front building line, regardless of any required yard or building setback.\n( Ord.

Brunswick County has numerous waterways, marshes, Carolina Bays, pocosins, and other water courses that contribute to the County's\nscenic character and serve as a reminder of the important place these water courses hold in the County's history.\n2. The water courses are also an important natural resource and amenity to residents of and visitors to Brunswick County, and the scenic views\nassociated with these watercourses are an important attraction to residents and visitors to Brunswick County, which in large part is\neconomically dependent upon tourism.\n3.\nThe intent of the Viewshed Protection Overlay is to protect and enhance the scenic character of Brunswick County's riparian areas and water\ncourses, with the broader goal of ensuring the preservation of views from within these scenic areas as well as views of these areas from\nadjacent lands.\nB. Designation of Viewshed Protection Overlay\n1. A Viewshed Protection Overlay may only be established as a zoning map change in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.8,\nRezoning.\n2. The ordinance adopting the overlay district shall clearly designate the name and geographic limits of the watercourse to be protected (i.e.\ncan't just say Intercoastal Waterway, it must specify the extents of the district along the length of the watercourse).\n3. The following watercourses are designated (VS) Viewshed Protection Overlays:\nC. Applicability\n1. Generally, the requirements of this Viewshed Protection Overlay District apply to all structures within 300 feet of the normal high water line\nof a designated watercourse.\n2. However, the Planning Director may waive these requirements for structures related to an industrial use that is located in the RU-I or I-G\nzoning districts.\n3. These requirements shall not apply to water oriented commercial uses (see Section 5.1.4.)).\nD. Development Standards\n1. Portions of structures facing a protected watercourse that exceed 50 feet in height shall be set back a minimum of two feet for each\nadditional one foot in height above 50 feet. The Planning Director shall have the authority to determine which portions of a structure are\nconsidered to be \"facing\" the protected watercourse for the purposes of these regulations.\n2. With the exception of Water Oriented Commercial Uses (see Section 5.1.4.J), and permitted height obstructions (see Section 5.4.13.C) the\nmaximum height of any structure may not exceed 75 feet.\n4.8.8. WQP: Water Quality Protection\nA. Purpose and Intent\n1. It is the intent of Brunswick County to bolster those regulations of state and federal government as to the unique quality of the water of the\nLockwood Folly River associated with naturally occurring shellfish beds.\n2. The quality of these defined waters has been affected by such activities as forestry, farming, construction of roads, growth of towns, and\nrural and suburban residential development, as well as industrial processes associated with the fishing industry.\n3. Numerous types of water pollutants have been identified by state studies. No one or even several types or causes of such degradation have\nbeen determined as having more impact than any other.\n59 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\nCELL (1, 1): \nWatercourse\nCELL (1, 2): \nFrom\nCELL (1, 3): \nTo\nCELL (2, 1): \nName\nCELL (2, 2): \nLocation\nCELL (2, 3): \nLocation\nCELL (3, 1): \nIntracoastal Waterway (IWW)\nCELL (3, 2): \nBorder with New Hanover County\nCELL (3, 3): \nSouth Carolina State Line\nCELL (4, 1): \nLockwood Folly River\nCELL (4, 2): \nGenoes Point to Mullet Creek\nCELL (4, 3): \nTo and across the Intracoastal Water to\nSheep Island\nCELL (5, 1): \nTown Creek\nCELL (5, 2): \nUS Hwy 17\nCELL (5, 3): \nNC 133\nCELL (6, 1): \nShallotte River\nCELL (6, 2): \nUnincorporated Areas of Brunswick County\nCELL (6, 3): \n\n\nNEW PAGE 60\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n4. The intent of this Water Quality Protection District is to apply a set of regulations for water quality protection, to specifically described areas\nof land abutting a specifically described water area; which is encompassed by a line drawn to extend across the Lockwood Folly River from\nGenoe's Point to Mullet Creek, southly to and across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway.\nB. Applicability\n1. The requirements and standards of the WQP- Water Quality Protection Overlay shall apply to all lands shown on a special Zoning Overlay\nMap made a part of this District, whereby all land parcels of public record included are clearly shown. This District includes an area extending\n575' landward of the mean high water line, with any lot or parcel falling within such distance being included entirely within this overlay zone.\n2. Parcels smaller than one acre in size shall be exempt from the requirements of this Section.\n3. Such waters have been defined by the State as being those waters south from a line extending from Genoes Point to Mullet Creek, to and\nacross the Intracoastal Water to Sheep Island.\nC. Incorporation of Studies by Reference\n1. Among the specific studies establishing the WQP District have been the March, 1989 publication entitled \"Report on Coastal Resource Waters\n- Intensive Study,\" by the Division of Environmental Management, N.C. Department of Natural Resources and Community Development, and\nthe August, 1989, publication entitled \"Lockwood Folly River Basin Water Quality Evaluation Report.\" Those studies are included by reference.\n2. The State of North Carolina has concluded the quality of the waters within the boundaries of the District had so declined there could be no\nassurance the proposed regulations would result in the goal of these waters being open full seasons for shell fishing. The Environmental\nManagement Commission did, under N.C. Administrative Code, Subordinance 2B, Surface Water Standards, Monitoring, Section .0219, Water\nQuality Management Plans, sub-section (b) establish a defined area of the mouth of this river, as above described, to be protected by a\nWater Quality Management Plan with specific actions which became effective January 1, 1990, included herein by reference.\nD. Application Requirements\nApplications for all development meeting the applicability requirements in the paragraph above shall require an approved Sedimentation\nErosion Control Plan be filed.\nE. Development Standards\nAll development within a WQP- Water Quality Protection Overlay shall:\n1. Limit the built upon impervious area to no more than 25% of the lot;\n2. Provide a buffer zone of at least 30' from any wetland or water line;\n3. Limit any structures to being at least 75' from the mean high water line; and\n4. Comply with any additional standards imposed by State or Federal regulations.\n4.9 VOLUNTARY AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT PROGRAM\nCommentary: The Voluntary Agricultural District is not an overlay zoning district, and is not implemented in the same was as a zoning district would\nbe.\n4.9.1. Authority\nThe standards and provisions of this Voluntary Agricultural District Program are established pursuant to the authority conferred by G.S. 106-735\nthrough 106-743 and Chapter 160D.\n( Ord. No. UDO-21-01, \u00a7 20, 5-17-21)\n4.9.2. Purpose\nThe purpose of this Program is to promote the health, safety, rural agricultural values, and general welfare of the County, and more specifically,\nincrease identity and pride in the agricultural community, its way of life, and its importance in preserving the agrarian heritage of the county;\nencourage the economic and financial health of farming; increase protection from undesirable, non-farm development: and increase the protection\nof farms from nuisance suits anti other negative impacts on properly managed farms.\n4.9.3. Initial Participation is Voluntary\nNothing contained within this Section shall require a landowner to initiate participation in the Program. Upon participation in the Program,\ncompliance with the requirements of this Section shall be required to maintain status.\n4.9.4. Implementation of Program\nIn order to implement the purposes stated in above, this Program provides for the creation of Voluntary Agricultural Districts (VADs) as follows:\nA. Application\n60 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\nNEW PAGE 116\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\npurposes other than a mobile home park or for any industrial, institutional, governmental, or residential purpose and is located within\n300 feet of the lot line separating it from the mobile home park.\niii. Street Buffers shall be provided and maintained in accordance with 6.2.2, Landscaping and Buffering.\niv. It shall be the responsibility of the mobile home park owner to functionally maintain any required screening.\n6. Utilities\ni. Water\n(a) An accessible, adequate, safe and potable supply of water shall be required.\n(b) Where public, municipal, or community water systems exist within 1,000 feet of the park (the County Utilities Policies may require\nconnection even when separated by greater distances), the developer shall connect to such system.
