Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Industrial\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"IND\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Industrial\n(IND) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Industrial (IND). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Industrial (IND)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Industrial\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

RV's shall be licensed motor vehicles in order to be occupied and\nremain on a lot for up to ninety (90) days, but not more than twice per year.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 12 - Page 4\n\n\nNEW PAGE 293\n12.11 Off-Street Parking Lots and Access Areas for Non-residential Development\nOff-street parking is required to meet the needs of the employees, clients, and/or\ncustomers of the principal use. Due to the potential for parking areas to use a large\npercentage of a development site, efforts should be made to accurately estimate the\nparking needs of the principal use. Strategies such as shared parking and remote parking\nshould be used to maximize the use of existing parking available in the area in which a\nuse is to be located. Parking areas shall be designed to minimize breaks in the pedestrian\nenvironment along the public street and create safe and comfortable passage for\npedestrians. The following standards shall therefore be met.\n12.11-1\nLocation of Parking Lots. Parking lots shall be placed behind buildings where\npractical; persons who wish to vary from this standard will have to appeal to the\nPlanning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator. Side of the building parking will be\npermitted only as indicated by Building Type and shall be measured along the build-\nto line. Off-street parking is not permitted in front of the primary building facade,\nexcept where specified in an adopted street section, detailed as a public plaza, or as\napproved by the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator as part of site plan\nreview and approval.\n12.11-2\nLimitation on Uninterrupted Areas of Parking. Uninterrupted areas of parking lot\nshall be limited in size. Large parking lots shall be broken by buildings and/or\nlandscape features. See Figure 12.11-2 below:\nFigure 12.11-2: Example of parking lot broken up by landscaping.\n12.11-3\nEnclosure of Parking Lots. Parking lots shall be enclosed by tree planting and/or\nbuilding walls(s). Plantings shall be in accordance with the provisions of Article 11,\nsee 11.6-4. For small lots (thirty-six spaces or less), landscaping shall be required at\nthe perimeter; for large lots (more than thirty-six spaces), landscaping shall be at the\nperimeter and placed to break the lot into parking areas of no more than thirty-six\nspaces.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 12 - Page 5\n\n\nNEW PAGE 294\n12.11-4\nPedestrian Corridors. Parking lots shall be designed to allow pedestrians to safely\nmove from their vehicles to the building. On small lots, this may be achieved by\nproviding a sidewalk at the perimeter of the lot. On larger lots, corridors within the\nparking area should channel pedestrians from the car to the perimeter of the lot or to\nthe building(s). These corridors should be delineated by a paving material which\ndiffers from that of vehicular areas and planted to provide shade and an edge. Small\nposts or bollards may be used to define/protect the pedestrian corridors. The\nminimum width of the sidewalk or pedestrian corridor shall be five (5) feet, with\nvehicle encroachment calculated as extending two (2) feet beyond curb or wheel stop.\n12.11-5\nDriveway Width. To maintain pedestrian comfort and calm the speed of entering\ntraffic, driveways to parking areas should be no wider than 24 feet. Driveways\nconnecting to state roads shall meet the requirements of the NC Department of\nTransportation.\n12.11-6\nInterconnection of Parking Lots. To the extent practicable, adjoining parking lots\nserving non-residential buildings shall be interconnected. When vehicular\nconnections are not practical, pedestrian walkways shall be provided to enable\npedestrian connections between parking lots.\n12.11-7\nPaving of Parking Lots. All commercial driveway and parking areas shall be\npaved with asphalt, concrete, pervious pavement and/or pavers, or brick pavers except\nfor areas used for overflow, special events, and peak parking. Any non-paved surface\nused for overflow, special events, and peak parking that cannot be maintained with\nhealthy, living turf grass or similar ground cover shall be paved with asphalt,\nconcrete, pervious pavement and/or pavers, or brick pavers. Paving shall not be\nrequired for.\n(1.) Overflow parking facilities for religious institutions, private clubs, lodges, or\nother similar nonprofit organizations.\n(2.) Parking areas for agricultural uses in the Agricultural (AG) District.\n(3.) Parking areas for manufacturing and industrial uses in the Industrial (IND)\nDistrict provided they are constructed with an all-weather surface.\n(4.) Parking areas for tracked heavy construction equipment, skid-mounted equipment\nand similar equipment, provided they are constructed with an all weather surface.\nFor paved parking areas, curb and gutter or an equivalent drainage system shall be\nprovided along the periphery of the parking lot, except where it is determined by the\nPlanning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator that such system is not practical for\nstorm drainage and/or water quality purposes. Access drives shall be paved and\nmaintained free from defects from the curb-line to a point at least ten (10) feet beyond\nthe public right-of-way line for all parking and loading facilities, whether paved or\nunpaved.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 12 - Page 6\n\n\nNEW PAGE 295\n12.11-8\nMinimize Dust and Erosion. All parking areas shall be graded, properly drained,\nstabilized, and maintained to minimize dust and erosion.\n12.11-9\nMarking of Parking Spaces. All parking spaces and stacking lanes shall be clearly\nidentified with paint lines, bumper guards, curbs, or similar treatment.\n12.11-10\nWheel Guards or Curbs Required. All parking spaces abutting the perimeter or a\nlandscape island shall be provided with wheel guards or curbs located SO that no part\nof the parking vehicle will extend beyond the property line or encroach into a\nrequired planting area.\n12.11-11\nReduction in Number of Spaces. Unless there is a change in use requiring a lesser\nnumber of spaces, the number of spaces shall not be reduced below the minimum\nrequirements of this Article except as provided for in Section 12.6 (Requirements for\nChange in Use).\n12.11-12\nParking Space Dimension. The minimum size for parking spaces shall be 11 feet\nby 20 feet as shown in the Coats Technical Standards & Specifications Manual.\n12.11-13 Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) Charging Stations. Hotels and/or motels shall\nprovide PEV charging stations within designated parking spaces for a minimum\nnumber equal to four percent (4%) of all guest rooms.\n12.11-14 Lighting and Illumination. All light fixtures (freestanding, flood, or any other\nform of light fixture) shall be provided with full cut-off fixtures, visors, or any other\nsuitable directional control to direct light either downward or directly on the\nappropriate building. Wall pack lighting is not permitted.\nNo light fixture shall create any glare or spillover lighting effects on any residential\nproperties or streets.\nFreestanding light fixtures along all public residential street systems and all internal\nprivately maintained street systems shall not exceed nineteen feet in total mounted\nheight and shall consist of a decorative fixture that shields the source of light away\nfrom neighboring properties. Residential streets shall utilize the Open Traditional\ndesign on a 12' black finished type \"A\" fiberglass pole.\nLighting located within parking lots may not exceed thirty-three feet in total mounted\nheight. Parking lot lighting shall consist of a fixture that shields the source of light\naway from neighboring properties and direct the illumination to the ground's surface.\nLighting installations should include timers, dimmers, and /or sensors to reduce\noverall energy consumption and unnecessary lighting.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 12 - Page 7\n\nNEW PAGE 296\nLighting levels for canopies and awnings of commercial facilities shall be adequate\nonly to facilitate the activities taking place in such locations and shall not be used to\nattract attention to the businesses. Lighting fixtures mounted on canopies shall be\nrecessed SO that the light's lens cover is recessed or flush with the bottom surface\n(ceiling) of the canopy and/or shielded by the fixture or the edge of the canopy SO that\nlight is restrained. Canopies shall be constructed of non-light-emitting material.\n12.12 Off-Street Parking Requirements and Bicycle Alternative as an Incentive\nWhile on-street parking can contribute substantially to everyday parking needs, sufficient\noff-street parking must also be provided to serve the particular needs of the building(s).\nThe following minimum and maximum requirements for off-street parking are set forth in\nTable 12-1 to ensure the provision of adequate off-street parking while preventing the\ndevelopment of parking areas that are under used.\nMinimum required parking spaces can be reduced by twelve percent (12%) where fully\nenclosed bicycle lockers are provided on a one-for-one exchange ratio, except for single\nfamily detached dwellings.\nFor any use not specifically listed in Table 12-1, the parking, stacking and loading\nrequirements shall be those of the most similar use characteristic.\nTable 12-1\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 12 - Page 8\nCELL (1, 1): \nType of Land Use\nCELL (1, 2): \nOff-street Parking Spaces to be Provided:\nCELL (1, 3): \nOff-street Parking Spaces to be Provided:\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nMinimum\nCELL (2, 3): \nMaximum\nCELL (3, 1): \nResidential\nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (4, 1): \nAccessory dwelling unit\nCELL (4, 2): \n1\nCELL (4, 3): \n2\nCELL (5, 1): \nDwellings, multi-family with 2\nbedrooms or less\nCELL (5, 2): \n1 per unit\nCELL (5, 3): \n2 per unit\nCELL (6, 1): \nDwellings, multi-family with 3\nbedrooms or more\nCELL (6, 2): \n2 per unit\nCELL (6, 3): \n3 per unit\nCELL (7, 1): \nDwellings, attached age\nrestricted\nCELL (7, 2): \n0.75 per unit\nCELL (7, 3): \n1.5 per unit\nCELL (8, 1): \nDwellings, single-family\ndetached and attached with 2\nbedrooms or less\nCELL (8, 2): \n1 per unit\nCELL (8, 3): \nnot applicable\nCELL (9, 1): \nDwellings, single-family\ndetached and attached with 3\nCELL (9, 2): \n2 per unit\nCELL (9, 3): \nnot applicable\n\n\n Output:"}]}
