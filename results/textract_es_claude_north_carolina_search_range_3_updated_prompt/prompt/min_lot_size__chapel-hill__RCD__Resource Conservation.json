Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Resource Conservation\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"RCD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Resource Conservation\n(RCD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Resource Conservation (RCD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Resource Conservation (RCD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Resource Conservation\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

The town encourages cluster developments as defined in Appendix A [Definitions]. Cluster developments, as defined in Appendix A [Definitions], require modification of lot size\nstandards; individual lots may be somewhat smaller but the sum of reductions in lot area becomes common recreation area for the benefit of all residents of the cluster development. The\nrecreation area is increased and the intensity of development is controlled. Cluster developments also allow the developer greater design flexibility and will permit reasonable use of land with\ndifficult topography.\n(b) Approval requirements. The town council may approve a cluster development in any residential district, or the HR-L or HR-M Special Districts, if it finds that:\n(1) The tract proposed for cluster development is at least two (2) acres in size.\n(2) Public, separate, water supply and sewerage connections are available for every subdivided lot.\n(3)\nThe total number of lots proposed for the tract, excluding parcels of reserved recreation area, is not greater than the number determined by multiplying the total gross land area by the\nmaximum density established in section 3.8 for that zoning district.\n(4) The recreation area reserved within the tract shall conform to the recreation area standards of section 5.5.\n(5) The minimum amount of land reserved as recreation area shall be the sum of all reductions in minimum gross land area as a result of the cluster form of development, combined with the\nminimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5. Only the minimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5 may be dedicated outside the boundaries of the land being\nsubdivided as specified in section 5.5.2.\n(c)\nReductions in lot and setback requirements. For lots created as part of a cluster development, minimum gross land area, minimum lot width, and minimum setback requirements may be reduced\nas follows:\n(1) Minimum lot size requirements specified in section 3.8 may be reduced to five thousand, five hundred (5,500) square feet gross land area.\n(2) Minimum lot width requirements specified in section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to fifty (50) feet.\n(3) Minimum street setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the street lot line forms an exterior boundary of the cluster development.\n(4)\nMinimum interior setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to eight (8) feet except where the interior lot line\nforms a boundary of the cluster development.\n(5) Minimum solar setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the north lot line forms\na\nboundary of the cluster development.\n(d) Floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations. For lots created as part of a cluster development, floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations, as shown in Table 3.8-1, shall be\ncalculated using the gross land area of the lot or the minimum lot size for the zoning district, whichever is greater.\n(Ord.

This section promotes the public health, safety and welfare of the town by promoting housing of high quality located in neighborhoods throughout the community for households of\na\nvariety of income levels, ages and sizes in order to meet the town's goal of preserving and promoting a culturally and economically diverse population in our community.\nBased upon the review and consideration of reports and analyses of the housing supply in the town, the town finds and determines that the diversity of its housing stock has declined for many reasons\nincluding increasing property values and construction costs. The town recognizes the need to provide affordable housing to households of a broad range of income levels in order to maintain a diverse\npopulation and to provide housing for those who live or work in the town. Without intervention, the trend toward rising housing prices will result in an increasingly inadequate supply of affordable housing\nfor town residents and local employees, which will have a negative impact upon the ability of local employers to maintain an adequate local work force and will otherwise be detrimental to the public health,\nsafety and welfare of the town and its residents. Since the remaining land appropriate for new residential development within the town is limited, it is essential that a reasonable proportion of such land be\ndeveloped into housing units affordable to low- and moderate-income households and working families. The town finds and determines that additional market rate development would displace and\neliminate opportunities for additional affordable housing in the town unless the restrictions on use established by this section are included. This displacement would create the following threats to the\nhealth, safety, or the general welfare of the community:\nIncreases in travel time and distances for persons who provide services or are employed in the town, but who cannot find decent, affordable shelter, which in turn increases traffic congestion,\nreduces air and water quality, and has an adverse impact on public health resulting from excessive commuting; and\nAn imbalance in population diversity; and\nInconsistency with the vision for future development and the specific policies of the town's comprehensive plan.\nThe regulations set forth in this section further a key goal of the town's comprehensive plan: to create and preserve affordable housing opportunities. The regulations also support other goals of the\ntown including the reduction of traffic congestion and associated air pollution; and the prevention of sprawl through the maintenance of the urban services boundary. Documentation exists demonstrating\nthat the construction of residential dwelling units in Chapel Hill generates need for affordable housing for workers and families. These regulations are intended to provide a structure for cooperative\nparticipation by the public and private sectors in the production of affordable housing.\n3.10.1 Applicability and Minimum Project Size.\n(a) Single-family and two-family units. This section applies to all development that includes:\n(1) At least five (5) single-family dwelling units or two-family dwelling units; or\n(2) At least five (5) single-family lots; or\n(3) Two-family lots in which six (6) or more residential units are allowed by the Chapel Hill Land Use Management Ordinance, either individually or as part of the same subdivision.\n(b) Multifamily units. This section applies to all development that includes:\n(1) New development that creates at least five (5) multifamily dwelling units; or\n(2) Any vertical mixed use building that creates at least five (5) multifamily dwelling units; or\n(3) Renovation or reconstruction of an existing building that contains multifamily dwelling units, and that increases the number of dwelling units from the number of dwelling units in the original\nstructure by at least five (5); or\n(4) Any change in use of all or part of an existing building from a nonresidential use to a residential use that has at least five (5) dwelling units.\n3.10.2 Affordable Dwelling Units or Lots Required.\n(a) General requirement.
