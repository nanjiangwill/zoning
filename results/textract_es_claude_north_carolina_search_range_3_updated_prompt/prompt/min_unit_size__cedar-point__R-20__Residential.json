Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-20\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Residential\n(R-20) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Residential (R-20). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Residential (R-20)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 74\nArticle 4 Zoning Districts\n4.5 Commercial Zoning Districts\n4.5.4.\nSpecial Standards in the R-20 Zoning District\nD.\nOpen Space\nOpen space requirements for the residential portion of a multifamily or mixed commercial-residential\nproject shall be the same and conform to the requirements for multifamily developments in the MR-\n4-12\nCELL (1, 1):\nUse\nCELL (1, 2):\nDistrict\nCELL (1, 3):\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 4):\nMinimum\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 5):\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 6):\nMinimum\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 7):\nCELL (1, 8):\nYard\n(ft.)\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (2, 1):\nCELL (2, 2):\nCELL (2, 3):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 4):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 5):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 6):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 7):\nFront\nCELL (2, 8):\nRear\nCELL (2, 9):\nSide\nCELL (3, 1):\nAll residential, except\nCELL (3, 2):\nR-20\nCELL (3, 3):\n60\nCELL (3, 4):\n60\nCELL (3, 5):\n6,000\nCELL (3, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (3, 7):\n25\u00b3\nCELL (3, 8):\n63\nCELL (3, 9):\n51,2\nCELL (4, 1):\nmultifamily\nCELL (4, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (4, 3):\n75\nCELL (4, 4):\n75\nCELL (4, 5):\n7,500\nCELL (4, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (4, 7):\n253\nCELL (4, 8):\n253\nCELL (4, 9):\n102\nCELL (5, 1):\nMultifamily/ Mixed\nCELL (5, 2):\nR-20\nCELL (5, 3):\n100\nCELL (5, 4):\n150\nCELL (5, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (5, 6):\n15,000\nCELL (5, 7):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 8):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 9):\nCELL (6, 1):\ncommercial- residential\nCELL (6, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (6, 3):\n100\nCELL (6, 4):\n100\nCELL (6, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (6, 6):\n7,000\nCELL (6, 7):\nCELL (6, 8):\nCELL (6, 9):\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"CELL (2, 5):\\nWith\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 5):\\n6,000\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (2, 6):\\nWithout\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 6):\\n10,000\" 74]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"For district R-20, the section provides the information for min_unit_size.

PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Town of Cedar Point Planning Board and Board of Commissioners deem it\nnecessary and desirable in the interest of public health, safety, and general welfare\nto enact regulations for the preservation, planting, and replacement of trees and\nshrubbery and to prevent the indiscriminate pruning and removal of trees in the\ntown's jurisdictional area without denying the reasonable use and enjoyment of real\nproperty. The importance of trees and shrubbery is recognized for their shade,\ncooling, noise and wind reduction, soil erosion prevention, oxygen production, dust\nfiltration, carbon dioxide absorption, aesthetic and economic enhancement of all real\nproperty and their contribution to the general well-being of the citizens of the town.\nFurthermore, this section is intended to:\n1. Regulate and control the planting of trees and shrubbery on town property,\ndeveloping private property to include commercial, industrial, and multi-family\nresidential developments, and property clearing.\n2. To conserve energy and retard storm-water runoff while aiding in noise, glare,\nand heat abatement.\n3. To safeguard and enhance property value, to protect public and private investment\nthrough the protection of significant existing trees.\n4. To provide visual buffering and enhance town beautification through landscaping\nstandards.\n5. To prevent the indiscriminate removal of trees and facilitate their replacement on\npublic and private property for new and expanding developments.\nB. EXEMPTIONS\n1. The Board of Commissioners or Town Manager may waive the requirements of\nthis section during an emergency such as a hurricane, tornado, windstorm, tropical\nstorm, flood, or other acts of God, following an on-site review.\n2. The Town of Cedar Point shall have the authority to maintain trees and shrubbery\nplanted on public rights-of-way or public property.\n3. Utility companies, electric suppliers, and governmental agencies in the course of\nconstructing or maintaining easements for water, sewer, electric, gas, drainage,\ntelephone or television transmissions, or rights-of-way shall be exempt from the\nprovisions of this Ordinance.\nC. TREE PLANTING ON PUBLIC PROPERTY\nThe town encourages the planting of trees and other approved vegetation by private\nindividuals, groups, and businesses on public property and along street rights-of-\nway. However, to obtain maximum benefit from those efforts, all plantings on public\nrights-of-ways or public property owned by the town, its agents, boards, or\ncommissions shall be done in accordance with predetermined guidelines set forth in\nthis Chapter and approved by the Town Manager utilizing such professional criteria\nand technical assistance as deemed necessary.\nD. TREES AND SHRUBBERY IN OR ALONG STREETS AND SIDEWALKS\n1. Citizens may plant trees in front of their lots and along the sidewalks adjacent to\nPage I 135\n\n\nNEW PAGE 136\ntheir property under the supervision of the Town Manager or his/her designee, but\nno trees or other plantings shall be planted in the streets, gutters, or ditches of the\ntown. The Town Manager shall notify all persons having trees in front of their lots\nto have them properly trimmed either by a company engaged in the business of\ntree trimming or by the property owners themselves. During normal street right-\nof-way maintenance by the Public Works Department, all town employees\ninvolved in trimming of trees shall operate under the direction of the Town\nManager or his/her designee. In addition, all other public service or utility\ncompanies shall notify the town prior to maintenance within the jurisdiction.\n2. The cutting, trimming, destruction, lopping of branches of any manner of trees or\nshrubbery standing along, in, or extending over the street right-of-way of any\nmunicipal or state-maintained street by any person is hereby prohibited, except\nwhen done under the supervision and according to the direction of the Town\nManager or his/her designee.\nE. STREET YARD LANDSCAPING\n1. A street yard must be provided for new construction of principal structures, for\nexpansions to such structures, for changes of use, or whenever additional off-\nstreet parking is required. However, no such street yard improvements shall be\nrequired for those portions of lot frontage used for driveways.\n2. Street yards shall be landscaped as follows:\n(a)\nMinimum Standards - For every twenty-five (25) linear feet of frontage, or\nfraction thereof, the street yard shall contain one (1) tree, minimum two (2)\ninch caliper at planting; OR three (3) flowering trees, minimum one (1) inch\ncaliper at planting.\n(b)\nCreative standards - To promote creative designs, street yards may consist\nof trees and shrubbery, which cover at least fifty (50) percent of its area and\nare selected in accordance with Appendix B.\n(c) For new construction of principal structures, the minimum depth of the\nstreet yard landscaping area shall not be less than fifteen feet (15') and shall\nbe located within the Front Yard.\n3. No more than fifteen (15) percent of the required street yard shall be covered with\nan impervious surface. This portion of the street yard may be used for walkways,\nfountains, walls, or fences, but not for parking or storage.\n4. If there are existing trees in the proposed street yard area, the Town Manager or\nhis/her designee may grant credit toward meeting the requirements for\npreservation of those trees provided their DBH is at least two (2) inches.\n5. All street yards and buffers shall be landscaped with a combination of live\nvegetation, groundcover, grass, trees, and/or shrubs. The Town Manager or\nhis/her designee shall utilize such professional criteria and technical assistance as\ndeemed necessary to maintain continual growth of plantings.\nF. LANDSCAPING FOR OTHER COMMERCIAL CHANGES\n1.\nFor changes in use, expansions to existing commercial principal structures, or for\nrenovations to existing commercial principal structures, Table 7.4-1 shall be\nutilized in calculating the minimum amount of landscaping required for the\nPage 136\n\n\nNEW PAGE 137\npreviously developed portions of the site. All newly developed portions of the site\nshall be subject to the full landscaping requirements of this section.\n2. When division of previously developed property occurs and a building permit for\nnew construction is requested for any newly created tract within two (2) years of\nthe effective date of the recordation, all parcels of the original tract shall be subject\nto the above provisions for expansions to existing structures or uses.\n3. For consecutive expansion occurring within a two-year period, the amount of the\nexpansions shall be summed and the maximum landscaping requirements for the\ntotal extent of the expansions shall be provided.\n4. Notwithstanding the above requirements, expansions to existing structures or uses\namounting to not more than a total increase of five hundred (500) square feet in\ngross floor area over a two-year period shall be exempted from meeting the street-\nyard and parking facility landscaping requirements.\n5.\nWhere the street yard depth requirement listed in Table 7.4-1 cannot be complied\nwith due the presence of an existing building not proposed for removal, only the\narea where the building exists is exempt from the requirement specified.\nPage\nI\n137\nCELL (1, 1): \nTable 7.4-1\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCommercial Change\nCELL (2, 2): \nTree\nPreservation\nCELL (2, 3): \nStreet Yard\nDepth\nCELL (2, 4): \nParking Facilities Landscaping\n(% of gross paved area of\nparking facility)\nCELL (3, 1): \nChange in use, 10-25% increase in gross\nfloor area or 5-20 new parking spaces as\nrequired by zoning ordinance, whichever is\nmore restrictive\nCELL (3, 2): \n15/acre\nCELL (3, 3): \n10 feet\nCELL (3, 4): \n4%\nCELL (4, 1): \n26-50% increase in gross floor area; or over\n10,000 sq. ft. increase in gross floor area; or\n21-50 new parking spaces as required by\nzoning ordinance, whichever is more\nrestrictive.\nCELL (4, 2): \n15/acre\nCELL (4, 3): \n12 feet\nCELL (4, 4): \n6%\nCELL (5, 1): \nGreater than 50% increase in gross floor\narea; or over 20,000 sq. ft. increase in gross\nfloor area; or more than 50 new parking\nspaces required by zoning ordinance,\nwhichever is more restrictive\nCELL (5, 2): \n15/acre\nCELL (5, 3): \n15 feet\nCELL (5, 4): \n8%\n\nNEW PAGE 138\nG. TREE PROTECTION STANDARDS\nConstruction activities under the drip line of a protected tree are prohibited within\nthe Town of Cedar Point Zoning Jurisdiction.\n1. PURPOSE AND INTENT\nIt is the intent of this section to protect and promote the public health, safety, and\ngeneral welfare by requiring the preservation, maintenance, and protection of the\ntree coverage area. Preservation of the tree coverage area helps to reduce carbon\nemissions and decrease the urban \"heat-island\" effect.\n2. APPLICABILITY\nEvery application for a site plan or grading plan, or any modification to any of the\nlisted permit types shall provide a tree inventory and protection plan. This plan\nshall also be included in the grading plan of the construction drawings for any of\nthe review types listed. Applicants submitting a grading plan as part of a Zoning\nCompliance Permit application where no building or structure is proposed shall\nalso provide a tree inventory and protection plan.\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n(a)\nGrading and tree protection plans shall indicate the limits of the area to be\ndisturbed. This limit shall be marked in the field with tree protection fencing\nand signs and shall be verified by the Town Manager before grading work\nbegins.\n(b) Tree inventories shall identify all canopy trees on site including the diameter\n(dbh) and species. Plans shall clearly indicate the trees to be removed and\nthose to remain.\n(c)\nFor sites exceeding 20 acres, the applicant may provide 100' X 100' sample\nsurvey areas for each separate undisturbed portion of the site containing an\nacre or more.\n(d)\nWhen an application only approves the installation of infrastructure for a site\nand the creation of lots for single-family residential development, survey\ndata is required within the disturbed areas of the site.\n(e)\nApplications shall clearly state, in table form:\ni.\nthe number of canopy trees to be removed\nii.\nan estimate of the number of canopy trees being retained\niii.\nthe number of trees 24\" or greater dbh to be removed\niv.\nthe percentage of tree cover area before development\nV.\nthe percentage of tree cover area after development.\nvi.\nFor each 24\" or greater tree proposed for removal, the applicant shall\nindicate all design alternatives considered to allow the retention of the\ntree.\nvii.\nA tree protection plan will show the tree coverage area before\ndevelopment and shall indicate which method was used to calculate the\ntree coverage area.\n4. STANDARDS\n(a)\nApplications shall clearly state the number of canopy trees to be removed,\nalong with an estimate of the number being retained on site.\n(b) Applications shall also include a calculation of percentage of the site\nPage\n138\n\n\nNEW PAGE 139\ncovered by tree coverage area before and after development.\n(c) For sites with existing, pre-development tree coverage area that covers 25%\nor less of the site, it is expected that the developed condition of the site shall\nnot reduce this percentage.\n(d)\nFor sites with existing, pre-development tree coverage area that covers more\nthan 25% but less than 50% of the site, maintenance of the tree coverage\narea is required.\n(e)\nFor sites with existing pre-development tree coverage area that covers more\nthan 50% of the site, some reduction of that percentage may be approved by\nthe permit issuing authority.\n5.

For\nuses that exceed 10,000 square feet, a standard loading dock shall be provided.\nF. PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING REQUIREMENTS\nSubject to other standards outlined within this Ordinance, including Section 7.3\nBUFFERS, all required parking areas shall be required to adhere to the following\nadditional interior buffering requirements:\n1. For every ten (10) required parking spaces, there shall be an area within the\nparking lot four hundred (400) square feet in area either left in a natural vegetative\nstate or planted with trees and shrubs. Exception: medical facility parking lots\nmay be as obstruction free and conducive to water, ice and debris minimization\nand removal as practicable. Landscaping within parking areas, particularly, but\nnot limited to, independent internal vegetated islands that may interfere with\naccess is therefore not required.\n2. For commercial/industrial land uses that, due to their overall size, are required to\nprovide more than fifty (50) parking spaces to support the proposed land use, the\nTown of Cedar Point shall allow for a reduction in the number of required parking\nspaces based on the following incentive plan:\n(a)\nRequired Parking spaces may be reduced by ten (10) percent if there is an\nadditional one thousand (1,000) square feet of land area within the required\nparking lot dedicated as interior buffer space;\n(b)\nRequired parking spaces may be reduced by twenty (20) percent if there is\nan additional three thousand (3,000) square feet of land area within the\nrequired parking lot dedicated as interior buffering space;\n(c) Required parking spaces may be reduced by thirty (30) percent if there is an\nadditional five thousand (5,000) square feet of land area within the required\nparking lot dedicated as interior buffering space;\n(d)\nThese allowances shall be in addition to the mandatory buffering\nrequirements outlined within this section\n3. The maintenance and upkeep of all interior buffer areas shall be the responsibility\nof the property owner.\n4. Unless deemed improbable by the Cedar Point Planning Board, all interior buffer\nareas shall be used as bio-retention storm water devices not to be included as part\nof the overall storm water retention for the project.\n5.\nAt least fifty (50) percent of the trees planted shall be of a shade/canopy species\nas referenced in Appendix B and other vegetation that may be suitable for the area\nper Cedar Point Planning Board and other technical assistance personnel as\ndeemed necessary.\n6. In support of the above, the following standards shall apply to interior plantings:\n(a) All plantings shall be evenly distributed throughout the parking facility.\n(b) All interior plantings shall be curbed or otherwise physically protected.\nWhen practical, interior planting areas should be used as storm water\ndevices. This can be accomplished with inverted curb sections, grates,\npipes, etc.\n(c) Consecutive parking spaces shall incorporate landscape peninsulas no more\nPage\n185\n\n\nNEW PAGE 186\nthan fifteen (15) spaces apart and at least the ends of all parking rows.\nPeninsulas shall contain at least one hundred (100) square feet in area and\nat least eight (8) feet in width, measured from back of curb/barrier to back\nof curb/barrier.\n7. For every protected tree, as defined in Section 7.4, which is retained in a parking\nfacility and/or street yard in addition to the requirements of Sections 7.4.E and\n7.5.I., a reduction to the interior planting requirement fifteen percent (15%) may\nbe allowed. The reduction shall be limited to a maximum credit of four (4)\nprotected trees retained.\n8. When a parking facility is within fifty (50) feet of the public right-of-way a\nperimeter planted strip shall be installed, consisting of a buffer (three feet or less\nin height) incorporated into the street-yard.\n9. The Board of Commissioners may waive all or part of the requirements of this\nsection for any facility, which is limited to periodic or intermittent use for\nvehicular parking, such as parking lots for churches or recreational facilities,\nprovided the facility is completely covered by grass or otherwise presents a\nlandscaped effect.\n10. The Board of Commissioners may waive the requirements of this section for\ntemporary parking lots when determined that a waiver is necessary to relieve\nhardship and will not violate the purposes of this section. Any such waiver shall\nnot exceed one year.\n7.14\nPOSTING REQUIREMENTS FOR STRUCTURES\nA. PURPOSE AND INTENT\nIt is the general purpose and intent of this section to protect and promote the public\nhealth, safety, and general welfare by requiring the posting of the correct and current\n911-address on each structure or residence.\nB. APPLICABILITY\nAll new and existing residential and non-residential structures must meet the\nrequirements of this section.\nC.
