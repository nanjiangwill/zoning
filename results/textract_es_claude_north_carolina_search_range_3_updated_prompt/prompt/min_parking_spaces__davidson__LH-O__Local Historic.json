Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Local Historic\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"LH-O\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Local Historic\n(LH-O) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Local Historic (LH-O). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Local Historic (LH-O)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Local Historic\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

An\naccessory structure is smaller in area, extent, or purpose than the principal use or\nprincipal structure. Accessory structures are permitted as established in the respective\nplanning areas in Section 2 provided they meet the specific standards set forth in this\nsection. Lots within the Rural Planning Area that are part of an approved master plan are\nsubject to all applicable ordinance requirements and are not eligible for the exceptions\ngranted to individually-developed lots located within the Rural Planning Area.\nFor the purposes of this ordinance, the establishment or construction of an accessory\nstructure on an existing lot shall be considered an expansion of an existing use and/or\nstructure and shall be subject to the approval procedures found in Section 14.\nA.

All accessory structures ancillary to non-residential building types or multi-family\nbuilding types shall be reviewed by the Design Review Board, in accordance with the\nprocedures in Section 14. Additionally, certain residential accessory structures may\nrequire review by the Design Review Board or Historic Preservation Commission if\nthey are located in certain historic districts and/or not subject to the North Carolina\nResidential Code for One and Two-Family Dwellings. See G.G. 160D for a full list of\nexceptions.\n3.

In all other circumstances, the minimum side yard setback shall be\nfive feet and the minimum rear yard setback shall be five feet.\n5.\nExceptions or minor variations to the accessory structure location regulations may\nbe permitted with the approval of the Planning Director. Such provision will only be\nfor extraordinary site conditions.\n6. Pools must be located in the rear yard only. Pools must also be at least 5 feet from\nthe property line. All pools must meet Mecklenburg County's rules governing\nswimming pools.\nD. Detached garages\n1.
