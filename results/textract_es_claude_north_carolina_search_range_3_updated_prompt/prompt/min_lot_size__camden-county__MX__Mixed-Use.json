Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Mixed-Use\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MX\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Mixed-Use\n(MX) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Mixed-Use (MX). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Mixed-Use (MX)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Mixed-Use\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists.

The district is intended to foster\nfunctional neighborhoods where County residents and visitors can live,\nwork, shop, and recreate without travelling large distances between\ndiffering uses. Buildings are built close to the sidewalk and one another\nMX\nand served by public gathering areas that create places for people to\ncongregate and interact. Off-street parking and service areas are located\nto the sides and rears of buildings to help ensure a continuity of building\nfacades along street edges and to avoid areas that are unsafe or\nundesirable for pedestrians. The district encourages a fine-grained\nMixed Use\nnetwork of streets and pedestrian ways that allow a wide freedom of\nmovement and choices in transportation mode. Uses are located in close\nproximity to one another and rely on design techniques to maintain\ncompatibility instead of large yards, deep setbacks, and suburban-style\nvegetative buffers. The district allows a wide variety of housing types to\npromote population density and to support nearby retail, dining, and\nentertainment establishments. The district discourages the establishment\nof single-use, monolithic, and automobile-oriented forms of development\nthat require large areas of off-street parking, large floorplates, or that fail\nto cater to pedestrians.\nCamden County\n3-44\nLast Updated:\nUnified Development Ordinance\nAugust 1, 2022\nCELL (1, 1): \nB.\nCELL (1, 2): \nDimensional Requirements\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nREQUIREMENT\nCELL (2, 5): \nCELL (3, 1): \n#\nCELL (3, 2): \nSTANDARD TYPE\nCELL (3, 3): \nRESIDENTIAL\nDEVELOPMENT\nCELL (3, 4): \nMIXED-USE\nDEVELOPMENT\nCELL (3, 5): \nNONRESIDENTIAL\nDEVELOPMENT\nCELL (4, 1): \nA\nCELL (4, 2): \nMaximum Residential Density (units/acre)\nCELL (4, 3): \n4.35\nCELL (4, 4): \n5.44\nCELL (4, 5): \nN/A\nCELL (5, 1): \nB\nCELL (5, 2): \nMinimum Lot Area (square feet)\nCELL (5, 3): \n10,000 per unit\nCELL (5, 4): \nCELL (5, 5): \n40,000\nCELL (6, 1): \nC\nCELL (6, 2): \nMinimum Lot Width (feet)\nCELL (6, 3): \n60 [1]\nCELL (6, 4): \n50\nCELL (6, 5): \n75\nCELL (7, 1): \nD\nCELL (7, 2): \nMaximum Lot Coverage (% of lot area) [2]\nCELL (7, 3): \n24\nCELL (7, 4): \n40\nCELL (7, 5): \n24\nCELL (8, 1): \nE\nCELL (8, 2): \nMinimum Open Space (% of development area)\nCELL (8, 3): \nCELL (8, 4): \n15\nCELL (8, 5): \nCELL (9, 1): \nF\nCELL (9, 2): \nMinimum Front Setback (feet) [3]\nCELL (9, 3): \n10 [4]\nCELL (9, 4): \nNone\nCELL (9, 5): \nNone\nCELL (10, 1): \nG\nCELL (10, 2): \nMaximum Front Setback (feet) [3]\nCELL (10, 3): \n20\nCELL (10, 4): \n10\nCELL (10, 5): \n20\nCELL (11, 1): \nH\nCELL (11, 2): \nMinimum Corner Side Setback (feet) [3]\nCELL (11, 3): \n15\nCELL (11, 4): \n10\nCELL (11, 5): \n10\nCELL (12, 1): \nI\nCELL (12, 2): \nMinimum Interior Side Setback (feet) [5]\nCELL (12, 3): \n10\nCELL (12, 4): \n5; 10 from residential development\nCELL (12, 5): \n5; 10 from residential development\nCELL (13, 1): \nCELL (13, 2): \nMinimum Rear Setback (feet)\nCELL (13, 3): \nCELL (13, 4): \n10\nCELL (13, 5): \nCELL (14, 1): \nK\nCELL (14, 2): \nMin.

These standards may be modified by other applicable sections of this Ordinance.\n10.2.2.\nMEASUREMENTS, GENERALLY\nA.\nStraight Lines\nUnless otherwise stated in this Ordinance, distances specified in this Ordinance are to be measured as the length of\nan imaginary straight line joining two points.\nB.\nRounding\nAll calculations that result in a fractional unit or part of a whole number, the number shall be rounded up to the next\nhighest whole number, unless otherwise provided in this section or elsewhere in this Ordinance.\nC.\nIrregular Shapes\nIn cases where an irregular shape complicates the application of these standards, the UDO Administrator shall\ndetermine the applicable dimensional, setback, or bulk standards.\nD.\nSeparation\n1.\nLot to Lot\nWhen the provisions of this Ordinance require separation between two or more lots, or a lot and another\nfeature, separation shall be measured by drawing straight lines from the nearest point of one lot line to the\nnearest point of the lot line subject to the separation requirement (see Figure 10.2.2.D: Separation).\n2.\nUse Type to Use Type\nWhen the provisions of this Ordinance require one use type to be separated from another use type,\nseparation shall be measured by drawing straight lines from the nearest point of the wall of the existing or\nproposed principal structure to the nearest point of the wall of the existing or proposed structure subject to\nthe separation requirement.\nFIGURE 10.2.2.D: SEPARATION\nA\nLEGEND\nA\nLot-to-Lot Separation\nB Use Type-to-Use\nType Separation\nB\nLot Line\nCELL (1, 1): \nCamden County\nCELL (1, 2): \n10-5\nCELL (1, 3): \nLast Updated\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nFebruary 4, 2019\n\n\n Output:"}]}
