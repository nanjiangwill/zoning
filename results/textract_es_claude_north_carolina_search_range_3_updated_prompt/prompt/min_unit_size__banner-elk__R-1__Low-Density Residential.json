Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Low-Density Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-1\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_unit_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min unit size, min floor area, min finished floor area, min livable floor area, min building size, min floor area, unit size, floor area, min dwelling unit size, floor area requirements, min total living area, min lot area per dwelling unit, living area requirements, min habitable floor area, living area requirements, min gross floor area, min ground floor area. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Low-Density Residential\n(R-1) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_unit_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_unit_size\nfor Low-Density Residential (R-1). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Low-Density Residential (R-1)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Low-Density Residential\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_unit_size extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nRemember, min_unit_size refers to the minimum lot size per dwelling unit, which is different from the overall minimum lot size.\n\nThe range for min_unit_size is typically between 200 and 5,000 sq ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_unit_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 500 sq ft). However, bear in mind that values falling outside of these ranges are possible, so do not disregard them.\n\nHere are several examples that you can use as references.\n# Examples\n\nInput:\nNEW PAGE 74\nArticle 4 Zoning Districts\n4.5 Commercial Zoning Districts\n4.5.4.\nSpecial Standards in the R-1 Zoning District\nD.\nOpen Space\nOpen space requirements for the residential portion of a multifamily or mixed commercial-residential\nproject shall be the same and conform to the requirements for multifamily developments in the MR-\n4-12\nCELL (1, 1):\nUse\nCELL (1, 2):\nDistrict\nCELL (1, 3):\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 4):\nMinimum\nLot Width (ft.)\nCELL (1, 5):\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 6):\nMinimum\nLot Area per dwelling\nunit (s.f.)\nCELL (1, 7):\nCELL (1, 8):\nYard\n(ft.)\nCELL (1, 9):\nCELL (2, 1):\nCELL (2, 2):\nCELL (2, 3):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 4):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 5):\nWith\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 6):\nWithout\nWater and\nSewer\nCELL (2, 7):\nFront\nCELL (2, 8):\nRear\nCELL (2, 9):\nSide\nCELL (3, 1):\nAll residential, except\nCELL (3, 2):\nR-1\nCELL (3, 3):\n60\nCELL (3, 4):\n60\nCELL (3, 5):\n6,000\nCELL (3, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (3, 7):\n25\u00b3\nCELL (3, 8):\n63\nCELL (3, 9):\n51,2\nCELL (4, 1):\nmultifamily\nCELL (4, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (4, 3):\n75\nCELL (4, 4):\n75\nCELL (4, 5):\n7,500\nCELL (4, 6):\n10,000\nCELL (4, 7):\n253\nCELL (4, 8):\n253\nCELL (4, 9):\n102\nCELL (5, 1):\nMultifamily/ Mixed\nCELL (5, 2):\nR-1\nCELL (5, 3):\n100\nCELL (5, 4):\n150\nCELL (5, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (5, 6):\n15,000\nCELL (5, 7):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 8):\nPer District\nCELL (5, 9):\nCELL (6, 1):\ncommercial- residential\nCELL (6, 2):\nXXXX\nCELL (6, 3):\n100\nCELL (6, 4):\n100\nCELL (6, 5):\n3,200\nCELL (6, 6):\n7,000\nCELL (6, 7):\nCELL (6, 8):\nCELL (6, 9):\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [\n        [\"CELL (2, 5):\\nWith\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 5):\\n6,000\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (2, 6):\\nWithout\\nWater and\\nSewer\", 74],\n        [\"CELL (3, 6):\\n10,000\" 74]\n    ],\n    \"rationale\": \"For district R-1, the section provides the information for min_unit_size.

A conditional use permit application, as well as a site plan, denoting the\ndimensions of the subject property for a proposed small scale wind energy conversion system located at a residence must meet the\nfollowing standards as an accessory use: roof-mounted wind energy conversion systems shall meet the following location\nstandards.\n(1) Roof-mounted accessory wind energy conversion systems shall not extend above the ridge-cap of the roof or exceed the\n35 feet height restrictions of this chapter.\n(2) The wind energy conversion system and mounting devices for roof-mounted systems shall not extend beyond the exterior\nperimeter of the roof of the building on which the system is mounted or built.\n(3) Roof-mounted systems shall be located so as not to impede the ability of emergency personnel to access the roof for\nfirefighting purposes.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 315)\n\u00a7 152.056 ACCESSORY WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEMS, UTILITY SCALE.\n(A) Accessory wind energy conversion systems, utility scale, shall be conditional as an accessory use in the Medical\nEducational Zoning District (M-E) for the purpose of on-site consumption in addition to the resale of energy back to the grid. The M-\nE Zoning District has large enough parcels to accommodate this type of system with minimal impact to neighboring properties.\nThese systems require an environmental assessment by a professional engineer, licensed in the state. The environmental\nassessment shall be submitted along with a conditional use permit to the Zoning Administrator for review by the Planning Board\nand the Board of Adjustment.\n(B) All wind energy conversion systems shall be located within a protected \"fall zone\". The fall zone shall not have any other\nstructures located within the clearly defined area and the system shall be indicated on the site plan, with distances from the\nproposed site improvements to all property lines. The setbacks in this chapter are in addition to the fall zone calculation.\n(C) Acceptable decibels (at the property line) should be no greater than 40dB.\n(D) Clear cutting of property in order to install an accessory wind energy conversion system shall not be allowed without special\npermission from the town's Planning Board and Board of Adjustment.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 315)\n\u00a7 152.057 COMPLETION AND DECOMMISSIONING\nEach accessory wind energy conversion system project must be completed within 18 months. Should delays occur, the Zoning\nAdministrator must approve an extension at six-month intervals. Should a project cease operation as an ongoing business entity,\nthe site must be restored to the original agricultural natural state. A plan must be filed with the Zoning Administrator within 180 days\nafter cessation, outlining how the structure will be removed, the timeframe in which the work will be done and the plan to return the\nproperty to its pre-existing state. A date for final removal must be given and approved by the Zoning Administrator in the plan.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 315)\nPARKING AND LOADING REGULATIONS\n\u00a7 152.070 PARKING AND LOADING REGULATIONS.\nIt is the intent of these regulations that adequate parking and loading facilities shall be provided on private property in order to\npromote the public safety, to lessen congestion in the public streets, and to help make possible the full use of existing streets for\ntraffic movement. Parking lots shall not be focal points for development. Parking and site circulation should be created behind\nbuildings. To achieve these purposes, it is further intended that upon the erection of any building or the use of any lot, there shall\nbe provided on the lot not less than the minimum space required herein. Compliance with these requirements shall be a continuing\nresponsibility.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 400)\n\u00a7 152.071 OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIRED.\n\n\nNEW PAGE 56\nOff-street automobile storage or parking space shall be provided on every lot on which any of the following uses are hereinafter\nestablished; exception may be made within the C-1 Central Business District when evidence is provided by the applicant that\nadequate on-street or public parking is available. No certificate of compliance will be issued upon completion of any building unless\nall off-street parking and loading requirements, shown upon the plans or made part of the zoning permit, shall be in place and\nready for use and conforming to the requirements.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 401)\n\u00a7 152.072 DIMENSIONS AND DESIGN CRITERIA.\n(A) General.\n(1) Each parking space shall be not less than the dimensions provided in the second table below. The number of parking\nspaces provided shall be at least as great as the number specified in the first table below for various uses.\n(2) Parking areas shall be designed to accommodate the following criteria.\n(a) Unless no other practical alternative is available, parking areas shall be designed so that, without resorting to\nextraordinary movements, vehicles may exit such areas without backing onto a public street. This requirement does not apply to\ndriveways that serve single-family residential units or duplexes.\n(b) Parking areas of all developments shall be designed so that sanitation, emergency and other public service vehicles can\nserve such developments without the necessity of backing unreasonable distances (greater than 900 feet) or making other\ndangerous or hazardous turning movements.\n(c) Parking area shall be designed so that vehicles cannot extend beyond the perimeter of such area onto adjacent\nproperties, public rights-of-way, sidewalk or landscaped areas.\n(d) Parking areas shall be graded and improved with either asphalt, concrete or pave-blocks to provide a surface that is\nstable and minimizes dust. Alternative pervious surfaces will be encouraged in areas where site constraints permit. Storm water\nrunoff shall be directed to grass catchment areas (rain gardens or swales), or existing storm water systems, and allowed to\npercolate into the soil to the maximum extent practicable. The town shall review the proposed parking area and may require\nadditional measures by the applicant to reduce or mitigate any negative impacts of storm water runoff. Exception: churches,\ntheaters or assembly halls, whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sundays, may be exempt from the requirement to pave or\nconcrete one-half of the parking spaces required; provided, the spaces are stabilized with turf or gravel and maintained in good\ncondition.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nRequired Parking\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (2, 1): \nUse\nCELL (2, 2): \nMinimum Parking\nCELL (2, 3): \nMaximum Parking\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nRequired Parking\nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (4, 1): \nUse\nCELL (4, 2): \nMinimum Parking\nCELL (4, 3): \nMaximum Parking\nCELL (5, 1): \nAutomobile repair\nCELL (5, 2): \n2 spaces for each working bay, plus 1\nspace for each employee\nCELL (5, 3): \nNA\nCELL (6, 1): \nBed and breakfast homes, bed and\nbreakfast inns, motels and hotels\nCELL (6, 2): \n1 space for each accommodation,\nplus 1 space for each 2 employees\nCELL (6, 3): \n2 spaces for each accommodation,\nplus 1 space for each 1 employee\nCELL (7, 1): \nCar sales, outdoor equipment and\nmachinery sales\nCELL (7, 2): \n1 space for each two employees at\nmaximum employment on a single\nshift, plus 1 space for each sales\nvehicle/ machinery\nCELL (7, 3): \nNA\nCELL (8, 1): \nChurches, other religious institutions\nand assembly places of public\nassembly without fixed seats\nCELL (8, 2): \n1 space for each 200 square feet of\ngross floor space directed to patron\nuse\nCELL (8, 3): \n1 space for each 100 square feet of\ngross floor space directed to patron\nuse\nCELL (9, 1): \nChurches, other religious institutions\nand places of public assembly with\nfixed seats\nCELL (9, 2): \n1 space for each 4 seats in the\nprincipal assembly room\nCELL (9, 3): \n1 space for each 2 seats in the\nprincipal assembly room\nCELL (10, 1): \nColleges\nCELL (10, 2): \n1 space for each 4 students, plus 1\nspace for each faculty and staff\nmember\nCELL (10, 3): \nNA\nCELL (11, 1): \nCommercial nurseries\nCELL (11, 2): \n1 space for each company vehicle,\nplus 1 space for each 4 employees\nCELL (11, 3): \nNA\nCELL (12, 1): \nConvenience stores\nCELL (12, 2): \nCELL (12, 3): \nCELL (13, 1): \nWith gas sales\nCELL (13, 2): \n2 spaces for each gas pump, plus 2\nspaces for each vehicle bay or similar\nfacility\nCELL (13, 3): \nNA\nCELL (14, 1): \nWithout gas sales\nCELL (14, 2): \n1 space for each 300 square feet of\nstore gross floor area\nCELL (14, 3): \n1 space for each 150 square feet of\nstore gross floor area\nCELL (15, 1): \nLibraries, art galleries, public\nbuildings, professional business\noffices and banks\nCELL (15, 2): \n1 space for each 250 square feet of\ngross floor space\nCELL (15, 3): \nNA\n\nNEW PAGE 57\nNOTES TO TABLE:\n(a)\nIn parking areas containing 10 or more spaces, up to 20% of the parking spaces may be designated\nfor compact cars only.
