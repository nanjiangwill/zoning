Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"RESTAURANT DISTRICT OVERLAY\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"EAT\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional requirements, height, lot and building requirements, max building height, max height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If RESTAURANT DISTRICT OVERLAY\n(EAT) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of max_height for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of max_height\nfor RESTAURANT DISTRICT OVERLAY (EAT). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"RESTAURANT DISTRICT OVERLAY (EAT)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"RESTAURANT DISTRICT OVERLAY\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of max_height extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for max_height is typically between 25 and 500 ft. Please focus on values within this range when searching for max_height and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 50 ft).

The purpose of this district is to protect\nthe public health, safety, and welfare by severely restricting development within and adjacent to\ncertain lakes, ponds, watercourses, streams, creeks, drainage areas, floodplains, wetlands, and other\nflood-prone areas within the University Lake Watershed. The limited development allowed\nwithin\na\nconservation district not only minimizes the danger to the community water supply from the more\nintensive development of this land but also allows this land to act as a natural buffer between more\nintensively developed areas and the watercourses contained within a conservation district.\n(AMENDED 12/7/83)\nSection 15-136 Commercial Districts Established.

The area is intended to accommodate the pedestrian user.\n(AMENDED 6/09/98)\nCELL (2, 1): \n(2)\nCELL (2, 2): \nB-1(G) GENERAL BUSINESS. This district is designed to accommodate a broad range\nof business uses. This district, because of its close proximity to established residential\nsingle family neighborhoods, is limited in the types of night uses permitted. Uses may\nbe restricted in the hours of operation where the permit-issuing authority finds that\nsuch restrictions are necessary to prevent unreasonable disruptions to the peace and\nquiet of a nearby residential area.

This overlay district is designed to\naccommodate on-premises (inside and outside) dining 8.100 and 8.200 restaurant\nuses in the B-1(g) General Business district. Because of the B-1(g) district's close\nproximity to established residential single-family neighborhoods, the EAT overlay\nis restricted to properties a minimum distance of one property width from abutting\nresidential zones and is limited in the types of night uses permitted. In addition,\nemphasis is given to the existing restrictions in the B-1(g) district and the ability of\nthe permit-issuing authority to limit hours of operation where such restrictions are\nnecessary to prevent unreasonable disruptions to the peace and quiet of a nearby\nresidential area. Use of property within the overlay district for 8.100 and 8.200\npurposes shall require the issuance of a special use permit-A. (AMENDED\n03/21/95)\nCELL (4, 1): \n(3)\nCELL (4, 2): \nB-2 FRINGE COMMERCIAL. This district is a transitional district which is designed\nto accommodate commercial uses in areas that formerly were residential but that now\nmay be more desirable for commercial activities due to high traffic volumes and\n\n\nNEW PAGE 3\nArt. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\nproximity to other nonresidential districts. At the same time, continued residential use\nof existing and nearby structures, and preservation of the existing character and\nappearance of this area is encouraged. Accordingly, however, whenever the use of\nthe land in this district is changed to commercial, it is intended and desired that\nexisting residential structures be converted and adapted to commercial use rather than\nnew buildings constructed, and to encourage this, the regulations for this district allow\ndevelopment at a lower density than is permitted in the B-1 districts and permit uses\nthat tend to generate minimal traffic. In this way, the B-2 district should provide a\nsmoother transition from the more intensively developed B-1 areas to residential\nareas. Any development within the B-2 district shall comply with the following\nrequirements: (AMENDED 9/06/88; 6/20/06).\na.\nTo the extent practicable, development shall otherwise retain, preserve and be\ncompatible with the residential character of the older homes within and\nimmediately adjacent to this district;\nb.\nTo the extent practicable, vehicle accommodation areas associated with uses\non lots in this district shall be located in the rear of buildings SO that parking\nareas are not readily visible from the streets; and\n(4)\nB-3 NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESS. This district is designed to accommodate\ncommercial needs arising at the neighborhood level, such as grocery stores, branch\nbanks, gas sales, and the like, as well as other commercial and office uses that are\nof such size and scale that they can compatibly coexist with adjoining residential\nneighborhoods. To insure compatibility between B-3 areas and the neighborhoods,\nno B-3 district shall be greater than five acres, and no areas shall be zoned B-3 if\nany portion of a pre-existing business district lies within one-half mile in any\ndirection. (AMENDED 3/7/2006)\n(5)\nB-4 OUTLYING CONCENTRATED BUSINESS. This zone is designed to accommodate\na variety of commercial enterprises that provide goods and services to a larger market\narea than those businesses permitted in the neighborhood business district.\nDevelopment regulations also permit higher buildings and increased density over that\nallowed in the B-3 zone. This zone is intended to create an attractive, concentrated\nbusiness district in areas that are outside the town's central business district but that\nare served by the town's major thoroughfares. Examples of permitted uses include\nshopping centers, professional offices and motels. Uses that are not permitted include\noutside storage and drive-in theaters.\n(6)\nB-5 WATERSHED COMMERCIAL. This district is designed to accommodate\ncommercial uses within the University Lake Watershed area without adversely\naffecting the community water supply.\n(7)\nCT CORPORATE TOWN. This district is designed to create a visually attractive,\ncommercial use district with flexible space. The district is intended to provide space\nfor assemblage and research and development type enterprises. Any structure in this\nPage #3\n\n\nNEW PAGE 4\nArt.

In order to encourage the creation of flexible space, an average\nminimum building height of 18 feet for any principal structure is required. The\ncontinued use of existing residential dwelling units along North Greensboro Street is\nencouraged. (AMENDED 6/20/06)\n(8)\nB-3-T TRANSITION AREA BUSINESS. This district is designed to accommodate\ncommercial needs arising in the town's more rural neighborhoods, especially in the\njoint planning transition areas, and which are more appropriately dealt with at the\nneighborhood level than at a community or regional level. To insure compatibility\nbetween B-3-T areas and their associated rural neighborhoods, no B-3-T district shall\nbe greater than five acres, and no areas shall be zoned B-3-T if any portion of a\npre-existing business district lies within one-half mile in any direction. (AMENDED\n11/14/88)\n(9)\nO OFFICE. This district is intended to provide locations for low intensity office and\ninstitutional uses. This district is designed for parcels three (3) acres or less in size.\nRather than have new buildings constructed, it is intended and desired that any\nexisting residential structures within the district be converted and adapted to office or\ninstitutional use. In order to assure compatibility of residential conversions or new\noffice construction with existing and future residential development, specific\nperformance measures to mitigate negative impacts of office development will be\nrequired. Any development within the Office (O) district shall comply with the\nfollowing requirements:\na.\nType A screening will be required between any non-residential use and\nadjacent properties, except for openings necessary to allow pedestrian\nmovement between the office or institutional use and adjacent properties;\nb.\nTo the extent practicable, vehicle accommodation areas associated with uses\non lots in this district shall be located in the rear of buildings SO that parking\nareas are not readily visible from the streets, unless doing SO would adversely\naffect adjoining residential properties;\nC.\nWhenever a new building is erected in this district, (i) the exterior walls shall\nbe constructed of materials commonly used on the exterior walls of\nsingle-family residences (such as brick, stone, wood, or fabricated residential\nlap siding made of hardboard, vinyl, or aluminum); (ii) the pitch of the roof\nshall have a minimum vertical rise of one foot for every five feet of horizontal\nrun; provided that this requirement shall not apply to lots that have frontage\non any street where, within the same block as the property in question, at least\n75% of the buildings (in place on April 16, 1991) that front along the same\nside of the street do not have roofs that comply with this pitched roof standard;\nand (iii) windows shall be of a type commonly used in single-family\nresidences;\nPage #4\n\n\n Output:"}]}
