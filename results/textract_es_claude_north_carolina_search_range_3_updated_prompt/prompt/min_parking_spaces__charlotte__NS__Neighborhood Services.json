Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Neighborhood Services\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"NS\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Neighborhood Services\n(NS) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Neighborhood Services (NS).

Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

Purpose.\nThe purpose of the Neighborhood Services District (NS) is to encourage and accommodate the\ndevelopment and continued existence of mixed use districts, which provide a focus for\nneighborhood retail and service activities. This district provides for a variety of neighborhood-\noriented retail and service uses intermixed with high density residential uses. Residential uses on\nthe upper floor of commercial structures are strongly encouraged. Emphasis in the district is\nplaced upon creating a pedestrian scale urban environment with strong linkages to the\nneighborhood and access to transit.\nSection 11.502. Applicability.\nThe delineation of Neighborhood Services Districts will be done primarily through the area\nplanning process. This does not preclude, however, a private sector initiated rezoning petition to\nestablish a district. The following criteria must be considered for the establishment of the\nNeighborhood Services District:\n(1)\nThe district must be directly adjacent to or within a residential neighborhood.\n(2)\nThe proposed uses are intended to serve the surrounding neighborhood.\n(3)\nThe district must have frontage on a major or minor thoroughfare, unless an\napproved site plan provides otherwise.\n(4)\nThe district must have proximity to existing and future transit routes.\nSection 11.503. Uses permitted by right.\nThe intent of the Neighborhood Services District is to provide for uses that directly serve the\nneighborhood in which they are located. Uses allowed by right and under prescribed conditions\nin the B-1 district are allowed.\nSection 11.504. Permitted accessory uses and structures.\nAccessory uses and structures, which are permitted in the B-1 district, are allowed.\n11 25\n\n\nNEW PAGE 518\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 5: NEIGHBORHOOD SERVICES DISTRICT\nSection 11.505.

If a\nside yard is provided, it shall be a minimum of 10 feet.\n(3)\nSide yard adjacent to residential district is 10 feet.\n(4)\nRear yard adjacent to nonresidential district is 10 feet.\n(5)\nRear yard adjacent to residential district is 20 feet.\n(6)\nScreening shall be provided next to a residential use or district as required in\nSection 12.303.\n(7)\nMaximum floor-area-ratio is 2.0. Any residential use incorporated into a\ncommercial or office structure will not be included in the floor-area-ratio\ncalculation. In addition, a commercial or office structure may receive an\nadditional .50 floor-area-ratio if a residential use is incorporated into the structure.\nIf a parking deck is constructed as part of the building, the allowable floor-area-\nratio may be increased by .50. The total maximum allowable floor-area-ratio in\nthis district is 3.0.\n(8)\nMaximum height is 60 feet in the district. However, the maximum height in the\ndistrict abutting property used or zoned for single family residential is 40 feet,\nexcept the height may exceed 40 feet if there is an increase in side and rear yards\nof one foot for every foot of building height over 40 feet up to the 60 feet\nmaximum.\nHeight requirements for other permitted structures are set forth in Section 12.108.\n(Petition No. 2014-098,$ 11.505(8), 11/17/2014)\n(9)\nThe NS district is exempt from the buffer regulations of Section 12.302, but must\nbe applicable screening requirement of Section 12.303.\n11 - 26\n\n\nNEW PAGE 519\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 6: HAZARDOUS WASTE DISTRICT\nSection 11.506.
