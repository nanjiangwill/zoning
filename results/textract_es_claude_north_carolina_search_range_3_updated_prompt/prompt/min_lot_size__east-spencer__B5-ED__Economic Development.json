Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Economic Development\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"B5-ED\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: area and bulk, area and bulk requirements, area requirements, dimensional, dimensional requirements, lot, lot and building, lot and building requirements, lot area, lot requirements, lot size, min area, min dimensional, min lot, min lot and area, min lot and building, min lot area, min lot coverage, min lot requirements, min lot size, min parcel area, min parcel size. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Economic Development\n(B5-ED) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_lot_size for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_lot_size\nfor Economic Development (B5-ED). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Economic Development (B5-ED)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Economic Development\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_lot_size extracted from the text.

Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_lot_size and provide the answer as a whole number with unit (e.g., 5000 sq ft).

O&I OFFICE AND INSTITUTION is primarily intended to accommodate the office and\ninstitutional use of land developed in various densities. The principal structure of the\nO&I district is the office and institutional building, including the adaptive reuse of\nformer residential, commercial, and industrial buildings previously existing within\nthe community.\n2. GENERAL BUSINESS DISTRICT is primarily intended to accommodate a wide\nrange of retail, service, and office uses in various density patterns. The district is\ntypically located along through fares in areas which have developed with minimal front\nset back.\n3. THE HIGHWAY BUSINESS DISTRICT is primarily intended to accommodate retail\nservice and distributive uses which are typically located along thoroughfares in\nvarious density patterns. The district is established to provide location for\nestablishments which require high visibility and good road access, or which cater\nprimarily to passing motorists. Development in this district generally has substantial\nfront setbacks.\n4. 1-2 HEAVY INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT is primarily intended to accommodate a wide\nrange of assembling, fabricating and manufacturing activities in a moderate low-\ndensity pattern. The district is established for the purpose of providing appropriate\nlocations of development regulation for uses which may have significant\nenvironmental impacts or require special measures to ensure compatibility with\nadjoining properties.\n5. C-1 COMMERCIAL DISTRICT, the neighborhood business district provides for the\ncommercial use of land in harmony with surrounding residential zoning districts.\nCommercial development should be environmentally and aesthetically compatible\nwith surround residential uses. The requirements for the C-1 zoning district should\nensure harmony with residential uses and not impair existing and/or future residential\n20\n\n\nNEW PAGE 21\nTown of East Spencer Zoning/Development Ordinance\nEast Spencer - Land Usage\ndevelopment. All establishments developed under the C-1 classification should be\nscaled to meet shopping needs of the immediate area and should not be scaled to\ndetract from high commercial zoning districts.\n6. ED-85 DISTRICT is established to preserve, encourage and enhance the economic\ndevelopment opportunities in areas adjacent and near 1-85 in accordance to the plans\nadopted by the Town of East Spencer. It is recognized that/-85 is uniquely important to the\nfuture of the Town because of the great potential for development of all types that exist\nalong this corridor. Development within this district; shall be of types which maximize the\neconomic benefits to the Town while minimizing the potential impacts.\nThe district is designed to accommodate, as appropriate, uses such as\nmanufacturing, distribution, retail, service industries, corporate parks in a moderate-\nto-moderate high density pattern. Certain individual uses may be allowed as uses by\nright in the districts, while other more intensive uses may require a higher level of\nreview and approval by the Town. The district encourages and allows more creative\ndesign of land development than may be provided on other general zoning district.\nThe \"85\" represents the relationship to 1-85 and \"ED\" represents the economic\ndevelopment designation.\n(B)\nMULTI-FAMILY DISTRICTS\n1. RM-10 RESIDENTIAL MULTI-FAMILY DISTRICT is a moderate district and is\nprimarily intended to accommodate multi-family uses at a maximum overall density of\nten (10) units per acre.\n2. RM-18 RESIDENTIAL MULTI-FAMILY DISTRICT is a moderate district.\nand is primarily intended to accommodate multi-family uses at a maximum overall\ndensity of eighteen (18) units per acre.\n(C)\nSINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS\n1.\nR-1 SINGLE-FAMILY DISTRICT provides for residential use of land in the\nlow-density pattern at four (4) units per acre. The principal structure in the R-1\nzoning district is the single-family detached dwelling.\n2. R-3 SINGLE FAMILY DISTRICT provides for residential use of land in the Medium\nto high density pattern in which the principal use of land is the single-family detached\ndwelling.\n21\n\n\nNEW PAGE 22\nTown of East Spencer Zoning/Development Ordinance\nEast Spencer - Land Usage\n(D)\nConditional Zoning District\n1.\nWhere the regulations and restrictions applicable within a zoning district\npermitting a proposed use are inadequate to ensure the compatibility of a proposed\ndevelopment with the immediately surrounding neighborhood in accordance with the\nprinciples of this Ordinance and applicable adopted plans, the property owner may\napply for rezoning to a conditional zoning district bearing the same designation as a\nstandard zoning district but subject to additional conditions, in accordance to G.S. \u00a7\n160D-703.\n2.\nA conditional zoning district bearing the designation CZ is hereby\nestablished as a companion district for every district established in section\n155.020. These districts are: CZ- O&I, CZ-GB, CZ-HB, CZ-I-2, CZ-C-1, CZ-85-\nED, CZ-R-1, CZ-R-3, CZ-RM-10, CZ-RM-18\n3.\nAll regulations which apply to the general use zoning district shall also apply to\nthe companion conditional zoning district. All other regulations, which may be offered\nby the property owner and approved by the Governing Body as a part of the rezoning\nprocess shall also apply.\n\u00a7 155.022\nDISTRICT BOUNDARIES SHOWN ON THE ZONING MAP.\n(A) The boundaries of the districts are shown on the zoning map. The zoning map and all\nthe notations, references, and amendments thereto, and other information shown thereon\nare hereby made a part of this chapter the same as if the information set forth on the map\nwere all fully described and set out herein.\n(B) The zoning map is posted at the Town Hall and is available for inspection by the public.\n\u00a7 155.023\nDUE CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.\nIn the creation, by this chapter, of the respective districts, careful consideration is given to the\npeculiar suitability of each district for the particular uses and regulations applied thereto, and\nthe necessary and proper grouping and arrangement of various uses and densities of\npopulation in accordance with a well-considered comprehensive plan for the physical\ndevelopment of the community.\n\u00a7 155.024\nRULES GOVERNING INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.\nWhere uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts, as shown on\nthe zoning map, the following rules apply:\n(A) Where the district boundaries are indicated as approximately following street, alley or\nhighway lines, the lines shall be construed to be the boundaries.\n22\n\n\nNEW PAGE 23\nTown of East Spencer Zoning/Development Ordinance\nEast Spencer - Land Usage\n(B) Where district boundaries are SO indicated that they approximately follow street, alley or\nhighway lines, the lines shall be construed to be the boundaries.\n(C) Where district boundaries are SO indicated that they are approximately parallel to\nthe centerlines of streets, alleys, or highways, or the right-of-way of the same, the\ndistrict boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at a distance there from\nas indicated on the zoning map.\n(D) Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerlines of\nstreets or highways, street lines or railroad right-of-way lines or these lines extended, the\ncenterline, street lines or railroad right-of-way lines shall be construed to be the boundaries.\n(E) Where a district boundary line divides a lot or tract in single ownership, the district\nrequirements of the least restricted portion of the lot or tract shall be deemed to apply to the\nwhole thereof, provided the extensions shall not include any part of a lot or tract more than\n50 feet beyond the district boundary line. The term \"least restricted\" shall refer to all zoning\nrestrictions.\n(F) In unsubsidized property, the location of zoning boundaries shall be determined by use of\nthe scale appearing on the map.\n(G) In subdivided property, the location of zoning boundaries shall be construed to be the\nnearest parallel lot line. However, if the zoning boundaries lie at a scaled distance greater\nthan 25 feet from any parallel or approximately parallel lot line, the boundary shall be\ndetermined by use of the scale;\n(H) In case any further uncertainty exists, the Board of Adjustment shall interpret the intent\nof the zoning map as to location of the boundaries.\n23\n\n\n Output:"}]}
