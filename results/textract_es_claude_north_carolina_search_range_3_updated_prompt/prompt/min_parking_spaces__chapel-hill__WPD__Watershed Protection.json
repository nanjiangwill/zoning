Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Watershed Protection\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"WPD\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Watershed Protection\n(WPD) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Watershed Protection (WPD). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Watershed Protection (WPD)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Watershed Protection\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

Except where exempted in Section 3.5.7(c), Exemptions, the standards in this section apply to all land and development located within the HR district and subdistrict boundaries as\nidentified and located on the Chapel Hill Zoning Atlas.\nc) Exemptions. Minor additions to lawfully-established buildings that existed on May 22, 2019 are exempt from the standards in this section. For the purposes of this section, \"minor additions\" are\ndefined as increases in the amount of floor area on a lot of up to 25 percent beyond what existed on May 22, 2019 or up to a maximum total size of 2,000 square feet of heated floor area,\nwhichever is greater.\nd) Effective Date. The effective date of these standards is May 22, 2019.\ne) District Boundary. The boundary for the HR District is depicted in Figure 3.5.7(e), below:\nFigure 3.5.7(e): HR District Boundary\nLegend\nHR District Boundary\nParcel Lines\nRoadways\nCarrboro Jurisdiction\nParallel HR District\n1:10000\nNOTES:\n[1] Because the Historic Rogers Road Neighborhood, as defined in Mapping Our Community's Future, is located across two jurisdictions (the Town of Chapel Hill and the Town of\nCarrboro), a parallel district was prepared for the Town of Carrboro, to be applicable in the grey-shaded area on the map.\nf) Subdistricts Established. The HR District is comprised of subdistricts, or character areas. The purpose and intent of each subdistrict is as follows:\n1) Residential-Low Density (HR-L) Subdistrict. The Residential-Low Density (HR-L) Subdistrict is established with the intent to protect and preserve the character of existing lower-density areas\n(minimum lot size 14,500 square feet, or no more than three lots per acre) within the neighborhood while providing for compatible new development, including new housing choice options,\nand increased home occupation opportunities for residents.\n2) Residential-Medium Density (HR-M) Subdistrict. The Residential-Medium Density (HR-M) Subdistrict is established with the intent of designating areas within the neighborhood for medium-\ndensity (minimum lot size 9,000 square feet, or no more than five lots per acre) residential development that offers a broader range of housing options and increased home occupation\nopportunities for residents.\n3)\nHousing and Employment Mixed-Use (HR-X) Subdistrict. The Housing and Employment Mixed-Use (HR-X) Subdistrict is established with the intent of providing areas within the neighborhood\nwith a broader range of housing and employment options. These areas are intended to concentrate new development into nodes which will balance providing areas for desired new uses\nwhile protecting the overall neighborhood character. Uses appropriate in the HR-X Subdistrict include live-work units, flex offices, and low-intensity neighborhood-serving establishments such\nas healthcare, assisted living, elder care, child care, and recreation facilities.\nNOTE: As of May 22, 2019, no lands bear the HR-X designation. This subdistrict is established as a placeholder for future use within the district, subject to a rezoning.\n4) Conservation (HR-C) Subdistrict. The Conservation (HR-C) Subdistrict is established with the intent of preserving and protecting environmentally sensitive areas as well as lands under joint\nmanagement by the Town of Chapel Hill and Orange County.\nNOTE: As of May 22, 2019, no lands bear the HR-C designation. This subdistrict is established as a placeholder for future use within the district, subject to a rezoning.\ng) Modification of District Standards.\n1) Minor modifications or deviations of up to 10 percent may be approved by the Planning Director through an administrative adjustment for the following numerical requirements:\nA. Maximum single-family home size;\nB. Maximum block length; or\nC. Street Configuration\n2) In order to be granted a modification, the applicant requesting the modification must demonstrate all of the following:\nA. The modification is consistent with the character of development on surrounding land and results in development that is compatible with surrounding land uses;\nB. The modification results in development that is consistent with both the purpose and intent statement of the HR District, as stated in Section 3.5.7(a), and the purpose and intent\nstatement of the subdistrict in which the development is located, as stated in Section 3.5.7(g)(2);\n21 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\n\nNEW PAGE 22\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nC. The modification compensates for some unusual aspect of the site or the proposed development that is not shared by landowners in general;\nD. The modification will not pose a danger to the public health or safety; and\nE. Any adverse impacts resulting from the modification will be fully mitigated.\n3) No modification granted under this section shall result in a change in use.\nh) Development Standards. This section sets out the special standards for new development or redevelopment in the HR District. Development standards not listed in this section (including\nRecreational Area for Residential Subdivisions, Required Buffers for Adjacent Vacant Land Zoning, and Permitted Sign Types, Dimensional Standards, and Lighting) shall comply with the standards\nfor development in the R-1 District listed in Article 5.\n1) Buffering.\nA.

Purpose and Intent. The intent of the street standards in this section is to ensure that future development in the Historic Rogers Road Neighborhood is served by adequate streets that:\n1. Mitigate new traffic generated by development;\n2. Increase connections within the neighborhood and between the neighborhood and surrounding areas in accordance with the goals and recommendations in Mapping Our\nCommunity's Future; and\n3. Prioritize the safety of pedestrians, bicyclists, and drivers.\nB. Applicability.\n1. The standards in this section shall apply to:\na. Development in the Housing and Employment Mixed-Use (HR-X) Subdistrict; and\nb. New residential subdivisions in the HR-L and HR-M Subdistricts.\n2. Minor subdivisions as defined in Section 4.6.3 shall, at the minimum, include in their applications:\na. A description of how the subdivision and future development will accommodate the standards of this section; and\nb. Dedication of right-of-way for roads meeting these standards.\nC.\nStandards. In addition to compliance with the standards in the Town of Chapel Hill Public Works Engineering Design Manual and Chapter 17, Streets and Sidewalks, of the Town Code of\nOrdinances, the following standards shall apply to development in the HR District.\n1.\nMaximum Block Length. The maximum block length, as measured from right-of-way line to right-of-way line of two parallel streets forming the sides of a block, or right-of-way line to\nproperty line, shall be 850 linear feet. Nothing shall prevent block lengths of less than 850 linear feet.\n2. Preferred Street Configuration.\na. To the maximum extent practicable, new streets shall be configured in accordance with the following guidelines:\ni. New roadways shall extend and connect existing roadways into a coherent street network;\nii. New roadways shall intersect at right (90 degree) angles;\niii. New roadways shall be configured in straight-sided blocks, rather than curvilinear;\niv. New roadway networks shall avoid the use of permanent dead-end streets (including cul-de-sac streets);\nV.

No. 2015-11-23/0-16, adopted Nov. 23, 2015, states that upon notification by the University of North Carolina that the Horace Williams Airport is closed, subsection 3.6.1, which\npertained to the Airport Hazard District shall be repealed.\n3.6.2 Historic Districts.\nPurpose statement: The historic district is intended to protect and conserve the heritage and character of the Chapel Hill community by providing for the preservation of designated areas within the\nplanning jurisdiction, including individual properties therein that embody important elements of social, economic, political, or architectural history, and by promoting the stabilization and enhancement of\nproperty values throughout such areas. The purpose of requiring regulation of placement and design of telecommunications equipment in this district is to help achieve these objectives and to protect the\nspecial character of the historic district.\nIt is intended that these regulations ensure, insofar as possible, that buildings or structures in the historic district shall be in harmony with other buildings or structures located therein. However, it is not\nthe intention of these regulations to require the reconstruction or restoration of individual or original buildings, or to prohibit the demolition or removal of such buildings, or to impose architectural styles\nfrom particular historic periods, but rather to encourage design, whether contemporary or traditional, which is harmonious with the character of the historic district.\n(a) Establishment of historic district.\n(1) The historic district is hereby established as a district which overlays other zoning districts established in sections 3.3-3.5. The boundaries of the historic district are as shown on the official\nzoning atlas.\n(2) No new historic district or any change to the boundaries of any existing historic district shall be designated until the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, or its successor agency,\nshall have been given an opportunity, in accord with Chapter NCGS 160D-944, or its successor statutes, to make recommendations with respect to the establishment of such new district or\nchange in the boundaries of an existing district.\n(3) The use and development of any land or structure within the historic district shall comply with use regulations and intensity regulations applicable to the use district in which it is located.\n(b) Certificate of appropriateness required.\n(1) No exterior portion of any building or other structure (including masonry walls, fences, light fixtures, steps and pavement, or other appurtenant features), or any aboveground utility structure,\nor any type of outdoor advertising sign shall be erected, altered, restored, moved, or demolished within the historic district until an application for a certificate of appropriateness as\nto\nexterior architectural features has been approved. For purposes of this article, \"exterior architectural features\" shall include the architectural style, general design, and general arrangement of\nthe exterior of a building or other structure, including the kind and texture of the building material, the size and scale of the building, and the type and style of all windows, doors,\nlight\n23 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\n\nNEW PAGE 24\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nfixtures, signs, and other appurtenant fixtures. In the case of outdoor advertising signs, \"exterior architectural features\" shall be construed to mean the style, material, size, and location of all\nsuch signs.\n(2) A certificate of appropriateness shall be issued prior to the issuance of a zoning compliance permit or any other permit granted for purposes of constructing, altering, or demolishing buildings\nor structures. A certificate of appropriateness shall be required whether or not a zoning compliance permit is required. Any zoning compliance permit or other permit not issued in conformity\nwith this section shall be invalid.\n(3)\nThe town and all public utility companies shall be required to obtain a certificate of appropriateness prior to initiating any changes in the character of street paving, sidewalks, utility\ninstallations, lighting, walls, fences, structures, and buildings on property owned or franchised by the Town of Chapel Hill or public utility companies, excluding regulatory signs, other traffic\ncontrol measures and devices, and utility distribution systems located in public right-of-way.\n(4)\nA certificate of appropriateness application and amendments to a certificate of appropriateness application may be reviewed and approved by the town manager according to specific review\ncriteria contained in state law and Design Principles and Standards approved by the commission when the application is determined to involve minor works or modifications. Minor works or\nmodifications are defined as those exterior changes that do not involve any substantial alterations, and do not involve additions or removals that could impair the integrity of the property\nand/or the district as a whole.

The town manager shall notify the\ncommission of all such exemptions.\n(d) Procedures for approval of certificates of appropriateness.\n(1) Application submittal requirements.\nA. Applications for certificates of appropriateness shall be filed with the town manager.\nB. The town manager shall prescribe the form(s) on which applications are made, as well as any other material which may reasonably be required to determine the nature of the application.\nC. The commission may specify criteria for situations in which the town manager may waive any of the application material requirements.\nD. No application shall be accepted by the town manager unless it complies with such requirements. Applications which are not complete shall be returned forthwith to the applicant, with a\nnotation of the deficiencies in the application.\n(2) Notification of affected property owners. Prior to approval or denial of an application for a certificate of appropriateness by the historic district commission, the commission shall take such\naction as may reasonably be required to inform the owners of any property likely to be materially affected by the application, and shall give the applicant and such owners an opportunity to\nbe heard.\n(3) Procedures for decisions on certificates of appropriateness. Decisions on certificates of appropriateness are quasi-judicial and shall follow the procedures in NCGS 160D-406.\n(4) Evidentiary hearing. In cases where the commission deems it necessary, it may hold an evidentiary hearing concerning the application provided such evidentiary hearing is held pursuant to\nthe relevant quasi-judicial procedures in NCGS 160D-406.\n(5) Action on the application. The town manager or the commission shall approve the application, approve the application with conditions, or deny the application for a certificate of\nappropriateness by the end of the next commission meeting following ninety days after the application is filed; provided, if timely action is not taken, and the time for taking action is not\nextended by the Commission and consented to by written notice from the applicant, the certificate of appropriateness shall be deemed to have been approved as submitted and shall be\nissued administratively.\nThe Commission may extend the time for consideration and deliberation for a period or for periods up to a total of one hundred eighty days from the date of acceptance of the application as\ncomplete, where it finds such action to be necessary:\na) Because of meeting cancellations or postponements, quorum shortages, or backlogs of pending applications with priority by filing date, or other practical considerations; or\nb) To receive additional information requested by the Commission, or to deliberate fully on memoranda submitted by one or more parties, or to seek resolution of outstanding questions,\nissues, or goals.\nNothing herein shall prevent extensions by and with the consent of the Applicant. The time periods for action by the Commission shall be stayed during periods of appeal to the Board\nof\nAdjustment by any party.\nUnder no circumstances shall the time period for which the Commission or staff may take action on an application for a certificate of appropriateness be extended beyond 180 days from the\ndate an application is filed. An application is considered filed when it has been submitted, deemed complete by the town manager, and the requisite application fee has been received by the\nTown.\nThe town manager or the commission may impose such reasonable conditions on the approval of an application as will ensure that the spirit and intent of this article are achieved. An\napplication for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the demolition of a building or structure within the historic district may not be denied. However, the effective date of such a\ncertificate may be delayed for up to three hundred sixty-five (365) days from the date of approval. The maximum period of delay authorized by this section shall be reduced by the commission\nwhere it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use of or return from such property by virtue of the delay. During such period the\ncommission may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building. If the commission finds that the building has no particular\nsignificance or value toward maintaining the character of the historic district, it shall waive all or part of such period and authorize earlier demolition or removal. In every case, the record of\nthe commission's action shall include the reasons for its action.\"\n(6) Actions subsequent to decision. The town manager shall notify the applicant of a decision in writing, and shall file a copy of it with the town's planning department. If the application is denied,\nthe notice shall include the reasons for such action.\n(7) Appeal of decision.

Appeals of administrative decisions shall be made to the historic district commission pursuant to the relevant procedures in NCGS 160D-405.\n(8) Submittal of new application. If the commission denies an application for a certificate of appropriateness, a new application affecting the same property may be accepted by the town manager\nonly if substantial change, with respect to the reasons for its denial, is made in plans for the proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or moving.\n(9) A certificate of appropriateness shall be valid for three hundred sixty-five (365) calendar days from date of issuance, or, in the case of a certificate for demolition, from the effective date. If the\nauthorized work has not commenced within that period, has not been extended by the commission, or has been discontinued for more than three hundred sixty-five (365) calendar days from\nthe date of issuance, such certificate of appropriateness shall expire and the applicant shall be required to reapply and obtain a new certificate of appropriateness before commencing further\nwork.\n24 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\n\n Output:"}]}
