Your goal is to find facts about a particular Zoning District with the name \"Flood Hazard Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"FHO\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which may also be referred to by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit, parking space for each. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that, in the field \"extracted_text\", the first element of\nthe inner list does not span multiple lines and that it is a real substring of the input.\nYou CANNOT make up a value for \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring!\n\"extracted_text\" will be used in the python statement `extracted_text in input`\nand if that returns False, the universe will be destroyed! If you cannot extract\nreasonable text, then you should not return an answer. If Flood Hazard Overlay\n(FHO) is referring to a general residential district,\nwe are only interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces for single-family homes.\nHowever, if it is referring to a specific district, like Multi Family Residential (MFR),\nGeneral Commercial (GC), etc., we are still interested in the requirement of min_parking_spaces\nfor Flood Hazard Overlay (FHO). Remeber, the text given to you is a\ndocument that is part of a larger document, which means you might find answer that is\nnot for the zone \"Flood Hazard Overlay (FHO)\" but for other zones.\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it corresponds to the correct zone district \"Flood Hazard Overlay\"\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": List[List[str, int]], // A list of lists. Each inner list must contain exactly two elements: The first element is a string representing the verbatim text from which the result was extracted. ONLY USE VALUES EXTRACTED DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT. Make sure to include \\n and any special characters and DO NOT span multiple lines. The second element is an integer representing the page where the verbatim text is found. Multiple extracted texts from different pages may correspond to the answer, so the extracted_text field should always be a list of lists, even if only one inner list is present.\"\n    \"rationale\": str, // A string containing a natural language explanation for the following answer\n    \"answer\": str // A string representing the value of min_parking_spaces extracted from the text. Answer must include units and must be normalized, e.g. (sqr. ft. becomes sq ft)\n}\n\nThe range for min_parking_spaces is typically between 1 and 20 (per dwelling unit, square feet of floor area, etc.). Please focus on values within this range when searching for min_parking_spaces and provide the answer as a decimal value with unit (e.g., 1 parking space per unit plus 1 guest parking space for every 4 units should be calculated as \"1.25 per unit\").

ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\nPart I. Zoning Districts\nSection 9.1 Residential Districts Established.\n(a)\nThe following residential districts are hereby established: RA, R-20, R-14, R-10, and\nR-5. Each of these districts is designed and intended to secure for the persons who reside there a\ncomfortable, healthy, safe, and pleasant environment in which to live, sheltered from incompatible\nand disruptive activities that properly belong in nonresidential districts. Other objectives of some of\nthese districts are explained in the remainder of this section.\n(b)\nThe RA District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for very\nlow-density, single-family residential and agricultural purposes (1 dwelling unit per 5 acres). The\nregulations of this district are intended to protect prime agricultural land, as defined by the Soil\nConservation Service, from an influx of users likely to render it undesirable for farms and\nlow-density residential development.\n(c)\nThe R-20 District is established to allow a variety of single-family residential agricultural\nland uses, at a low-density of approximately 2.1 dwelling units per acre, which are interspersed with\nlarge, undeveloped open areas.\n(d)\nThe R-14 District is established to allow principally single-family residences and other\ncompatible uses permitted by major special use permit at a density of approximately 3.1 dwelling\nunits per acre. (Amended 9/14/2021)\n(e)\nThe R-10 District is established as a district in which to allow primarily single-family and\ntwo-family residences and other compatible uses permitted by major special use permit at a density\nof approximately 4.13 dwelling units per acres. (Amended 9/14/2021)\n(f)\nThe R-5 District is established as a district in which to allow primarily single-family,\ntwo-family and multi-family residences at a medium density of approximately 8.7 dwelling units per\nacre.\n(g)\nThe R-40 District is established as a district in which to allow primarily single-family\nresidential and agricultural land uses, at a low-density of one dwelling per acre. (Amended 5/12/92)\nSection 9.2 Commercial Districts Established.\n(a)\nThe following commercial districts are hereby established: MA, CD, CN, CH, OS, and\nSC. Each of these districts is created to accomplish the purposes and serve the objectives set forth\nin the remainder of this section.\n(b)\nThe MA District is established as a district in which to allow health care facilities\nincluding hospitals, medical and dental offices and clinics, and related health care uses.\n(c)\nThe CD District is established as a district in which to accommodate a wide variety of\ncommercial activities (particularly those that are pedestrian-oriented) in an intensive development\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 9/14/2021\n9-1\n\n\nNEW PAGE 105\npattern in the town's central business district. The regulations of this district are intended to (i)\npreserve the general character and integrity of the current development in the central business\ndistrict; (ii) encourage land uses which provide for a multi-purpose central business district including\nretail, offices, services, entertainment, and living space; (iii) encourage land uses which do not\nrequire large amounts of outdoor use areas; and (iv) encourage common or shared off-street\nparking.\n(d) The CN District is established as a district in which to allow small, limited retail service\nland uses which provide goods and services primarily to surrounding residential neighborhoods.\nThe major objectives of this district are to (i) encourage the location of convenience retail\nestablishments, professional services, and professional offices so as to be as compatible as\npossible with surrounding residential uses; (ii) discourage intensive land uses which require large\namounts of land area; and (iii) limit large vehicular traffic-generating uses to major streets\n(e)\nThe CH District is established as a district in which to accommodate highway-oriented\nretail and commercial service businesses which generally have as their market area the entire town\nand surrounding area. The major objectives of this district are to (i) encourage planned commercial\nand office parks; (ii) discourage small lot development on major highways; (iii) encourage vehicular\naccess from service drives and other local commercial streets rather than directly from arterial\nstreets; and (iv) provide a location for major shopping facilities and land uses requiring large\noutdoor spaces.\n(f)\nThe os District is designed to accommodate office and service uses as well as\nmedium-density residential uses. The major objectives of this district are to (1) encourage land\nuses which serve as an adequate buffer between intensive non-residential and residential uses; (2)\nprovide aesthetic controls and dimensional requirements to ensure compatible office and service\ndevelopment with surrounding residential uses; and (3) encourage a mixture of medium-density\nresidential uses with offices and services.\n(g)\nThe CS District is designed to accommodate well planned shopping centers serving the\ncommunity and regional marketplace. The major objectives of this district are to (1) encourage\nattractive and orderly shopping center development, (2) promote unified site design, pedestrian\ncirculation and traffic control within the shopping center complex, (3) provide opportunities for\ncoordinated transportation planning for ingress and egress, and (4) promote urban design and\ncorridor landscape improvements which are compatible with the Town's comprehensive planning\ngoals. (Amended 3/99)\nSection 9.3 Industrial Districts Established.\nThe IW District is established as a district in which to allow primarily light manufacturing,\nassembly, research, warehousing, and intensive commercial uses. The regulations of this district\nare intended to (i) encourage light manufacturing and intensive commercial uses as well as\naccessory land uses incidental to and in support of manufacturing uses; (ii) exclude heavy industry,\nmajor retail, and residences as acceptable land uses; and (iii) preserve locations that are best\nsuited for industrial development. Land uses in the IW District are limited to those determined to be\ncompatible with the character of the community. Uses permitted in the IW Districts are restricted to\nthe SIC code-designated uses delineated in Section 10.1.\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 9/14/2021\n9-2\n\n\nNEW PAGE 106\nSection 9.4 Overlay Districts Established\n(a) Four special control overlay districts are hereby established: FHO (Flood Hazard\nOverlay), AHO (Airport Hazard Overlay) HO (Historic Overlay) and BSR (South Broad Street\nResidential Overlay). These special control overlay districts are intended to be superimposed over\nthe underlying general zoning district and the land so encumbered may be used in a manner\npermitted in the underlying district only if and to the extent such use is also permitted in the\napplicable overlay district. The specific objectives of each of these overlay districts are explained in\nthe remainder of this section.\n(b)\nThe FHO District is established as an overlay district of all general zoning districts for\nthe purpose of protecting people and property from the hazards of flooding. The flood hazard\ndistricts are further described in Part I of Article 16 of this ordinance.\n(c)\nThe AHO District is established as an overlay district of all general zoning districts in\nthe vicinity of the Edenton Municipal Airport. The purpose of the AHO is to protect the airport\nenvirons from encroachment of incompatible land uses which present hazards to users of the\nairport as well as to persons residing or working in the airport vicinity. The additional regulations\nimposed in the AHO are designed to (i) place additional height restrictions on buildings and trees;\n(ii) control the above-ground storage of flammable materials; and (iii) control the locations of\nhigh-density residential uses and places of assembly. The additional regulations governing land\ndevelopment in the AHO district are delineated in Section 11.14.\n(d)\nThe HO District is established as an overlay district for all general zoning districts that\ncontain structures or other facilities of historic significance. The purpose of the HO is to protect and\nconserve the heritage and character of the Edenton community by providing for the preservation of\ndesignated areas within the planning jurisdiction. No new historic districts nor any change to the\nboundaries of any existing historic district shall be designated until the North Carolina Department\nof Cultural Resources shall have been given an opportunity, in accordance with Chapter 160D,\nArticle 9, Part 4 of the N.C. General Statutes, to make recommendations with respect to the\nestablishment of such new district or change in the boundaries of an existing district. The additional\nregulations governing land development in the HO district are delineated in Section 11.15.\n(Amended 9/14/2021)\n(e)\nThe RCO District is established as an overlay district of all general zoning districts for\nthe purpose of establishing streetscape appearance and pedestrian and bicycle circulation\nrecommendations along six main road corridors that lead into downtown Edenton. The additional\nregulations governing land development in the RCO districts are delineated in Section 11.36.\n(f)\nThe BSR overlay district is established as an overlay district for an area of Broad Street\nlocated in the CD (Downtown Commercial) zoning district. The purpose of the overlay district is to\nprohibit residential uses in the first floor of structures fronting on South Broad Street.\nSection 9.5 Conditional Zoning District.\nThe conditional zoning district (CZD) allows a site to be developed with a mixture of land uses\naccording to an approved overall site plan. For example, a large tract may be developed with a mix\nof single-family and multi-family housing, with part of the site also devoted to commercial and office\nuses. The CZD allows for greater flexibility in dimensional standards (such as lot sizes and\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 9/14/2021\n9-3\n\nNEW PAGE 107\nsetbacks) upon approval of an overall master plan for the entire development. The district does not\nrequire a rigid separation of different land uses. Uses are limited to the uses identified in Section\n10.1 Table of Permitted Uses. All of the site-specific standards and conditions, including a site plan,\nare incorporated into the zoning district regulations for the CZD. Approval of the site plan will\nestablish all zoning requirements for the subject property. A CZD district shall not be less than three\n(3) acres in area.\nThis negotiated approach to a legislative decision allows maximum flexibility to tailor regulations to\na particular site and project. But it also has great potential for abuse - both in terms of impacts on\nindividual landowners seeking approval and their neighbors and on the public interests zoning is\nsupposed to promote. Thus, special restrictions have been placed on conditional zoning.\nConditional Zoning Districts may only occur at the owner's request and cannot be imposed without\nthe owner's agreement. The individual conditions and site-specific standards that can be imposed\nare limited to those that are needed to bring a project into compliance with town ordinances and\nadopted plans and to those addressing the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by use of\nthe site. The town must assure that all of the factors defining reasonable spot zoning are fully\nconsidered and that the public hearing record reflects that consideration.\nConditional zoning provides important opportunities to carefully tailor regulations to address the\ninterest of the landowner, the neighbors, and the public. The town may use conditional zoning when\nit concludes that a particular project should be approved but that the standards in the comparable\nconventional zoning district(s) are insufficient to protect neighbors or public interests (perhaps\nbecause the conventional zoning allows other uses not suitable for the site or dimensional\nstandards inadequate to preserve the neighborhood). Conditional zoning often allows a developer\nto proceed with a project in a way that addresses site-specific concerns of neighbors and the Town\nof Edenton. The petitioner must consent in writing to all conditions imposed by the conditional\nzoning.
