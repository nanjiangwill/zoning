In the Mountain View-Shed District section:\n\"Buildings on areas of high elevation are highly visible from surrounding public spaces.

Without more explicit information about the height limit for R-1, I cannot provide a definitive answer.\n\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": null,\n    \"rationale\": \"The input does not contain a specific maximum height value for the Low Density Residential (R-1) zoning district.
