The document provides various development standards and regulations for multi-family districts, but does not specify a minimum unit size or floor area requirement for individual dwelling units in the R-8MF district.\n\nThe closest relevant information I found was:\n\n1. Minimum lot sizes for different dwelling types in R-8MF:\n   - Detached dwellings: 3,500 sq ft\n   - Duplex dwellings: 6,500 sq ft\n   - Triplex dwellings: 9,500 sq ft\n   - Quadraplex dwellings: 11,500 sq ft\n   - Multi-family dwellings: 11,500 sq ft\n\n2. Maximum residential density of 8.0 dwelling units per acre for R-8MF.\n\nHowever, these are not specifications for individual unit sizes, but rather for overall lot sizes and density. Without a clear statement of minimum unit size or floor area for individual dwelling units in R-8MF, I cannot provide a specific answer to the question about min_unit_size.\n\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": null,\n    \"rationale\": \"The provided text contains development standards for the R-8MF district, including lot sizes and density, but does not specify a minimum unit size or floor area for individual dwelling units.
