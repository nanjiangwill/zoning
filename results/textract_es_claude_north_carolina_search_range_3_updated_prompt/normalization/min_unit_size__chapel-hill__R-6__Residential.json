Without seeing a clear statement about minimum unit size for R-6 single-family homes, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the question.\n\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": null,\n    \"rationale\": \"The document contains zoning information for the R-6 district, including lot size and dimensional requirements, but does not appear to specify a minimum unit size or floor area for single-family dwellings in this district.\",\n    \"answer\": null\n}", "extracted_text": null, "rationale": "The document contains zoning information for the R-6 district, including lot size and dimensional requirements, but does not appear to specify a minimum unit size or floor area for single-family dwellings in this district.", "answer": null}, "normalized_answer": null}]}
