The document provides detailed information about buffer requirements, permitted uses, and development standards for this overlay district, but does not specify a minimum lot size.\n\nThe closest relevant information I found was in Section 10.506, which provides a table of development standards. However, this table does not list a specific minimum lot size for the Mountain Island Lake Watershed Overlay district. Instead, it refers to the underlying zoning district requirements with an asterisk (*) for minimum lot area in the Protected Areas (PA1, PA2, PA3).\n\nGiven the lack of a specific minimum lot size requirement for this overlay district, I cannot provide a definitive answer. The minimum lot size would likely depend on the underlying base zoning district requirements.\n\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": null,\n    \"rationale\": \"The provided text does not specify a minimum lot size requirement for the Mountain Island Lake Watershed Overlay district.
