The table on page 68 provides lot area requirements for different uses in various zoning districts, including B-1, but it does not specify a minimum unit size for residential units in the B-1 district.\n\nThe closest relevant information I found was:\n\n1. For single-family dwellings in the B-1 district, the minimum lot area is 5,000 sq ft.\n2. For two-family dwellings in the B-1 district, the minimum lot area is 9,100 sq ft.\n3. For multifamily dwellings in the B-1 district, the minimum lot area is 5,000 sq ft for the first dwelling unit, 4,100 sq ft for the second dwelling unit, and 4,100 sq ft for each additional dwelling unit.\n\nHowever, these are lot area requirements, not minimum unit sizes. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer for the min_unit_size in the General Business (B-1) district based on the given information.\n\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": null,\n    \"rationale\": \"The provided text does not contain specific information about the minimum unit size (min_unit_size) for the General Business (B-1) zoning district.
