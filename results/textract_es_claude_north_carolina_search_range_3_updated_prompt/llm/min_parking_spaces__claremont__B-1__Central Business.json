The document mentions the following regarding parking in the B-1 district:\n\n\"Off-street parking and loading requirements. Off-street parking and loading requirements shall be provided for all uses as required by Article H of this chapter.\"\n\nHowever, Article H states:\n\n\"Off-street parking space shall be provided in accordance with this article in all districts, except the B-1 Central Business District, if adequate public or on-street parking is available within fifty (50) feet of the property. However, if provided in the B-1 District, off-street parking spaces shall be provided at one (1) space per five hundred (500) square feet of gross floor area and comply with the applicable landscaping requirements.\"\n\nSo there is no specific minimum parking requirement for the B-1 district, unless off-street parking is provided, in which case it would be 1 space per 500 sq ft of gross floor area.\n\nGiven this, I cannot provide a definitive answer about minimum parking spaces for the Central Business District (B-1).
