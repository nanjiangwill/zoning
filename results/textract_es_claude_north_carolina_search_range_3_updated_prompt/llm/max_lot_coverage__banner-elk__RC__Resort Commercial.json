Without more context, I cannot confidently determine if this represents the maximum lot coverage for buildings only. Therefore, I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer about the maximum lot coverage for the RC district.\n\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": null,\n    \"rationale\": \"The provided text does not contain a clear specification of maximum lot coverage for buildings only in the Resort Commercial (RC) zoning district.
