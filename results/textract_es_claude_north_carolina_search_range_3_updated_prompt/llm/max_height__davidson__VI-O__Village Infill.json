In the Village Height Overlay District (VH-O), which appears to be a subset of the Village Infill area, buildings are limited to 3 stories (page 96).\n\n2. Table 2-64 on page 98 provides maximum heights for different Village Infill Overlay Districts, ranging from 32' to 35' depending on the specific overlay color.\n\n3. Section 4.4.1 on page 129 discusses how building height is measured generally, but does not give a specific limit for VI-O.\n\nWithout a clear maximum height stated for the overall Village Infill (VI-O) district, I cannot provide a definitive answer.
