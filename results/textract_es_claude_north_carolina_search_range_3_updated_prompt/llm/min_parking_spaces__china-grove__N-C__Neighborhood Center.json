The document does not provide a clear minimum parking requirement for this district. However, there are a few relevant points:\n\n1. Section 10.2.1 D states: \"The minimum parking ratios of Section 10.2.1A shall be reduced by 30% for all uses within N-C and H-B Districts.\"\n\n2. Section 10.2.1 E mentions: \"Parking for a minimum of two bicycles shall be required for all uses within N-C and H-B Districts.\"\n\n3. There are general parking ratios provided in the table in Section 10.2.1 A for different uses, but these are not specific to the N-C district.\n\nGiven this information, I cannot provide a definitive answer for the minimum parking spaces required in the Neighborhood Center (N-C) district. The requirements seem to be based on the use type and then reduced by 30% from the general ratios, but there's no clear single value provided.\n\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": [[\"The minimum parking ratios of Section 10.2.1A shall be reduced by 30% for all uses within N-C and H-B Districts.\", 164]],\n    \"rationale\": \"This statement indicates that the N-C district has reduced parking requirements compared to the general ratios, but does not provide a specific minimum number of spaces.\",\n    \"answer\": null\n}", "extracted_text": [["The minimum parking ratios of Section 10.2.1A shall be reduced by 30% for all uses within N-C and H-B Districts.", 164]], "rationale": "This statement indicates that the N-C district has reduced parking requirements compared to the general ratios, but does not provide a specific minimum number of spaces.", "answer": null}]}
