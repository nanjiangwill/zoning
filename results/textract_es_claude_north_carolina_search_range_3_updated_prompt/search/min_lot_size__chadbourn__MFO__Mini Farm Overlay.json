Intent. The Mini Farm Overlay District (MFO) permits buildings to be grouped\non a site, parcel, or property in order to optimize the use of land and resources for\nboth residential and agricultural purposes. By clustering development at a density\nno greater than 1.15 unit per developed acre, projects developed in accordance\nwith these standards can obtain density bonuses while preserving unique natural\nfeatures for agricultural use. The Mini Farm Overlay District mandates the\ndedication of both agricultural land and open space with density bonuses provided\nas an incentive for adhering to the standards. It is the intent of this district to be\nused for new development in undeveloped outlying areas of the Town. Allowed\nbuilding/lot type is Detached House.\n(B.) Applicability. The provisions set forth below may be applied, upon designation\nof the property as a Mini Farm Overlay District, to properties with a minimum size\nof 66 acres in the Agricultural zoning district. The provisions of this section shall\nnot be applicable in platted and recorded residential subdivisions.\n(C.) Listed Uses: See underlying Primary General-Use District for Listed Uses.\n(D.) Listed Building and Lot Type: Detached House\n(E.) Development standards.
