Once a LI-CZD is established, a property owner may submit final plans applications to the town manager for review and approval in\naccordance with the standards of this appendix and the conditions and rezoning plan attached to the conditional zoning district rezoning approval.\nb) Purpose.\nThe LI-CZD district is intended to support and encourage job-creating uses that fit Chapel Hill's character and desired brand of being a place for creative, sustainable and entrepreneurial\ncompanies to start, grow or relocate. Encouraged uses include research activities; manufacturing, light; food processing, light and flex space, and associated support functions serving both the\nneeds of the community and region. A LI-CZD may only be applied to areas designated as innovative, light industrial opportunity area on the land use plan as adopted and amended by the town\ncouncil.\nA LI-CZD is intended to be applied to areas within the Town limit so that municipal services can be provided to properties containing innovative, light industrial uses that will need the full range of\nmunicipal services such as police, fire, public works, transit, and building inspections. It is further intended to increase the town's non-residential tax base, provide a place for innovative, light industrial\nbusinesses to locate, and to promote a healthy and sustainable economy in order to provide the range of services desired by the community and necessary to maintain public health, safety, and welfare.\nc) Standards applicable to development in a LI-CZD.\n1) Intent: The standard conditions applicable to a LI-CZD are intended to foster an efficient use of land-enabling productive use of limited developable land in Chapel Hill and allowing for\nenhanced protection of environmentally-sensitive areas that may be present on a lot. Development in a LI-CZD shall be designed in a manner that provides a mix of non-residential uses which\narea integrated, interrelated, and linked by non-vehicular connections and vehicular connections consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan and its various adopted elements.\nDevelopment shall be designed in a manner to be congruent with adjacent land uses, and mitigate impacts to surrounding properties to the full extent required by this appendix.\n2) Standard conditions:\nA. The following standard conditions, contained within subdivisions (c)(3)-(c)(8), apply to development within a LI-CZD and shall be included in a conditional zoning district rezoning approval.\nB.

The town council, in approving a conditional zoning district rezoning may determine that additional and/or alternate standards are appropriate provided that the intent of the LI-CZD\nstandards have been met to an equal or greater degree.\n3) Stormwater management performance criteria.\nA. Stormwater management is required in accordance with section 5.4 \"Stormwater Management\" of this appendix except as listed below to provide additional protections to ensure that the\nimpacts of innovative, light industrial development are mitigated on surrounding properties and the community as a whole.\nB. Stormwater detention capacity: Stormwater detention/retention shall be designed to provide an additional ten (10) percent storage capacity above the volume required to meet the\nstormwater runoff rate criteria established for the 25-year 24-hour storm event in section 5.4.6(c) of this appendix.\nC.\nTotal suspended solids (TSS) removal: Notwithstanding section 5.4.6(a) of this appendix the minimum impervious area treated for eighty-five (85) percent average annual TSS removal shall\nbe fifty (50) percent of the post-construction total impervious area within the project's limits of land disturbance.\n4) Landscape buffer requirements.\nA. Landscape buffers are required in accordance with section 5.6.6 of this appendix except as listed below.\nB. Proposed development that directly abuts a railroad track, does not require a buffer on that lot line.\nC.\nProposed development that abuts a lot within the innovative, light industrial opportunity area, as shown on the land use plan does not require a buffer on that lot.\nD. Proposed development abutting a non-Interstate, arterial street, shall require a Type B buffer on that lot line.\nE. Proposed development abutting vacant land zoned MU-R-1 or MU-OI-1 shall require a Type B buffer on that lot line.\n5) Landscape protection plan.\nA. Landscape protection plans are required in accordance with section 5.7.3 \"landscape protection\" of this appendix except that specimen trees are not required to be identified on\nlandscape protection plans. Rare trees and significant tree stands are required to be identified and protected in accordance with section 5.7 of this appendix.\n6) Parking and loading.\nA. Vehicular parking minimum and maximum ratios: To accommodate and encourage wide variety of innovative, light industrial, research activity, and flex space uses in the LI-CZD, an\nalternative parking ratio, differing up to thirty (30) percent of the ratios established in section 5.9.7 \"Parking Ratios\" of this appendix, may be granted by the town manager if, based on\nsubstantial evidence, the town manager finds that compliance with the full minimum off-street vehicular parking space requirements of section 5.9.7 of this appendix would not be\nrequired by the applicant's proposed use or that compliance with the maximum off-street vehicular parking space requirements would not provide enough parking spaces required by the\napplicant's proposed use.\nB. Loading docks shall be placed to the rear or side fa\u00e7ade of buildings and not on the same side as the primary public entrance.\nC. Placement of parking areas.

The district is designed to facilitate stated public policies to encourage\ndesign which emphasizes lively, people-oriented environments and compatible, visually interesting development. This district provides areas where moderate scale mixed use centers can locate\nwith an emphasis on development of a balance of residential, office and commercial uses.\nIt is further intended that the mixed use districts shall encourage development within which mutually supporting residential, commercial and office uses are scaled, balanced and located to\nreduce general traffic congestion by providing housing close to principal destinations, and convenient pedestrian and bicycle circulation systems and mass transit to further reduce the need for\nprivate automobile usage. Mixed use districts are intended to encourage development that allows multiple destinations to be achieved with a single trip. These standards encourage a design such\nthat uses within a mixed use district are arranged in a manner that encourages internal vehicular trip capture and the development patterns that encourage walking, transit and bicycling as\nalternatives to automotive travel.\nWhen such districts adjoin residential development or residential zoning districts, it is intended that arrangement of buildings, uses, open space, and vehicular or pedestrian and bicycle access\nshall be such as to provide appropriate transition and reduce potentially adverse effects.\n(a) The mixed-use village conditional zoning district (MU-V-CZD) is permitted only upon approval of a conditional zoning district rezoning application by the town council pursuant to section 4.4.5\nof this appendix.\n(b) Permitted uses and development intensities.\n(1) The uses permitted in the MU-V-CZD include the following:\nA. Vertical mixed-use buildings, or\nB. Uses listed in subsection (2), below, which are mixed horizontally. Uses are \"mixed horizontally\" where:\ni. Such uses comprise not less than the minimum, and not more than the maximum, percentage of floor area prescribed in subsection (b)(2)A, below; and\nii. Uses within a land use category set forth below, are located not further than eight hundred (800) feet from the uses located within another land use category;\niii. The uses within separate land use categories, as set forth below, are linked by a continuous system of sidewalks or trails. Sidewalks or trails shall be considered \"continuous\" if they\nare interrupted only by street intersections, but shall not be considered \"continuous\" if interrupted by natural or man-made barriers to pedestrian and bicycle movement or by\na\nstreet consisting of more than two (2) lanes of traffic, unless a pedestrian and bicycle island is provided.\n(c) Land use categories.\n(1) An MU-V shall include office, commercial, and residential uses as described below. The mix of floor area within a proposed development shall contain at least twenty-five (25) percent of\nthe floor area devoted to residential uses and at least twenty-five (25) percent of the floor area devoted to office/commercial uses.\n(2) For purposes of this section:\nA.
