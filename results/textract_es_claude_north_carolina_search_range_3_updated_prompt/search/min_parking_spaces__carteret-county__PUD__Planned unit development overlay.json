Application for a flexible planned unit development. Application for a project as a flexible PUD shall be submitted and reviewed in accordance with the\nCarteret County Subdivision Regulations. The planning commission shall subsequently make advisory recommendations to the board of county commissioners, which,\nfollowing a public hearing held pursuant to proper notice, shall make the final decision as to whether the application and plat will be approved or disapproved.\nThe following shall be shown on the plat:\n(Amd. of 11-3-04)\n3207. - Conditional planned unit development overlay. (Res. of\n3207.1. The planned unit development district is established to foster the blending of various land uses including, but not limited to, residential, light commercial,\noffice and recreational structures, which would not otherwise be possible under general district requirements. The purpose of this district is to promote economical\nand efficient patterns of land use which are sensitive to natural features and site amenities and allow for the accumulation of large areas of open space with the\nflexibility in design not afforded in other residential zoning districts. The planned unit development district is intended to provide flexibility within the constraints of the\ncounty's land use plan in situations where the owners of the property present a development plan which is found to be in the public interest and which provides\nnecessary urban services and improvements required by this ordinance and the county's policies for growth and development.\nThe planned unit development may focus on resort amenities, such as golf, tennis, swimming, boating, with occasional club buildings and supporting commercial\nestablishments for the PUD residents and their guests. All structures must be similar in design and structure to allow for a blending among land uses. The dedication of\ncommon open space shall be utilized as a tool to create a resort atmosphere as well as enhance the visual character of the development.\n68 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\nCELL (1, 1): \n.1 Proposed primary traffic circulation pattern.\nCELL (1, 2): \n.1 Proposed primary traffic circulation pattern.\na) All 404 wetland areas on the tract.\nb) Proposed means of compliance with division of environmental management stormwater regulations.\nCELL (2, 1): \n.2 Proposed parks, tennis courts, swimming pools, beaches, golf course, boating docks, playgrounds, community buildings, common open space, etc.;\nCELL (2, 2): \n.2 Proposed parks, tennis courts, swimming pools, beaches, golf course, boating docks, playgrounds, community buildings, common open space, etc.;\nCELL (3, 1): \n.3 Proposed means of dedication of common open space areas and facilities, and the organizational arrangements for the ownership, maintenance, and\nCELL (3, 2): \n.3 Proposed means of dedication of common open space areas and facilities, and the organizational arrangements for the ownership, maintenance, and\npreservation of common open space, wetlands and stormwater management facilities;\nCELL (4, 1): \n.4 Delineation of the sections, units or phases to be constructed in progression or sequence in a master plan concept which will be the basis for approval\nCELL (4, 2): \n.4 Delineation of the sections, units or phases to be constructed in progression or sequence in a master plan concept which will be the basis for approval\nsubject to accepted and approved changes by the Carteret County Planning Commission and the Carteret County Board of Commissioners;\nCELL (5, 1): \n.5 When required by the planning department, planning commission, or the board of county commissioners, an environmental impact statement will be\nCELL (5, 2): \n.5 When required by the planning department, planning commission, or the board of county commissioners, an environmental impact statement will be\nsubmitted.

The approval process is outlined in section\n3207.9 of this ordinance.\n3207.2. District regulations.\n3207.3. Open space requirements. Open space shall be defined as an area or facility designated on the PUD master plan as \"common area\" which will be held in\nownership for the use and benefit of residents of the dwelling units. Common open spaces may contain structures and improvements desirable for religious,\neducational, noncommercial, recreational or cultural uses. To qualify as common open space, land shall have a minimum width of 20 feet that is unoccupied by street\nrights-of-way, drives, parking areas or structures other than recreational structures. In waterfront developments, required open space may be utilized in conjunction\nwith public water access facilities prescribed by the Carteret County Subdivision Regulations. Certain open space areas, such as golf courses or tennis courts, may be\nprovided as open space and held in private ownership. If approved as open space for the PUD, a use dedication shall be required for the open space area at the time of\nrecordation of the final plat.\na) Location of open space. Open space may be natural or landscaped for the use of active or passive recreation and should be located so as to be\nconveniently accessible to all residents of the development.\nb) Conveyance and maintenance of open space. All common open space designated on the master plan and recorded in the office of the register of deeds,\nmust be conveyed by the following method:\n1. By leasing or conveying title (including beneficial ownership) to a corporation, association or other legal entity as indicated in section 3207.7\n(Homeowner's association). The terms of such lease or other instrument of conveyance must include provisions suitable to the planning commission\nfor guarantees of:\n.01 The continued use of such land for its intended purposes through provisions in deeds to each parcel to be served by the common area or facility;\n.02 Responsibility for and continuance of proper maintenance for the portions of the open space requiring maintenance;\n.03\nAssurance that the open space shall be made available in its improved state as set forth on the site development plan in accordance with an\napproved time schedule;\n.04 Financial arrangements shall be made to ensure the improvement and/or maintenance of said common space facilities;\n.05 A legally binding use dedication shall be recorded at the time of final approval for open space areas dedicated to specific uses, such as golf\ncourses, tennis courts, playgrounds, etc.\nc) Amount of open space required. PUD developments shall reserve no less than 25 percent of the gross tract acreage as open space. Said open space shall\nbe proportionally distributed throughout the total residential area as nearly as possible.\nd)\nSubstitution of amenities for open space. When deemed appropriate by the planning commission, an amenity may be approved as a substitute for the\nrequired open space in any phase of the project. If an amenity is approved as all or part of the required open space, performance guarantees may be\nrequested if said amenity is not completely constructed upon presentation for final approval.\n3207.4. Maximum density standards. High density development shall be encouraged where adequate public services are available and where environmental\nimpacts will be minimal.

This provision is not to be used for occupancy when a home is in disrepair. In the case of a non-residential use\ndamaged by fire, flood, hurricane, tornado, or the like, a commercial modular with approved occupancy, as per North Carolina State Building Code may be used.\nAny temporary structure must meet setbacks for that zoning district and all other applicable regulations (CAMA, FEMA, Environmental Health, etc.).

The director is authorized to\ngrant an extension not to exceed 365 days from the initial date of the damage.\nTemporary provisions shall also be allowed in the event repair or replacement is being made pursuant to a governmental grant or program. However, any\ntemporary structure shall be removed within 180 days or 30 days after the issuance of an occupancy permit for the dwelling or the installation of the manufactured\nhome, whichever comes first.\nThis provision is not intended to allow extension of a nonconforming use.\n(Ord. of 7-16-12(5))\n3200. - CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICTS\nFootnotes:\n(4)\nEditor's note- Res. of 6-21-21 amended the title of Section 3200 to read as set out herein. Formerly, Section 3200 had been titled \"Conditional Use Districts.\"\n3201. Purpose.\n3201.1. Conditional zoning district. This ordinance contains regulations which establish zoning districts and assign land uses to one or more of these districts. The\nordinance also provides standards for development which regulate lot size, yards, parking and open space. There are, however, certain circumstances which often arise\nwhen a general zoning district designation would not be appropriate for a certain property, but a specific use or uses permitted under the district would be consistent\nwith the objectives of this ordinance. In order to accommodate this situation, this section establishes the conditional zoning district process.\nThe conditional zoning district process is established to address those situations involving a rezoning when a particular use or uses may be acceptable but the\ngeneral classification which would allow that use would not be acceptable. It allows the board of county commissioners to approve a rezoning proposal for a specific\nuse with reasonable conditions to assure the compatibility of the use with surrounding properties. This is a voluntary procedure which is intended for firm\ndevelopment proposals. It is not intended or suited for securing early zoning for tentative proposals which may not be undertaken for some time.\n(Res. 6-21-21)\n3202. - Application and review process.\nThe following process applies to the conditional zoning district:\n3202.1. Application. Rezoning petitions to establish a conditional zoning district must be submitted to the Carteret County Planning Department and will be\nprocessed in accordance with the procedure for zoning amendments described in Chapter 1300, as well as the provisions of this section. A conditional zoning district\nclassification will be considered only if the application is made by the owner of the property or his/her authorized agent. All applications must include a schematic plan\ndrawn to scale and any supporting text for the ordinance amendment. The applicant should include at least the items listed below: (Amended 10-19-09)\n(Res. 6-21-21)\n.01 A boundary survey showing the total acreage, present zoning classification(s), date, and North arrow;\n66 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\n\nNEW PAGE 67\nCarteret County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blar\n.02 The owners' names, addresses, and the tax parcel numbers of all abutting properties as shown on the tax records of Carteret County;\n.03 All existing easements, reservations, and rights-of-way and all yards required for the zoning district requested;\n.04 Proposed use of land and structures. For residential uses, this should include the number of units and an outline of the area where the structures will be\nlocated. For non-residential uses, this should include the approximate square footage of all structures and an outline of the area where the structures\nwill be located; and\n.05 Traffic, parking, and circulation plans, showing the proposed locations and arrangement of parking spaces and access points to adjacent streets.\n3202.2. Additional requirements. It may be necessary to request additional information in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding\narea. Therefore, the planning commission and/or board of county commissioners may request additional information as they deem necessary. This information may\ninclude, but is not limited to, the items listed below:\n.01 Proposed screening, including walls, fences, or planting areas as well as treatment of any existing natural features;\n.02 Delineation of areas within the regulatory flood zone, as shown on the official FEMA flood zone maps for Carteret County;\n.03 Existing and proposed topography at 2-foot contour intervals or less;\n.04 Generalized information on the number, height, size, and the location of structures;\n.05 Proposed number and location of signs;\n.06 Proposed phasing, if any, and approximate completion time of the project.\nThe application for [the establishment of] a conditional zoning district must contain information and/or site plans which indicate all of the principal and accessory\nuses which are proposed to be developed on the site. Subsequent to the approval of a conditional zoning district, only those principal and accessory uses indicated on\nthe approved plan may be constructed on the site. Any substantial modifications to an approved plan, including any changes in the permitted principal or accessory\nuses, must comply with the provisions of section 3202.5.\n(Res. 6-21-21)\n3202.3. Review and approval. In considering an application for the establishment of a conditional zoning district, the board of county commissioners may attach\nreasonable and appropriate conditions to the location, nature, and extent of the proposed use. Any conditions should relate to the relationship of the proposed use to\nsurrounding property, proposed support facilities such as parking, screening and buffer areas, the timing of development and other matters that the board may find\nappropriate or the petitioner may propose. The conditions may not include architectural review or controls. The petitioner will have a reasonable opportunity to\nconsider and respond to any such additional requirements prior to final action by the board of county commissioners. If any conditions are included as part of the\nrezoning, the petitioner shall agree in writing to all applicable conditions within 30 (thirty) days of the decision. The conditional zoning district approval will not become\neffective until such written agreement is recorded in the Carteret County Register of Deeds. If the petitioner does not agree to the conditions in writing within 30 (thirty)\ndays following the date of the decision, the conditional zoning district will be deemed null and void.\nIn evaluating an application for the establishment of a conditional zoning district, it is appropriate for the board of county commissioners to consider the following:\n.01 The policies and objectives of the Carteret County Land Use Plan, particularly in relation to the use, proposed site, and surrounding area;\n.02\nThe potential adverse impacts to the surrounding area, of, but not limited, to traffic, storm water drainage, land values, and compatibility of land use\nactivities.\nIn the review and approval of a conditional zoning district, emphasis will be given to evaluation of the characteristics of the specific use proposed in relationship to\nsurrounding properties.\n3202.4. Effect of approval. If an application is approved, the conditional zoning district that is established and all conditions which may have been attached to the\napproval are binding on the property. All subsequent development and use of the property must be in accordance with the approved plan and conditions.\nThe intent of this type of zoning is to provide an alternative procedure for specific development proposals. It is intended that all property be rezoned only in\naccordance with firm plans to develop.\n3202.5. Alterations to an approved conditional zoning district. Changes to approved plans and conditions of development will be treated the same as changes to the\nzoning map and will be processed as an amendment as provided for in section 1300. However, minor changes in the detail of the approved plan which will not alter the\nbasic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property, which will not alter the uses permitted or increase the density of development, and which will not\ndecrease the off-street parking ratio or reduce the yards provided at the boundary of the site may be approved by the planning director without going through the\namendment process. The planning director, at his (her) discretion, may elect not to allow any proposal as a minor change and will, in that event, forward the detailed\napplication for changes to the planning commission and/or board of county commissioners for their consideration.

A mix of commercial, single-family and group housing shall be allowed within the flexible PUD tract but the following criteria must be\nmet: (Res. 6-21-21)\n.1 The overall density of single-family and multifamily units shall not exceed 2.9 units per acre for the project's net acreage. The net acreage shall mean the\nentire tract, minus ten percent for necessary infrastructure. Commercial land uses shall not be included within the tract net acreage;\n.2 The total number of units (single-family or multifamily) shall not exceed eight in number for any single designated acre within the project;\n.3 No residential units shall exceed 50' in height.

(Res. of\n3207.1. The planned unit development district is established to foster the blending of various land uses including, but not limited to, residential, light commercial,\noffice and recreational structures, which would not otherwise be possible under general district requirements. The purpose of this district is to promote economical\nand efficient patterns of land use which are sensitive to natural features and site amenities and allow for the accumulation of large areas of open space with the\nflexibility in design not afforded in other residential zoning districts. The planned unit development district is intended to provide flexibility within the constraints of the\ncounty's land use plan in situations where the owners of the property present a development plan which is found to be in the public interest and which provides\nnecessary urban services and improvements required by this ordinance and the county's policies for growth and development.\nThe planned unit development may focus on resort amenities, such as golf, tennis, swimming, boating, with occasional club buildings and supporting commercial\nestablishments for the PUD residents and their guests. All structures must be similar in design and structure to allow for a blending among land uses. The dedication of\ncommon open space shall be utilized as a tool to create a resort atmosphere as well as enhance the visual character of the development.\n68 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\nCELL (1, 1): \n.1 Proposed primary traffic circulation pattern.\nCELL (1, 2): \n.1 Proposed primary traffic circulation pattern.\na) All 404 wetland areas on the tract.\nb) Proposed means of compliance with division of environmental management stormwater regulations.\nCELL (2, 1): \n.2 Proposed parks, tennis courts, swimming pools, beaches, golf course, boating docks, playgrounds, community buildings, common open space, etc.;\nCELL (2, 2): \n.2 Proposed parks, tennis courts, swimming pools, beaches, golf course, boating docks, playgrounds, community buildings, common open space, etc.;\nCELL (3, 1): \n.3 Proposed means of dedication of common open space areas and facilities, and the organizational arrangements for the ownership, maintenance, and\nCELL (3, 2): \n.3 Proposed means of dedication of common open space areas and facilities, and the organizational arrangements for the ownership, maintenance, and\npreservation of common open space, wetlands and stormwater management facilities;\nCELL (4, 1): \n.4 Delineation of the sections, units or phases to be constructed in progression or sequence in a master plan concept which will be the basis for approval\nCELL (4, 2): \n.4 Delineation of the sections, units or phases to be constructed in progression or sequence in a master plan concept which will be the basis for approval\nsubject to accepted and approved changes by the Carteret County Planning Commission and the Carteret County Board of Commissioners;\nCELL (5, 1): \n.5 When required by the planning department, planning commission, or the board of county commissioners, an environmental impact statement will be\nCELL (5, 2): \n.5 When required by the planning department, planning commission, or the board of county commissioners, an environmental impact statement will be\nsubmitted.

The notice will appear for the first\ntime no more than 25 days and no less than 10 days prior to the meeting or hearing date.\n3208.2 In addition, notice shall be given by first class mail to the owners of surrounding properties, as well as any others whose property (or any portion thereof) lies\nwithin 200 feet or two properties, whichever distance is greater, of any portion of the subject property or properties. Such notification must be mailed at least 10 (ten)\ndays in advance of the meeting/hearing date.\n3208.3 A sign shall be posted on the subject property or properties at least 10 (ten) days prior to the meeting or hearing date.\n(Ord. of 10-17-11(10); Res. of 2-20-23)\n3300. - SPECIAL USE PERMITS\n3301. Purpose.\nThis ordinance provides for certain uses to be located by right in certain districts where the uses are compatible with the purpose of the district and with other uses\nto be located in certain districts only by complying with additional development standards to ensure that same compatibility. However, certain uses which are basically\nin keeping with the intent and purposes of the district may have substantial impacts on the surrounding area and should only be allowed after a review of the specific\nproposal.\nIn order to ensure that these uses would be compatible with surrounding development and be in keeping with the purposes of the district in which they are\nproposed to be placed, they are not allowed to be established as a matter of right. They may be established only after a review and approval of a special use permit as\nrequired by this section.\n(Ord. of 12-19-11(7); Res. of 6-21-21)\n3302. Structure.\nUses that require special use permits vary greatly in their size, characteristics, impact on surrounding properties, impact on public facilities, and relationship to the\noverall health, safety, and welfare of the community. Because of this variation, this section establishes two classes of special use permits (\"major\" and \"minor\") that\ngroup the uses together based on their relative size, characteristics, and community impact.\nA. Major special use permit uses are those uses that, by virtue of the size, impact, or relationship to the overall health, safety, and general welfare of the\ncommunity, will be reviewed and approved by the board of county commissioners after a public hearing and recommendation from the Carteret County\n73 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\n\nNEW PAGE 74\nCarteret County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nPlanning Commission. Unless otherwise stated, all special use permit applications will be deemed to be minor special use permit applications.\nB.\nMinor special use permit uses are those uses that, by virtue of their more limited size, impact, or relationship to the overall health, safety, and general\nwelfare of the community, will be reviewed and approved by the planning commission.\n(Ord. of 12-19-11(7))\n3303. Application.\nA request for a major or minor special use permit will be considered only if requested by the owner of the property in question or an authorized agent of the\nproperty owner. Applications for all special use permits or amendments to any approved special use permit must be filed in the office of the planning department on\nthe forms provided by the planning staff. All applications must be accompanied by the proper fee to defray administrative and advertising expenses.\nAll applications for a special use permit must be accompanied by a site plan (drawn to scale) that includes at least the following information:\nA. A boundary survey showing the total acreage, zoning classification(s), date, and north arrow (with the north arrow oriented up, i.e., to the top of the\nmap);\nB. All existing easements, reservations and rights-of-way and all setbacks required for the zoning district requested;\nC. Proposed location of all structures, their approximate square area and general exterior dimensions;\nD. Proposed use of all land and structures;\nE. Traffic, parking, and circulation plan, showing proposed location and arrangement of parking spaces and ingress and egress to adjacent streets;\nF. Proposed screening, including walls, fences or planting areas, as well as treatment of any existing natural features.\n(Ord. of 10-19-09(7); Ord. of 12-19-11(7))\n3304. - Additional application requirements.\nWhen processing a special use permit application, it may be desirable to request additional information in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to\nthe surrounding area. Therefore, the planning commission and/or the board of county commissioners may require additional information. This may include, but is not\nlimited to, the following information:\nA. Delineation of areas within the regulatory flood zones, as shown on the county FEMA maps;\nB. Topography at four-foot contour intervals or less (existing and proposed);\nC. Proposed location of buildings, their general exterior dimensions, and number of floors;\nD. Proposed signs and their locations;\nE. Proposed phasing, if any, and approximate completion time of the project.\n(Ord. of 12-19-11(7))\n3305. Public notice.\nA. No major or minor special use permit may be issued until after a public hearing has been held on the request.\nB. The total amount of time allowed for the supporters or the opponents of a petition to present arguments at the hearing shall be determined at the time of\npublic hearing. At the hearing, the presiding officer will decide whether to grant all or part of the request for additional time.\nC. In cases involving a controversial matter and a large number of persons wish to speak at the public hearing in favor of or against a request, the planning\ncommission reserves the right to require those persons to sign up in advance of the public hearing in order to facilitate and organize the speakers. Persons\nwho do not register to speak in advance shall be allowed that right at the public hearing. If such a requirement for pre-registration is necessary, the\nadvertised public hearing notice shall clearly indicate this requirement.\n(Ord. of 10-19-09(7); Ord. of 10-17-11(11); Ord. of 12-19-11(7))\n3306. Hearing procedure.\nThe applicant has the burden of producing competent material and substantial evidence, tending to establish the existence of the facts and conditions which the\nappropriate section of this ordinance requires for the issuance of the special use permit.\nIn considering an application for a special use permit, the board of county commissioners or planning commission will consider, evaluate, and may attach\nreasonable and appropriate conditions to the location, nature and extent of the proposed use and its relation to surrounding property. Any such conditions may relate\nto parking areas and driveways, pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems, screening and buffer areas, the timing of development, and other matters the board of\ncounty commissioners or planning commission may find appropriate or that the applicant may propose.\n(Ord. of 12-19-11(7))\n3307. Effect of approval.\nAn approved application for a special use permit and all conditions that may be attached to the approval are binding on the property. All subsequent development\n74 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\n\nNEW PAGE 75\nCarteret County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nand use of the property must be in conformance with the special use permit and all plans, specifications, and conditions, unless terminated by procedures established\nbelow. It is unlawful to develop or use real property in violation of any approved special use permit, all additional conditions, or the resolution authorizing a special use\nof the property. The special use permit shall become effective after being duly recorded in the Carteret County Register of Deeds.\n(Ord. of 12-19-11(7))\n3308. Reapplication for a special use permit.\nIf an application for a special use permit is denied by the board of county commissioners or the planning commission, a reapplication for that special use on that\nproperty may not be instituted, unless, however, upon request of the property owner, the board of county commissioners or planning commission determine that\nthere have been sufficient changes in conditions or circumstances bearing on the property to warrant a reapplication.\nIn the case of a major special use permit, such a request must be submitted to the planning director with evidence to support the allegation that sufficient changes\nhave occurred. The planning director will submit the request to the planning commission who, in turn, will review the request and transmit its findings and\nrecommendations to the board of commissioners.\nIn the case of a minor special use permit, the applicant must submit the request to the planning director with evidence to support the allegation that sufficient\nchanges have occurred. The planning director will review the request and transmit his findings and recommendations to the planning commission for a final\ndetermination.\n(Ord. of 12-19-11(7))\n3309. - Modification of an approved special use permit.\nA. Modifications to an approved special use permit. The owner of property that is subject to an approved special use permit may petition for a modification of\nthe special use permit by following the same procedure as if applying for a new special use permit Applications for a modification must include a new site\nplan that identifies the proposed changes. Evidence presented at the hearing on the proposed modification will be limited to the effect of the proposal on\nthe original special use permit, any plans or conditions that were a part of the original special use permit, and the standards and requirements of the\nordinance under which the original special use permit was approved.\nB.\nAlterations to an approved preliminary or final plan. Changes to approved plans and conditions of development require planning commission approval.\nHowever, minor changes (as determined by the planning director) in the detail of the approved plan may be approved by the planning director without going\nthrough the plan amendment process, if the minor changes:\n1. Will not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property;\n2. Will not alter the uses permitted or increase the density of development; and\n3. Will not decrease the off-street parking ratio or reduce the yards provided at the site boundary\nIf the planning director, at his (her) discretion, determines that a proposal is not a minor change, the application for changes shall be forwarded to the planning\ncommission for its consideration.\n(Ord. of 7-19-10(5); Ord. of 12-19-11(7))\n3310. Revocation or termination.\nA. The special use permit shall be subject to revocation when a court has determined that a particular special use permit has been violated. After receipt of the\nfinal judgment and after the party responsible for the violation has had reasonable opportunity to correct the violation but has not, the board of county\ncommissioners or planning commission, whichever granted the original special use permit, will revoke the special use permit.\nSubsequent to the revocation of a special use permit, the special use must cease and the future use of the property must be in conformance with the standards of\nthis ordinance for the district where the property is located. Any use or development of the property commenced pursuant to the special use permit must conform, or\nbe brought into conformance with, the standards of the district where the property is located.\nB.\nTermination of a special use permit may be requested by the property owner or an authorized agent of the property owner. All applications for termination\nof a special use permit will be considered using the same process as a minor special use permit.\n(Ord. of 12-19-11(7))\n3311. - Conformance of existing special uses.\nUses listed in the various district regulations as special uses that were already in existence prior to being classified as special uses will be considered as conforming\nuses.
