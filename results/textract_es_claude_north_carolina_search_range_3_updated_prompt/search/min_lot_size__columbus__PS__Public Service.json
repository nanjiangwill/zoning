In no case, however, shall minimum lot area be\nless than specified in this table.\n(2) On all corner lots, a 15-foot side yard setback is required except in the CBD, where a five-foot side yard setback is\nrequired.\n(3) In the CBD, where adjacent buildings have front yard setbacks less than five feet, the minimum front setback may be\nequivalent to the adjacent properties.\n(4) Regulations pertaining to mobile home parks are contained in Chapter 150\n(5) Regulations pertaining to Mixed Use (MU) Districts and Traditional Neighborhood Districts (TND) are contained in \u00a7\u00a7\n154.066(A) and 154.066(B), respectively.\n(Ord., Art. IX, passed -\n\u00a7 154.067 BUILDING HEIGHT OVERLAY DISTRICTS.\n(A) Reason for regulation. It is recognized that two major characteristics of the town greatly contribute to the atmosphere,\ncultural heritage and appeal of the whole community. Specifically, the scenic mountain views bounding the town on the north\nand north west and the historic county courthouse located in the middle of town both offer a sense of place and community\nto the town's residents and add to the attractiveness of the area. It is further recognized that the height of buildings, if left\nunregulated or inadequately regulated, can detract from these two features. Therefore, building heights shall be regulated\nbased on the location of the subject building in relation to mountain view-sheds and to the historic county courthouse.\n(B) Establishment of Building Height Overlay Districts The boundaries of the Building Height Overlay Districts shall be\ndepicted on a map named the \"Town of Columbus Building Height Overlay District Map\" and shall be made part of this\nchapter upon adoption of this section.\n(C) Districts. For the purposes of determining maximum building heights, the town shall be divided into the following\nBuilding Height Overlay Districts:\n(1) General;\n(2) Courthouse; and\n(3) Mountain View-Shed.\n(D) General Building Height District. In this district no building shall be taller than 36 feet. However, if the average\nelevation (above mean sea level) of the ridgelines of existing adjacent buildings situated on lots having a common boundary\nwith the subject parcel upon which the proposed building is to be situated (adjacent lots that are vacant not being included in\nthis calculation) is less than the elevation (above mean sea level) determined by measuring 36 feet vertically from the\naverage grade of the proposed building envelope on the subject parcel, then the proposed building shall be no taller than\nthat average. In the event that the average elevation (above mean sea level) of the existing buildings' ridgelines on the\nsurrounding adjacent properties is such that the subject parcel is rendered unbuildable (meaning a single story building with\nan appropriate roof is not feasible), then the proposed building shall have a height not exceeding 29 feet. The determination\nthat a subject parcel is rendered unbuildable under this division (D) shall be at the discretion of the approving administrator,\nboard, or council.\n(E) Courthouse Building Height District. In this district no building's ridgeline shall have an elevation higher than the\nelevation defined by the plane of the soffit of the eave of the roof of the historic county courthouse; however, in no case shall\na buildings height be taller than 29 feet.\n(F) Mountain View-Shed District. Buildings on areas of high elevation are highly visible from surrounding public spaces.\nAs such, buildings in this district shall not be more than 29 feet tall.\n(G) Height. The height of a building shall be measured from the grade of the average grade of the property to the highest\nridge of the roof of the structure.\n(Ord., Art. IX, \u00a7 900, passed - -; Ord. passed - -)\n\u00a7 154.068 FLOOR AREA.\n(A) Potential. Large scale commercial development has the potential to pose many challenges to a relatively small\ncommunity such as the town. The development can overwhelm local police services, undermine a current diversified\ncommercial market, strain the character of the local community, cause excessive vehicular congestion, and can be difficult\nCELL (1, 1): \nIndustrial\nDistrict\n(IND)\nCELL (1, 2): \nSame as\nHC\nCELL (1, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (1, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (1, 5): \n80\nCELL (1, 6): \n30\nCELL (1, 7): \n60\nCELL (1, 8): \n10\nCELL (1, 9): \n20\nCELL (1, 10): \n50\nCELL (2, 1): \nPublic\nService\nDistrict (PD)\nCELL (2, 2): \nSame as\nHC\nCELL (2, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (2, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (2, 5): \n80\nCELL (2, 6): \n30\nCELL (2, 7): \n60\nCELL (2, 8): \n10\nCELL (2, 9): \n20\nCELL (2, 10): \n50\n\nNEW PAGE 25\nto handle once left vacant. As such, the town finds it necessary to limit the allowable floor area of commercial development\nin order to ensure that the development is carried out in a manner that is appropriate and consistent with the character of the\ntown.\n(B) Commercial development. The building footprint of any structure and any accessory structure in the aggregate to be\nused for any commercial enterprise shall not be larger than 10,000 square feet in size. The building's footprint shall be\nconstrued to mean the perimeter line created by the edge of the roof of any structure and building on a lot in the aggregate.\nFor the purposes of this section, the term commercial development shall include any development intended to be used or\npotentially used by for-profit enterprises, including manufacturing and industrial developments, except that those uses\nallowed within the town's Public Service District shall not be considered commercial. It is recognized that in certain\ncircumstances it may be appropriate to allow for a larger building footprint for commercial developments. In order for a\ncommercial structure proposed to have a footprint larger than 10,000 square feet to be constructed, a special use permit\nshall be obtained prior to the commencement of the development. See \u00a7\u00a7 154.082 and 154.083 below for details regarding\nthe issuance of a special use permit for large scale commercial developments.\n(C) Residential development. The building footprint of all newly constructed residential developments shall not be larger\nthan 35% of the lot on which the residential development is proposed to be erected.\n(D) Public service development. Development to be used for any land use allowed in the town's Public Service (PS)\nzoning district shall have no limit on the size of the building footprint.\n(Ord., Art. IX, \u00a7 901, passed -)\nCONDITIONAL AND SPECIAL USES\n\u00a7 154.080 CONDITIONAL USE DISTRICTS.\n(A) For each general use district established in 154.060 through 154.064 above, there is also established a\ncorresponding conditional use district as follows:\n(B) It is recognized that certain types of zoning districts would be inappropriate at certain locations in the absence of\nspecial conditions. Where the applicant for rezoning desires property to be rezoned to such a district in those situations, the\nConditional Use District (CUD) is a means by which the special conditions can be imposed in the furtherance of the\npurposes of this chapter. The Conditional Use District classification will be considered for rezoning only upon request of a\nproperty owner. If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these regulations is found to be illegal or invalid or if the\napplicant should fail to accept any condition, it is the intent of this chapter that the authorization of the conditional use permit\nshall be null and void and of no effect, and that proceedings shall be instituted to rezone the property to its previous zoning\nclassification.\n(C) Within a CUD, only those uses authorized as either permitted or conditional uses in the zoning district with which the\nCUD corresponds shall be permitted, and all other requirements of the corresponding district shall be met as minimum\nstandards. In addition, with a CUD no use shall be permitted except pursuant to a conditional use permit authorized by the\nTown Council, which shall specify the use or uses authorized. The permit may further specify the location on the property of\nthe proposed use or uses, the number of dwelling units, the location and extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots,\ndriveway and access streets, the location and extent of buffer areas, and other special purpose areas, the timing of\ndevelopment, the location and extent of right-of-way and other areas to be dedicated for public use, and other such matters\nas the applicant may propose as conditions upon the request, but not to include conditions not generally a part of land\ndevelopment controls. In granting a conditional use permit, the Town Council may impose additional reasonable and\nappropriate safeguards upon the permit as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose and intent of this chapter are\nserved, public welfare secured and substantial justice done.\n(D) In approving a Conditional Use District Rezoning, the Town Council shall make the following (in addition to the\nfindings for conditional use permits in \u00a7 154.081(C) below) affirmative findings:\n(1) That the use(s) requested is among those listed as an eligible use in the Conditional Use District in which the\nsubject property is located or is to be located; and\n(2) That the location and character of the Conditional Use District if developed according to the site specific plan will be\nreasonable and consistent with the surrounding area and with adopted plans of the town.\nCELL (1, 1): \n(1) CU-R-1 Conditional Use R-1 District;\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \n(2) CU-R-2

The Mixed-Use District (MU) is established to provide opportunities for compatible and sustainable re-\ndevelopment where underutilized commercial properties already exist. The existing auto-oriented street, lot, and building\ndesigns can create uncomfortable pedestrian environments; however, with careful site planning these areas will allow\na\ngreater number of residents to walk or bike to businesses and services with an interconnected network of streets and\nsidewalks. Dominant uses in this district are residential, retail and office. The Mixed-Use District is expected to serve\nColumbus residents as well as persons who travel from surrounding communities. The development pattern in this district\nacknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access provided to ensure safety for the motoring public.\nDevelopment standards in the Mixed-Use District ensure the creation of a pleasant auto-oriented environment while enabling\na compatible transition to uses in adjacent districts. This District is available for rezoning only with the consent of the\nproperty owner(s).\n(2) Residential density limits.\n(a) Single Family Detached:\n7 unit/acre;\n(b) Single Family Attached: 17 units/acre; and\n(c) Multifamily:\n28 units/acre.\n(3) Dimensional standards.\n(Unless a greater standard is otherwise required)\n(B) Regulations pertaining to Traditional Neighborhood Districts (TND).\n(1) Intent. The Traditional Neighborhood Development District (TND) provides for the development of new\nneighborhoods and the revitalization or extension of existing neighborhoods. These neighborhoods are structured upon a\nfine network of interconnecting pedestrian oriented streets and other public spaces. Traditional Neighborhood Developments\n(TND's) provide a mixture of housing types and prices, prominently sited civic or community building(s),\nstores/offices/workplaces, and churches to provide a balanced mix of activities.

Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 250 feet in length, must be accessed from a street providing internal or external\nconnectivity, shall be permanently terminated by a vehicular turnaround, and are listed only where topography makes a\nstreet connection impracticable\n4. Vehicular turnarounds of various configurations are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately\nprovided.\n5. Pedestrian connections should be provided as extensions of terminating streets where not precluded by\ntopography or other physical constraints.\n6. The average perimeter of all blocks within the TND should not exceed 1,350 feet. No block face should have a\nlength greater than 500 feet without a dedicated alley or pathway providing through access.\n7. A continuous network of rear alleys shall provide vehicular access to lots 49 feet or less in width.\n8. Utilities may run along alleys provided that a permanent public access and utility easement is recorded for the full\nlength of alley being used for utilities or public services such as garbage collection.\n9. TND streets shall be organized according to a hierarchy based on function, size, capacity, and design speed;\nstreets and rights-of-way are therefore expected to differ in dimension. The proposed hierarchy of streets shall be indicated\non the submitted site plan. Each street type in a TND shall be separately detailed. An array of elements that are combined to\nmeet the purposes of TND neighborhood streets: building placement line, optional utility allocation, sidewalk, planting strip,\ncurb and gutter, optional parallel parking, and travel lane(s). Alternative methods of assembling the required street elements\nwill be considered to allow neighborhood street designs that are most appropriate to setting and use.\n10. To prevent the buildup of vehicular speed, disperse traffic flow, and create a sense of visual enclosure, long\nuninterrupted segments of straight streets should be avoided. Methods to achieve this interruption include:\n(i) A street can be interrupted by intersections designed to calm the speed and disperse the flow of traffic and\nterminate vistas with a significant feature (building, park, natural feature);\n(ii) A street can be terminated with a public monument, specifically designed building facade, or a gateway to the\nensuing space;\n(iii) Perceived street length can be reduced by a noticeable street curve where the outside edge of the curve is\nbounded by a building or other vertical elements that hug the curve and deflect the view; and\n(iv) Other traffic calming configurations are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately provided.\n(c) Buildings and lots.\n1. All lots shall share a frontage line with a street or square; lots fronting a square shall be provided rear alley\naccess.\n2. Consistent build-to lines shall be established along all streets and public space frontages; build-to lines determine\nthe width and ratio of enclosure for each public street or space. A minimum percentage build-out at the build-to line shall be\nestablished on the plan along all streets and public square frontages.\n3. Large-scale, single use facilities (conference spaces, theaters, athletic facilities, etc.) shall generally occur behind\nor above smaller scale uses of pedestrian orientation.\n(d) Open space.

IX, passed -\n\u00a7 154.067 BUILDING HEIGHT OVERLAY DISTRICTS.\n(A) Reason for regulation. It is recognized that two major characteristics of the town greatly contribute to the atmosphere,\ncultural heritage and appeal of the whole community. Specifically, the scenic mountain views bounding the town on the north\nand north west and the historic county courthouse located in the middle of town both offer a sense of place and community\nto the town's residents and add to the attractiveness of the area. It is further recognized that the height of buildings, if left\nunregulated or inadequately regulated, can detract from these two features. Therefore, building heights shall be regulated\nbased on the location of the subject building in relation to mountain view-sheds and to the historic county courthouse.\n(B) Establishment of Building Height Overlay Districts The boundaries of the Building Height Overlay Districts shall be\ndepicted on a map named the \"Town of Columbus Building Height Overlay District Map\" and shall be made part of this\nchapter upon adoption of this section.\n(C) Districts. For the purposes of determining maximum building heights, the town shall be divided into the following\nBuilding Height Overlay Districts:\n(1) General;\n(2) Courthouse; and\n(3) Mountain View-Shed.\n(D) General Building Height District. In this district no building shall be taller than 36 feet. However, if the average\nelevation (above mean sea level) of the ridgelines of existing adjacent buildings situated on lots having a common boundary\nwith the subject parcel upon which the proposed building is to be situated (adjacent lots that are vacant not being included in\nthis calculation) is less than the elevation (above mean sea level) determined by measuring 36 feet vertically from the\naverage grade of the proposed building envelope on the subject parcel, then the proposed building shall be no taller than\nthat average. In the event that the average elevation (above mean sea level) of the existing buildings' ridgelines on the\nsurrounding adjacent properties is such that the subject parcel is rendered unbuildable (meaning a single story building with\nan appropriate roof is not feasible), then the proposed building shall have a height not exceeding 29 feet. The determination\nthat a subject parcel is rendered unbuildable under this division (D) shall be at the discretion of the approving administrator,\nboard, or council.\n(E) Courthouse Building Height District. In this district no building's ridgeline shall have an elevation higher than the\nelevation defined by the plane of the soffit of the eave of the roof of the historic county courthouse; however, in no case shall\na buildings height be taller than 29 feet.\n(F) Mountain View-Shed District. Buildings on areas of high elevation are highly visible from surrounding public spaces.\nAs such, buildings in this district shall not be more than 29 feet tall.\n(G) Height. The height of a building shall be measured from the grade of the average grade of the property to the highest\nridge of the roof of the structure.\n(Ord., Art.

It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator of the town to maintain the map and post any changes thereto\nas they may be made.\n(Ord., Art. VII, \u00a7 702, passed - -)\n\u00a7 154.063 RULES GOVERNING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.\nWhere uncertainly exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts as shown on the zoning map, the\nfollowing shall apply.\n(A) Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways, alleys, streams, rivers or other\nbodies of water, should be construed to follow the lines.\n(B) Boundaries indicated, as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following the lot lines.\n(C) Boundaries indicated, as approximately following town limit lines shall be construed as following the town lines.\n(D) Where district boundaries are so indicated they are approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets, highways,\nrailroads or right-of-way of same, the district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance\ntherefore as indicated on the zoning map. If no distance is given, the dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale\nshown on the zoning map.\n(E) Where a district boundary line divides a lot of single ownership, the district requirements for the least restricted portion\nof the lot shall be deemed to apply to the whole thereof, provided that the extensions shall not include any part of the lot\nmore than 35 feet beyond the district boundary lines.\n(F) Where physical features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the official zoning map, or in\nother circumstances not covered by divisions (A) through (E) above, the Board of Adjustment shall interpret the district\nboundaries.\n(Ord., Art. VII, \u00a7 703, passed - -)\n\u00a7 154.064 STATEMENT OF DISTRICT INTENTS.\n(A) Residential Estate (RE). The Residential Estate (RE) district as herein established is intended to be the most\nrestrictive of the residential districts. The intent is to provide for an environment of low density one-family detached dwelling\nunits along with other residentially related facilities which serve the residents in this district. These areas will often be\ndependent on private, individual septic tanks and wells; therefore, requiring larger lot sizes to sustain individual water\nsupplies and sewage disposal facilities. These areas may have soil and topographic constraints that preclude intense urban\ndevelopment.\n(B) Low Density Residential District (R-1). The Low Density Residential District is primarily intended to provide locations\nfor low-density residential development in outlying rural areas that are not likely to have public water and sewer services\navailable and may have soil and topographic constraints that preclude intense urban development. These areas often will be\ndependent upon private, individual septic tanks and wells; therefore, requiring larger lot sizes to sustain individual water\nsupplies and sewage disposal facilities. This district also provides for recreational, community service and institutional uses\nthat will complement the residential development. This district will be applied within those areas designated on the land use\nplan as Low Density Residential areas.\n(C) Community Residential-Medium Density Residential District (R-2). The Community Residential-Medium Density\nResidential District is primarily intended to provide locations for residential uses and supporting recreational and community\nservice uses in area where generally both Town public water and sewer services are available. These are the more urban\nareas of the community and will be primarily within the town limits and in close proximity to public and private services and\nthe town's central business district. This district is intended to protect existing single-family homes and subdivisions within\nthe town. This district will be applied within those areas designated on the land use plan as Medium Density Residential\n\nNEW PAGE 17\nareas.\n(D) Central Business District (CBD). The Central Business District is intended to be the primary retail and service center,\nand focal point of the community. This district provides for the concentration of commercial uses, professional services,\nfinancial services, governmental functions, and related services. The CBD area currently has access to both public water\nand sewer services, and dimensional requirements for this district are intended to encourage concentrated commercial\ndevelopment and to promote convenient pedestrian shopping in pleasant surroundings. This district will be applied to the\nexisting commercial center and to adjacent properties that with commercial development will complement and enhance the\nCBD as the retail and service center of the community. This district will be applied within the commercial areas as\ndesignated on the land use plan.\n(E) I-26 Corridor Overlay Area (I-26 COA). The I-26 Corridor Overlay boundaries are from the concrete right-of-way\nmonument set at the east intersection of Highway 26 and Highway 108, at the corner of Spartan Petroleum Company and\nrunning least 500 feet on Highway 108 to a line parallel to the right-of-way of 1-26, and also at the concrete right-of-way\nmonument set at the west intersection of Highway 26 and Highway 108, at the corner of the McFarland tract and running\nwest 500 feet on Highway 108 to a line parallel to the right of way of 1-26. This overlay area has the same requirements as\nin\nthe Highway Commercial District, but also has additional requirements for tall signs and electronic gaming operations.\n(F) Highway Commercial District (HC). The Highway Commercial District is intended to provide suitable locations for\nclustered groupings of highway commercial development in convenient locations along N.C. 108, to serve local residences\nand persons traveling by automobile. Urban sprawl, congestions, and strip commercial development will be discouraged by\npromoting good design, clustered developments, and by guiding commercial development primarily to areas that have water\nand sewer services and suitable soil and topographic conditions. These areas should provide sufficient space for ample off-\nstreet parking and well designed entrances and exits to avoid traffic congestion and safety hazards. Highway commercial\nareas are intended for commercial enterprises and services that require greater land area and lot dimensions than\nestablishments locating in the Central Business District. This district will be applied within the commercial areas as\ndesignated on the land use plan.\n(G) Industrial District (IND). The Industrial District is intended to provide sites for manufacturing and industrial uses,\nstorage and warehousing, wholesale trade, and other major employment centers. These locations should currently have\nboth public water and sewer services available or be expected to have these services in the future, and have suitable soil\nand topographic conditions to sustain the development. This district includes existing manufacturing areas, and sites suited\nfor future or further industrial development, and area designated on the land use plan as Industrial Centers. Only those\nmanufacturing uses will be allowed which have meet all local, state, and federal environmental standards, and do not involve\nobnoxious noise, vibrations, smoke, gas, fumes, odor, dust, fire hazards or other objectionable conditions which would be\ndetrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the community.\n(H) Public Service District (PS). The Public Service District is intended to be an area containing a concentration of public\nservice activities such as recreation areas, educational facilities, hospitals, emergency services and the like. This district\nis\nintended to preserve existing public service centers and will apply to those areas designated on the land use plan as Public\nService Centers.\n(I) Mixed-Use District (MU). The Mixed-Use District is established to provide opportunities for compatible and sustainable\nre-development where underutilized commercial properties already exist. The existing auto-oriented street, lot and building\ndesigns can create uncomfortable pedestrian environments; however, with careful site planning these areas will allow a\ngreater number of residents to walk or bike to businesses and services with an interconnected network of streets and\nsidewalks. Dominant uses in this district are residential, retail and office. The Mixed-Use District is expected to serve\nColumbus residents as well as persons who travel from the surrounding communities. The development pattern in this\ndistrict acknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access provided to ensure safety for the motoring public.\nDevelopment standards in the Mixed-Use District ensure the creation of a pleasant auto-oriented environment while enabling\na compatible transition to uses in adjacent districts. This District is available for rezoning only with the consent of the\nproperty owner(s).\n(J) Traditional Neighborhood Development District (TND). The Traditional Neighborhood Development District provides\nfor the development of new neighborhoods and the revitalization or extension of existing neighborhoods. These\nneighborhoods are structured upon a fine network of interconnecting pedestrian oriented streets and other public spaces.\nTraditional Neighborhood Developments (TND's) provide a mixture of housing types and prices, prominently sited civic or\ncommunity building(s), stores/offices/workplaces, and churches to provide a balanced mix of activities. A Traditional\nNeighborhood Development (TND) has a recognizable center and clearly defined edges; optimum size is a quarter mile from\ncenter to edge. A TND is urban in form, is typically an extension of the existing developed area of the Town, and has an\noverall residential density of up to 16 dwelling units per acre. TND districts should have a significant portion of land\ndedicated to open spaces. This District is available for rezoning only with the consent of the property owner(s).\n(Ord., Art.

IX, passed -\n\u00a7 154.067 BUILDING HEIGHT OVERLAY DISTRICTS.\n(A) Reason for regulation. It is recognized that two major characteristics of the town greatly contribute to the atmosphere,\ncultural heritage and appeal of the whole community. Specifically, the scenic mountain views bounding the town on the north\nand north west and the historic county courthouse located in the middle of town both offer a sense of place and community\nto the town's residents and add to the attractiveness of the area. It is further recognized that the height of buildings, if left\nunregulated or inadequately regulated, can detract from these two features. Therefore, building heights shall be regulated\nbased on the location of the subject building in relation to mountain view-sheds and to the historic county courthouse.\n(B) Establishment of Building Height Overlay Districts The boundaries of the Building Height Overlay Districts shall be\ndepicted on a map named the \"Town of Columbus Building Height Overlay District Map\" and shall be made part of this\nchapter upon adoption of this section.\n(C) Districts. For the purposes of determining maximum building heights, the town shall be divided into the following\nBuilding Height Overlay Districts:\n(1) General;\n(2) Courthouse; and\n(3) Mountain View-Shed.\n(D) General Building Height District. In this district no building shall be taller than 36 feet. However, if the average\nelevation (above mean sea level) of the ridgelines of existing adjacent buildings situated on lots having a common boundary\nwith the subject parcel upon which the proposed building is to be situated (adjacent lots that are vacant not being included in\nthis calculation) is less than the elevation (above mean sea level) determined by measuring 36 feet vertically from the\naverage grade of the proposed building envelope on the subject parcel, then the proposed building shall be no taller than\nthat average. In the event that the average elevation (above mean sea level) of the existing buildings' ridgelines on the\nsurrounding adjacent properties is such that the subject parcel is rendered unbuildable (meaning a single story building with\nan appropriate roof is not feasible), then the proposed building shall have a height not exceeding 29 feet. The determination\nthat a subject parcel is rendered unbuildable under this division (D) shall be at the discretion of the approving administrator,\nboard, or council.\n(E) Courthouse Building Height District. In this district no building's ridgeline shall have an elevation higher than the\nelevation defined by the plane of the soffit of the eave of the roof of the historic county courthouse; however, in no case shall\na buildings height be taller than 29 feet.\n(F) Mountain View-Shed District. Buildings on areas of high elevation are highly visible from surrounding public spaces.\nAs such, buildings in this district shall not be more than 29 feet tall.\n(G) Height. The height of a building shall be measured from the grade of the average grade of the property to the highest\nridge of the roof of the structure.\n(Ord., Art. IX, \u00a7 900, passed - -; Ord. passed - -)\n\u00a7 154.068 FLOOR AREA.\n(A) Potential. Large scale commercial development has the potential to pose many challenges to a relatively small\ncommunity such as the town. The development can overwhelm local police services, undermine a current diversified\ncommercial market, strain the character of the local community, cause excessive vehicular congestion, and can be difficult\nCELL (1, 1): \nIndustrial\nDistrict\n(IND)\nCELL (1, 2): \nSame as\nHC\nCELL (1, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (1, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (1, 5): \n80\nCELL (1, 6): \n30\nCELL (1, 7): \n60\nCELL (1, 8): \n10\nCELL (1, 9): \n20\nCELL (1, 10): \n50\nCELL (2, 1): \nPublic\nService\nDistrict (PD)\nCELL (2, 2): \nSame as\nHC\nCELL (2, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (2, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (2, 5): \n80\nCELL (2, 6): \n30\nCELL (2, 7): \n60\nCELL (2, 8): \n10\nCELL (2, 9): \n20\nCELL (2, 10): \n50\n\nNEW PAGE 25\nto handle once left vacant. As such, the town finds it necessary to limit the allowable floor area of commercial development\nin order to ensure that the development is carried out in a manner that is appropriate and consistent with the character of the\ntown.\n(B) Commercial development. The building footprint of any structure and any accessory structure in the aggregate to be\nused for any commercial enterprise shall not be larger than 10,000 square feet in size. The building's footprint shall be\nconstrued to mean the perimeter line created by the edge of the roof of any structure and building on a lot in the aggregate.\nFor the purposes of this section, the term commercial development shall include any development intended to be used or\npotentially used by for-profit enterprises, including manufacturing and industrial developments, except that those uses\nallowed within the town's Public Service District shall not be considered commercial. It is recognized that in certain\ncircumstances it may be appropriate to allow for a larger building footprint for commercial developments. In order for a\ncommercial structure proposed to have a footprint larger than 10,000 square feet to be constructed, a special use permit\nshall be obtained prior to the commencement of the development. See \u00a7\u00a7 154.082 and 154.083 below for details regarding\nthe issuance of a special use permit for large scale commercial developments.\n(C) Residential development. The building footprint of all newly constructed residential developments shall not be larger\nthan 35% of the lot on which the residential development is proposed to be erected.\n(D) Public service development. Development to be used for any land use allowed in the town's Public Service (PS)\nzoning district shall have no limit on the size of the building footprint.\n(Ord., Art. IX, \u00a7 901, passed -)\nCONDITIONAL AND SPECIAL USES\n\u00a7 154.080 CONDITIONAL USE DISTRICTS.\n(A) For each general use district established in 154.060 through 154.064 above, there is also established a\ncorresponding conditional use district as follows:\n(B) It is recognized that certain types of zoning districts would be inappropriate at certain locations in the absence of\nspecial conditions. Where the applicant for rezoning desires property to be rezoned to such a district in those situations, the\nConditional Use District (CUD) is a means by which the special conditions can be imposed in the furtherance of the\npurposes of this chapter. The Conditional Use District classification will be considered for rezoning only upon request of a\nproperty owner. If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these regulations is found to be illegal or invalid or if the\napplicant should fail to accept any condition, it is the intent of this chapter that the authorization of the conditional use permit\nshall be null and void and of no effect, and that proceedings shall be instituted to rezone the property to its previous zoning\nclassification.\n(C) Within a CUD, only those uses authorized as either permitted or conditional uses in the zoning district with which the\nCUD corresponds shall be permitted, and all other requirements of the corresponding district shall be met as minimum\nstandards. In addition, with a CUD no use shall be permitted except pursuant to a conditional use permit authorized by the\nTown Council, which shall specify the use or uses authorized. The permit may further specify the location on the property of\nthe proposed use or uses, the number of dwelling units, the location and extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots,\ndriveway and access streets, the location and extent of buffer areas, and other special purpose areas, the timing of\ndevelopment, the location and extent of right-of-way and other areas to be dedicated for public use, and other such matters\nas the applicant may propose as conditions upon the request, but not to include conditions not generally a part of land\ndevelopment controls. In granting a conditional use permit, the Town Council may impose additional reasonable and\nappropriate safeguards upon the permit as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose and intent of this chapter are\nserved, public welfare secured and substantial justice done.\n(D) In approving a Conditional Use District Rezoning, the Town Council shall make the following (in addition to the\nfindings for conditional use permits in \u00a7 154.081(C) below) affirmative findings:\n(1) That the use(s) requested is among those listed as an eligible use in the Conditional Use District in which the\nsubject property is located or is to be located; and\n(2) That the location and character of the Conditional Use District if developed according to the site specific plan will be\nreasonable and consistent with the surrounding area and with adopted plans of the town.\nCELL (1, 1): \n(1) CU-R-1 Conditional Use R-1 District;\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \n(2) CU-R-2 Conditional Use R-2 District;\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (3, 1): \n(3) CU-CBD Conditional Use CBD District;\nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (4, 1): \n(4) CU-HC Conditional Use HC District;\nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (5, 1): \n(5) CU-IND Conditional Use IND District;\nCELL (5, 2): \nCELL (6, 1): \n(6) CU-PS Conditional Use PS District;\nCELL (6, 2): \nCELL (7, 1): \n(7) CU-MU Conditional Use MU District; and\nCELL (7, 2): \nCELL (8, 1): \n(8) CU-TND Conditional Use TND District.\nCELL (8, 2): \n\nNEW PAGE 26\n(Ord., Art.

Conditional use permits shall only be granted in conjunction with a Conditional Use District\nrezoning, and shall be processed and considered in a quasi-judicial manner by the Town Council. Proposals for a rezoning\nto any Conditional Use District shall always be accompanied by a request for a conditional use permit and shall be heard and\nconsidered simultaneously.\n(B) Approval process.\n(1) The Town Council shall consider the application in accordance with the findings-of-fact in division (C) below. The\nproposals and requests shall be processed and considered in the same procedure as conventional rezoning proposals,\nexcept as otherwise set forth herein, and the voting shall be the same as that required for zoning matters.\n(2) If the Town Council should determine that the property involved in the proposal should be rezoned and the\nconditional use permit issued, it shall adopt an ordinance rezoning the property and authorizing the issuance of a conditional\nuse permit. Otherwise the proposal shall be denied.\n(3) An application shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator and shall be accompanied by a site specific plan with the\nfollowing requirements:\n(a) Existing site conditions, including contours, water courses, identified flood hazard area, and unique natural or\nhuman-made features.\n(b) Boundary lines of the proposed development, proposed lot lines and plot designs;\n(c) Proposed location and use of all existing and proposed structures;\n(d) Location and size of all areas to be conveyed, dedicated or reserved as common open space, parks, recreation\nareas, school sites and similar public and semi-public uses;\n(e) The existing and proposed street system, including location and number of off-street parking spaces, service\nareas, loading areas and major points of access to public right-of-way. Notations of proposed ownership of the street system\n(public or private). Documentation from the Town Fire Department of the adequacy of the development's facilities for\nemergency medical and fire services;\n(f) Approximate location of proposed utility systems, including documentation approving the proposed water and\nsewer systems from the appropriate local and state agencies. Documentation of an approved Sedimentation and Erosion\nControl Plan shall also be submitted where required;\n(g) Location and/or notation of existing and proposed easements and right-of-way;\n(h) The proposed treatment of the perimeter of the development including materials and/or techniques such as\nscreens, fences and walls;\n(i) Information on adjacent land areas, including land use, zoning classifications, public facilities and any unique\nnatural features;\n(j) Where applicable, the following written documentation shall be submitted:\n1. A legal description of the total site proposed for development, including a statement of present and proposed\nownership;\n2. The zoning district or districts in which the project is located;\n3. A development schedule indicating approximate beginning and completion dates of the development, including\nany proposed states;\n4. A statement of the applicant's intentions with regard to the future selling and/or leasing of all or portions of the\ndevelopment;\n5. Quantitative data for the following: proposed total number and type of residential dwelling units; parcel size;\ngross residential densities and total amount of open space; and\n6. Plan for maintenance of common areas, recreation areas, open spaces, street and utilities.\n(k) Any additional information required by the Town Council in order to evaluate the impact of the proposed\ndevelopment. The Council may waive a particular requirement if in their opinion the inclusion is not essential to a proper\ndecision on the application.\n(C) Conditions, evidence and findings of fact\n(1) In approving an application for a conditional use permit, the Town Council may attach fair and reasonable\nconditions to the approval. The petitioner will have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any additional\nrequirements prior to approval or denial by the Town Council. In no instance shall any of these conditions be less restrictive\nthan any requirements which would pertain to that particular development found elsewhere in a similar zoning district.\n",
