Intent: The Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay District (TNDO)\nprovides an alternative opportunity applicable only upon request for a Zoning Map\nAmendment for the development of new neighborhoods and the revitalization or\nextension of existing neighborhoods. These neighborhoods are structured upon a\nfine network of interconnecting pedestrian-oriented streets and other public\nspaces. Traditional Neighborhood Developments (TND's) provide a mixture of\nhousing types and prices, prominently sited civic or community building(s),\nstores/offices/workplaces, and churches to provide a balanced mix of activities. A\nTraditional Neighborhood Development (TND) has a recognizable center and\nclearly defined edges; optimum size is a quarter mile from center to edge. A TND\nis urban in form, is typically an extension of the existing developed area of the\nTown and has an overall residential density of up to eleven (11) dwelling units per\nacre. TNDO districts should have a significant portion of land dedicated to\nimproved open spaces, and reserve un-improved open spaces where\nenvironmentally sensitive areas are located.\n(B.) A Development Agreement, established pursuant to Section 7.15 of this\nOrdinance, shall be required as part of all Traditional Neighborhood Development\nOverlay (TNDO) District applications and apply to all projects within the TNDO\nDistrict. Application for a TNDO District shall serve as consent per G.S. 160D-\n702(b) to the standards & specifications applicable to TNDO District development.\n(C.) Listed Uses:\n(1.)
