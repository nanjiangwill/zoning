The required height of the planted buffer shall be measured in relation to the elevation of the edge of the adjacent area\nto be screened. In such cases as the ground elevation of the location at which the screen is to be planted is less than the\nelevation of the proposed building site, the required height of the screen shall be increased in an amount equal to said\ndifference in elevation.\nb.\nIn lieu of compliance with the above buffer and screening requirement, an applicant may submit to the Planning\nDirector for his or her review and approval a detailed plan and specifications for landscaping and screening.\nC. In situations where the topography would render most practical required screening noneffective, the Planning Director\nmay allow the screening to be located outside of the required buffer and placed in a location that will enable the screening to\nbe effective in meeting the intent of this section.\n4. Plant types and spacing. Below are listed the types of plants that shall be used in planted buffers and the maximum\ndistance each plant type shall be planted apart. Substitution for another plant type not listed is to be made in writing to the\nZoning Administrator and is subject to verification that the proposed plant will thrive and provide adequate screening.
