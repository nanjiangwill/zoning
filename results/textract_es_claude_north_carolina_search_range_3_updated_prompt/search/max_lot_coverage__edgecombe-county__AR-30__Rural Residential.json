It is the intent of these standards to encourage the development of solar energy conversion\nuses that reduce reliance on foreign and out-of-state energy resources, bolster local\neconomic development and job creation, support the diversification of the State's energy\nportfolio, strengthen energy and grid security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce\nlocal air and water pollution, and aid North Carolina in meeting its Renewable Portfolio\nStandard.\n3.\nThese standards are not intended to abridge safety, health, or environmental requirements\ncontained in other applicable codes, standards, or ordinances. These provisions shall not\nnullify any local, State, or federal laws.\nB.\nAPPLICABILITY\n1.
