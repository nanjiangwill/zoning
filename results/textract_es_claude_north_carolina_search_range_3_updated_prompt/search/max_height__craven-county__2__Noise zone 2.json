Such zones are shown on the Craven County\nZoning and Height Control Map consisting of one sheet, prepared by Holland Consulting Planners, Inc., and dated July 1, 2006,\nwhich is by reference made a part of this division. A lot located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in\nthe zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various height restriction zones are hereby established and defined as\nfollows:\n(a)\nUtility runway non-precision instrument approach zone (runway) 13 and runway 31). The inner edge of this approach zone\ncoincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width\nof 2,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline\nof the runway.\n(b) Non-precision instrument approach zone (runway 22). The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the\nprimary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal\ndistance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface.

The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a horizontal\ndistance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.\n(d) Transitional zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces.\n(e) Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet radii for all runways designated utility or\nvisual and 10,000 feet for all others from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the\nadjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.\n(f) Conical zone. The conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends\noutward from the horizontal zone at a slope of 20 to one for a distance of 4,000 feet.\n(3) Airport height zone restrictions.
