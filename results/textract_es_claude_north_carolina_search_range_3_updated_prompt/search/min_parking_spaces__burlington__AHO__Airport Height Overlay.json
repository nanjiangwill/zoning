GENERAL BUSINESS (GB) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe General Business (GB) district is the primary district intended to serve\nretail, business, and service uses in the City and is found along major\narterial streets, interstate interchanges, and on blocks surrounding the\ncentral business district. Development in the GB district tends to be\nautomobile oriented and comprised of a mix of individual buildings on\nindividual sites and multi-tenant or multi-building developments located\nnear major roadway intersections. In addition to commercial uses, the\ndistrict also accommodates wholesale sales, warehousing uses, and a very\nwide range of institutional uses. Limited forms of residential use are\nallowed, such as upper-story residential and multi-family development.\nUses in the district are subject to standards intended to ensure development\nis compatible with adjacent residential neighborhoods, ensure that the\ntraffic carrying capacity along the City's major roadways is not impaired due\nto unsafe turning movements, and that development is well landscaped and\naesthetically pleasing. In order to maintain compatibility with surrounding\nuses and ensure a high quality of development, all activities, including\nstorage shall be indoors or be fully screened from view from the street or\nfrom lands in lower-intensity zoning districts.\nB.

OFFICE INSTITUTIONAL (OI) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Office Institutional (OI) District is established to accommodate\noffice uses, research and development facilities, corporate\nheadquarters, and multi-family residential uses in high quality single-\nbuilding and multi-building developments. The district also\naccommodates the ancillary service uses necessary to support the\npredominant office development, but is not intended as a retail\n920\ndistrict. Retail, personal service, and other commercial uses\npermitted as accessory to an office or institutional use should not\noccupy more than 10 percent of the floor area and should be\nconfigured to minimize visibility from off-site areas. The OI district\nalso serves as a transition area between higher intensity commercial\nuses and nearby lower density single-family residential\nneighborhoods. Development in the OI district is subject to design\nstandards to ensure it maintains compatibility with its surroundings.\nB.

MIXED USE (MX) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Mixed Use (MX) district is intended to foster functional neighborhoods where City\nresidents and visitors can live, work, shop, and recreate without travelling large distances\nbetween differing uses. Buildings are built close to the sidewalk and served by public\ngathering areas that create places for people to congregate and interact. The district\nencourages a fine-grained network of streets and pedestrian ways that allow a wide\nfreedom of movement and choices in transportation mode, including public transit. Land\nuses are mixed (including both residential and non-residential) either in the same building\n(vertical integration) or on the same development site (horizontal integration), and are\nlocated in close proximity to one another. Mixed use districts are located on principal and\nminor arterials as well as collector streets. The district allows a wide variety of housing\ntypes to promote population density and to support nearby retail, dining, and entertainment\nestablishments. The district discourages the establishment of single-use, monolithic, and\nautomobile-oriented forms of development that require large areas of off-street parking.\nNOTES:\n(AMENDED 06.21.22 UDOTA-03-22)\n[1] Includes duplex, triplex, and quadriplex dwellings.\n[2] 10,000 for duplex buildings; 15,000 for triplex buildings; 20,000 for quadriplex buildings; and 5,400 for a single-family\nattached development plus an additional 1,600 square feet per single-family attached unit in the development.\n[3] This is a minimum development size, not a minimum lot area.\n[4] Development in the WPO is subject to Section 3.20.F, Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay (WPO) District.\n[5] Increased to 90% for lots in pocket neighborhoods and 80% for lots in bungalow courts.\n[6] Not applied to single-family attached lots but the entire development shall maintain a max. lot coverage of 50%.\n[7] Applied to entire development (not individual lots) when configured as a pocket neighborhood or bungalow court.\n[8] Standards applied to entire development, not individual lots.\n[9] Open space set-aside requirements applied to single-family detached subdivisions of six or more lots and developments\ncomprised of six or more duplex, triplex, or quadriplex buildings.
