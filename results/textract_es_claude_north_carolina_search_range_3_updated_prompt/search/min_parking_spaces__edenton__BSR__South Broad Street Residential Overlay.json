The regulations of this district\nare intended to (i) encourage light manufacturing and intensive commercial uses as well as\naccessory land uses incidental to and in support of manufacturing uses; (ii) exclude heavy industry,\nmajor retail, and residences as acceptable land uses; and (iii) preserve locations that are best\nsuited for industrial development.

These special control overlay districts are intended to be superimposed over\nthe underlying general zoning district and the land so encumbered may be used in a manner\npermitted in the underlying district only if and to the extent such use is also permitted in the\napplicable overlay district. The specific objectives of each of these overlay districts are explained in\nthe remainder of this section.\n(b)\nThe FHO District is established as an overlay district of all general zoning districts for\nthe purpose of protecting people and property from the hazards of flooding. The flood hazard\ndistricts are further described in Part I of Article 16 of this ordinance.\n(c)\nThe AHO District is established as an overlay district of all general zoning districts in\nthe vicinity of the Edenton Municipal Airport. The purpose of the AHO is to protect the airport\nenvirons from encroachment of incompatible land uses which present hazards to users of the\nairport as well as to persons residing or working in the airport vicinity. The additional regulations\nimposed in the AHO are designed to (i) place additional height restrictions on buildings and trees;\n(ii) control the above-ground storage of flammable materials; and (iii) control the locations of\nhigh-density residential uses and places of assembly. The additional regulations governing land\ndevelopment in the AHO district are delineated in Section 11.14.\n(d)\nThe HO District is established as an overlay district for all general zoning districts that\ncontain structures or other facilities of historic significance. The purpose of the HO is to protect and\nconserve the heritage and character of the Edenton community by providing for the preservation of\ndesignated areas within the planning jurisdiction. No new historic districts nor any change to the\nboundaries of any existing historic district shall be designated until the North Carolina Department\nof Cultural Resources shall have been given an opportunity, in accordance with Chapter 160D,\nArticle 9, Part 4 of the N.C. General Statutes, to make recommendations with respect to the\nestablishment of such new district or change in the boundaries of an existing district. The additional\nregulations governing land development in the HO district are delineated in Section 11.15.\n(Amended 9/14/2021)\n(e)\nThe RCO District is established as an overlay district of all general zoning districts for\nthe purpose of establishing streetscape appearance and pedestrian and bicycle circulation\nrecommendations along six main road corridors that lead into downtown Edenton. The additional\nregulations governing land development in the RCO districts are delineated in Section 11.36.\n(f)\nThe BSR overlay district is established as an overlay district for an area of Broad Street\nlocated in the CD (Downtown Commercial) zoning district. The purpose of the overlay district is to\nprohibit residential uses in the first floor of structures fronting on South Broad Street.\nSection 9.5 Conditional Zoning District.\nThe conditional zoning district (CZD) allows a site to be developed with a mixture of land uses\naccording to an approved overall site plan. For example, a large tract may be developed with a mix\nof single-family and multi-family housing, with part of the site also devoted to commercial and office\nuses. The CZD allows for greater flexibility in dimensional standards (such as lot sizes and\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 9/14/2021\n9-3\n\nNEW PAGE 107\nsetbacks) upon approval of an overall master plan for the entire development. The district does not\nrequire a rigid separation of different land uses. Uses are limited to the uses identified in Section\n10.1 Table of Permitted Uses. All of the site-specific standards and conditions, including a site plan,\nare incorporated into the zoning district regulations for the CZD. Approval of the site plan will\nestablish all zoning requirements for the subject property. A CZD district shall not be less than three\n(3) acres in area.\nThis negotiated approach to a legislative decision allows maximum flexibility to tailor regulations to\na particular site and project. But it also has great potential for abuse - both in terms of impacts on\nindividual landowners seeking approval and their neighbors and on the public interests zoning is\nsupposed to promote. Thus, special restrictions have been placed on conditional zoning.\nConditional Zoning Districts may only occur at the owner's request and cannot be imposed without\nthe owner's agreement. The individual conditions and site-specific standards that can be imposed\nare limited to those that are needed to bring a project into compliance with town ordinances and\nadopted plans and to those addressing the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by use of\nthe site. The town must assure that all of the factors defining reasonable spot zoning are fully\nconsidered and that the public hearing record reflects that consideration.\nConditional zoning provides important opportunities to carefully tailor regulations to address the\ninterest of the landowner, the neighbors, and the public. The town may use conditional zoning when\nit concludes that a particular project should be approved but that the standards in the comparable\nconventional zoning district(s) are insufficient to protect neighbors or public interests (perhaps\nbecause the conventional zoning allows other uses not suitable for the site or dimensional\nstandards inadequate to preserve the neighborhood). Conditional zoning often allows a developer\nto proceed with a project in a way that addresses site-specific concerns of neighbors and the Town\nof Edenton. The petitioner must consent in writing to all conditions imposed by the conditional\nzoning.
