Fences consisting of masonry, rock, wire or wooden material and hedges may be installed on the\nboundaries of any residential lot, provided that the height of such fencing, walls or hedges shall be limited to a maximum\nheight of five (5) feet between the street right-of-way line and the normal building line for that section adjacent to the street.\nFencing, walls and hedges on all other boundaries of residential property shall be limited to a maximum of eight (8) feet in\nheight.

If sidewalk already exists on the other side of the right-of-way, no\nnew sidewalk is required.

Concrete sidewalks, minimum five (5) feet wide, shall be built along all street frontages of the lot according to city\nspecifications (four (4) inches thick except at non-residential driveways it shall be six (6) inches thick). The sidewalk shall be\nseparated from the street by a minimum four (4) foot wide planting strip unless on-street parking is provided.

A TIS shall be required for all development that experiences a change in zoning classification\nafter the effective date of this chapter and is projected to generate one thousand five hundred (1,500) daily trips. A TIS may\nbe required by the City of Claremont for any redevelopment or change in use of an existing occupied development that has\nexperienced a change in zoning classification after the effective date of this chapter that would generate one thousand\n(1,000) additional daily trips, and shall be required when the subject development is expected to generate one thousand five\nhundred (1,500) additional daily trips, subject to the exception set out below.\nWhen sufficient information on the proposed development is available for the City of Claremont to determine that the\naforementioned criteria is met, a TIS shall be submitted with all preliminary plats, site plans, site plan revisions, and special\nuse permit applications. The trip rates shall be based on trip generation rates contained in the latest edition of Trip\nGeneration published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers or any local trip generation rates either published or\napproved by the City of Claremont. Additional trips shall be determined by subtracting the gross trip generation of the\nexisting use from the gross trip generation of the proposed use. The additional trip calculation shall apply to property that is\noccupied at the time of submittal or has been occupied at any time prior to submittal.\nIf a development or property experiences a change in zoning classification after the effective date of this chapter and\nspecial circumstances exist, the City of Claremont may require a TIS without regard to the expected trip generation of the\ndevelopment. Factors that would warrant such a requirement are:\n1. There are existing levels of service deficiencies in the area of the proposed development. (\"Level of Service\" as\ndefined in the Highway Capacity Manual - Transportation Research Board Special Report 209) and/or\n2. Available accident data and/or operational and geometric factors indicate safety concerns.\nNotwithstanding the above, a TIS shall not be required if the property to be rezoned or developed has been the subject of\na TIS within the previous three (3) years and the projected trip generation of the newly proposed development is equal to or\nless than the previous study performed and the trip distribution has not significantly changed. As a part of subdivision, site\nplan and driveway permit approval, the City of Claremont may require needed transportation improvements for the property\nrequesting development approval; however, a TIS shall not be utilized as a means for staff to require the party developing\nthe property to make needed transportation improvements remote from the property for which the TIS is submitted, nor shall\nidentified deficiencies in level of service automatically preclude approval of the proposed development.\nThe TIS shall address the proposed land use, the trip generation therefrom, site access, modal splits if appropriate,\nimpacts on the transportation system from the proposed development, and physical improvements or enforceable\nmanagement strategies to mitigate negative impacts. At a minimum, the TIS shall identify the improvements necessary to\n\nNEW PAGE 21\nmaintain Level of Service D for streets and intersections as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual - Transportation\nResearch Board Special Report 209. Any TIS, whether required or voluntarily prepared, must be prepared by a licensed\nengineer in accordance with city guidelines. Additionally, the TIS should be reviewed and approved by city staff before being\nconsidered by City Council or any planning agency of the city.\nDevelopments/properties that have not experienced a change in zoning classification since the effective date of this\nchapter are not required to prepare a TIS as a part of their site plan approval.
