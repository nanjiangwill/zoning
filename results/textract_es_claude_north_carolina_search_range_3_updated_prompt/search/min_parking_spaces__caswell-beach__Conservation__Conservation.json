Variance of area, width, and yard requirements\nshall be obtained only through action of the Board of Adjustment.\n(B) If two or more lots or combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of\nrecord at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots do not meet at least 80% of the\nrequirements for lot width and area, for the zone in which they are located, as established by this chapter, the land involved\nshall be considered to be an undivided parcel, for the purpose of this chapter, and no portion of the parcel shall be used or\nsold which does not meet width and area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of the parcel be\nmade which leaves remaining any lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this chapter.\n(Ord. passed 6-8-78; Am.

Therefore, a structure of 5,400 square feet\nbulk size is permitted only if the resultant total built-upon area associated with the construction of\nthe residence including all other impervious or partially impervious surfaces complies with the\nmaximum built-upon area limitations set out in \u00a7 153.086.\n(Ord. 2013-08-0, passed 5-9-13; Am.

These uses are declared by this chapter to be\nincompatible with permitted uses in the districts in which they are located. It is the intent of this section to encourage\nconformance without prohibiting the reconstruction of a nonconforming residential structure within the structure's original\nfootprint destroyed by fire, explosion, tornado, earthquake, hurricane or similar uncontrollable cause.\n(B) It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformances shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, or\nused as grounds for adding other structures, or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.\n(Ord. passed 6-8-78; Am.
