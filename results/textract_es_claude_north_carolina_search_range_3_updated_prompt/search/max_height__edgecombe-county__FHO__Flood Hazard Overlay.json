The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of Edgecombe County are subject to periodic\ninundation which results in loss of life, property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of\ncommerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood\nprotection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the\npublic health, safety, and general welfare.\n2. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains\ncausing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas\nof uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.\nC.\nSTATEMENT OF PURPOSE\nIt is the purpose of these standards to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and\nto minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by\nprovisions designed to:\n1.\nRestrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or\nerosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;\n2.\nRequire that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected\nagainst flood damage at the time of initial construction;\n3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective\nbarriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;\n4. Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or\nflood damage; and\n5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood\nwaters, or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\nD.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objectives of these standards are to:\n1. Protect human life, safety, and health;\n2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\n3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally\nundertaken at the expense of the general public;\n4. Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;\n5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and gas mains, electric,\ntelephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;\n6.
