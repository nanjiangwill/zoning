SCHEDULE OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS\nSECTION 7.01.\nOFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS\nAt the time of erection of any structure, or at any time any structure is enlarged or increased in\ncapacity by adding dwelling units, guest rooms, seats or floor area, or before conversion from one\nzoning use or occupancy to another, permanent off-street parking space shall be provided according to\nthe requirements of this ordinance.\nA.\nGeneral Provisions\n1.\nEach parking space shall have a minimum length of twenty (20) feet and a minimum\nwidth of ten (10) feet. It shall have vehicular access to a publicly dedicated street.\n2.\nWith the exception of required spaces for single-family and two-family dwelling\nunits, sufficient maneuvering space shall be provided SO that no vehicle will be\nrequired to back into the public right-of-way.\n3.\nNo parking space for multi-family residential use shall be located in the required front\nyard.\n4.\nRequired off-street parking spaces are permanent areas and shall not be used for any\nother above-ground purpose. Removal or elimination of a required parking space shall\nimmediately revoke the zoning compliance certificate/occupancy permit of the use for\nwhich the parking space is required.\n5.\nFor uses not specifically mentioned, off-street parking requirements shall be applied\nby the Zoning Administrator based upon requirements for similar uses listed in this\nordinance.\n6.\nAll space requirements which are based upon employment shall be computed on the\nbasis of the greatest number of persons on duty at any one period during the day or\nnight.\n7.\nEach application for zoning compliance certificate/occupancy permit submitted to the\nZoning Administrator shall include information as to the location and dimensions of\noff-street parking and loading space and the means of ingress and egress to such\nspace. This information shall be in sufficient detail to enable the Zoning Administrator\nto determine whether or not the requirements of this Section are met.\n8.\nThe required space for any number of separate uses may be combined in one lot but\nthe required space assigned to the use may not be assigned to another use, except that\none-half of the parking space required for churches, theaters, or assembly halls whose\npeak attendance will be at night or on Sundays may be assigned to a use which will be\nclosed at night or on Sundays.\n9.\nIn any district except Residential, if the off-street parking requirement cannot be\nreasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal use is located, the space\nmay be provided on any land within four hundred (400) feet of the main entrance to\nthe principal use. That land shall be used solely to meet the parking requirement SO\nlong as no other provisions of parking space meeting the requirements of this\nordinance have been made for the principal use. In such cases, the applicant shall\nsubmit with his application for a zoning compliance certificate/occupancy permit an\ninstrument duly executed and acknowledged, which subjects the land to parking use in\nconnection with the specified use for a period of twenty (20) years with an option for\nrenewal for an additional period of twenty (20) years.
