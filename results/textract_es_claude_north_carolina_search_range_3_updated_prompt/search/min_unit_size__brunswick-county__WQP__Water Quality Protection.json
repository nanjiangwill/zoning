Brunswick County has numerous waterways, marshes, Carolina Bays, pocosins, and other water courses that contribute to the County's\nscenic character and serve as a reminder of the important place these water courses hold in the County's history.\n2. The water courses are also an important natural resource and amenity to residents of and visitors to Brunswick County, and the scenic views\nassociated with these watercourses are an important attraction to residents and visitors to Brunswick County, which in large part is\neconomically dependent upon tourism.\n3.\nThe intent of the Viewshed Protection Overlay is to protect and enhance the scenic character of Brunswick County's riparian areas and water\ncourses, with the broader goal of ensuring the preservation of views from within these scenic areas as well as views of these areas from\nadjacent lands.\nB. Designation of Viewshed Protection Overlay\n1. A Viewshed Protection Overlay may only be established as a zoning map change in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.8,\nRezoning.\n2. The ordinance adopting the overlay district shall clearly designate the name and geographic limits of the watercourse to be protected (i.e.\ncan't just say Intercoastal Waterway, it must specify the extents of the district along the length of the watercourse).\n3. The following watercourses are designated (VS) Viewshed Protection Overlays:\nC. Applicability\n1. Generally, the requirements of this Viewshed Protection Overlay District apply to all structures within 300 feet of the normal high water line\nof a designated watercourse.\n2. However, the Planning Director may waive these requirements for structures related to an industrial use that is located in the RU-I or I-G\nzoning districts.\n3. These requirements shall not apply to water oriented commercial uses (see Section 5.1.4.)).\nD. Development Standards\n1. Portions of structures facing a protected watercourse that exceed 50 feet in height shall be set back a minimum of two feet for each\nadditional one foot in height above 50 feet. The Planning Director shall have the authority to determine which portions of a structure are\nconsidered to be \"facing\" the protected watercourse for the purposes of these regulations.\n2. With the exception of Water Oriented Commercial Uses (see Section 5.1.4.J), and permitted height obstructions (see Section 5.4.13.C) the\nmaximum height of any structure may not exceed 75 feet.\n4.8.8. WQP: Water Quality Protection\nA. Purpose and Intent\n1. It is the intent of Brunswick County to bolster those regulations of state and federal government as to the unique quality of the water of the\nLockwood Folly River associated with naturally occurring shellfish beds.\n2. The quality of these defined waters has been affected by such activities as forestry, farming, construction of roads, growth of towns, and\nrural and suburban residential development, as well as industrial processes associated with the fishing industry.\n3. Numerous types of water pollutants have been identified by state studies. No one or even several types or causes of such degradation have\nbeen determined as having more impact than any other.\n59 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\nCELL (1, 1): \nWatercourse\nCELL (1, 2): \nFrom\nCELL (1, 3): \nTo\nCELL (2, 1): \nName\nCELL (2, 2): \nLocation\nCELL (2, 3): \nLocation\nCELL (3, 1): \nIntracoastal Waterway (IWW)\nCELL (3, 2): \nBorder with New Hanover County\nCELL (3, 3): \nSouth Carolina State Line\nCELL (4, 1): \nLockwood Folly River\nCELL (4, 2): \nGenoes Point to Mullet Creek\nCELL (4, 3): \nTo and across the Intracoastal Water to\nSheep Island\nCELL (5, 1): \nTown Creek\nCELL (5, 2): \nUS Hwy 17\nCELL (5, 3): \nNC 133\nCELL (6, 1): \nShallotte River\nCELL (6, 2): \nUnincorporated Areas of Brunswick County\nCELL (6, 3): \n\nNEW PAGE 60\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n4. The intent of this Water Quality Protection District is to apply a set of regulations for water quality protection, to specifically described areas\nof land abutting a specifically described water area; which is encompassed by a line drawn to extend across the Lockwood Folly River from\nGenoe's Point to Mullet Creek, southly to and across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway.\nB. Applicability\n1. The requirements and standards of the WQP- Water Quality Protection Overlay shall apply to all lands shown on a special Zoning Overlay\nMap made a part of this District, whereby all land parcels of public record included are clearly shown. This District includes an area extending\n575' landward of the mean high water line, with any lot or parcel falling within such distance being included entirely within this overlay zone.\n2. Parcels smaller than one acre in size shall be exempt from the requirements of this Section.\n3. Such waters have been defined by the State as being those waters south from a line extending from Genoes Point to Mullet Creek, to and\nacross the Intracoastal Water to Sheep Island.\nC. Incorporation of Studies by Reference\n1. Among the specific studies establishing the WQP District have been the March, 1989 publication entitled \"Report on Coastal Resource Waters\n- Intensive Study,\" by the Division of Environmental Management, N.C. Department of Natural Resources and Community Development, and\nthe August, 1989, publication entitled \"Lockwood Folly River Basin Water Quality Evaluation Report.\" Those studies are included by reference.\n2. The State of North Carolina has concluded the quality of the waters within the boundaries of the District had so declined there could be no\nassurance the proposed regulations would result in the goal of these waters being open full seasons for shell fishing. The Environmental\nManagement Commission did, under N.C. Administrative Code, Subordinance 2B, Surface Water Standards, Monitoring, Section .0219, Water\nQuality Management Plans, sub-section (b) establish a defined area of the mouth of this river, as above described, to be protected by a\nWater Quality Management Plan with specific actions which became effective January 1, 1990, included herein by reference.\nD. Application Requirements\nApplications for all development meeting the applicability requirements in the paragraph above shall require an approved Sedimentation\nErosion Control Plan be filed.\nE. Development Standards\nAll development within a WQP- Water Quality Protection Overlay shall:\n1. Limit the built upon impervious area to no more than 25% of the lot;\n2. Provide a buffer zone of at least 30' from any wetland or water line;\n3. Limit any structures to being at least 75' from the mean high water line; and\n4. Comply with any additional standards imposed by State or Federal regulations.\n4.9 VOLUNTARY AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT PROGRAM\nCommentary: The Voluntary Agricultural District is not an overlay zoning district, and is not implemented in the same was as a zoning district would\nbe.\n4.9.1.

The Planning Director is authorized to make reasonable adjustments to applicable requirements such as setbacks, buffers,\nopen space, landscaping, etc. in the review and approval of project plans that successfully incorporate historic resources into project design.\n6.6 - SUITABILITY OF LAND\n6.6.1. Land which has been determined by the County staff on the basis of engineering or other expert surveys, to pose an ascertainable danger to\nlife or property by reason of its unsuitability for the use proposed, shall not be platted for that purpose, unless and until the subdivider has taken the\nnecessary measures to correct said conditions.\n6.6.2. Areas that have been used for disposal of solid waste shall not be subdivided.\n6.6.3. Development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to\nflood hazards.\n6.6.4. Wetlands\nCommentary: If a Water Quality Protection Overlay is located in a proposed subdivision, specific requirements apply. See Section 4.8.8.\nEcologically sensitive lands, such as marsh, Carolina Bays, pocosins and swamps, when in the ownership of the owner/applicant, should be\npreserved whenever possible for the public interest.\n6.7 APPEARANCE\n6.7.1. Large Scale Commercial\nA. General Purpose and Intent\nB. The purpose of this Section is to supplement development standards elsewhere in these zoning regulations with specific criteria that apply to\nthe design of certain commercial buildings and projects.\nC. The County's goal is to create and maintain a positive ambiance and community image and identity by providing for architectural and site design\ntreatments that will enhance the visual appearance of certain commercial development and the quality of life.\nD. The applicable commercial development depends on high visibility from public streets. In turn, design of certain commercial buildings and sites\ndetermines much of the image and attractiveness of the streetscapes and character of the community. Massive, duplicative or generic projects\nthat do not contribute to, or integrate with, the community in a positive manner can be detrimental to a community's image and sense of place.\nE. This Section incorporates a basic level of architectural design which, in conjunction with site design, landscaping, lighting and sign treatments\nlocated elsewhere in this Ordinance, is intended to result in a comprehensive scheme for building design and site development. However, this\nSection is not intended to require any specific style of architecture.\nF. This Section is also intended to:\n1. Promote high standards in architectural design and the construction of creative, innovative, aesthetically pleasing structures;\n2. Encourage landowners, designers and developers to look closely at local conditions and the development site, and produce new\ndevelopment that enhances and complements both the built and natural environment;\n3. Ensure that development and building design is sensitive to the specific site, consistent with the existing and proposed character of the area,\nincluding residential and nonresidential uses in the surrounding area, and does not detract from the positive elements existing\nneighborhood characteristics.\n6.7.2. Large Scale Commercial Defined\nLarge scale commercial developments are considered to be any structure or group of structures that share common walls that have an enclosed\ngross floor area of 75,000 square feet or more.\n6.7.3. Applicability\nThe requirements of this section shall apply in the following circumstances:\nA. Where compliance with these standards is explicitly required in other portions of this Ordinance.\nB.\nConstruction of any new use classified as Commercial or Office (see Section 5.1, Use Interpretation).\nC. Construction of any new use classified as Industrial when located within 100 feet of a public roadway.\nD. Expansion or modification of an existing commercial or office use that increases the total enclosed floor area by at least 50% or 5,000 square\nfeet, whichever is greater.\n6.7.4. Standards\n172 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\nNEW PAGE 173\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blanl\nCommentary: Compliance with the requirements for items such as parking, landscaping, screening, and other components of this Ordinance is still\nrequired.\nA. Building Materials\nPredominant exterior building materials shall be high quality material. These include, without limitation: brick, natural decay resistant quality\nexterior wood siding, rock, stone or tinted and textured concrete masonry units, and transparent glass windows and doors. Facade colors shall\nbe neutral or earth tone colors. Building trim and accent areas may feature brighter colors, including primary colors, but these colors may not\ncomprise more than 15% of any building facade.\nB. Requirements for Building Massing and Articulation\n1. The design shall help integrate the development with its surroundings by breaking down the apparent mass and scale of the building on all\nsides.\n2. No more than 75,000 gross square feet of the structure shall be designed as a distinct mass. Preferably, two or more building masses shall\nbe expressed.\n3. The primary (front) facade shall be designed to comply with the requirements of Section 6.8, Building Facade Design.\n4. All facades visible from a public roadway shall be given equal design significance. There shall be no blank, featureless walls, including rear\nwalls. The design shall present a continuity of style on all facades visible from the public roadway, except where separated by a party wall\nlocated on a lot line.\n5. Outparcels shall be designed and integrated with the main project.\nC. Integration into the Street Network\nInternal and new streets shall connect to existing streets or be designed to facilitate future connections to the maximum extent possible.\nD. Review Required\nCompliance with the large-scale commercial requirements shall be demonstrated through submittal of architectural drawings at the time of site\ndevelopment plan review or where no site development plan is required, submittal of architectural drawings directly to the Planning Director.\nDrawings shall include, but not be limited to, a floor plan, roof plan and all exterior building elevations, and any other information deemed\nnecessary to demonstrate compliance with this Section.\nE. Criteria for Approval\nThe Planning Director shall apply the following criteria in making a determination of compliance with these large-scale commercial\nrequirements.\n1. The petition is complete and the information contained within the petition is sufficient and correct enough to allow adequate review and\nfinal action.\n2.

Large Scale Commercial\nA. General Purpose and Intent\nB. The purpose of this Section is to supplement development standards elsewhere in these zoning regulations with specific criteria that apply to\nthe design of certain commercial buildings and projects.\nC. The County's goal is to create and maintain a positive ambiance and community image and identity by providing for architectural and site design\ntreatments that will enhance the visual appearance of certain commercial development and the quality of life.\nD. The applicable commercial development depends on high visibility from public streets. In turn, design of certain commercial buildings and sites\ndetermines much of the image and attractiveness of the streetscapes and character of the community. Massive, duplicative or generic projects\nthat do not contribute to, or integrate with, the community in a positive manner can be detrimental to a community's image and sense of place.\nE. This Section incorporates a basic level of architectural design which, in conjunction with site design, landscaping, lighting and sign treatments\nlocated elsewhere in this Ordinance, is intended to result in a comprehensive scheme for building design and site development. However, this\nSection is not intended to require any specific style of architecture.\nF. This Section is also intended to:\n1. Promote high standards in architectural design and the construction of creative, innovative, aesthetically pleasing structures;\n2. Encourage landowners, designers and developers to look closely at local conditions and the development site, and produce new\ndevelopment that enhances and complements both the built and natural environment;\n3. Ensure that development and building design is sensitive to the specific site, consistent with the existing and proposed character of the area,\nincluding residential and nonresidential uses in the surrounding area, and does not detract from the positive elements existing\nneighborhood characteristics.\n6.7.2. Large Scale Commercial Defined\nLarge scale commercial developments are considered to be any structure or group of structures that share common walls that have an enclosed\ngross floor area of 75,000 square feet or more.\n6.7.3. Applicability\nThe requirements of this section shall apply in the following circumstances:\nA. Where compliance with these standards is explicitly required in other portions of this Ordinance.\nB.\nConstruction of any new use classified as Commercial or Office (see Section 5.1, Use Interpretation).\nC. Construction of any new use classified as Industrial when located within 100 feet of a public roadway.\nD.
