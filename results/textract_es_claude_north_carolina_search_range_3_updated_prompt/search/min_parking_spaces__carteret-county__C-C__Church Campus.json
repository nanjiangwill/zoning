Such flexibility shall include\nplacement at the property line, near the use, and all points in-between the use and the property line.\nChain-link and other wire fences on non-residential property cannot be used to provide required screening, even when slat inserts are used.\nSuch screening is not required at access points to the property, such as entrances, exits, driveways, and sidewalks. Screening planted near driveways,\nentrances, and exits intersecting with a roadway shall be planted so that the outside edge of the plantings is no closer than 15 feet to the intersection\nand shall be kept trimmed so that the outside edge of the plantings is no closer than 10 feet to the intersection. If a DOT driveway permit requires a sight\ntriangle at a driveway, entrance, or exit, the portion of any required 15-foot vegetative planting area that would otherwise overlap the sight triangle shall\nbe omitted.\nF. Maintenance of screening. All screening required by this ordinance shall be maintained in a healthy state by the property owner(s) so as to continue its\neffectiveness. Periodic inspections may be made to determine continued effectiveness of the required screening. Any deficiencies, if not addressed to\nthe satisfaction of the Planning Director or designee, shall be treated as a violation of this ordinance.\nAny shrub that is required screening that needs to be replaced due to an unhealthy state or because it has not grown to be five feet tall after three\ngrowing seasons shall be replaced within 30 days of notification in writing by the Planning Director or designee. Any trees that are required screening\nthat need to be replaced due to an unhealthy state shall be replaced within 180 days of notification in writing by the Planning Director or designee. If the\nunhealthy state is caused by a natural disaster (such as a hurricane, extreme drought, forest fire, etc.), the replacement period for shrubs and trees shall\nbe doubled to 60 days and 360 days, respectively.\nThe replacement screening shall be of the same species or of similar effectiveness for screening, as determined by the Planning Director or designee,\nand shall be at least as tall as the two nearest plants or plantings in that group, tier, or row, as appropriate.\nG. When a vegetative planting area is deemed inappropriate by the Planning Director or designee due to site, neighborhood, or other conditions, the\nPlanning Director or designee may allow either a durable masonry wall or privacy fence or any combination of walls, fences, and vegetation that are\ndesigned to be compatible with the character of adjacent properties, as determined by the Planning Director or designee.\nH. Walls and fences. Within residential districts, walls and fences that are required by this ordinance must be at least five feet in height but shall not be\ngreater than eight feet in height, measured from the ground along the common lot line of adjoining properties. Along non-residential zoning district\nboundaries, walls and fences that are required by this ordinance must be at least five feet in height but shall not be greater than ten feet high. Walls and\nfences must be constructed and maintained in a safe and sound condition. Walls and fences near driveways and entrances and exits intersecting with a\nroadway shall be no closer than ten feet to the intersection.\nNo fence or wall taller than three feet (whether required or not) may be located in the front yard setback or the side yard on street right-of-way setback.\nWhen chain-link and other wire fences are installed on a non-residential property, they shall be screened by Group One plantings. Screening of other\ntypes of walls and fences on non-residential property is not required but plantings along them are encouraged, particularly along taller sections and\nlonger stretches.\nI. Screening outdoor storage. Outdoor storage of any material, stocks, or equipment (other than junkyards and salvage yards), whether the outdoor\nstorage is a principal use or an accessory use, on any lot within any district (other than a residential district or use) must be screened from any abutting\nresidential use or district, in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance.\nJ. Screening junkyards and salvage yards. Junkyards and salvage yards must be screened from public view from any public or private street and from any\nabutting lots in accordance with the requirements of section 1601.1 and other pertinent provisions of this ordinance.\nK. Waiver of screening requirements when screening is already provided. There may be cases where the unusual topography or elevation of a site, the size\nof the parcel involved, existing vegetation on the site, or the presence of screening on abutting property would make the strict adherence to the\nordinance serve no useful purpose. In those cases, the Planning Director or designee is empowered to waive the requirements for some or all of the\nscreening, as long as the spirit and intent of the ordinance and the general provisions of this ordinance pertaining to screening are adhered to.\nL. Vegetative requirements along shorelines of sounds, rivers, canals and other water bodies. Except when accessory structures are allowed in rear or side\nyards under other provisions of this ordinance, the minimum rear and side yards for the zoning district in which the lot is located shall remain vegetated\non waterfront lots. The vegetation shall consist of grass, trees, other planted ground cover, or remain in a natural state. Only the sides of the lot abutting\nthe sound, river, canal, or other water body shall comply with this requirement.\nM. Screening and trash receptacles. Dumpsters, trash compactors, and similar trash receptacles, whether located in a residential or non-residential\ndevelopment (other than a receptacle that serves just one single-family or two-family residence on the same premises), shall be enclosed on all four\nsides, except that one of the four sides may have a three-foot wide pass-through opening for persons to access the dumpster without having to open the\ndumpster gate. The trash receptacle shall be oriented so that the opening is visible to the fewest number of residences, whether the residences are on-\nsite or off-site. Three of the sides must be constructed of durable materials that match or complement the principal building. The fourth side shall be an\nopaque gate that latches securely to prevent it from inadvertently opening. The wall and gate shall have a minimum height of eight feet. A chain link\nfence shall not be permitted for the wall or the gate.\n1601.2. General buffering requirements. Buffering is used to reduce conflicts between and impacts on, adjoining land uses by separating them with a grassed buffer\nyard or strip. The developer may substitute a landscaped buffer for the grassed one.\nA. When a non-residential property is developed adjacent to a:\n19 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\n\nNEW PAGE 20\nCarteret County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(1) Residential or institutional use or district, at least a five-foot wide buffer yard or strip must be provided along all side property lines and at least a 15-\nfoot wide buffer yard or strip must be provided along all rear property lines that abut that residential or institutional use or district.\nThe developer may elect to use a durable masonry wall or privacy fence that is at least eight feet tall and is designed to be compatible with the\ncharacter of adjacent properties. If the materials, height, and design are approved by the Planning Director or designee, the approved wall or fence\nmay be used to substitute for up to 8 feet of the required 15-foot buffer yard or strip.\n(2) Public or private street, at least a 20-foot wide grassed buffer yard or strip must be provided along all property lines that abut or are a part of a public\nor private street.\nB.\nNo fence or wall taller than three feet (whether required or not) may be located in the front yard setback or the side yard on street right-of-way setback.\nThe required buffer yard or strip must be installed and be in compliance with the Zoning Ordinance before a Certificate of Occupancy can be granted.\nC. Maintenance of buffering. Any buffer yard or strip that is required by this ordinance shall be maintained in a healthy state by the property owner(s) so as\nto continue its effectiveness. Periodic inspections may be made to determine continued effectiveness of the required buffering. Any deficiencies, if not\naddressed to the satisfaction of the Planning Director or designee within 30 days of notification in writing by the Planning Director or designee, shall be\ntreated as a violation of this ordinance.\n(Amd. of 11-19-07(5); Ord. of 7-21-08(5))\n1602. - Development within flood zones.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) governs development within flood zones with the use of flood insurance rate maps (FIRM). Five flood zones\nhave been designated: \"VE\", \"AE\", \"AO\", Shaded X and Unshaded X zones. Any development within the \"VE\", \"AE\", and \"AO\" zones must meet the minimum height\nrequirement as per the FIRM. Should a property owner not agree with the FIRM, an appeal may be made to FEMA.\n(Res. of 6-21-21)\n1603. - Development within coastal area management zone.\nThe North Carolina Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA) governs development within certain areas of environmental concern, including areas directly abutting\ncoastal waters. Prior to issuance of a zoning permit, required CAMA permits must have been issued.\n1604. Structures permitted above the height limit.\n1604.1. The following structures, features, or equipment are permitted above the height limit in any district: silos, skylights and roof structures for elevators,\nstairways, tanks, ventilating fans, air conditioning, or similar equipment for the operation or maintenance of the building and any device used for screening such\nstructures and equipment.\n1604.2. The following structures are permitted above the height limit on lots in the business, church campus, and industrial districts which do not abut lots in any\nresidential district: towers, steeples, flagpoles, chimneys, water tanks or similar structures. If this type of structure is on a lot which abuts a residential district, then the\npart of the structure above the height limit must be separated from any such abutting lot line by a distance equal to at least one-half of its height measured from the\nground. Towers used to support electric power and other utility lines are exempt from this requirement.\n1604.3. The structures listed in section 1604.2 above are also permitted above the height limit in residential districts. However, any part of such a structure which\nextends above the height limit must be separated from any abutting property line by a distance equal to at least half of its height measured from the ground.\nOtherwise the structure will be subject to the usual requirements for the particular district. Towers used to support electric power and other utility lines are exempt\nfrom this requirement. Towers and other similar structures used solely for the purposes of amateur radio reception and transmission shall be exempt from this\nrequirement.\n1604.4. Radio and television towers and similar structures are permitted above the height limit in any district. If such a structure is located on a lot in or abutting a\nresidential district, it must be located at least 50 feet from all abutting residential property lines or at a distance equal to its height, whichever is greater.\n1604.5. The height of any structure shall be measured from its finished grade.\n1605. Accessory structures.\nAccessory structures will not be permitted in any required front yard or within five feet of any side or rear exterior property line. If located on a corner lot, the\naccessory structure will not be nearer to the side street than the principal structure. Security guard stations and gates may be located within any required setback or\nyard provided that the site has been approved by the zoning enforcement officer. Underground accessory structures will be permitted within any setback or yard\nrequirement in any district but shall not be permitted any closer than five feet to any exterior property line. Canopies to cover gasoline pumps are permitted to be\nlocated ten feet from any exterior property line. Exempted from the requirements for accessory structures are well houses, fences, mail boxes, flower boxes, dog\nhouses, and the like.\n1606. Public utility companies.\nPublic utilities may be established in any district in conformance with the requirements listed below:\n20 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\n\nNEW PAGE 21\nCarteret County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n.1\nLots must conform to minimum setback and yard requirements of the district in which they are located.\n.2 The design of buildings, structures and facilities on the site should conform as closely as possible to the character of the area or neighborhood.\n.3 Adequate fencing or comparable safety devices must be installed and maintained in order to make the facility inaccessible to the public.\n.4 Portions of properties not used for buildings, parking, or related services must be maintained with planted ground cover. Screening must be provided in\naccordance with the provisions of section 1601.\n1607. - Setbacks for lots in un-zoned areas.\nMinimum Building Setbacks\nDetached garages, carports, and accessory buildings may be constructed a minimum of five feet from a side or rear property line. Such buildings shall, however, be\nset back fifteen feet from a side property line that abuts a street on a corner lot and set back from a front property line a minimum of 20 feet.\n(Res. of 5-18-15)\n1608. - Minimum requirements for mixed uses.\nWhen two or more uses occupy the same building and those uses would normally have different minimum requirements, the more restrictive requirements shall\napply. The off-street parking and loading requirements for each use must be fully met.\n1609. - Modifications of setbacks.\nWhen a lot is nonconforming relative to its width, the side yard requirements for the lot may be reduced by a distance equal to the average of the district\nrequirement and the established nonconforming side yard created by existing primary structures within a 300-foot radius. In no case shall a structure and its\narchitectural features such as cornices, leaves, steps, gutters and fire escapes be allowed any closer than seven feet to a side property line.\n1610. - Certain extensions into yards allowed.\nArchitectural features such as cornices, leaves, gutters, and handicapped ramps may project up to three feet into any required yard or beyond any required setback\nunless such a feature would obstruct driveways which may be used for service or emergency vehicles. HVAC equipment and other machinery attached to and servicing\na dwelling may project up to three feet into any required yard or beyond any required setback.\n(Res. of 6-21-21)\n1611. Reserved.\n1612. - Side and rear yards next to railroad or waterfront.\nIn business and industrial districts, side and rear yards are not required abutting railroad rights-of-way. In I-W and P-I districts side yards and rear yards are not\nrequired on the waterfront side of lots that abut the water.\n1613. - Location of required yards on irregular lots.\nThe location of required front, side, and rear yards on irregularly shaped lots will be determined by the zoning enforcement officer. The determination will be based\non the spirit and intent of this ordinance to achieve an appropriate spacing and location of buildings on individual lots.\n1614. Special yard requirements for corner lots.\nIn any zoning district, the side yard requirements for corner lots along the side street right-of-way shall be required to have an additional ten feet of yard\nrequirement, unless otherwise stated.\n21 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\nCELL (1, 1): \nFrom the front property line\nCELL (1, 2): \n20 feet\nCELL (2, 1): \nFrom the front property line on a lot abutting a major thoroughfare street\nCELL (2, 2): \n40 feet\nCELL (3, 1): \nFrom the side property line\nCELL (3, 2): \n10 feet\nCELL (4, 1): \nFrom the side property line on a corner lot\nCELL (4, 2): \n15 feet\nCELL (5, 1): \nFrom the rear property line\nCELL (5, 2): \n30 feet\n", "page_number": 19, "page_range": [19, 20, 21], "highlight": ["The following structures are permitted above the height limit on lots in the business, <em>church</em> <em>campus</em>,", "The <em>off</em>-<em>street</em> <em>parking</em> <em>and</em> <em>loading</em> <em>requirements</em> for each use must be fully met.\n1609. - Modifications"], "score": 6.7589087, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Church Campus\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"C-C\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"CC\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"C-C\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking space for each\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 78\nCarteret County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n3.

Special uses in the port industrial district (P-I).\nThe port industrial district (P-I) is established as a district to provide and protect areas for port-related industrial purposes and uses which are dependent to some\ndegree on nearby water or need access to nearby harbors or bodies of water. Due to the uniqueness of this district, all special uses shall be required to obtain a major\nspecial use permit.\nA. Prior to granting a major special use permit in the P-I district, the board of county commissioners must make the following findings:\n1. That the special use will not materially endanger the public health, public safety, adjacent water and air resources or environment if located where\nproposed and developed according to the plan, as submitted and approved;\n2. That the special use meets all the requirements, conditions, and specifications of this ordinance;\n3. That the use will not substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property;\n4. That the location and character of the use, if developed according to the plan, as submitted and approved, will be in harmony with the area in which\nit is to be located and in general conformity with the plan of development;\n5.
