Promote sequestration of carbon dioxide through the establishment of new trees or the retention of\nexisting trees on lots following the development process;\n2. Protect species diversity and habitat through the establishment of connected or linked areas of\nprotected forest;\n3. Encourage the retention of existing trees during the development process through accelerated credit\ntowards landscaping requirements; and\n4. Establish tree protection requirements for trees voluntarily proposed for retention during the\ndevelopment process.\nB. APPLICABILITY\nUnless exempted in accordance with Section 7.2.C, Exemptions, the standards in this section shall apply\nto all lands and development, including subdivisions of land for single-family detached residential\ndwellings, in the City's jurisdiction.\nC.

Reforestation Standards\na.
