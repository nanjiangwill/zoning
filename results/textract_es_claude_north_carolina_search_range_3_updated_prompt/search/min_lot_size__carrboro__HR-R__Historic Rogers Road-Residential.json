IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\nCommunity's Future community planning effort, completed in May 2016. The intent of Mapping\nOur Community's Future and the HR districts is to:\n(1)\nCreate opportunities for long-term residents to continue living in the\ncommunity and to age in place;\n(2)\nPreserve the socioeconomic and cultural diversity of the neighborhood;\n(3)\nIncrease physical connections within the neighborhood, including for\npedestrians and bicyclists;\n(4)\nRespect and protect the natural character of the neighborhood;\n(5)\nEnsure that new development is consistent with neighborhood character and\nthe vision that residents have developed for its future;\n(6)\nProvide greater residential housing choice, affordability, and diversity;\n(7)\nIncrease economic opportunities within the neighborhood;\n(8)\nIncrease recreational resources within the neighborhood; and\n(9)\nEnsure that new development is adequately served by infrastructure,\nincluding streets, sidewalks, and utilities.\n(b)\nThe HR-R zoning district is designed to protect and preserve the character of\nexisting lower-density areas (minimum lot size 14,520 square feet, or no more than three lots per\nacre) within the neighborhood while providing for compatible new development, including new\nhousing choice options, and increased home occupation opportunities for residents.\n(c)\nThe HR-CC district is designed to provide for a broader range of housing and\nemployment options by concentrating new development into nodes which will balance providing\nareas for desired new uses while protecting the overall neighborhood character. Uses appropriate\nin the HR-CC district include live-work units, flex space, and low-intensity neighborhood-serving\nestablishments such as healthcare, assisted living, elder care, child care, and recreation facilities.\nProperty proposed for rezoning to an HR-CC district shall include no less than 5 contiguous acres.\nThe district may be expanded to include additional parcels of land SO long as such parcels: (i) are\ncontiguous to the district, and (ii) are the same, or part of the same, tracts or parcels of land that\nwere identified in Mapping Our Community's Future for more intensive uses. The development\nof an HR-CC district may include the recombination of existing lots and/or the subdivision of new\nlots that meet the density and dimensional standards outlined in Article XII.\nPage #6\n\nNEW PAGE 7\nArt. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\nSection 15-137 Manufacturing Districts Established. (AMENDED 6/22/82; 2/4/86)\n(1)\nThe M-1 and M-2 districts are hereby created to accomplish the purposes and serve\nthe objectives set forth in this subsection. Part of Article XI contains performance standards that place\nlimitations on the characteristics of uses located in the districts created by this section.\n(a)\nM-1 LIGHT MANUFACTURING This zone is designed to accommodate a\nlimited range of industrial activities and a wide range of commercial uses\nincluding wholesaling, storage, mail-order, auto related, and office and retail\nin conjunction with industrial or wholesaling uses. Permitted industrial uses\ninclude enterprises engaged in manufacturing, processing, creating, repairing,\nrenovating, painting, cleaning and assembly where all operations are\ncontained inside a fully enclosed building. The performance standards for the\nM-1 zone located in Part I of Article XI are more restrictive than those in the\nM-2 district.\n(b)\nM-2 GENERAL MANUFACTURING This district is designed to accommodate\nthe widest range of industrial uses. Business operations may be conducted\nwithin and outside a fully enclosed building. The performance standards for\nthis zone are less restrictive than those in the M-1 district.\n(2)\nThere is also established a watershed light industrial (WM-3) zoning district. The\npurpose of this district is to allow areas within the University Lake Watershed that have been zoned\nM-1 prior to the effective date of this subdivision to continue to be used and developed for light\nindustrial and related purposes, subject to certain restrictions designed to protect the watershed.\nConsistent with the purpose of this zone, this district shall be confined to that area zoned M-1 on the\neffective date of this subsection (12/7/1983); this area shall not be expanded and no new WM-3 areas\nshall be designated. For the purposes of this section, changes to make WM-3 zoning uniform on lots\nthat were depicted as entirely within the M-1 zoning at the time of its establishment, but that were\nlater depicted as being bisected by the zoning boundary, will not be considered an expansion of the\ndistrict or the creation of new WM-3 areas. (AMENDED 12/7/83; 06/27/17)\n(3)\nThere is also established a Planned Industrial Development (PID) zoning district. The\npurpose of this district is to provide for the possibility of well-planned and tightly controlled industrial\ndevelopment in areas that are suitable for such development but that are not deemed appropriate for\nM-1 or M-2 zoning because of the less restricted types of development that may occur in such zones.\n(AMENDED 6/22/82; 12/7/83)\n(a)\nNo area less than twenty contiguous acres may be zoned as a Planned\nIndustrial Development district, and then only upon a request submitted by or\non behalf of the owner or owners of all the property intended to be covered by\nsuch zone.\nPage #7\n\nNEW PAGE 8\nArt. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\n(b)\nAs indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses (Section 15-146) a planned\nindustrial development (use classification 30.000) is the only permissible use\nin a PID zone.\n(c)\nSubject to subdivision (2) of this subsection, and consistent with the\nrestrictions contained in the definition of a planned industrial development\n[see Subdivision 15-15], land within a PID zone may be used in a manner that\nwould be permissible if the land were zoned M-1, except that (i) the only\npermissible uses are those described in the 2.130 and 4.100 classifications and\n(ii) the performance standards (Article XI, Part I) applicable to 4.100 uses in\nbusiness zones shall govern uses in a planned industrial development.\nSection 15-138 Public Facilities District Established.\nThere is hereby created a Public Facilities (P-F) zoning district. Within this district, those\nuses indicated as permissible in the Table of Permissible Uses may be developed, but only if such\ndevelopments are owned and operated by the United States, the State of North Carolina, Orange\nCounty, the Town of Carrboro, or any agency, department, or subdivision of the foregoing\ngovernments.\nSection 15-139 Planned Unit Development District Established.\n(1)\nThere are hereby established sixty different Planned Unit Development (PUD) zoning\ndistricts as described in this section. Each PUD zoning district is designed to combine the\ncharacteristics of at least two and possibly three zoning districts. (AMENDED 2/24/87)\n(a)\nOne element of each PUD district shall be the residential element. Here there\nare six possibilities, each one corresponding to one of the following residential\ndistricts identified in Section 15-135: R-20, R-15, R-10, R-7.5, R-3, or\nR- S.I.R. Within that portion of the PUD zone that is developed for purposes\npermissible in a residential district, all development must be in accordance\nwith the regulations applicable to the residential zoning district to which the\nparticular PUD zoning district corresponds.\n(b)\nA second element of each PUD district shall be the commercial element. Here\nthere are five possibilities, each one corresponding to either the B-1(g), B-2,\nB-3, O, or O/A zoning districts established by Section 15-136. Within that\nportion of a PUD district that is developed for purposes permissible in a\ncommercial district, all development must be in accordance with the\nregulations applicable to the commercial district to which the PUD district\ncorresponds. (AMENDED 2/04/97)\n(c)\nA manufacturing/processing element may be a third element of any PUD\ndistrict. Here there are two alternatives. The first is that uses permitted within\nthe M-1 district would be permitted within the PUD district. The second\nalternative is that uses permitted only within the M-1 or M-2 zoning districts\nPage #8\n", "page_number": 6, "page_range": [6, 7, 8], "highlight": ["(b)\nThe <em>HR</em>-<em>R</em> zoning
