Except when MU-V\ndevelopment is separated from the residential district by an arterial street with a right-of-way of one hundred (100) feet or greater, in which case the setbacks of the underlying zoning district\nwould apply.\n(2)\nMinimum interior setback adjacent to residentially zoned land shall be equal to the interior setback applicable in the adjacent residential district.\n(3) Minimum solar setback adjacent to residentially zoned land shall be equal to the solar setback applicable in the adjacent residential district.\n(4) The primary height limitation applicable at any of the modified setbacks identified in (1)-(3) above shall not exceed thirty-five (35) feet.\n3.8.5 Reserved.\n3.8.6 Reserved.\nEditor's note- Ord. No. 2010-06-21/0-11, 4, adopted June 21, 2010, repealed subsection 3.8.5, Housing Floor Area Restrictions for Major Subdivisions and subsection 3.8.6, Alternatives to Floor Area\nRestrictions of the Land Use Development Ordinance; provided, however, that in the event Section 2 of this ordinance No. 2010-06-21/O-11 is, subsequent to its enactment, ruled void or unenforceable in its\nentirety or in substantial part by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction, Sections 3.8.5 and 3.8.6 shall be automatically reinstated without the need for further action by the Town Council.\n3.8.7 Incentive for Residential Construction in Town Center (TC) Districts.\nThe purpose of this section is to provide an incentive for the construction of dwelling units in the town center.\n(a) The amount of floor reserved for residential uses on new or expanded lots shall be excluded from the floor area ratio calculation as follows:\nTC Residential Floor Area Bonus\n3.8.8 Cluster Development.\n(a) Generally. The town encourages cluster developments as defined in Appendix A [Definitions]. Cluster developments, as defined in Appendix A [Definitions], require modification of lot size\nstandards; individual lots may be somewhat smaller but the sum of reductions in lot area becomes common recreation area for the benefit of all residents of the cluster development. The\nrecreation area is increased and the intensity of development is controlled. Cluster developments also allow the developer greater design flexibility and will permit reasonable use of land with\ndifficult topography.\n(b) Approval requirements. The town council may approve a cluster development in any residential district, or the HR-L or HR-M Special Districts, if it finds that:\n(1) The tract proposed for cluster development is at least two (2) acres in size.\n(2) Public, separate, water supply and sewerage connections are available for every subdivided lot.\n(3)\nThe total number of lots proposed for the tract, excluding parcels of reserved recreation area, is not greater than the number determined by multiplying the total gross land area by the\nmaximum density established in section 3.8 for that zoning district.\n(4) The recreation area reserved within the tract shall conform to the recreation area standards of section 5.5.\n(5) The minimum amount of land reserved as recreation area shall be the sum of all reductions in minimum gross land area as a result of the cluster form of development, combined with the\nminimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5. Only the minimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5 may be dedicated outside the boundaries of the land being\nsubdivided as specified in section 5.5.2.\n(c)\nReductions in lot and setback requirements. For lots created as part of a cluster development, minimum gross land area, minimum lot width, and minimum setback requirements may be reduced\nas follows:\n(1) Minimum lot size requirements specified in section 3.8 may be reduced to five thousand, five hundred (5,500) square feet gross land area.\n(2) Minimum lot width requirements specified in section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to fifty (50) feet.\n(3) Minimum street setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the street lot line forms an exterior boundary of the cluster development.\n(4)\nMinimum interior setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to eight (8) feet except where the interior lot line\nforms a boundary of the cluster development.\n(5) Minimum solar setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the north lot line forms\na\nboundary of the cluster development.\n(d) Floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations. For lots created as part of a cluster development, floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations, as shown in Table 3.8-1, shall be\ncalculated using the gross land area of the lot or the minimum lot size for the zoning district, whichever is greater.\n(Ord.

Dimensional standards.\nPurpose statement: It is the intent of this article to provide for performance standards which serve to define the development character of an area, and to ensure the compatibility of development both\nwith the environmental characteristics, accessibility levels, and special amenities offered by the development site and with surrounding land uses and development intensities. It is further intended that the\nestablishment of intensity regulations reflect the protection of critical environmental areas and the suitability of land for a particular level of development intensity, in accord with the goals and objectives of\nthe comprehensive plan.\nThe setback and height regulations established in the dimensional matrix are intended to ensure adequate solar access, privacy, and ventilation; access to and around buildings, off-street parking areas,\nloading space, and service areas; space for landscaping; and spacing between buildings and portions of buildings to reduce potential adverse effects of noise, odor, glare, or fire. Adequate solar access is\ndeemed to consist of varying levels of access ranging from rooftop solar access in high-intensity zoning districts to south wall solar access in low-intensity zoning districts.\n3.8.1 Establishment and General Applicability of Dimensional Regulations.\nExcept as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, regulations governing the dimensions of lots and buildings are hereby established as described in section 3.8.2 and shown in Table 3.8-1.\n(a) No land or structure shall be used or occupied, and no structure, or part thereof, shall be constructed, erected, altered, or moved except in compliance with the dimensional regulations herein\nspecified for each zoning district.\n(b)\nNo portion of land used in connection with an existing or proposed structure or use of land and necessary for compliance with the dimensional regulations of this article shall also be used,\nthrough sale or otherwise, as part of the land required in connection with any other development.\n(c) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, dimensional regulations applicable to OI-3 and OI-4 zoning districts and planned development zoning lots shall be applied to the district or lot as a\nwhole and not to individual parts thereof.\n3.8.2 Dimensional Regulations.\nAbout the Building Envelope. Sections (f)-(j) define the three-dimensional building envelope. All structures, or portions thereof, must be placed within the building envelope and may not encroach the\nbuilding envelope unless specifically exempted by this Appendix.\nDivisions (f) and (g) regulate the setback height and core height, respectively, which together define the vertical extent of the building envelope.\nDivisions (h)-(j) regulate the street, interior, and north setback lines, respectively, which together define the perimeter setback line and horizontal extent of the building envelope.\nDefinitions. Refer to Appendix A for definitions of applicable terms.\n(a) Zoning District. Column (A) refers to the applicable Zoning District. The requirements set forth in sections (b)-(i) below, relate to the zoning district specified in the row under Column (A),\n(b) Minimum Lot Size. Column (B) is expressed in square feet of gross land area.\nNotes:\n(1) Where a zoning lot is located in more than one zoning district, the minimum gross land area required of such zoning lot shall be the sum of the areas derived by multiplying the minimum\ngross land area required for each represented district by the proportion of the zoning lot located within that district.\n(2) For all uses that consist of three (3) or more dwelling units, the minimum lot size is two (2) times the figure shown in Column (B).\n(c) Minimum Frontage. Column (C) is the minimum width of the lot measured along the street.\nNotes:\n(1) Where a zoning lot fronts on two (2) or more streets, minimum street frontage width requirements shall be considered met if the frontage along any one of such streets meets the minimum\nstreet frontage width requirements.\n(2) Where a zoning lot fronts on a turning circle of a cul-de-sac or at a point of a street where the radius of the curvature of the right-of-way is less than ninety (90) feet, the minimum street\nfrontage width requirement shall be thirty-five (35) feet.\n(d) Minimum Lot Width. Column (D) is the minimum width of the lot, expressed in feet, measured at least twenty-five (25) feet interior from the minimum street setback. No portion of a lot, created\nas part of a subdivision, between a street setback and the opposite interior (rear) setback, shall be less than twenty (20) feet in width.\nException:\n(1) Authorized flag lots, created as part of a subdivision and subject to the lot layout standards in section 5.2, may contain areas between a street setback and the opposite interior (rear) setback\nthat are less than twenty (20) feet in width. Authorized flag lots shall reach the minimum lot width at a point not to exceed two hundred (200) feet from the street right-of-way.\nNotes:\n(2) Where a zoning lot fronts on two (2) or more streets, minimum lot width requirements shall be considered met if the lot width at the street setback from any one of such streets meets the\nminimum lot width requirement.\n(3)\nWhere a zoning lot fronts on a turning circle of a cul-de-sac or at a point of a street where the radius of the curvature of the right-of-way is less than ninety (90) feet, the minimum lot width\nshall be reached at a distance derived by the following formula: D = 50 (W)(35) 50, where W = minimum required lot width, and D = maximum distance from street right-of-way to where the\nlot width equals the minimum required width for that district.\n(e) Maximum Setback Height: Column (E) is the maximum allowable height at the perimeter setback line of a zoning lot, as defined by the minimum street, interior, and solar setbacks.\n(1)\nHeight shall be measured from mean finished grade, along the street fa\u00e7ade of the building. Where a structure fronts more than one (1) street, height shall be measured from the lower, more\nrestrictive mean finished grade.\n(2)\n42 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 43\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nTo determine mean finished grade, take the spot elevations from the highest and lowest points of the foundation. The average of these two (2) spots elevations is the mean finished grade and the elevation\nfrom which height measurements are made.\n(3) The entire structure, and all portions thereof, is subject to the maximum setback height.\nExceptions:\nA. The structure or part thereof is below the allowable core height, as described in division (g) below.\nB. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted in section 3.8.3 Exceptions to Setback and Height Requirements, below.\nC. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted as provided elsewhere in this Appendix.\n(4) For purposes of applying setback and height regulations to development within an OI-3 or OI-4 zoning district or within a townhouse development or a planned development, all contiguous\nland within the district, townhouse development, or planned development shall be considered as a single zoning lot.\n(f) Maximum Core Height: Column (F) is the maximum allowable height in the interior or core area of a lot. The core height provides additional allowable height on the interior of a zoning lot based\non the horizontal distance measured away from the perimeter setback line of the lot. The allowable core height increases with the distance interior to the lot, measured from the perimeter\nsetback line at a rate described below.\n(1) In all Zoning Districts, except those explicitly named in subdivision (2), the allowable core height increases at a rate of one (1) foot in height for every two (2) feet of distance interior to the lot,\nmeasured away from the perimeter setbacks. This is equivalent to a slope of 1/2 (rise/run) or 1:2.\n(2) In the Town Center 1 to 3, Office/Institutional 3 to 4 zoning districts the allowable core height increases at the following rates:\nA. Street and interior setbacks: one (1) feet in height for every one (1) feet of distance interior to the lot, measured away from the street and interior setbacks. This is equivalent to a slope of\n1/1 (rise/run) or 1:1.\nB. Solar setbacks: one (1) feet in height for every one (1) foot and seven-tenths of a foot (1.7 feet) of distance interior to the lot, measured away from the street and interior setbacks. This is\nequivalent to a slope of 1/1.7 (rise/run) or 1:1.7.\n(3) No structure, or part thereof, shall project beyond the allowable core height of a structure or part thereof.\nExceptions:\nA. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted in section 3.8.3 Exceptions to Setback and Height Requirements, below.\nB. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted as provided elsewhere in this Appendix.\n(4) If a structure is located in the vicinity of an airport, the height limitations set forth in Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 77, or successor regulations, shall apply where such limitations are\nstricter than those established in this appendix.\n(g) Minimum Street Setback. Column (G) establishes a minimum setback from the street right-of-way line. Where a zoning lot fronts on a street with a right-of-way width not meeting the standards of\nthis appendix, street setback shall be measured from a line running parallel to the centerline of the street at a distance from such centerline equal to one-half (1/2) the standard right-of-way width\nof the street.\nException:\n(1) The town manager or town council may exempt lots from this requirement upon making one (1) of the following findings:\nA. Where a building line has already been established by existing structures along the block which are situated on lots comprising at least twenty-five (25) percent of the street frontage, the\nbuilding may be constructed at the established building line; or\nB. The existing right-of-way is adequate to encompass any anticipated need for widening of the street or other improvements and widening of the right-of-way to town standards would\ncreate nonconforming street setbacks for other structures on the street.\n(h) Minimum Interior Setback. Column (H) establishes a minimum setback measured from the interior lot lines.\nException:\n(1) The interior setback requirements may be reduced to zero (0) under certain conditions (see section 5.2.8.).\nNote:\n(2) Side setbacks are set at zero (0) in many non-residential districts in order to encourage the formation of a street wall, as is found in traditional commercial centers such as the TC district along\nFranklin Street.\n(i) Minimum Solar Setback. Column (I) establishes a minimum setback measured from north lot lines. Where a solar setback and either a street or interior setback both apply to the same portion of a\nlot line, the required minimum setback shall be the greater of the two (2).\nExceptions:\n(1) The solar setback may be reduced to zero (0) under certain conditions (see section 5.2.8).\n(2) Minimum solar setback requirements shall not apply to any structure, or part thereof, when the proposed height of the structure is ninety (90) percent, or less, of the maximum allowed\nsetback height. In such cases, the lesser interior setback may be used instead.\n(j)\nMaximum Impervious Surface Ratio. Column (J) establishes the maximum ratio of impervious surface on a lot. The maximum amount of impervious surface area is divided by multiplying the gross\nland area of the lot by the ratio established in Column (K) and as described below:\n(1) Single-family and two-family residential development: (.50)\n(2) Multifamily developments, fraternities and sororities, non-residential, or mixed-use development: (.70).\nException:\n(3) Impervious surface restrictions shall not apply to town center zoning districts.\n(k) Maximum Floor Area Ratio. Maximum floor area allowed shall be the number of square feet derived by multiplying gross land area by the applicable floor area ratio (FAR) as shown in Table 3.8.1.\nExceptions:\n(1) A maximum floor area ratio shall not apply to:\nA. Dwelling Units, Single-Family\nB. Dwelling Units, Single-Family with Accessory Apartment\nC. Dwelling Units, Single-Family with Cottage\nD. Public Cultural Facilities\n(2) For two-family dwellings on a single zoning lot, the floor area shall be .40 in all zones and overlay zones, except where the overlay zone establishes a more restrictive floor area ratio for\nduplexes.\n(3)\nFor public elementary and secondary schools, the maximum floor area ratio shall be 0.174 unless a higher floor area ratio is established in Column (L).\n43 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 44\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(4) Where a lot is partially within the resource conservation district, the maximum allowable floor area of the portion of the lot outside of the resource conservation district shall be calculated\nthe sum of:\nas\nA. The product of, and\n(i) The floor area ratio of the portion of the zoning lot outside the resource conservation district, and\n(ii) The area, in square feet, of the portion of the zoning lot outside the resource conservation district.\nB. The product of\n(i) The floor area ratio applicable to a permitted use in the resource conservation district, and\n(ii) The area, in square feet, of the portion of the zoning lot within the resource conservation district.\n( Ord.

The development agreement may\ninclude other defined performance standards to be met by the applicant and/or its successors in interest.\n(f) Permitted within the boundary of a development agreement.\n(1) Permitted uses within a development agreement. The predominant uses are to be public or private development for college/university, research activity, civic, hospital, clinics, cultural, and/or\nrelated or support functions with integrated supporting housing, general business, convenience business, office-type business, recreation, utility, and/or open space uses. Uses that may be\napproved within a development agreement in this district include all uses allowed within the OI-4 district as permitted uses, special uses, or accessory uses. The maximum floor area, density\nof development, building heights and general locations, other attributes of development intensity, and design guidelines for the development permitted shall be as provided in a town council-\napproved development agreement. The development agreement may provide that specified uses shall require a town council-approved special use permit.\nA large central cogeneration/utility plant may only be approved within a development agreement in this district upon approval of a special use permit by the town council. For the purposes of\nthis section, a large central cogeneration/utility plant includes any facility designed to produce steam, heat, electric power, chilled water, or cooling for other buildings and that is designed to\nor has the capacity to serve more than two million square feet of building space. The process established by section 4.5.3 of this appendix shall be followed in the consideration of this special\nuse permit and sections 4.5.4 and 4.5.5 of this appendix shall apply to modification, expiration, and revocation of this special use permit. The town council shall not approve that permit unless\neach of the following findings is made:\n1. That the use is located, designed, and proposed to be operated so as to maintain or promote the public health, safety, and general welfare;\n2. That the use is located, designed, and proposed to be operated so as to maintain or enhance the value of contiguous property, or that the use is a public necessity;\n3. That the use conforms with the general plans for the physical development of the town as embodied in the comprehensive plan; and\n4. That the use conforms with the applicable terms of the development agreement.\n(g) Permitted and special uses outside a boundary area of a development agreement.\n(1) Permitted uses outside the boundary area of a development agreement. Uses that may be approved as permitted uses within the zoning district but outside the boundary area or terms of a\ntown council-approved development agreement are:\nCommunity gardens;\nLocal farmers markets;\nRecreational facility, non-profit;\nTrails, greenways, and recreational land;\nPublic use facilities;\nSolar energy collection arrays;\nRadio, television, or wireless transmitting and/or receiving facilities, provided the total height of an antenna-supporting structure is not more than one hundred twenty (120) feet and there is\na\nfive hundred-foot or more setback from the property line;\nWind turbines designed to produce 100kW or less, provided the total height is not more than one hundred twenty (120) feet, there is a minimum ground clearance of thirty (30) feet from\nrotors, and there is a five hundred-foot or more setback from the property line. Wind turbines designed to produce 100kW or less may also be located on rooftops.\nThese permitted uses shall require a zoning compliance permit pursuant to section 4.9 of this appendix and, as is provided for OI-3 and OI-4 districts in Table 3.7-1 (Use Matrix), shall not require a\nspecial use permit based on the floor area of the proposed development.\n(2) Uses subject to a special use permit outside the boundary area of a development agreement. Uses that may be approved as special uses within this zoning district outside the boundary or\nterms of a town council-approved development agreement (including proposed uses for property formerly covered by a development agreement that has expired or been terminated) are\nlimited to those uses allowed within the OI-4 district as permitted uses, special uses, or accessory uses as set forth in Table 3.7-1 (Use Matrix). These special uses shall be subject to the\ndimensional requirements for the OI-4 district as set forth in Table 3-8.1 (Dimensional Matrix) and the perimeter transition area requirements applicable in the OI-4 district.\n(h) Existing conditions within a U-1 zoning district. Existing uses, structures, and conditions within a U-1 zoning district as of the effective day property is placed in this district may be continued as\nspecified by this section. All existing uses of land that do not involve the use of a building can be continued as they exist as of the effective date the property is zoned U-1 and can be changed to\nany use permitted by subsection 3.5.5(f)(1). Any existing building within the U-1 district can be used for the use in effect as of the effective date property is zoned U-1 and can be changed to any\nuse permitted pursuant to a development agreement as authorized by subsection 3.5.5(f)(1). Any existing building being used for a use permitted by this appendix or by an applicable\ndevelopment agreement may be expanded to the extent that the town manager finds that the expansion is exempt from the transportation impact analysis requirements of subsection 5.8(g) of\nthis appendix. Any new construction, development, or site improvements associated with continuation of existing conditions shall be consistent with the terms of all applicable development\nagreements in effect within the district.\n(i) Development standards. Development in the U-1 zoning district shall be designed to provide a mix of uses within all major phases of the development that are integrated, interrelated and linked\nby pedestrian ways, bikeways, and/or other transportation systems. Development agreements shall, to the extent practical and consistent with applicable laws and regulations, include measures\nto encourage reduction of automobile use and promote alternative modes of transportation; to provide sustainable building design and land uses; to mitigate adverse environmental impacts; to\npromote conservation of non-renewable energy resources; to exceed minimally accepted practices; and to achieve visual continuity in the siting and scale of buildings.\nSpecifically, a development agreement in this district shall at a minimum address the following:\n1. Plan consistency. The proposed development shall be generally consistent with the long range development plan for the district submitted by the owner. The development shall be generally\nconsistent with the adopted comprehensive plan for the town.\n15 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 16\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n2. Transportation. Proposed development shall be accompanied by reasonable measures to mitigate transportation impacts that are caused by the development. Proposed development shall\naddress parking, transit, traffic, road, greenway, bikeway, and pedestrian access.\n3.\nFiscal impact. Proposed development shall be accompanied by reasonable measures to mitigate any adverse fiscal impacts for the town; provided that, pursuant to NCGS 160D-1001 (b), the\ntown may not impose any tax or fee not authorized by otherwise applicable law.\n4. Housing. Proposed development shall be accompanied at appropriate times by on-site housing to mitigate the impacts that are caused by the development. Such housing shall address\nstudent and/or workforce housing needs. A range of housing availability and price levels shall be shall be provided within each major phase and area of the proposed development.\n5. Noise and lighting. Noise and lighting levels from proposed development shall not exceed those allowed by town ordinances or the provisions of the development agreement, whichever are\nmore stringent.\n6. Environment. Proposed development shall seek to minimize impacts on natural site features and shall be accompanied by reasonable measures to mitigate those impacts. Proposed\ndevelopment shall address preservation of open land and natural areas, management of stormwater quality and quantity, energy generation and use, preservation of solar access, solar\norientation of buildings, air quality, sustainable water and wastewater management, protection of stream buffers, soil erosion and sedimentation control, landscape and vegetation protection.\n7. Public utilities and services. Proposed development shall assure that there are adequate public utilities and services and shall be accompanied by reasonable measures to assure the\navailability of such services concurrent with the creation of the need for the services. There shall be a general demonstration that police, fire, emergency, water, sewer, school, recreation, and\nother necessary utilities and public services will be available to accommodate the proposed development.\nThe development agreement shall provide for regular monitoring, reporting, and evaluation of the effectiveness of the development standards.\n(j) Minor and major modifications to development agreements. A development agreement may be modified or canceled by mutual consent of the parties to the agreement or by their successors in\ninterest.\nEither party may propose a major or minor modification to any town council-approved development agreement. Upon receipt of a proposed modification, the town manager shall consider the following\ncriteria in making the determination as to whether a proposed adjustment is a major or a minor modification to a development agreement:\n1. A substantial change in the boundaries of the development agreement shall constitute a major modification. Any single proposed increase or decrease in the area of land subject to the\ndevelopment agreement approved by the town council of more than five (5) percent shall be considered substantial. A cumulative increase of fifteen (15) percent or more in the land area\nsubject to the development agreement shall be considered substantial.\n2.\nA substantial change in the floor area or number of parking spaces shall constitute a major modification. Any single proposed increase or decrease in new floor area or number of parking\nspaces of more than a five (5) percent in a development agreement approved by the town council shall be considered a major modification. A cumulative increase of fifteen (15) percent or\nmore in the floor area or number of parking spaces subject to the development agreement shall be considered a major modification. Provided, under no circumstances shall a change in floor\narea of less than one thousand (1,000) square feet or fewer than ten (10) parking spaces be deemed either a major amendment or minor modification and such changes shall be reported by\nthe applicant to the town manager.\n3. Changes that would substantially affect pedestrian, bicycle, or vehicular access or circulation beyond the boundaries of the development agreement shall constitute a major modification.\n4.\nSubstantial change in the amount or location of open space within the boundaries of a development agreement shall constitute a major modification. Any single change that increases or\ndecreases the amount of open space by more than five (5) percent shall be considered a major modification. A cumulative increase or decrease in the amount of open space by fifteen (15)\npercent or more or a substantial change in the location of designated open space shall be considered a major modification.\nNotwithstanding the above, some proposed changes to a town-council approved development agreement that do not meet the threshold to constitute a major modification may in the judgment of the\ntown manager, because of size, perimeter location or transportation impacts, merit public review. In the event the manager makes such a determination he may submit the proposed minor modification at\na town council meeting to allow an opportunity for council review and citizen comment. Unless the other party to the development agreement agrees otherwise, such a review shall not extend the time\nperiod allowed for a decision by the manager on the minor modification or convert the change from a minor modification into a major modification.\nAll proposed adjustments to a town council-approved development agreement shall be publicly posted in such a manner that citizens of Chapel Hill will have the opportunity to express any concerns to\nthe town council and/or the town manager. The town manager shall determine whether a proposed adjustment to a town council-approved development agreement is a major or a minor modification\nwithin fifteen (15) working days of receipt of a proposed adjustment and shall promptly notify the town council and applicant of that determination. If the proposed action is determined to be a major\nmodification, the town manager shall require the filing of an application for approval of the amendment, following procedures outlined in subsection 3.5.5(k) of this appendix.\nIn the event state or federal law is changed after a development agreement has been entered into and the change prevents or precludes compliance with one or more provisions of the development\nagreement, the town council may modify the affected provisions, upon a finding that the change in state or federal law has a fundamental effect on the development agreement. In so doing, the procedures\nset forth for original approval of the development agreement shall be followed.\nExcept for grounds specified in NCGS 160D-108(c) or 160D-108.1(f), the town shall not apply subsequently adopted ordinances or development policies to the development that is subject to the approved\ndevelopment agreement.\n(k) Procedure for review of development agreements, amendments, and modifications.\n(1) Application submittal requirements. Applications for approval of a development agreement, a major modification to a previously approved development agreement, and a minor modification\nto a previously approved development agreement within a U-1 zoning district shall be submitted to the town manager. The town manager shall prescribe the form(s) of applications as well as\nany other material as the town manager may reasonably require to determine compliance with this section.\n(2) Process for review.\nA. Informal consultation. Prior to submission of a proposed development agreement or a major modification to a previously approved development agreement within this district, the\napplicant shall consult with the town manager and town council regarding the proposed development. The applicant is encouraged to engage in active discussion and collaboration with\nthe town staff, town council, town advisory boards, neighbors, and the community in the preparation of a proposed development agreement or amendment and plans for development.\nB.\nDraft agreement. A draft development agreement and long-range development plan for the activity to be addressed in the development agreement shall be submitted to the town\nmanager prior to the submission of a formal development agreement. The manager and applicant shall present the draft agreement to the planning commission, such other advisory\nboards as deemed appropriate by the town council, and the town council for review and comment. The manager and applicant shall also present the draft agreement in informal public\ninformation sessions for public review and comment. A formal application for approval of a development agreement may be submitted upon completion of the review, comment, and\nrevision of the draft development agreement.\nC. Initial development agreement. Applications for approval of an initial development agreement within this zone shall be processed concurrently with the petition for rezoning to the U-1\ndistrict. The legislative hearing on the initial development agreement shall be noticed and held concurrently with the hearing on the proposed rezoning. Notice of the legislative hearing\nbefore the town council on the proposed development agreement shall follow the same notice requirements as are applicable for hearings on proposed zoning atlas amendments. The\npublic notice shall include the location of the property covered by the proposed development agreement, the development uses proposed on the property, and the place a copy of the\nproposed development agreement may be obtained or reviewed. The town council's legislative hearing on the proposed development agreement shall be open to the public and all\ninterested persons shall be given the opportunity to present comments. The town council shall take action on an application for an initial development agreement within this zone\nconcurrently with action on the application for rezoning to this district. The initial development agreement may be applicable to all or part of the land within the district.\nD.\n16 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 17\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nSubsequent development agreements and major modifications. Subsequent new development agreements within this zoning district and major modifications of a previously approved development\nagreement shall be considered using the following process:\n1. Upon receipt of an application for approval, the town manager shall review the proposal for completeness. The town manager shall determine within fifteen (15) working days whether\nthe application is complete and shall promptly notify the town council and applicant of that determination. If the application is determined to be incomplete, a notice of the deficiencies\nin the mandatory items to be included in a proposed agreement or major amendment shall be provided to the applicant with the notice of the town manager's determination. If the\napplication is determined to be complete, the town manager shall notify the applicant of that determination and shall prepare a report on the proposed agreement or major\nmodification.\n2. The town manager shall submit a complete proposed agreement or major modification and the town manager's report to the planning commission for review and comment. The\nplanning commission shall review the application and the town manager's report and shall submit to the town council a written recommendation regarding the proposed agreement or\namendment. The planning commission shall submit its recommendation within thirty-five (35) calendar days of the meeting at which the town manager's report is submitted to it or\nwithin such further time consented to in writing by the applicant or by town council resolution. If the planning commission fails to prepare its recommendation to the town council\nwithin this time limit, or extensions thereof, the town council may consider the proposed agreement without a comment or recommendation from the planning commission.\n3.\nThe town council shall hold a legislative hearing on a proposed subsequent development agreement or major modification to a previously approved development agreement. Notice of\nthe date, time, and place of the legislative hearing before the town council shall follow the same published, mailed, and posted notice requirements as are applicable for hearings on\nproposed zoning atlas amendments. The public notice shall include the location of the property covered by the proposed development agreement, the development uses proposed on\nthe property, and the place a copy of the proposed development agreement may be obtained or reviewed. The town council's legislative hearing on the proposed agreement or major\nmodification shall be open to the public and all interested persons shall be given the opportunity to present comments.\n4.\nThe town council shall issue a decision on a proposed subsequent development agreement or major modification to a previously approved development agreement within one\nhundred twenty (120) calendar days of the date of the town manager's determination that a complete application was submitted or such further time as mutually agreed to by the\napplicant and the town.\nE.\nMinor modifications to a previously approved development agreement may be approved by the town manager as long as such changes continue to be in substantial compliance with the\napproving action of the town council and all other applicable requirements and result in a configuration of buildings/development that is generally consistent with the town council-\napproved development agreement. The town manager shall not have the authority to approve changes that constitute a major modification of a town council-development agreement,\nwhich includes change in uses permitted or the density of overall development permitted unless permitted to make such modifications by the terms of the town-council-approved\ndevelopment agreement.\nF. The time periods referenced in this subsection shall not run during any period in which the applications for subsequent development agreements or major modification to a previously\napproved development agreement have been returned to the applicant for substantial modification or analysis. The time periods set forth in this subsection may also be modified by\nmutual consent of the applicant and the town council.\n(I) Actions after the decision on a development agreement.\n(1) Recording approval. If the application for approval of a development agreement or major modification is approved or approved with conditions, the town manager shall execute the\ndevelopment agreement or modification in accord with the action of the town council. The applicant shall then execute the development agreement or modification and record the\ndevelopment agreement or modification in the office of the applicable county register of deeds within fourteen (14) days after the town enters into the development agreement. The burdens\nof the development agreement are binding upon, and the benefits of the agreement shall inure to, all successors in interest to the parties to the agreement.\n(2)\nIndividual site development permits. After an executed development agreement is recorded, the town manager may then accept applications for individual site development permits for\nspecific buildings that the applicant proposes to build within the physical boundaries covered by the agreement. No construction work on any such building identified in the agreement may\nbegin until a site development permit has been issued. The town manager shall prescribe the form(s) of applications as well as any other material the town manager may reasonably require to\ndetermine compliance with the agreement. The town manager shall approve or deny of the individual site development permit application within fifteen (15) working days of the manager's\ndetermination that the individual site development plan application is complete. The town manager shall approve the application upon finding it is substantially consistent with and does not\nviolate any term of the agreement and shall deny approval upon finding the application is not substantially consistent with or violates a term of the agreement. If the application is denied, the\ntown manager shall specify the grounds for finding that it is inconsistent or in violation and refer the applicant to the special use permit process described in section 4.5 of this appendix.\nAlternatively, the applicant may modify the site development permit application or apply for a major modification to the development agreement. Provided, under no circumstances shall a\nchange in floor area of less than one thousand (1,000) square feet or fewer than ten (10) parking spaces be deemed either a minor modification or major modification of the development\nagreement nor require approval or modification of an individual site development permit; such changes shall be reported by the applicant to the town manager.\n(3)\nExpiration, abandonment, revocation of development agreement. The term of any development agreement shall be set forth in the agreement. The development agreement shall also contain\nspecific provisions relative to default or termination of the agreement.\n(4) Periodic review and amendment of the development agreement. The town manager shall at least every twelve (12) months conduct a review of the development agreement at which time the\napplicant or its successors in interest must demonstrate good faith compliance with the terms of the development agreement. The town manager shall promptly report the results of this\nreview to the town council. If, as a result of this periodic review, the town council finds and determines that the applicant or its successors in interest has committed a material breach of the\nterms or conditions of the agreement, the town manager shall serve notice in writing, within a reasonable time not to exceed thirty (30) working days after the periodic review, upon the\napplicant or its successors in interest setting forth with reasonable particularity the nature of the breach and the evidence supporting the finding and determination, and providing the\napplicant or their successors in interest a reasonable time in which to cure the material breach. If the applicant or its successors in interest fail to cure the material breach within the time\ngiven, then the town council unilaterally may terminate or modify the development agreement pursuant to NCGS 160D-1008; provided, the notice of termination or modification may be\nappealed to the board of adjustment in the manner provided by NCGS 160D-405. Thereafter the applicant or its successors in interest may pursue any other rights and remedies available at\nlaw or in equity. If the town council elects to unilaterally modify the agreement, the applicant or its successors in interest may elect for the development agreement to be terminated rather\nthan accede to the development agreement with the modifications unilaterally made by the town council.\n( Ord. No. 2021-05-19/O-1, \u00a7\u00a7 14-21)\n3.5.6 Development Agreement-1 District.\n(a)\nPurpose and intent. The purpose and intent of the Development Agreement-1 district (DA-1) is to establish procedural and substantive standards for the town council's review and approval of\ndevelopment where the predominant uses are to be private development that includes uses such as housing, general business, convenience business, office-type business, recreation, utility, and/\nor open space uses.\nThe objective of the DA-1 district is to allow for orderly and sustainable growth and major new development while mitigating impacts to nearby neighborhoods, the community, and the environment. A\nkey feature of this district is the concurrent review of a rezoning application and an initial proposed development agreement within such district that allows the property owner, immediate neighbors, and\ncommunity to understand the type and intensity of development being proposed, the timing of that development, the potential impacts of the development, the mitigation measures that will be\nimplemented to address those impacts, and the commitments of both the developer and the Town regarding public facilities and services needed to support the proposed development. A development\nagreement that is approved by ordinance as a legislative decision of the town council pursuant to NCGS 160D-1003 is an integral component of the DA-1 zoning district.\n(b) Overview of development review procedures. Procedures in this zoning district are designed to facilitate:\n1.

3-5-4\nPurpose statement: The transit oriented development district encourages a mixture of residential, commercial, and employment opportunities within identified light rail station or other high\ncapacity transit areas. The district allows for a more intense and efficient use of land at increased densities for the mutual reinforcement of public investments and private development. Uses and\ndevelopment are regulated to create a more intense built-up environment, oriented to pedestrians and bicycles, to provide a density and intensity that is transit supportive. The development\nstandards of the zone also are designed to encourage a safe and pleasant pedestrian and bicycle environment near transit stations by encouraging an intensive area of shops and activities, by\nencouraging amenities such as benches, kiosks, and outdoor cafes, and by limiting conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians and bicycles. It is the intent of this section that a TOD district be\nrestricted to areas within one-half of a mile of a transit station, which area is equivalent to a typical 10-minute walking distance.\nBecause most transit users will walk only one-quarter to one-half of a mile to a transit facility, transit influence areas require high densities on small areas of land. The town therefore finds and\ndetermines that uses inconsistent with transit will undermine the most efficient use of limited land areas within a TOD, and may render the transit system unworkable. Accordingly, the uses\npermitted within the core (TOD-C) and perimeter (TOD-P) zoning districts are those which are dependent upon, or which may generate, a relatively high level of transit usage. Uses which would\ninterfere with transit usage and which generate few transit trips are not permitted.\n(a) Designation procedures.\nA transit oriented development may be designated pursuant to the procedures established in section 4.4 of this appendix.\n(b) Designation criteria.\nTo be designated a transit oriented development district, the area must meet the following criteria:\n(1) At least fifty (50) percent of the territory within a TOD must lie within one-quarter (1/4) of a mile of a transit station or major bus boarding location, and shall be classified as transit oriented\ndevelopment-core (\"TOD-C\").\n(2) Areas between one-quarter (1/4) of a mile and one-half (1/2) of a mile from a transit station or a major bus boarding location may be classified as transit oriented development-perimeter (\"TOD-\nP\"). No land area shall be zoned \"TOD-P\" unless it adjoins an area zoned \"TOD-C.\"\nPRIMARY\nPRIMARY\nVEHICULAR\nPEDESTRIAN\nSTREET\nSTREET\nCOMMERCIAL\nMIXED USE BLDG\nMIXED\nUSE\nPARKING\nPARK\nTRANSIT\nGARAGE\nSTOP\nMIXED\nUSE\nCOMMERCIAL\nTRANSIT STOP WITHIN\nEXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE\n(c) Uses and dimensional standards.\nThe TOD district shall establish minimum levels of density and intensity required to support transit ridership, and prohibit lower levels of density which will not support transit ridership and will\n13 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 14\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\ncreate unacceptable levels of vehicular congestion.\nThe TOD district shall establish permitted, special and prohibited uses. Land uses which are not supportive of public transportation in that they tend to not generate transit ridership, and which\nrequire access primarily by automobile, shall be prohibited.\n(d) Development standards.\nThe ordinance designating the TOD shall include standards governing landscaping, lot layout, buffers, setbacks, parks and open space, parking, transportation, and urban design. The ordinance\nshall establish maximum setbacks and maximum parking requirements which support transit usage.\nTransit related development\nTeam\nExample: Buildings within a TOD district feature small front setbacks in order to provide efficient pedestrian and bicycle movement (top graphic). Buildings in conventional commercial strips do not\nsupport transit usage because pedestrians are separated from buildings by parking lots and wide setbacks (bottom graphic).\n(Source: USDOT, A Guide to Land Use and Public Transportation (Dec. 1989))\n3.5.5. University-1 District\n(a) Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of the University-1 district (U-1) is to establish procedural and substantive standards for the town council's review and approval of development on\nlarge tracts of land where the predominant uses aretobepublic orprivate developmentforcollege/university,researchactivity,civic,hospital, clinics, cultural, and/or related or support functions\nwith integrated supporting housing, general business, convenience business, office-type business, recreation, utility, and/or open space uses.\nThe objective of the U-1 district is to allow for orderly and sustainable growth and major new development while mitigating impacts to nearby neighborhoods, the community, and the environment. A key\nfeature of this district is the concurrent review of a rezoning application and an initial proposed development agreement within such district that allows the property owner, immediate neighbors, and\ncommunity to understand the type and intensity of development being proposed, the timing of that development, the potential impacts of the development, the mitigation measures that will be\nimplemented to address those impacts, and the commitments of both the developer and the town regarding public facilities and services needed to support the proposed development. A development\nagreement that is approved by ordinance as a legislative decision of the town council pursuant to G.S. 160D-1003 is an integral component of the U-1 zoning district.\n(b) Overview of development review procedures. Procedures in this zoning district are designed to facilitate:\n1. Articulation of a long-term development plan that provides a context for more detailed intermediate and short term plans and projects;\n2. Articulation of detailed plans that involve multiple buildings over an extended time period on a defined portion of the zoning district that is subject to an individual development agreement;\n3. Identification of the infrastructure needs and impacts related to the development specified in a development agreement;\n4.\nProvision of measures to mitigate the negative impacts of development in the development agreement and to promote sustainability of approved development, with the mitigation\nimplemented in a manner appropriate with the pace of development; and\n5. Provision of predictability and certainty as to the type, intensity, and design of development set out in a town council-approved development agreement.\nApplicants proposing that property be zoned U-1 must submit a long-range development plan and supporting analysis at the time of petition for rezoning to this district. Upon approval by the town\ncouncil of a development agreement in this district, site development permits for individual buildings are to be issued by the town manager, following a determination by the town manager that such\nindividual building projects do not violate the town council-approved development agreement.\nFor development proposed within the U-1 zoning district that is not included in a town council-approved development agreement, but is a minor modification according to the provisions of this section,\nthe town manager may approve a change to the development agreement and issue a site development permit.\nExcept as specifically authorized as a permitted use under subsection 3.5.5(g)(1), development proposed within this zoning district that is not included in a town council-approved development\nagreement and/or that cannot be considered a minor modification to a development agreement shall be considered to be a special use and subject to the special use permit standards and procedural\nrequirements of section 4.5 of this appendix. In the alternative, the applicant may apply to the town council for an amendment to the development agreement.\nThe terms used within this section have the same meaning and scope as provided by this appendix and state law. Provided, however, that to the extent a council-approved and owner-executed\ndevelopment agreement define a term to have a different meaning or scope, that meaning and scope shall apply as specified in the development agreement.\n(c) Minimum requirements.\nAn\napplication for rezoning to a U-1 district may only be initiated by the owner of the property to be rezoned or a duly authorized agent of the owner.\nAn application for rezoning to a U-1 district must, in addition to all other requirements of this ordinance, include:\n1. A long-range plan for the development of the entire area proposed to be included in the district.\n2. An ecological assessment of the entire area proposed to be included in the district.\n3. A proposed development agreement for a discrete portion of the land to be placed in the district.\nThe town manager may specify forms and reasonable requirements related to these mandated materials to be submitted with a rezoning petition.\n(d) Long-range development plan. When an application for a rezoning to this district is submitted, the developer shall submit a long-range development plan to provide an opportunity for the town\ncouncil, town manager and citizens to see the developer's current plans at a conceptual level for long-term development of all property within the proposed zoning district. This long-range plan is\nnecessary to provide a context for individual development agreements for development within the district. The long-range plan shall represent a good faith depiction of the developer's intentions\nrelative to overall development of the site. It is not, however, submitted for town approval and shall not be deemed to create a binding commitment on behalf of the developer or the town.\nThe long-range development plan shall be submitted to the town manager prior to or concurrently with the submission of an application to rezone property into this district. An updated long-range\ndevelopment plan shall also be submitted with all applications for approval of a development agreement within the district or for approval of major modifications of a development agreement within the\ndistrict.\n(e) Development agreement. A proposed development agreement in this district must include all provisions mandated by state law and shall at a minimum include:\n1. A legal description of the property subject to the agreement and the names of its legal and equitable property owners.\n2. The duration of the agreement.\n14 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 15\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n3.\nThe development uses permitted on the property, including population densities and building types, intensities, placement on the site, and design.\n4. A description of public facilities that will service the development, including who provides the facilities, the date any new public facilities, if needed, will be constructed, and a schedule or\ntriggering points to assure public facilities are available concurrent with the impacts of the development.\n5.\nA description, where appropriate, of any reservation or dedication of land for public purposes and any provisions to protect environmentally sensitive property.\n6. A description of all local development permits approved or needed to be approved for the development of the property together with a statement indicating that the failure of the agreement\nto address a particular permit, condition, term, or restriction does not relieve the developer of the necessity of complying with the law governing their permitting requirements, conditions,\nterms, or restrictions.\n7. A description of any conditions, terms, restrictions, or other requirements determined to be necessary by the town council for the public health, safety, or welfare.\n8. A description, where appropriate, of any provisions for the preservation and restoration of historic structures.\n9. A development schedule, including commencement dates and interim completion dates at no greater than five-year intervals, provided, however, the failure to meet a commencement or\ncompletion date shall not, in and of itself, constitute a material breach of the development agreement pursuant to NCGS 160D-1008 but must be judged based upon the totality of the\ncircumstances.\nThe development agreement may provide that the entire proposed development or any phase of it be commenced or completed within a specified period of time. The development agreement may\ninclude other defined performance standards to be met by the applicant and/or its successors in interest.\n(f) Permitted within the boundary of a development agreement.\n(1) Permitted uses within a development agreement. The predominant uses are to be public or private development for college/university, research activity, civic, hospital, clinics, cultural, and/or\nrelated or support functions with integrated supporting housing, general business, convenience business, office-type business, recreation, utility, and/or open space uses. Uses that may be\napproved within a development agreement in this district include all uses allowed within the OI-4 district as permitted uses, special uses, or accessory uses. The maximum floor area, density\nof development, building heights and general locations, other attributes of development intensity, and design guidelines for the development permitted shall be as provided in a town council-\napproved development agreement. The development agreement may provide that specified uses shall require a town council-approved special use permit.\nA large central cogeneration/utility plant may only be approved within a development agreement in this district upon approval of a special use permit by the town council. For the purposes of\nthis section, a large central cogeneration/utility plant includes any facility designed to produce steam, heat, electric power, chilled water, or cooling for other buildings and that is designed to\nor has the capacity to serve more than two million square feet of building space. The process established by section 4.5.3 of this appendix shall be followed in the consideration of this special\nuse permit and sections 4.5.4 and 4.5.5 of this appendix shall apply to modification, expiration, and revocation of this special use permit. The town council shall not approve that permit unless\neach of the following findings is made:\n1. That the use is located, designed, and proposed to be operated so as to maintain or promote the public health, safety, and general welfare;\n2. That the use is located, designed, and proposed to be operated so as to maintain or enhance the value of contiguous property, or that the use is a public necessity;\n3. That the use conforms with the general plans for the physical development of the town as embodied in the comprehensive plan; and\n4. That the use conforms with the applicable terms of the development agreement.\n(g) Permitted and special uses outside a boundary area of a development agreement.\n(1) Permitted uses outside the boundary area of a development agreement. Uses that may be approved as permitted uses within the zoning district but outside the boundary area or terms of a\ntown council-approved development agreement are:\nCommunity gardens;\nLocal farmers markets;\nRecreational facility, non-profit;\nTrails, greenways, and recreational land;\nPublic use facilities;\nSolar energy collection arrays;\nRadio, television, or wireless transmitting and/or receiving facilities, provided the total height of an antenna-supporting structure is not more than one hundred twenty (120) feet and there is\na\nfive hundred-foot or more setback from the property line;\nWind turbines designed to produce 100kW or less, provided the total height is not more than one hundred twenty (120) feet, there is a minimum ground clearance of thirty (30) feet from\nrotors, and there is a five hundred-foot or more setback from the property line. Wind turbines designed to produce 100kW or less may also be located on rooftops.\nThese permitted uses shall require a zoning compliance permit pursuant to section 4.9 of this appendix and, as is provided for OI-3 and OI-4 districts in Table 3.7-1 (Use Matrix), shall not require a\nspecial use permit based on the floor area of the proposed development.\n(2) Uses subject to a special use permit outside the boundary area of a development agreement. Uses that may be approved as special uses within this zoning district outside the boundary or\nterms of a town council-approved development agreement (including proposed uses for property formerly covered by a development agreement that has expired or been terminated) are\nlimited to those uses allowed within the OI-4 district as permitted uses, special uses, or accessory uses as set forth in Table 3.7-1 (Use Matrix). These special uses shall be subject to the\ndimensional requirements for the OI-4 district as set forth in Table 3-8.1 (Dimensional Matrix) and the perimeter transition area requirements applicable in the OI-4 district.\n(h) Existing conditions within a U-1 zoning district. Existing uses, structures, and conditions within a U-1 zoning district as of the effective day property is placed in this district may be continued as\nspecified by this section. All existing uses of land that do not involve the use of a building can be continued as they exist as of the effective date the property is zoned U-1 and can be changed to\nany use permitted by subsection 3.5.5(f)(1). Any existing building within the U-1 district can be used for the use in effect as of the effective date property is zoned U-1 and can be changed to any\nuse permitted pursuant to a development agreement as authorized by subsection 3.5.5(f)(1). Any existing building being used for a use permitted by this appendix or by an applicable\ndevelopment agreement may be expanded to the extent that the town manager finds that the expansion is exempt from the transportation impact analysis requirements of subsection 5.8(g) of\nthis appendix. Any new construction, development, or site improvements associated with continuation of existing conditions shall be consistent with the terms of all applicable development\nagreements in effect within the district.\n(i) Development standards. Development in the U-1 zoning district shall be designed to provide a mix of uses within all major phases of the development that are integrated, interrelated and linked\nby pedestrian ways, bikeways, and/or other transportation systems. Development agreements shall, to the extent practical and consistent with applicable laws and regulations, include measures\nto encourage reduction of automobile use and promote alternative modes of transportation; to provide sustainable building design and land uses; to mitigate adverse environmental impacts; to\npromote conservation of non-renewable energy resources; to exceed minimally accepted practices; and to achieve visual continuity in the siting and scale of buildings.\nSpecifically, a development agreement in this district shall at a minimum address the following:\n1. Plan consistency. The proposed development shall be generally consistent with the long range development plan for the district submitted by the owner. The development shall be generally\nconsistent with the adopted comprehensive plan for the town.\n15 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n", "page_number": 13, "page_range": [13, 14, 15], "highlight": ["The maximum

Provided, however, that to the extent a council-approved and owner-executed\ndevelopment agreement define a term to have a different meaning or scope, that meaning and scope shall apply as specified in the development agreement.\n(c) Minimum requirements.\nAn\napplication for rezoning to a U-1 district may only be initiated by the owner of the property to be rezoned or a duly authorized agent of the owner.\nAn application for rezoning to a U-1 district must, in addition to all other requirements of this ordinance, include:\n1. A long-range plan for the development of the entire area proposed to be included in the district.\n2. An ecological assessment of the entire area proposed to be included in the district.\n3. A proposed development agreement for a discrete portion of the land to be placed in the district.\nThe town manager may specify forms and reasonable requirements related to these mandated materials to be submitted with a rezoning petition.\n(d) Long-range development plan. When an application for a rezoning to this district is submitted, the developer shall submit a long-range development plan to provide an opportunity for the town\ncouncil, town manager and citizens to see the developer's current plans at a conceptual level for long-term development of all property within the proposed zoning district. This long-range plan is\nnecessary to provide a context for individual development agreements for development within the district. The long-range plan shall represent a good faith depiction of the developer's intentions\nrelative to overall development of the site. It is not, however, submitted for town approval and shall not be deemed to create a binding commitment on behalf of the developer or the town.\nThe long-range development plan shall be submitted to the town manager prior to or concurrently with the submission of an application to rezone property into this district. An updated long-range\ndevelopment plan shall also be submitted with all applications for approval of a development agreement within the district or for approval of major modifications of a development agreement within the\ndistrict.\n(e) Development agreement. A proposed development agreement in this district must include all provisions mandated by state law and shall at a minimum include:\n1.

A description of all local development permits approved or needed to be approved for the development of the property together with a statement indicating that the failure of the agreement\nto address a particular permit, condition, term, or restriction does not relieve the developer of the necessity of complying with the law governing their permitting requirements, conditions,\nterms, or restrictions.\n7. A description of any conditions, terms, restrictions, or other requirements determined to be necessary by the town council for the public health, safety, or welfare.\n8. A description, where appropriate, of any provisions for the preservation and restoration of historic structures.\n9. A development schedule, including commencement dates and interim completion dates at no greater than five-year intervals, provided, however, the failure to meet a commencement or\ncompletion date shall not, in and of itself, constitute a material breach of the development agreement pursuant to NCGS 160D-1008 but must be judged based upon the totality of the\ncircumstances.\nThe development agreement may provide that the entire proposed development or any phase of it be commenced or completed within a specified period of time. The development agreement may\ninclude other defined performance standards to be met by the applicant and/or its successors in interest.\n(f) Permitted within the boundary of a development agreement.\n(1) Permitted uses within a development agreement.

The maximum floor area, density\nof development, building heights and general locations, other attributes of development intensity, and design guidelines for the development permitted shall be as provided in a town council-\napproved development agreement. The development agreement may provide that specified uses shall require a town council-approved special use permit.\nA large central cogeneration/utility plant may only be approved within a development agreement in this district upon approval of a special use permit by the town council. For the purposes of\nthis section, a large central cogeneration/utility plant includes any facility designed to produce steam, heat, electric power, chilled water, or cooling for other buildings and that is designed to\nor has the capacity to serve more than two million square feet of building space. The process established by section 4.5.3 of this appendix shall be followed in the consideration of this special\nuse permit and sections 4.5.4 and 4.5.5 of this appendix shall apply to modification, expiration, and revocation of this special use permit. The town council shall not approve that permit unless\neach of the following findings is made:\n1. That the use is located, designed, and proposed to be operated so as to maintain or promote the public health, safety, and general welfare;\n2. That the use is located, designed, and proposed to be operated so as to maintain or enhance the value of contiguous property, or that the use is a public necessity;\n3. That the use conforms with the general plans for the physical development of the town as embodied in the comprehensive plan; and\n4. That the use conforms with the applicable terms of the development agreement.\n(g) Permitted and special uses outside a boundary area of a development agreement.\n(1) Permitted uses outside the boundary area of a development agreement. Uses that may be approved as permitted uses within the zoning district but outside the boundary area or terms of a\ntown council-approved development agreement are:\nCommunity gardens;\nLocal farmers markets;\nRecreational facility, non-profit;\nTrails, greenways, and recreational land;\nPublic use facilities;\nSolar energy collection arrays;\nRadio, television, or wireless transmitting and/or receiving facilities, provided the total height of an antenna-supporting structure is not more than one hundred twenty (120) feet and there is\na\nfive hundred-foot or more setback from the property line;\nWind turbines designed to produce 100kW or less, provided the total height is not more than one hundred twenty (120) feet, there is a minimum ground clearance of thirty (30) feet from\nrotors, and there is a five hundred-foot or more setback from the property line. Wind turbines designed to produce 100kW or less may also be located on rooftops.\nThese permitted uses shall require a zoning compliance permit pursuant to section 4.9 of this appendix and, as is provided for OI-3 and OI-4 districts in Table 3.7-1 (Use Matrix), shall not require a\nspecial use permit based on the floor area of the proposed development.\n(2) Uses subject to a special use permit outside the boundary area of a development agreement. Uses that may be approved as special uses within this zoning district outside the boundary or\nterms of a town council-approved development agreement (including proposed uses for property formerly covered by a development agreement that has expired or been terminated) are\nlimited to those uses allowed within the OI-4 district as permitted uses, special uses, or accessory uses as set forth in Table 3.7-1 (Use Matrix). These special uses shall be subject to the\ndimensional requirements for the OI-4 district as set forth in Table 3-8.1 (Dimensional Matrix) and the perimeter transition area requirements applicable in the OI-4 district.\n(h) Existing conditions within a U-1 zoning district. Existing uses, structures, and conditions within a U-1 zoning district as of the effective day property is placed in this district may be continued as\nspecified by this section. All existing uses of land that do not involve the use of a building can be continued as they exist as of the effective date the property is zoned U-1 and can be changed to\nany use permitted by subsection 3.5.5(f)(1). Any existing building within the U-1 district can be used for the use in effect as of the effective date property is zoned U-1 and can be changed to any\nuse permitted pursuant to a development agreement as authorized by subsection 3.5.5(f)(1). Any existing building being used for a use permitted by this appendix or by an applicable\ndevelopment agreement may be expanded to the extent that the town manager finds that the expansion is exempt from the transportation impact analysis requirements of subsection 5.8(g) of\nthis appendix. Any new construction, development, or site improvements associated with continuation of existing conditions shall be consistent with the terms of all applicable development\nagreements in effect within the district.\n(i) Development standards. Development in the U-1 zoning district shall be designed to provide a mix of uses within all major phases of the development that are integrated, interrelated and linked\nby pedestrian ways, bikeways, and/or other transportation systems. Development agreements shall, to the extent practical and consistent with applicable laws and regulations, include measures\nto encourage reduction of automobile use and promote alternative modes of transportation; to provide sustainable building design and land uses; to mitigate adverse environmental impacts; to\npromote conservation of non-renewable energy resources; to exceed minimally accepted practices; and to achieve visual continuity in the siting and scale of buildings.\nSpecifically, a development agreement in this district shall at a minimum address the following:\n1. Plan consistency. The proposed development shall be generally consistent with the long range development plan for the district submitted by the owner. The development shall be generally\nconsistent with the adopted comprehensive plan for the town.\n15 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 16\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n2. Transportation. Proposed development shall be accompanied by reasonable measures to mitigate transportation impacts that are caused by the development. Proposed development shall\naddress parking, transit, traffic, road, greenway, bikeway, and pedestrian access.\n3.\nFiscal impact. Proposed development shall be accompanied by reasonable measures to mitigate any adverse fiscal impacts for the town; provided that, pursuant to NCGS 160D-1001 (b), the\ntown may not impose any tax or fee not authorized by otherwise applicable law.\n4. Housing. Proposed development shall be accompanied at appropriate times by on-site housing to mitigate the impacts that are caused by the development. Such housing shall address\nstudent and/or workforce housing needs. A range of housing availability and price levels shall be shall be provided within each major phase and area of the proposed development.\n5. Noise and lighting. Noise and lighting levels from proposed development shall not exceed those allowed by town ordinances or the provisions of the development agreement, whichever are\nmore stringent.\n6. Environment. Proposed development shall seek to minimize impacts on natural site features and shall be accompanied by reasonable measures to mitigate those impacts. Proposed\ndevelopment shall address preservation of open land and natural areas, management of stormwater quality and quantity, energy generation and use, preservation of solar access, solar\norientation of buildings, air quality, sustainable water and wastewater management, protection of stream buffers, soil erosion and sedimentation control, landscape and vegetation protection.\n7. Public utilities and services. Proposed development shall assure that there are adequate public utilities and services and shall be accompanied by reasonable measures to assure the\navailability of such services concurrent with the creation of the need for the services. There shall be a general demonstration that police, fire, emergency, water, sewer, school, recreation, and\nother necessary utilities and public services will be available to accommodate the proposed development.\nThe development agreement shall provide for regular monitoring, reporting, and evaluation of the effectiveness of the development standards.\n(j) Minor and major modifications to development agreements. A development agreement may be modified or canceled by mutual consent of the parties to the agreement or by their successors in\ninterest.\nEither party may propose a major or minor modification to any town council-approved development agreement. Upon receipt of a proposed modification, the town manager shall consider the following\ncriteria in making the determination as to whether a proposed adjustment is a major or a minor modification to a development agreement:\n1. A substantial change in the boundaries of the development agreement shall constitute a major modification. Any single proposed increase or decrease in the area of land subject to the\ndevelopment agreement approved by the town council of more than five (5) percent shall be considered substantial. A cumulative increase of fifteen (15) percent or more in the land area\nsubject to the development agreement shall be considered substantial.\n2.\nA substantial change in the floor area or number of parking spaces shall constitute a major modification. Any single proposed increase or decrease in new floor area or number of parking\nspaces of more than a five (5) percent in a development agreement approved by the town council shall be considered a major modification. A cumulative increase of fifteen (15) percent or\nmore in the floor area or number of parking spaces subject to the development agreement shall be considered a major modification. Provided, under no circumstances shall a change in floor\narea of less than one thousand (1,000) square feet or fewer than ten (10) parking spaces be deemed either a major amendment or minor modification and such changes shall be reported by\nthe applicant to the town manager.\n3. Changes that would substantially affect pedestrian, bicycle, or vehicular access or circulation beyond the boundaries of the development agreement shall constitute a major modification.\n4.\nSubstantial change in the amount or location of open space within the boundaries of a development agreement shall constitute a major modification. Any single change that increases or\ndecreases the amount of open space by more than five (5) percent shall be considered a major modification. A cumulative increase or decrease in the amount of open space by fifteen (15)\npercent or more or a substantial change in the location of designated open space shall be considered a major modification.\nNotwithstanding the above, some proposed changes to a town-council approved development agreement that do not meet the threshold to constitute a major modification may in the judgment of the\ntown manager, because of size, perimeter location or transportation impacts, merit public review. In the event the manager makes such a determination he may submit the proposed minor modification at\na town council meeting to allow an opportunity for council review and citizen comment. Unless the other party to the development agreement agrees otherwise, such a review shall not extend the time\nperiod allowed for a decision by the manager on the minor modification or convert the change from a minor modification into a major modification.\nAll proposed adjustments to a town council-approved development agreement shall be publicly posted in such a manner that citizens of Chapel Hill will have the opportunity to express any concerns to\nthe town council and/or the town manager. The town manager shall determine whether a proposed adjustment to a town council-approved development agreement is a major or a minor modification\nwithin fifteen (15) working days of receipt of a proposed adjustment and shall promptly notify the town council and applicant of that determination. If the proposed action is determined to be a major\nmodification, the town manager shall require the filing of an application for approval of the amendment, following procedures outlined in subsection 3.5.5(k) of this appendix.\nIn the event state or federal law is changed after a development agreement has been entered into and the change prevents or precludes compliance with one or more provisions of the development\nagreement, the town council may modify the affected provisions, upon a finding that the change in state or federal law has a fundamental effect on the development agreement. In so doing, the procedures\nset forth for original approval of the development agreement shall be followed.\nExcept for grounds specified in NCGS 160D-108(c) or 160D-108.1(f), the town shall not apply subsequently adopted ordinances or development policies to the development that is subject to the approved\ndevelopment agreement.\n(k) Procedure for review of development agreements, amendments, and modifications.\n(1) Application submittal requirements. Applications for approval of a development agreement, a major modification to a previously approved development agreement, and a minor modification\nto a previously approved development agreement within a U-1 zoning district shall be submitted to the town manager. The town manager shall prescribe the form(s) of applications as well as\nany other material as the town manager may reasonably require to determine compliance with this section.\n(2) Process for review.\nA. Informal consultation. Prior to submission of a proposed development agreement or a major modification to a previously approved development agreement within this district, the\napplicant shall consult with the town manager and town council regarding the proposed development. The applicant is encouraged to engage in active discussion and collaboration with\nthe town staff, town council, town advisory boards, neighbors, and the community in the preparation of a proposed development agreement or amendment and plans for development.\nB.\nDraft agreement. A draft development agreement and long-range development plan for the activity to be addressed in the development agreement shall be submitted to the town\nmanager prior to the submission of a formal development agreement. The manager and applicant shall present the draft agreement to the planning commission, such other advisory\nboards as deemed appropriate by the town council, and the town council for review and comment. The manager and applicant shall also present the draft agreement in informal public\ninformation sessions for public review and comment. A formal application for approval of a development agreement may be submitted upon completion of the review, comment, and\nrevision of the draft development agreement.\nC. Initial development agreement. Applications for approval of an initial development agreement within this zone shall be processed concurrently with the petition for rezoning to the U-1\ndistrict. The legislative hearing on the initial development agreement shall be noticed and held concurrently with the hearing on the proposed rezoning. Notice of the legislative hearing\nbefore the town council on the proposed development agreement shall follow the same notice requirements as are applicable for hearings on proposed zoning atlas amendments. The\npublic notice shall include the location of the property covered by the proposed development agreement, the development uses proposed on the property, and the place a copy of the\nproposed development agreement may be obtained or reviewed. The town council's legislative hearing on the proposed development agreement shall be open to the public and all\ninterested persons shall be given the opportunity to present comments. The town council shall take action on an application for an initial development agreement within this zone\nconcurrently with action on the application for rezoning to this district.
