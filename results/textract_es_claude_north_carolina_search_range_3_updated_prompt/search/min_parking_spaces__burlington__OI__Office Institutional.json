OFFICE INSTITUTIONAL (OI) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Office Institutional (OI) District is established to accommodate\noffice uses, research and development facilities, corporate\nheadquarters, and multi-family residential uses in high quality single-\nbuilding and multi-building developments. The district also\naccommodates the ancillary service uses necessary to support the\npredominant office development, but is not intended as a retail\n920\ndistrict. Retail, personal service, and other commercial uses\npermitted as accessory to an office or institutional use should not\noccupy more than 10 percent of the floor area and should be\nconfigured to minimize visibility from off-site areas. The OI district\nalso serves as a transition area between higher intensity commercial\nuses and nearby lower density single-family residential\nneighborhoods. Development in the OI district is subject to design\nstandards to ensure it maintains compatibility with its surroundings.\nB. DISTRICT DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS\nNOTES:\n[1] This is a minimum development size, not a minimum lot area.\n[2] Development in the WPO is subject to built-upon limits in Section 3.20.F, Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay\n(WPO) District.\n[3] Applied to the entire single-family attached development, not to individual lots containing an individual single-family\nattached dwelling.\n[4] Standards applied to entire development, not individual lots.\n[5] Open space set-aside requirements applied to subdivisions of five or more lots.\n[6] Open space set-aside shall be configured with at least 50 percent devoted to active recreation features in accordance\nwith Section 7.1, Open Space Set-Aside.\n[7] In cases where development is in a subdivision established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, no setback shall\nbe required to be greater than the average setback of existing residential structures on the same side of the block or within\na distance of 500 feet horizontally on either side when blocks are not present.\n[8] On corner lots of record, the street setback may be reduced by 50 percent on the long side of the lot.\n[9] Development in the AHO is subject to maximum building heights in Section 3.20.B, Airport Height Overlay (AHO) District.\nCity of Burlington\n3-41\nUnified Development Ordinance\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\nCELL (1,
