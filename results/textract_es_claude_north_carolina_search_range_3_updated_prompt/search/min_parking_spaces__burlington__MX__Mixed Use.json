OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING\nA. PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe purpose of this section is to ensure provision of off-street parking and loading facilities in proportion\nto the generalized parking, loading, and transportation demand of the different uses allowed by this\nOrdinance. The standards are further intended to:\n1. Provide for adequate off-street parking, off-street loading, and safe movement of vehicles into, out\nof, and through parking areas;\n2. Allow for flexibility to accommodate alternative solutions to off-street parking and loading needs,\nwhere such flexibility is consistent with the City's adopted policy guidance;\n3.\nReduce the aesthetic impact of surface parking lots in gateway corridors, downtown, and mixed-use\nareas through standards addressing on-site parking lot locations;\n4.\nAvoid excessive paved surface areas and the resulting problems associated with stormwater runoff\nand urban heat islands; and\n5. Protecting compatibility between adjacent uses of land and historic resources.\nB. APPLICABILITY\nThe standards in this section shall apply to all development in the City's jurisdiction, unless exempted in\naccordance with Section 5.1.C, Exemptions.\n1. Generally\nWhenever a building is constructed, an open-air use of land is conducted, or a principal or accessory\nuse is established, the development shall meet the requirements of this section.\n2. Additions and Expansions\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\nWhenever an existing building, open air use of land, or principal or accessory use is enlarged or\nincreased in capacity after November 1, 2019, the development shall comply with the requirements in\nSection 9.6, Nonconforming Site Features.\n3. Changes in Use\na. If the principal use changes, then the new principal use shall meet the requirements of this section,\nexcept that if the use change results in an increase of less than five percent in the required number\nof parking spaces, or less than two additional parking spaces, no additional parking spaces are\nrequired.\nb. In cases where an existing parking lot does not comply with the parking lot configuration\nrequirements of this section, changes in use shall require the parking lot's configuration to be\nbrought into compliance with these standards, to the maximum extent practicable.\n4. Addition of New Parking Spaces\n(AMENDED 6.21.22 UDOTA-3-22)\nNew off-street parking spaces added to a development, lot, or site after November 1, 2019 shall\ncomply with the standards in this section. In cases where the development, lot, or site has existing\noff-street parking spaces that do not comply with these standards, those spaces are subject to Section\n5.1.B.5, Pre-Existing Nonconforming Development. Driveways, aisles, or maneuvering areas serving\nnew off-street parking spaces or connecting new off-street parking spaces to the existing parking\nspaces established prior to November 1, 2019 shall also comply with the requirements in this section.\nNothing shall preclude the use of an administrative adjustment or alternative parking plan as needed\nto ensure continuity and practical connection between different parking areas.\n5. Pre-Existing Nonconforming Development\nLawfully-established off-street parking and loading areas established prior to November 1, 2019, that\ndo not comply with these standards shall be subject to the applicable standards in CHAPTER 9.\nINONCONFORMITIES.\nC. EXEMPTIONS\n1. The following forms of development are exempt from the requirements of this section:\na. Lawfully-established lots of record existing prior to November 1, 2019, that are 33 feet wide or\nless, contain a single-family detached residential structure, and are not served by an alley;\nb. Re-striping an existing parking lot which does not create a deficient number of parking spaces or\na nonconforming situation; and\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \n5-3\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\nNEW PAGE 296\nCHAPTER 5 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nSection 5.1 Off-Street Parking and Loading\nC. Rehabilitation or re-use of an historic structure in an LHO district.\n2. Development located in the CBD district is exempted from the minimum off-street parking\nrequirements in Table 5.1.D.9, Table of Minimum Off-Street Parking Requirements, but any off-street\nparking spaces shall comply with the standards in Section 5.1.E, Parking Lot Configuration.\nD. OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS\n1. Parking Plan Required\nEvery application for a site plan or building permit shall include a parking plan or plot plan drawn to\nscale and fully-dimensioned as necessary in order to demonstrate compliance with the standards in\nthis Ordinance.\n2. Minimum Off-Street Parking Spaces Required\na. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces required for development shall be in accordance\nwith Table 5.1.D.9, Table of Minimum Off-Street Parking Requirements.\nb. Off-street parking shall be provided to meet the parking demand without the use of streets, except\nas specifically allowed by this section.\n3. Off-Street Parking Space Maximum\na.\nRetail use types subject to the standards in Section 5.5.B.7, Standards for Large Format Retail\nUses, shall limit the total number of off-street parking spaces provided to not more than 125\npercent of the minimum parking spaces required in Table 5.1.D.9, Table of Minimum Off-Street\nParking Requirements.\nb. Deviations from this standard may be requested in accordance with Section 5.1.J, Parking\nAlternatives.\n4. Use Type Not Listed\na. For use types that do not correspond to the use types listed in Table 5.1.D.9, Table of Minimum\nOff-Street Parking Requirements, any one of the following actions may be taken as part of\ndetermining the applicable off-street parking requirements:\ni.\nThe applicant may provide a parking study for the use(s) prepared by a professional engineer\nlicensed by the State of North Carolina;\nii. The applicant may propose a text amendment to this UDO in accordance with Section 2.4.W,\nText Amendment;\niii. The applicant may request a formal determination of these off-street parking standards in\naccordance with Section 2.4.F, Determination, or\niv.\nThe Planning Director may determine the minimum parking space requirement based on a\nsimilar use in accordance with the standards of this Ordinance.\nb. In cases where the applicant desires the Planning Director to make a determination, the application\nshall provide adequate information for review, which includes, but is not limited to: the type of\nuse(s), number of employees, the availability of transit, the occupancy of the building, square feet\nof sales, service and office area, parking spaces proposed, and hours of operation.\n5.
