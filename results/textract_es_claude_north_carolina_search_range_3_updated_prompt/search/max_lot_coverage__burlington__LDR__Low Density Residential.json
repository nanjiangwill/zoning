CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION\nA. PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe purpose and intent of this section is to provide landowners in the rural and suburban portions of the\nCity a development option that provides additional development flexibility to build on smaller lots when\nadditional open space set-asides are provided, and the development is designed and located in a way that\nprotects rural character, agricultural activities, or natural and historic features on the site. This is done in\norder to:\n1.\nConserve open land, including those areas containing productive agricultural soils, unique and sensitive\nnatural features such as floodplains, wetlands, river and stream corridors, areas with mature deciduous\ntrees, and watersheds;\n2. Promote existing rural character particularly in areas visible from major roadways in the City;\n3. Retain and protect existing environmental, natural, and cultural resources;\n4. Create a linked network of open lands; and\n5. Provide reasonable economic use of the land.\nB. APPLICABILITY\n1. Type of Development\nThis conservation subdivision option shall be limited to development of single-family detached\nresidential dwellings on individual lots in subdivisions of more than five lots. The conservation\nsubdivision option shall not be available for any other form of development or use type.\n2. Where Allowed\nSingle-family detached residential subdivisions of more than five lots in the LDR, MDR, and PD districts\nmay be developed as a conservation subdivision, in accordance with the standards in this section.\n3. Where Prohibited\nThe conservation subdivision option is not available for use in the HDR, RMH, PDD or business, special,\nor other conditional districts.\nC.
