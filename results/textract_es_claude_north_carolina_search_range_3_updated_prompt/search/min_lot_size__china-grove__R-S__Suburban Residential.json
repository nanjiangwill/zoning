These elements are of economic value to the Town and make it a desirable place\nto live and visit.\nThe Open Space requirements of this section apply only to new developments with greater than 10\nresidential dwelling units, except for Open Space Subdivisions within R-S Districts, which are required to\nmeet open space requirements regardless of the number of lots proposed. Developments in which all lots\nare greater than one acre are exempt from this provision. Non-residential developments are encouraged to\npreserve open space wherever possible. All other requirements of this Chapter apply to all new\ndevelopments and construction in all districts.\nSection 12.2 Types of Open Space\nAll required open space shall be classified in accordance with this Section.\nThe following open space types may be either common area open space or public open space:\nA. Playground-Playgrounds are for active recreational use and provide sunny and shaded play equipment\nand play areas for children as well as open shelter with benches. Playgrounds may be part of other\ntypes of open space, such as parks, or may stand alone. Playgrounds may be fenced, lockable and lit if\nnot part of a park.\nB. Square-Squares are areas for passive recreational use. Squares shall be bounded by streets on a\nminimum of three sides or 75 percent of their perimeter. Squares are encouraged to be entirely bounded\nby streets and/or lanes.

Plaza- A plaza is an open area adjacent to, or part of, a non-residential building or facility. Plazas\nfunction as gathering places and may incorporate a variety of non-permanent activities such as vendors\nand display stands. Plazas are generally paved in brick or other type of paver or crushed stone. Plazas\nshall be level, stepped, or gently sloping [less than five (5) percent grade]. Plazas may be left unplanted.\nIf planted, the trees should form a frame around the plaza space.
