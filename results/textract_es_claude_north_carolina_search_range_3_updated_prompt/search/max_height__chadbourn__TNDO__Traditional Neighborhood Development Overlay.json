The buildings will\nprovide space for industry and large offices, as well as hotels, conference facilities,\nand large retail uses such as a full service grocery store. Structures shall be designed\nto serve as key focal points and to establish the design template for the area. When\nlocated at the end of a block or other appropriate location, structures shall be designed\nto terminate vistas.\nThe photograph below is an example for illustration purposes only and is not intended\nto regulate lot/building styles, patterns, or forms.\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 24\n", "page_number": 205, "page_range": [205, 206, 207], "highlight": ["The\n<em>height</em> of\n5' MAX\nENCROACHMENT\nparapet walls is\nnot counted in the building <em>height</em> calculations and", "Buildings shall have no less than 2 <em>stories</em>.", "Buildings shall have no more than 3\n<em>stories</em>, unless the building is in a \"<em>TNDO</em>\" district, in which case", "the maximum\nnumber of <em>stories</em> and <em>maximum</em> <em>building</em> <em>height</em> is regulated by the procedure for\n\"<em>TNDO</em>\" approval", "The urban workplace building may be a large structure (15,000+ square\n<em>feet</em>) and can have one or multiple"], "score": 22.06774, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"TNDO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"TNDO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"TNDO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 208\n9.7-2 Urban Workplace Lot Type.\n(A.)

For streets signed for greater than 35 MPH, the area to be\nclear of view obstructions at un-signalized intersections is the triangular area formed\nby the point of intersection of street right-of-way lines and a point located along each\nright-of-way line at a distance of 35 feet from the point of intersection. For\nintersecting streets signed for 35 MPH or less, the area to be clear of view\nobstructions at un-signalized intersections is the triangular area formed by the point of\nintersection of street right-of-way lines and a point located along each right-of-way\nline at a distance of 25 feet from the point of intersection.\nSite Triangle Illustration for Streets Signed for 35 MPH or less:\n25 ft\nsight line\narea\n25 ft\nStreet Right-of-Way\n2.11-2 No Obstruction in Sight Triangle.
