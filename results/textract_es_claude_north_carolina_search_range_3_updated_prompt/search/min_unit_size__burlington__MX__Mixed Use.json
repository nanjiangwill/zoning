NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESS (NB) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Neighborhood Business (NB) district is intended for low intensity,\nneighborhood-serving commercial and mixed-use development around\nsignificant roadway intersections along the edges of neighborhoods. The\ndistrict allows offices, personal services, and small-scale retail and a\nvariety of institutional uses. As a means of providing additional housing\noptions, the district allows live/work dwellings and upper story\nresidential. Industrial development and higher density residential uses\nare not permitted. New commercial development is built close to the\nstreet and subject to commercial design standards to raise the bar for\ndevelopment quality. District regulations discourage uses that are too\nintense or that draw the majority of their patrons from outside the\nimmediate area.\nB. DISTRICT DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20; 06.21.22 UDOTA-03-22)\n[1] Includes duplex, triplex, and quadriplex dwellings.\n[2] Increased to 7 units per acre in a pocket

court, duplex,\ntriplex, or quadriplex.\n[9] Open space set-aside requirements applied to subdivisions of five or more lots.\n[10] Open space set-aside shall be configured with at least 50 percent devoted to active recreation features in accordance with\nSection 7.1, Open Space Set-Aside.\n[11] In cases where development is in a subdivision established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, no setback shall be\nrequired to be greater than the average setback of existing residential structures on the same side of the block or within a distance\nof 500 feet horizontally on either side when blocks are not present.\n[12] On corner lots of record, the street setback may be reduced by 50 percent on the long side of the lot.\n[13] Reduced to as low as 3 feet for dwellings in pocket neighborhoods and bungalow courts.\n[14] When the lot abuts a residential district, the OI zoning district, or an alley, then the setback shall be at least 15 feet; when the\nbuilding wall abutting the lot line includes an opening (such as for a door or window), the setback shall be at least 5 feet.\n[15] Development in the AHO is subject to maximum building heights in Section 3.20.B,
