HOME OCCUPATIONS\n2901. Purpose.\nThe home occupation regulations are established in order to preserve the neighborhoods and to prevent the intrusion of commercial ventures into residential\ndistricts.\n(Ord. of 12-19-11(6))\n2902. - Standards for home occupations.\nThe purpose of the home occupation regulations is to protect the character of the surrounding residential neighborhood, while recognizing that traditional\nworkplaces are no longer necessary in all situations due to changing technology, computerization, networking, and the changing job market. These regulations are\nintended to recognize this trend and allow home occupations that are located and conducted in such a manner that the existence of the home occupation is not\ndetectable outside of the dwelling unit or accessory building. The home occupation use shall be clearly subordinate and incidental to the residential use of the\nproperty.\nA. Classes of Home Occupation.\n1. Minor Home Occupations. Home occupations that have little or no impact on the surrounding residential area, such as:\na. Personal home business and professional offices; a service-oriented business use.\nb. Home craft businesses, including (but not limited to) artists, sculptors, and dressmakers.\nC. Instructional services including music, art, dance, voice, and tutoring.\nd. Day-care for six or fewer individuals, whether for adults or children.\n57 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\n\nNEW PAGE 58\nCarteret County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n2. Major Home Occupations.

No more than 25 percent of the gross area of such residence may be used for the home occupation (bed-and-breakfast and day-care uses are\nexempt from this provision) and no more than 400 square feet of the residence may be used for the home occupation. No more than 600 square feet\nof either an attached garage or detached accessory building, but not both, may be used for the home occupation. Due to its nature, day-care may be\nconducted throughout the residence.\n2. No use shall require either internal or external alterations or involve construction features or use of electrical or mechanical equipment that would\nresult in a lower fire rating of the structure.\n3. Except for drop-off activities, the use may increase vehicular traffic flow and parking by no more than two additional vehicles at a time.\n4. In no way shall the appearance of the structure be altered or the occupation within the residence be conducted in a manner which would cause the\npremises to differ from its residential character either by the use of colors, materials, construction, lighting, signs, or by the emission of sounds,\nnoise, vibration, dust, smell, smoke, glare, electrical interference, or any other hazard or nuisance to any greater extent than experienced in an\naverage residential neighborhood.\n5. No exterior storage, display, use, or activity of any kind related to the home occupation.\n6. There shall be no commodities sold or services rendered that require receipt or delivery of merchandise, goods, or equipment other than by\npassenger motor vehicle, parcel delivery service, or U.S. mail service.
