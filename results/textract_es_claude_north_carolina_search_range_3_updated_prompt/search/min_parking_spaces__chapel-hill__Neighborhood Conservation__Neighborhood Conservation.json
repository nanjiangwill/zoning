Dimensional standards.\nPurpose statement: It is the intent of this article to provide for performance standards which serve to define the development character of an area, and to ensure the compatibility of development both\nwith the environmental characteristics, accessibility levels, and special amenities offered by the development site and with surrounding land uses and development intensities. It is further intended that the\nestablishment of intensity regulations reflect the protection of critical environmental areas and the suitability of land for a particular level of development intensity, in accord with the goals and objectives of\nthe comprehensive plan.\nThe setback and height regulations established in the dimensional matrix are intended to ensure adequate solar access, privacy, and ventilation; access to and around buildings, off-street parking areas,\nloading space, and service areas; space for landscaping; and spacing between buildings and portions of buildings to reduce potential adverse effects of noise, odor, glare, or fire. Adequate solar access is\ndeemed to consist of varying levels of access ranging from rooftop solar access in high-intensity zoning districts to south wall solar access in low-intensity zoning districts.\n3.8.1 Establishment and General Applicability of Dimensional Regulations.\nExcept as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, regulations governing the dimensions of lots and buildings are hereby established as described in section 3.8.2 and shown in Table 3.8-1.\n(a) No land or structure shall be used or occupied, and no structure, or part thereof, shall be constructed, erected, altered, or moved except in compliance with the dimensional regulations herein\nspecified for each zoning district.\n(b)\nNo portion of land used in connection with an existing or proposed structure or use of land and necessary for compliance with the dimensional regulations of this article shall also be used,\nthrough sale or otherwise, as part of the land required in connection with any other development.\n(c) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, dimensional regulations applicable to OI-3 and OI-4 zoning districts and planned development zoning lots shall be applied to the district or lot as a\nwhole and not to individual parts thereof.\n3.8.2 Dimensional Regulations.\nAbout the Building Envelope. Sections (f)-(j) define the three-dimensional building envelope. All structures, or portions thereof, must be placed within the building envelope and may not encroach the\nbuilding envelope unless specifically exempted by this Appendix.\nDivisions (f) and (g) regulate the setback height and core height, respectively, which together define the vertical extent of the building envelope.\nDivisions (h)-(j) regulate the street, interior, and north setback lines, respectively, which together define the perimeter setback line and horizontal extent of the building envelope.\nDefinitions. Refer to Appendix A for definitions of applicable terms.\n(a) Zoning District. Column (A) refers to the applicable Zoning District. The requirements set forth in sections (b)-(i) below, relate to the zoning district specified in the row under Column (A),\n(b) Minimum Lot Size. Column (B) is expressed in square feet of gross land area.\nNotes:\n(1) Where a zoning lot is located in more than one zoning district, the minimum gross land area required of such zoning lot shall be the sum of the areas derived by multiplying the minimum\ngross land area required for each represented district by the proportion of the zoning lot located within that district.\n(2) For all uses that consist of three (3) or more dwelling units, the minimum lot size is two (2) times the figure shown in Column (B).\n(c) Minimum Frontage. Column (C) is the minimum width of the lot measured along the street.\nNotes:\n(1) Where a zoning lot fronts on two (2) or more streets, minimum street frontage width requirements shall be considered met if the frontage along any one of such streets meets the minimum\nstreet frontage width requirements.\n(2) Where a zoning lot fronts on a turning circle of a cul-de-sac or at a point of a street where the radius of the curvature of the right-of-way is less than ninety (90) feet, the minimum street\nfrontage width requirement shall be thirty-five (35) feet.\n(d) Minimum Lot Width. Column (D) is the minimum width of the lot, expressed in feet, measured at least twenty-five (25) feet interior from the minimum street setback. No portion of a lot, created\nas part of a subdivision, between a street setback and the opposite interior (rear) setback, shall be less than twenty (20) feet in width.\nException:\n(1) Authorized flag lots, created as part of a subdivision and subject to the lot layout standards in section 5.2, may contain areas between a street setback and the opposite interior (rear) setback\nthat are less than twenty (20) feet in width. Authorized flag lots shall reach the minimum lot width at a point not to exceed two hundred (200) feet from the street right-of-way.\nNotes:\n(2) Where a zoning lot fronts on two (2) or more streets, minimum lot width requirements shall be considered met if the lot width at the street setback from any one of such streets meets the\nminimum lot width requirement.\n(3)\nWhere a zoning lot fronts on a turning circle of a cul-de-sac or at a point of a street where the radius of the curvature of the right-of-way is less than ninety (90) feet, the minimum lot width\nshall be reached at a distance derived by the following formula: D = 50 (W)(35) 50, where W = minimum required lot width, and D = maximum distance from street right-of-way to where the\nlot width equals the minimum required width for that district.\n(e) Maximum Setback Height: Column (E) is the maximum allowable height at the perimeter setback line of a zoning lot, as defined by the minimum street, interior, and solar setbacks.\n(1)\nHeight shall be measured from mean finished grade, along the street fa\u00e7ade of the building.

The purpose of requiring regulation of placement and design of telecommunications equipment in this district is to help achieve these objectives and to protect the\nspecial character of the historic district.\nIt is intended that these regulations ensure, insofar as possible, that buildings or structures in the historic district shall be in harmony with other buildings or structures located therein. However, it is not\nthe intention of these regulations to require the reconstruction or restoration of individual or original buildings, or to prohibit the demolition or removal of such buildings, or to impose architectural styles\nfrom particular historic periods, but rather to encourage design, whether contemporary or traditional, which is harmonious with the character of the historic district.\n(a) Establishment of historic district.\n(1) The historic district is hereby established as a district which overlays other zoning districts established in sections 3.3-3.5. The boundaries of the historic district are as shown on the official\nzoning atlas.\n(2) No new historic district or any change to the boundaries of any existing historic district shall be designated until the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, or its successor agency,\nshall have been given an opportunity, in accord with Chapter NCGS 160D-944, or its successor statutes, to make recommendations with respect to the establishment of such new district or\nchange in the boundaries of an existing district.\n(3) The use and development of any land or structure within the historic district shall comply with use regulations and intensity regulations applicable to the use district in which it is located.\n(b) Certificate of appropriateness required.\n(1) No exterior portion of any building or other structure (including masonry walls, fences, light fixtures, steps and pavement, or other appurtenant features), or any aboveground utility structure,\nor any type of outdoor advertising sign shall be erected, altered, restored, moved, or demolished within the historic district until an application for a certificate of appropriateness as\nto\nexterior architectural features has been approved. For purposes of this article, \"exterior architectural features\" shall include the architectural style, general design, and general arrangement of\nthe exterior of a building or other structure, including the kind and texture of the building material, the size and scale of the building, and the type and style of all windows, doors,\nlight\n23 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 24\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nfixtures, signs, and other appurtenant fixtures.

Such minor works or modifications shall be limited to those listed in the Commission's Design Principles and Standards, or a successor document. No application\ninvolving a minor work or modification may be denied without the formal action of the commission. Ordinance requirements for notification of affected property owners must be met for all\napplications.\n(c) Certain changes not prohibited.\n(1) Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in the historic district that does not involve a change in design,\nmaterial, or outer appearance thereof, or to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, moving, or demolition of any such feature that the building inspector or similar\nofficial shall certify is required by the public safety because of unsafe or dangerous condition.\n(2)\nOn the basis of preliminary sketches or drawings and other supporting data, the town manager may exempt from requirements for a certificate of appropriateness projects involving the\nordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature that does not involve a change in design, material, or outer appearance thereof. The town manager shall notify the\ncommission of all such exemptions.\n(d) Procedures for approval of certificates of appropriateness.\n(1) Application submittal requirements.\nA.

The town manager or the commission shall approve the application, approve the application with conditions, or deny the application for a certificate of\nappropriateness by the end of the next commission meeting following ninety days after the application is filed; provided, if timely action is not taken, and the time for taking action is not\nextended by the Commission and consented to by written notice from the applicant, the certificate of appropriateness shall be deemed to have been approved as submitted and shall be\nissued administratively.\nThe Commission may extend the time for consideration and deliberation for a period or for periods up to a total of one hundred eighty days from the date of acceptance of the application as\ncomplete, where it finds such action to be necessary:\na) Because of meeting cancellations or postponements, quorum shortages, or backlogs of pending applications with priority by filing date, or other practical considerations; or\nb) To receive additional information requested by the Commission, or to deliberate fully on memoranda submitted by one or more parties, or to seek resolution of outstanding questions,\nissues, or goals.\nNothing herein shall prevent extensions by and with the consent of the Applicant. The time periods for action by the Commission shall be stayed during periods of appeal to the Board\nof\nAdjustment by any party.\nUnder no circumstances shall the time period for which the Commission or staff may take action on an application for a certificate of appropriateness be extended beyond 180 days from the\ndate an application is filed. An application is considered filed when it has been submitted, deemed complete by the town manager, and the requisite application fee has been received by the\nTown.\nThe town manager or the commission may impose such reasonable conditions on the approval of an application as will ensure that the spirit and intent of this article are achieved. An\napplication for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the demolition of a building or structure within the historic district may not be denied. However, the effective date of such a\ncertificate may be delayed for up to three hundred sixty-five (365) days from the date of approval. The maximum period of delay authorized by this section shall be reduced by the commission\nwhere it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use of or return from such property by virtue of the delay. During such period the\ncommission may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building. If the commission finds that the building has no particular\nsignificance or value toward maintaining the character of the historic district, it shall waive all or part of such period and authorize earlier demolition or removal. In every case, the record of\nthe commission's action shall include the reasons for its action.\"\n(6) Actions subsequent to decision. The town manager shall notify the applicant of a decision in writing, and shall file a copy of it with the town's planning department. If the application is denied,\nthe notice shall include the reasons for such action.\n(7) Appeal of decision. A decision by the commission on an application for a certificate of appropriateness may be appealed to the board of adjustment in accordance with the provisions of\nsection 4.10. Appeals of administrative decisions shall be made to the historic district commission pursuant to the relevant procedures in NCGS 160D-405.\n(8) Submittal of new application. If the commission denies an application for a certificate of appropriateness, a new application affecting the same property may be accepted by the town manager\nonly if substantial change, with respect to the reasons for its denial, is made in plans for the proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or moving.\n(9) A certificate of appropriateness shall be valid for three hundred sixty-five (365) calendar days from date of issuance, or, in the case of a certificate for demolition, from the effective date. If the\nauthorized work has not commenced within that period, has not been extended by the commission, or has been discontinued for more than three hundred sixty-five (365) calendar days from\nthe date of issuance, such certificate of appropriateness shall expire and the applicant shall be required to reapply and obtain a new certificate of appropriateness before commencing further\nwork.\n24 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n", "page_number": 22, "page_range": [22, 23, 24], "highlight": ["For example, a duplex can be up to 2,400 square feet in size (up to 1,200 square feet <em>per</em> <em>dwelling</em> unit", "Size\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \nResidential Use Type\nCELL (2, 2): \nMaximum Size\n(heated square feet <em>per</em>", "<em>dwelling</em> unit)\nCELL (3, 1): \nSingle-family\nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (4, 1): \nSubdistrict\nCELL (4, 2): \n2,000", "statement: It is the intent of this section to provide for an airport hazard district, historic districts, <em>neighborhood</em>", "<em>conservation</em> districts, resource conservation district, and watershed protection\ndistrict, which shall"], "score": 9.77029, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Neighborhood Conservation\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Neighborhood Conservation\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Neighborhood Conservation\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Neighborhood Conservation\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking space for each\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 41\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nDefinitions of uses are listed in Appendix A\nDefinitions of Wireless Communication Facility uses are listed in Appendix A, and in Section 5.20.3.\nh\nUses in Table 3.7-1, Use Matrix, are applicable only to private property outside improved public rights-of-way.

Dimensional standards.\nPurpose statement: It is the intent of this article to provide for performance standards which serve to define the development character of an area, and to ensure the compatibility of development both\nwith the environmental characteristics, accessibility levels, and special amenities offered by the development site and with surrounding land uses and development intensities. It is further intended that the\nestablishment of intensity regulations reflect the protection of critical environmental areas and the suitability of land for a particular level of development intensity, in accord with the goals and objectives of\nthe comprehensive plan.\nThe setback and height regulations established in the dimensional matrix are intended to ensure adequate solar access, privacy, and ventilation; access to and around buildings, off-street parking areas,\nloading space, and service areas; space for landscaping; and spacing between buildings and portions of buildings to reduce potential adverse effects of noise, odor, glare, or fire. Adequate solar access is\ndeemed to consist of varying levels of access ranging from rooftop solar access in high-intensity zoning districts to south wall solar access in low-intensity zoning districts.\n3.8.1 Establishment and General Applicability of Dimensional Regulations.\nExcept as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, regulations governing the dimensions of lots and buildings are hereby established as described in section 3.8.2 and shown in Table 3.8-1.\n(a) No land or structure shall be used or occupied, and no structure, or part thereof, shall be constructed, erected, altered, or moved except in compliance with the dimensional regulations herein\nspecified for each zoning district.\n(b)\nNo portion of land used in connection with an existing or proposed structure or use of land and necessary for compliance with the dimensional regulations of this article shall also be used,\nthrough sale or otherwise, as part of the land required in connection with any other development.\n(c) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, dimensional regulations applicable to OI-3 and OI-4 zoning districts and planned development zoning lots shall be applied to the district or lot as a\nwhole and not to individual parts thereof.\n3.8.2 Dimensional Regulations.\nAbout the Building Envelope. Sections (f)-(j) define the three-dimensional building envelope. All structures, or portions thereof, must be placed within the building envelope and may not encroach the\nbuilding envelope unless specifically exempted by this Appendix.\nDivisions (f) and (g) regulate the setback height and core height, respectively, which together define the vertical extent of the building envelope.\nDivisions (h)-(j) regulate the street, interior, and north setback lines, respectively, which together define the perimeter setback line and horizontal extent of the building envelope.\nDefinitions. Refer to Appendix A for definitions of applicable terms.\n(a) Zoning District. Column (A) refers to the applicable Zoning District. The requirements set forth in sections (b)-(i) below, relate to the zoning district specified in the row under Column (A),\n(b) Minimum Lot Size. Column (B) is expressed in square feet of gross land area.\nNotes:\n(1) Where a zoning lot is located in more than one zoning district, the minimum gross land area required of such zoning lot shall be the sum of the areas derived by multiplying the minimum\ngross land area required for each represented district by the proportion of the zoning lot located within that district.\n(2) For all uses that consist of three (3) or more dwelling units, the minimum lot size is two (2) times the figure shown in Column (B).\n(c) Minimum Frontage. Column (C) is the minimum width of the lot measured along the street.\nNotes:\n(1) Where a zoning lot fronts on two (2) or more streets, minimum street frontage width requirements shall be considered met if the frontage along any one of such streets meets the minimum\nstreet frontage width requirements.\n(2) Where a zoning lot fronts on a turning circle of a cul-de-sac or at a point of a street where the radius of the curvature of the right-of-way is less than ninety (90) feet, the minimum street\nfrontage width requirement shall be thirty-five (35) feet.\n(d) Minimum Lot Width. Column (D) is the minimum width of the lot, expressed in feet, measured at least twenty-five (25) feet interior from the minimum street setback. No portion of a lot, created\nas part of a subdivision, between a street setback and the opposite interior (rear) setback, shall be less than twenty (20) feet in width.\nException:\n(1) Authorized flag lots, created as part of a subdivision and subject to the lot layout standards in section 5.2, may contain areas between a street setback and the opposite interior (rear) setback\nthat are less than twenty (20) feet in width. Authorized flag lots shall reach the minimum lot width at a point not to exceed two hundred (200) feet from the street right-of-way.\nNotes:\n(2) Where a zoning lot fronts on two (2) or more streets, minimum lot width requirements shall be considered met if the lot width at the street setback from any one of such streets meets the\nminimum lot width requirement.\n(3)\nWhere a zoning lot fronts on a turning circle of a cul-de-sac or at a point of a street where the radius of the curvature of the right-of-way is less than ninety (90) feet, the minimum lot width\nshall be reached at a distance derived by the following formula: D = 50 (W)(35) 50, where W = minimum required lot width, and D = maximum distance from street right-of-way to where the\nlot width equals the minimum required width for that district.\n(e) Maximum Setback Height: Column (E) is the maximum allowable height at the perimeter setback line of a zoning lot, as defined by the minimum street, interior, and solar setbacks.\n(1)\nHeight shall be measured from mean finished grade, along the street fa\u00e7ade of the building. Where a structure fronts more than one (1) street, height shall be measured from the lower, more\nrestrictive mean finished grade.\n(2)\n42 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 43\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nTo determine mean finished grade, take the spot elevations from the highest and lowest points of the foundation. The average of these two (2) spots elevations is the mean finished grade and the elevation\nfrom which height measurements are made.\n(3) The entire structure, and all portions thereof, is subject to the maximum setback height.\nExceptions:\nA. The structure or part thereof is below the allowable core height, as described in division (g) below.\nB. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted in section 3.8.3 Exceptions to Setback and Height Requirements, below.\nC. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted as provided elsewhere in this Appendix.\n(4) For purposes of applying setback and height regulations to development within an OI-3 or OI-4 zoning district or within a townhouse development or a planned development, all contiguous\nland within the district, townhouse development, or planned development shall be considered as a single zoning lot.\n(f) Maximum Core Height: Column (F) is the maximum allowable height in the interior or core area of a lot. The core height provides additional allowable height on the interior of a zoning lot based\non the horizontal distance measured away from the perimeter setback line of the lot. The allowable core height increases with the distance interior to the lot, measured from the perimeter\nsetback line at a rate described below.\n(1) In all Zoning Districts, except those explicitly named in subdivision (2), the allowable core height increases at a rate of one (1) foot in height for every two (2) feet of distance interior to the lot,\nmeasured away from the perimeter setbacks. This is equivalent to a slope of 1/2 (rise/run) or 1:2.\n(2) In the Town Center 1 to 3, Office/Institutional 3 to 4 zoning districts the allowable core height increases at the following rates:\nA. Street and interior setbacks: one (1) feet in height for every one (1) feet of distance interior to the lot, measured away from the street and interior setbacks. This is equivalent to a slope of\n1/1 (rise/run) or 1:1.\nB. Solar setbacks: one (1) feet in height for every one (1) foot and seven-tenths of a foot (1.7 feet) of distance interior to the lot, measured away from the street and interior setbacks. This is\nequivalent to a slope of 1/1.7 (rise/run) or 1:1.7.\n(3) No structure, or part thereof, shall project beyond the allowable core height of a structure or part thereof.\nExceptions:\nA. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted in section 3.8.3 Exceptions to Setback and Height Requirements, below.\nB. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted as provided elsewhere in this Appendix.\n(4) If a structure is located in the vicinity of an airport, the height limitations set forth in Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 77, or successor regulations, shall apply where such limitations are\nstricter than those established in this appendix.\n(g) Minimum Street Setback. Column (G) establishes a minimum setback from the street right-of-way line. Where a zoning lot fronts on a street with a right-of-way width not meeting the standards of\nthis appendix, street setback shall be measured from a line running parallel to the centerline of the street at a distance from such centerline equal to one-half (1/2) the standard right-of-way width\nof the street.\nException:\n(1) The town manager or town council may exempt lots from this requirement upon making one (1) of the following findings:\nA. Where a building line has already been established by existing structures along the block which are situated on lots comprising at least twenty-five (25) percent of the street frontage, the\nbuilding may be constructed at the established building line; or\nB. The existing right-of-way is adequate to encompass any anticipated need for widening of the street or other improvements and widening of the right-of-way to town standards would\ncreate nonconforming street setbacks for other structures on the street.\n(h) Minimum Interior Setback. Column (H) establishes a minimum setback measured from the interior lot lines.\nException:\n(1) The interior setback requirements may be reduced to zero (0) under certain conditions (see section 5.2.8.).\nNote:\n(2) Side setbacks are set at zero (0) in many non-residential districts in order to encourage the formation of a street wall, as is found in traditional commercial centers such as the TC district along\nFranklin Street.\n(i) Minimum Solar Setback. Column (I) establishes a minimum setback measured from north lot lines. Where a solar setback and either a street or interior setback both apply to the same portion of a\nlot line, the required minimum setback shall be the greater of the two (2).\nExceptions:\n(1) The solar setback may be reduced to zero (0) under certain conditions (see section 5.2.8).\n(2) Minimum solar setback requirements shall not apply to any structure, or part thereof, when the proposed height of the structure is ninety (90) percent, or less, of the maximum allowed\nsetback height. In such cases, the lesser interior setback may be used instead.\n(j)\nMaximum Impervious Surface Ratio. Column (J) establishes the maximum ratio of impervious surface on a lot. The maximum amount of impervious surface area is divided by multiplying the gross\nland area of the lot by the ratio established in Column (K) and as described below:\n(1) Single-family and two-family residential development: (.50)\n(2) Multifamily developments, fraternities and sororities, non-residential, or mixed-use development: (.70).\nException:\n(3) Impervious surface restrictions shall not apply to town center zoning districts.\n(k) Maximum Floor Area Ratio. Maximum floor area allowed shall be the number of square feet derived by multiplying gross land area by the applicable floor area ratio (FAR) as shown in Table 3.8.1.\nExceptions:\n(1) A maximum floor area ratio shall not apply to:\nA. Dwelling Units, Single-Family\nB. Dwelling Units, Single-Family with Accessory Apartment\nC. Dwelling Units, Single-Family with Cottage\nD. Public Cultural Facilities\n(2) For two-family dwellings on a single zoning lot, the floor area shall be .40 in all zones and overlay zones, except where the overlay zone establishes a more restrictive floor area ratio for\nduplexes.\n(3)\nFor public elementary and secondary schools, the maximum floor area ratio shall be 0.174 unless a higher floor area ratio is established in Column (L).\n43 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n", "page_number": 41, "page_range": [41, 42, 43], "highlight": [".\n**\nTwo-family, three-family, and four-family developments shall not be permitted in any <em>neighborhood</em>", "<em>conservation</em> districts that do not otherwise allow for single-family with accessory\napartment, duplexes", "intended to ensure adequate solar access, privacy, and ventilation; access to and around buildings, <em>off</em>-<em>street</em>", "<em>parking</em> areas,\nloading space, and service areas; space for landscaping; and spacing between buildings"], "score": 8.333035, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Neighborhood Conservation\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Neighborhood Conservation\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Neighborhood Conservation\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Neighborhood Conservation\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking space for each\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [21, 22, 23, 24, 35, 41, 42, 43]}
