Required due to the presence of existing utilities or other easements.\nV. Based on design considerations associated with the provision of public space in excess of the minimum requirements, and/or in support of a walkable public realm.\nT.\nMass Variation. Mass variation is the way the form and shape of a building changes to establish a sense of human scale. This may be achieved by changing the heights of different parts of\na\nbuilding and by creating offsets in wall planes to express individual building modules. All buildings four stories in height or greater shall have a reduced upper story floor plate area as specified for\nthe Subdistrict. Further, building facades of buildings four stories in height or greater along all frontages designated by Type A, B, C or E shall meet either the building step back requirement or the\nmodule offset requirement, as specified for the Subdistrict. A building three stories in height or less is not subject to the above. Frontage designations are as shown on the Regulating Plan (Section\n3.11.2.2) or assigned by the town manager.\n1. Upper Story Floor Plate Area. The maximum upper story floor plate area shall be based on the conditioned floor area measured for the ground story and applies at the fourth story and above.\nWhere multiple stories are subject to the floor plate area requirement, both an average upper story and maximum upper story floor plate area apply.\na.\nBonus. An upper story bonus is permitted for a building or a site that includes a non-residential use as listed in the Permitted Use Table under 3.11.3.4. Where non-residential square\nfootage is required under Section 3.11.3.5.A.4, the bonus described in this subsection is only available for square footage that exceeds the minimum required. For each square foot of non-\nresidential use provided, the floor plate area of an upper story may increase by one (1) square foot in excess of the average upper story and maximum upper story floor plate, subject to\nprovision of a twenty (20) foot building step back in accordance with Section 3.11.2.7.T.2.b.\n2.\nBuilding Step Back. The building step back shall be measured as the horizontal change in the building wall plane, perpendicular to the applicable frontage or property line.\na.\nIn addition to applicable frontages, a ten (10) foot building step back above the second or third floor is also required for buildings four (4) stories or greater at the boundary of the Form\nDistrict.\nb. A twenty (20) foot building step back above the second or third floor is required for the primary street frontage of a building that utilizes an upper story bonus in accordance with Section\n3.11.2.7.T.1.a. A building fa\u00e7ade located outside of the build-to zone remains subject to this requirement.\nC. A building step back is not required where a street-facing fa\u00e7ade is located at the maximum setback line or outside of the maximum setback, and is not the primary frontage of a building\nthat utilizes an upper story bonus, or where a building fa\u00e7ade facing the Form District boundary is located more than twenty (20) feet from the boundary.\n3. Module Offset. The module offset shall be measured as the horizontal change of a portion of the building wall plane at ground level, perpendicular to the applicable frontage. The module\nwidth shall be measured for the portion of the wall plane closer to the sidewalk, while the width of offset shall be measured for the portion further from the sidewalk. The dimensions of\nmodules and offsets should maintain a sense of proportion to the building as a whole.\na. Offset areas may count towards a build-to zone requirement when the area meets the criteria for a forecourt, outdoor amenity space, or outdoor dining area.\nb.\nA module offset is not required where a building fa\u00e7ade is located at the maximum setback line or outside of the maximum setback.\n4.\nThe Community Design Commission may approve a design alternative for mass variation, where a building exhibits varied heights, smaller building masses and/or articulated facades that\nprovide a positive visual impact and a sense of scale in the public realm.\nU. Building Footprint, Width, and Depth.\n1. Maximum Building Dimensions.\na.\nMaximum building width and secondary wing width are measured parallel to the primary frontage for each site.\nb. Maximum building depth and secondary wing depth are measured perpendicular to the primary frontage for each site, and apply to side facades. A building and wing must adjoin portions\nof the public realm for the full measurement of their depth.\nC.\nA secondary wing, if included, shall be appended to the rear of the building to create an extension of the building's depth. The wing may not be configured to increase the maximum\nbuilding width. The depth of the wing shall be measured starting at the point where the building footprint exceeds the baseline maximum depth.\nd.

Where pedestrian connectivity requirements are met through spaces between buildings, any portions meeting all requirements of this section 3.11.2.7.F.4 may qualify as outdoor amenity\nspace.\nf. Outdoor amenity space cannot be parked or driven upon, except for emergency access and permitted temporary events.\ng. Outdoor amenity spaces may include but not be limited to:\ni. Facilities such as a playground, sport court, dog park, garden, community garden, park, green, pavilion, seating area plaza or water feature\nii. Areas used to meet minimum tree canopy coverage as required under Section 5.7.2 for applications that require Council approval.\nh. Outdoor amenity space expressly does not include:\ni. Any streetscape components located within the public right-of-way; and\nii. Any landscaping internal to or screening a parking lot.\ni. The requirement for outdoor amenity space may also be met by means of a design alternative approved by the Community Design Commission where the space is located on a parcel\nother than the subject property, no further than eight hundred (800) feet from the subject parcel and within the boundaries of the Blue Hill District. This provision is intended to allow the\naggregation of outdoor amenity space to create larger, publically accessible areas.\nG. Recreation space.\n1.\nIn general. Active, improved outdoor space must be provided for common active recreational use by residents of multifamily or mixed use developments.\n2. Fee alternative. In lieu of providing recreation space, an applicant may, with the approval of the town manager, make a payment to the town whereby the town may acquire or develop\nrecreation land or greenways to serve the development. A minimum of fifty (50) percent of the required recreation space must be met through a payment in lieu. The amount of the payment\nis the product of the amount of recreational space required multiplied by a dollar amount established by the town council annually as part of the budget process. The applicant must make the\npayment before issuance of a Form District permit, provided, however, that the town manager may allow phasing of payments consistent with the approved phasing of the development.\n3. Greenway alternative. Form District development applications for sites that include any land which overlaps a portion of a proposed greenway shown on the town's adopted Greenway Master\nPlan must be designed to accommodate the extension of that greenway in accordance with the Greenway Master Plan. A developer's financial obligation to contribute to the dedication and\nconstruction of the greenway is based on the formulas for calculation of amenity space and recreation space provided in section 3.11.2.7. Land dedicated for a public pedestrian and non-\nmotorized vehicle easement or deeded to the town along the greenway may be substituted for required improved outdoor amenity or recreation space, where deemed acceptable by the\ntown manager.\n4. Standards.\na. The minimum size of active recreation space is the number of square feet derived by multiplying gross land area of the development by the applicable ratio shown for the zoning district\nand building height. Where a development contains residential and nonresidential uses, this standard applies only to the residential portion of the building. The land area used for\napplying the ratio described above is calculated based on the proportion of residential floor area.\nb. Recreation space not provided as a Fee or Greenway Alternative shall be provided on-site at ground level, at the perimeter lot line of the site.\nC. Recreation space shall be unobstructed above by any building elements. Canopies, coverings, or other roofs incidental to the intended use or purpose of the recreation space may be\nconsidered as unobstructed above.\nd. A pedestrian connection shall be provided between a recreation space and an adjoining public sidewalk or greenway.\ne.\nA pedestrian connection shall be provided between a recreation space and at least one area provided for outdoor amenity space.\nH. Building setbacks.\n1. There are three types of building setbacks-front, side interior and rear.\n2. Front setbacks are measured from the edge of the nearest right-of-way line.\n3.\nSide interior setbacks are measured from the side property line or the edge of the right-of-way where applicable.\n4. Rear setbacks are measured from the rear property line or the edge of the right-of-way where applicable.\n5. When the side interior or rear setback is zero (0) or five (5) feet, the building or structure must be placed on the side or rear property line or be placed a minimum of five (5) feet from the side\nor rear property line or the edge of the right-of-way line where applicable.\n6. The town manager will determine the application of front, side and rear setbacks to any irregularly-shaped lot.\nI. Build-to Requirements.\n1.\nThe build-to zone is the area on the lot where a certain percentage of the front building fa\u00e7ade must be located, measured as a minimum and maximum setback range from the edge of the\nright-of-way.\n2. The required percentage specifies the amount of the front building fa\u00e7ade that must be located in the build-to zone, measured based on the width of the building divided by the buildable\nwidth of the lot and applied as follows:\na. On a lot developed according to the Conventional conditions, the required build-to percentage applies to the primary Frontage. On a corner lot, the required build-to percentage\nadditionally applies to the continuation of the Frontage for a minimum of seventy-five (75) feet around the corner, in accordance with Section 3.11.2.1.D.7. For additional principal\nstructures along secondary Frontages, the street-facing building fa\u00e7ade(s) must meet the maximum setback requirement for at least two-thirds (2/3) of the fa\u00e7ade width.\nb.\nOn a lot developed according to the Enhanced Development conditions, the required build-to percentage applies to all Frontages. Secondary Frontages may have a reduced percentage in\naccordance with Section 3.11.2.1.D.7.\n3.\n66 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 67\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nOn a Type A Frontage on a corner lot, a building fa\u00e7ade, outdoor amenity space, outdoor dining area, and/or building element must be placed to meet the maximum setback requirement for the first thirty\n(30) feet along the street extending from the block corner, measured from the intersection of the two (2) right-of-way lines.\n4.\nOutdoor seating and dining areas may qualify as building fa\u00e7ade for the purpose of meeting the build-to requirement provided that the following standards are met:\na. The front building fa\u00e7ade is located no more than ten (10) feet behind the maximum street setback;\nb. The outdoor seating and dining area is no more than two-thirds (2/3) the width of the building.\nC. The outdoor seating and dining area is no more than sixteen (16) feet deep; and\nd. The seating area is separated from the sidewalk by a wall or fence no higher than four (4) feet above the sidewalk.\n5. Structured parking may count towards meeting the build-to requirement only where ground story conditioned space is provided for at least the first thirty (30) feet of the structured parking\nmeasured inward from the interior wall of a street-facing fa\u00e7ade.\nJ. Setback encroachments. All buildings and structures must be located at or behind required setbacks, except as listed below. Unless specifically stated no building or structure can extend into a\nrequired setback or public right-of-way.\n1. Building features.\na. Porches, stoops, balconies, galleries and lawnings/canopies can extend into a required setback under section 3.11.2.6.\nb. Building leaves, roof overhangs, gutters, downspouts, light shelves, bay windows and oriels less than ten (10) feet wide and cornices, belt courses, sills, buttresses or other similar\narchitectural features may encroach up to two (2) feet into a required setback.\nC.\nLow impact stormwater management features may encroach into the first two (2) feet of the minimum front setback. The features may include, but are not limited to:\ni. Rain barrels or cisterns, six (6) feet or less in height;\nii. Planter boxes;\niii. Bioretention areas; and\niv. Similar features, as determined by the town manager.\nd. Low impact stormwater management features listed above may encroach into a side interior or rear setback, provided such extension is at least two (2) feet from the vertical plane of any\nlot line.\ne. Unenclosed patios, decks or terraces may encroach into a side interior or rear setback, provided that such extension is at least two (2) feet from the vertical plane of any lot line.\nf. Handicap ramps may encroach to the extent necessary to perform their proper function.\ng. Structures below and covered by the ground may encroach into a required setback.\n2. Mechanical equipment and utility lines.\na.\nMechanical equipment associated with residential uses, such as HVAC units and security lighting, may encroach into a side interior or rear setback, provided that such extension is at least\nthree (3) feet from the vertical plane of any lot line.\nb. Minor structures accessory to utilities (such as hydrants, manholes, and transformers and other cabinet structures) may encroach into a side interior or rear setback.\nC. Mechanical equipment and utility lines below and covered by the ground may encroach into any required setback.\nd. Aboveground mechanical equipment and minor structures shall not be placed within ten (10) feet of a sidewalk for a Type A or a Type B street frontage, unless the town manager approves\nan alternative proposal that demonstrates compliance to the maximum extent feasible with the intent of this section.\n3. Other setback encroachments.\na. Fences and walls permitted in section 3.11.4.2.G.\nb. Signs permitted in section 5.14.\nK. Building height.\n1. Building height is measured in both the number of stories and in feet. Building height is the vertical distance from the average grade at the foundation to the highest portion of the structure\nPitched Roof\nFlat Roof\nMax 6'\nParapet Wall\nTop of Roof\nAverage Grade\n2. Average grade is determined by calculating the average of the highest and lowest elevation along natural or improved grade (whichever is more restrictive) along the front of the building\nparallel to the primary street setback line.\nBuilding Height\nHighest Elevation.\nElevations\nLowest\nFront Building\n3. Where a lot slopes downward from the front property line, one story that is additional to the specified maximum number of stories may be built on the lower, rear portion of the lot.\n67 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 68\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nStreet\n4. An attic does not count as a story where fifty (50) percent or more of the attic floor area has a clear height of less than seven and one-half (71/2) feet; measured from the finished floor to the\nfinished ceiling.\n5. A basement with fifty (50) percent or more of its perimeter wall area surrounded by natural grade is not considered a story.\nL. Height encroachments. Any height encroachment not specifically listed is expressly prohibited except where the town manager determines that the encroachment is similar to a permitted\nencroachment listed below.\n1. The maximum height limits do not apply to spires, belfries, cupolas, domes not intended for human occupancy; monuments, water tanks/towers or other similar structures which, by design or\nfunction, must exceed the established height limits.\n2.\nThe following accessory structures may exceed the established height limit of the district provided they do not exceed the maximum height by more than fifteen (15) percent of the maximum\nheight limitation that defines the portion of the building envelope penetrated by such structures:\na. Chimney, flue or vent stack, spire, smokestack, water tank, windmill;\nb. Rooftop deck, patio, shade structure;\nC. Monument, steeple, flagpole;\nd.

Elevator or stairway access to roof;\nb. Greenhouse; and\nC. Mechanical equipment.\n4. An accessory structure located on the roof must not be used for any purpose other than a use incidental to the principal use of the building.\nM. Story height.\n1. Story height is the height of each story of building and it is measured from the top of the finished floor to the ceiling above.\n2. Minimum ground story height applies to the first thirty (30) feet of the building measured inward from the interior wall of a street-facing fa\u00e7ade. At least fifty (50) percent of the ground story\nmust meet the minimum height provisions.\n3. At least eighty (80) percent of each upper story must meet the minimum upper story height provisions.\nmax. 20%\nunder min. height\n30ft min.\nmax 50%\nunder min. height\nN. Ground floor elevation.\n1. Ground floor elevation is the height of the ground floor relative to the height of the sidewalk and it is measured from top of the abutting curb to the top of the finished ground floor.\n2. Minimum ground floor elevation applies to the first twenty (20) feet of the lot measured from the right-of-way line.\nGround Floor\nElevation\nTop Curb\nO. Transparency.\n1. Transparency is the minimum percentage of windows and doors that must cover a ground or upper story fa\u00e7ade. Transparency is required for any building fa\u00e7ade facing a street.\n2. The transparency requirement on ground story fa\u00e7ades is measured between two (2) and ten (10) feet above the adjacent sidewalk.\n3. The transparency requirement on upper story fa\u00e7ades is measured from the top of the finished floor to the top of the finished floor above. When there is no floor above, upper story\ntransparency is measured from the top of the finished floor to the top of the wall plate.\n4.

District Character.\n3.11.2.1. Districts and Frontages.\nA. District summary. The Blue Hill District is a vital node of living, shopping and working, centrally located between downtown Chapel Hill and Durham. The Form District ensures that this essential\nhub is able to reach its full potential as both a destination and a community. The regulations support residential and mixed uses at varying levels of intensity, all of which will combine to foster a\nlively and engaging street environment easily accessible to pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders and automobile users.\nB. District intent. This Form District is intended to implement the Ephesus Church Road/Fordham Boulevard Small Area Plan. Specifically, the Blue Hill District provides the implementation\nmechanism for the citizen-endorsed vision for the project area, which is a more dense, walkable urban environment with balanced access for all modes of travel.\nC. Subdistricts established. In order to implement the vision of the Ephesus Church Road/Fordham Boulevard Focus Area Plan, the following subdistricts have been established and are depicted on\nthe Regulating Plan in section 3.11.2.2.\n1. Walkable Residential (WR-). The Walkable Residential Subdistrict is intended to create residential neighborhoods with a mix of housing types, together with civic buildings and open space\nessential to creating neighborhoods. The Walkable Residential Subdistricts are differentiated by the maximum building height permitted.\na. WR-3: maximum height limit of three (3) stories (forty-five (45) feet).\nb. WR-7: maximum height limit of seven (7) stories (ninety (90) feet).\nD.\nFrontages established. Frontages are established in this code to apply certain standards for development along all thoroughfares in the district, both existing and proposed. All public\nthoroughfare frontages shall be assigned one of the frontage types defined in this code.\n1. Type A Frontage. The Type A Frontage is intended for areas where the highest level of walkability is desired. The Frontage creates a \"main street\" environment with buildings pulled up to the\nstreet edge. Type A frontage is differentiated into Type A-1, Type A-2, and Type A-3 to provide three different levels of build-to-zone coverage, sidewalk width, and setback criteria. Type A\nfrontages are generally appropriate for Collector Streets, Local Streets, and District Streets.\n2. Type B Frontage. The Type B Frontage is intended for areas adjacent to major streets where pushing buildings back creates a quiet pedestrian setting at the building. While buildings are\nallowed to be pulled up to the street edge, they may also be set back behind one or two rows of head-in or angle parking served by a single drive aisle.\n3. Type C Frontage. Streets with significant traffic volumes that are not conducive to sustained pedestrian activity have been designated with a Type C Frontage.\n52 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 53\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n4. Type D Frontage. The Type D Frontage is appropriate for Alleys that are shared between sites and provide residents and businesses access to garages, parking decks, loading docks and service\nareas. An alley used to satisfy the maximum block length requirement shall meet the assigned frontage requirement.\n5. Type E Frontage. The Type E Frontage is intended for non-vehicular thoroughfares where development fronts on a multiuse path corridor and/or a significant natural feature.\n6. The Regulating Plan shows assigned frontages for existing streets and some proposed streets in the district. Frontages along all new thoroughfares west of Fordham Boulevard not otherwise\nshown in the Regulating Plan are assigned as Type A-1. Frontages along all new thoroughfares south of Europa Drive, least of 15-501, and north of Ephesus Church Road not otherwise shown\nin the Regulating Plan are assigned as Type A-1. Frontages along all new thoroughfares south of Ephesus Church Road and east of Fordham Boulevard not otherwise identified in the\nRegulating Plan are assigned as Type A-2. Frontages along any new thoroughfares north of Europa Drive not otherwise identified in the Regulating Plan are assigned as Type A-2.\nFor new thoroughfares not shown on the Regulating Plan, the town manager may assign a different frontage other than what is described in the preceding paragraph where one of the\nfollowing applies:\na. Because there are Type A-1 and/or Type A-2 Frontages on other sides of the development parcel;\nb. To protect sensitive natural areas or save healthy existing trees;\nC. To protect natural conditions, such as watercourses, riparian buffers, natural rock formations or topography;\nd. Due to the presence of existing utilities or other easements;\ne. For traffic safety, site distance considerations, intersection spacing, or intersection alignment and/or adequate site distance;\nf. Because there are no other options for ingress and egress;\ng. To provide greater consistency with pedestrian infrastructure, building placement and/or streetscape on adjoining lots and/or the opposite side of the street; or\nh. Because an alternative designation of frontage would promote greater consistency with the overall objectives of the district.\n7. Corner lot application of frontage.\na. Where a corner lot has two different assigned frontages, the more restrictive frontage requirement shall apply to the assigned frontage, and must be continued for a minimum of seventy-\nfive (75) feet around the corner, measured from the intersection of the two (2) right-of-way lines.\nb. Where a corner lot has the same assigned frontage on two (2) or more sides, the town manager shall designate one (1) side of the lot as the primary frontage where one (1) of the following\napplies:\ni. To provide greater consistency with pedestrian infrastructure, building placement and/or streetscape on adjoining lots and/or the opposite side of the street.\nii. Because of a condition where a longer frontage on a development parcel promotes consistent pedestrian character; or\niii. Because the frontage designation would promote greater walkability and support the overall objectives of the district as described in section 3.11.1.\nThe assigned frontage requirements shall apply to that primary frontage, and must be continued along all other frontages for a minimum of seventy-five (75) feet around the corner,\nmeasured from the intersection of the two (2) right-of-way lines.\nC. Any frontages not designated as the primary frontage shall be deemed secondary lot frontages, and shall meet at least one half (1/2) of the minimum Build-to-zone percentage requirement\nof the underlying frontages unless a design alternative is approved by the community design commission.\n3.11.2.2. Regulating Plan.\nThe Walkable Residential (WR-), Walkable Mixed Use (WX-) subdistricts are identified and located on the Town of Chapel Hill Official Zoning Map. The Regulating Plan is intended to show the general areas\nof\neach subdistrict and associated road frontage(s). Additional street right-of-way or public easement may be required at the time of development, in accordance with the Ephesus Church/Fordham\nBoulevard Small Area Plan, the Ephesus Fordham District Illustrative Block Studies, the Ephesus Fordham sections of the Mobility and Connectivity Plan and this section 3.11.\n-\nFrontage\n[The image of the map above is revised to show a Type A-2 frontage in (purple) along the north side of Franklin Street, the south side of Legion Road extension, the north side of Legion Road, both\nsides of Europa Drive and both sides of the new/proposed street that crosses Elliott Road extending from Franklin Street eastward to the new/proposed street that parallels the Booker Creek\ngreenway.

Design Considerations.\na. Pedestrian routes serving to meet Pedestrian Connectivity requirements shall be adequately lit as per Section 3.11.4.5. (Site Lighting), with 0.5 (min) and 15.0 (max) foot candles at any\npoint.\nb. Building elements and structures used for shade purposes may be provided within the minimum required space between buildings, so long as pedestrian access is maintained.\nC. Unenclosed overhead walkways may be provided to connect one building to another or to structured parking, so long as the walkway maintains a clear height above the pedestrian\nthrough access of at least twelve (12) feet.\n4. Pedestrian Connectivity Spacing.\na. The maximum pedestrian connectivity spacing may be increased by five percent (5%) through an administrative adjustment where one or more of the following applies:\ni. Proposed to protect sensitive natural areas or save healthy existing trees;\nii.\nRequired to protect natural conditions, such as watercourses, riparian buffers, natural rock formations or topography;\niii. Required based on some unusual aspect of the development site or the proposed development that is not shared by landowners generally within the Blue Hill District (e.g., unusual lot\nsize or configuration);\niv. Required due to the presence of existing utilities or other easements; or\nV. Proposed because there are no other options for ingress and egress.\nvi. Where an administrative adjustment to building size has been granted for maximum building width or depth in a corresponding location.\nb.\nWhere the Community Design Commission makes a finding that a proposed design alternative for pedestrian connectivity will provide access that at a minimum meets the purpose or\nintent of Section 3.11.2.1.B and where one or more of the site constraints listed below applies, the Community Design Commission may approve alternatively designed pedestrian\nconnectivity spacing up to the maximum allowable block length as part of a Certificate of Appropriateness:\ni. Proposed to protect sensitive natural areas or save healthy existing trees;\nii. Required to protect natural conditions, such as watercourses, riparian buffers, natural rock formations or topography;\niii.\nRequired based on some unusual aspect of the development site or the proposed development that is not shared by landowners generally within the Blue Hill District (e.g., unusual lot\nsize or configuration); or\niv. Required due to the presence of existing utilities or other easements.\nV. Based on design considerations associated with the provision of public space in excess of the minimum requirements, and/or in support of a walkable public realm.\nT.\nMass Variation. Mass variation is the way the form and shape of a building changes to establish a sense of human scale. This may be achieved by changing the heights of different parts of\na\nbuilding and by creating offsets in wall planes to express individual building modules. All buildings four stories in height or greater shall have a reduced upper story floor plate area as specified for\nthe Subdistrict. Further, building facades of buildings four stories in height or greater along all frontages designated by Type A, B, C or E shall meet either the building step back requirement or the\nmodule offset requirement, as specified for the Subdistrict. A building three stories in height or less is not subject to the above. Frontage designations are as shown on the Regulating Plan (Section\n3.11.2.2) or assigned by the town manager.\n1. Upper Story Floor Plate Area. The maximum upper story floor plate area shall be based on the conditioned floor area measured for the ground story and applies at the fourth story and above.\nWhere multiple stories are subject to the floor plate area requirement, both an average upper story and maximum upper story floor plate area apply.\na.\nBonus. An upper story bonus is permitted for a building or a site that includes a non-residential use as listed in the Permitted Use Table under 3.11.3.4. Where non-residential square\nfootage is required under Section 3.11.3.5.A.4, the bonus described in this subsection is only available for square footage that exceeds the minimum required. For each square foot of non-\nresidential use provided, the floor plate area of an upper story may increase by one (1) square foot in excess of the average upper story and maximum upper story floor plate, subject to\nprovision of a twenty (20) foot building step back in accordance with Section 3.11.2.7.T.2.b.\n2.\nBuilding Step Back. The building step back shall be measured as the horizontal change in the building wall plane, perpendicular to the applicable frontage or property line.\na.\nIn addition to applicable frontages, a ten (10) foot building step back above the second or third floor is also required for buildings four (4) stories or greater at the boundary of the Form\nDistrict.\nb. A twenty (20) foot building step back above the second or third floor is required for the primary street frontage of a building that utilizes an upper story bonus in accordance with Section\n3.11.2.7.T.1.a. A building fa\u00e7ade located outside of the build-to zone remains subject to this requirement.\nC. A building step back is not required where a street-facing fa\u00e7ade is located at the maximum setback line or outside of the maximum setback, and is not the primary frontage of a building\nthat utilizes an upper story bonus, or where a building fa\u00e7ade facing the Form District boundary is located more than twenty (20) feet from the boundary.\n3. Module Offset. The module offset shall be measured as the horizontal change of a portion of the building wall plane at ground level, perpendicular to the applicable frontage. The module\nwidth shall be measured for the portion of the wall plane closer to the sidewalk, while the width of offset shall be measured for the portion further from the sidewalk. The dimensions of\nmodules and offsets should maintain a sense of proportion to the building as a whole.\na. Offset areas may count towards a build-to zone requirement when the area meets the criteria for a forecourt, outdoor amenity space, or outdoor dining area.\nb.\nA module offset is not required where a building fa\u00e7ade is located at the maximum setback line or outside of the maximum setback.\n4.\nThe Community Design Commission may approve a design alternative for mass variation, where a building exhibits varied heights, smaller building masses and/or articulated facades that\nprovide a positive visual impact and a sense of scale in the public realm.\nU. Building Footprint, Width, and Depth.\n1. Maximum Building Dimensions.\na.\nMaximum building width and secondary wing width are measured parallel to the primary frontage for each site.\nb. Maximum building depth and secondary wing depth are measured perpendicular to the primary frontage for each site, and apply to side facades. A building and wing must adjoin portions\nof the public realm for the full measurement of their depth.\nC.\nA secondary wing, if included, shall be appended to the rear of the building to create an extension of the building's depth. The wing may not be configured to increase the maximum\nbuilding width. The depth of the wing shall be measured starting at the point where the building footprint exceeds the baseline maximum depth.\nd. A Wrapped Parking Configuration is one where the building is integrated with structured parking and where the building fully screens at least two (2) sides of the parking structure from\nview as follows:\n70 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 71\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\ni.\nthe building shall fully screen the side along the primary frontage.\nii. where the site has additional frontages, the building shall fully screen at least one other side along a frontage.\niii. if the above are not met, the footprint must meet the standards of a different Building Configuration.\ne. The maximum dimensions for Structured Parking are applicable to any configuration of structured parking, including standalone, wrapped, and podium configurations, except that the\ndimensions are not applicable to portions of the structured parking below grade.\nf.\nThe maximum building width and/or depth may be increased by five percent (5%) through an administrative adjustment where one or more of the following applies:\ni. Based on some unusual aspect of the development site or the proposed development that is not shared by landowners generally within the Blue Hill district (e.g., unusual lot size,\nconfiguration, or surrounding parcelization patterns);\nii. Based on design considerations due to existing or proposed utilities or easements;\niii. Based on design considerations for the accommodation of life safety, ingress or egress requirements.\niv. Based on design considerations associated with the provision of public space in excess of the minimum requirements, and/or in support of a walkable public realm.\n2. Building Separation.\na. Multiple buildings may be constructed on a lot provided that each building or aggregation of buildings meets the maximum building dimensions.\nb.\nWhere required, the minimum separation between two (2) buildings on a lot shall be the distance between building facades measured parallel to the street frontage.\nC.\nUnbuilt area used to meet building separation requirements shall be configured for Pedestrian Connectivity as defined in section 3.11.2.7.S.\nd. Service drives and vehicular access may be provided between buildings. The roadway width shall not count towards meeting the minimum building separation unless the town manager\ndetermines that it functions effectively as shared pedestrian-vehicular space.\ne. Multiple buildings arranged such that their combined width and/or depth does not exceed the maximum applicable dimensions shall not be subject to Building Separation requirements.\n3.11.2.8 Conventional Development.\nDevelopment in the Form District that meets the Conventional conditions as specified in Section 3.11.1.2.C. shall be subject to the following standards:\n1. Lot\nA\nOutdoor amenity space is a ratio of net land area.\nRecreation space, Residential density, and Floor area ratio are ratios of gross land area.\n2.
