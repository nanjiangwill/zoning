The district allows duplexes, live/work\nunits, single-family attached, and single-family detached\ndwellings, but does not allow mobile homes, manufactured\nhomes, or conservation subdivisions. As a means of creating\nVillage\ncompact, functional neighborhoods, the district also allows a wide\nvariety of institutional uses, including community centers, day\ncare, schools, assisted living, religious institutions, parks, and\nutilities. Lots served by public sewer may have reduced minimum\nlot sizes and building height is measured from the base flood\nResidential\nelevation. District regulations are intended to support the\nCounty's investment in infrastructure by encouraging the\ndevelopment of compact, vibrant neighborhoods with a variety of\nhouse sizes and types that are located in close proximity to\ncomplementary institutional uses. Low density development\ncomprised of uniform building types or styles is discouraged.\nCamden County\nUnified Development Ordinance\n3-30\nLast Updated:\nAugust 1, 2022\nCELL (1, 1): \nB.\nCELL (1, 2): \nDimensional Requirements\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (2, 1): \n#\nCELL (2, 2): \nSTANDARD TYPE\nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nREQUIREMENT\nCELL (2, 5): \nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (3, 3): \nSINGLE-FAMILY\nDETACHED\nCELL (3, 4): \nALL OTHER\nRESIDENTIAL\nCELL (3, 5): \nNON-\nRESIDENTIAL\nCELL (4, 1): \nA\nCELL (4, 2): \nMaximum Residential Density (units/acre)\nCELL (4, 3): \nCELL (4, 4): \n1.45 [1]\nCELL (4, 5): \nN/A\nCELL (5, 1): \nB\nCELL (5, 2): \nMinimum Lot Area (square feet)\nCELL (5, 3): \n30,000 [2]\nCELL (5, 4): \n15,000 per unit [3]\nCELL (5, 5): \n30,000\nCELL (6, 1): \nC\nCELL (6, 2): \nMinimum Lot Width (feet)\nCELL (6, 3): \n100 [4] [5]\nCELL (6, 4): \n100 [6]\nCELL (6, 5): \n125\nCELL (7, 1): \nD\nCELL (7, 2): \nMaximum Lot Coverage (% of lot area)\nCELL (7, 3): \nCELL (7, 4): \n24 [7]\nCELL (7, 5): \nCELL (8, 1): \nE\nCELL (8, 2): \nMinimum Open Space (% of development area)\nCELL (8, 3): \nCELL (8, 4): \n15\nCELL (8, 5): \nCELL (9, 1): \nF\nCELL (9, 2): \nMinimum Front Setback (feet) [8]\nCELL (9, 3): \n20\nCELL (9, 4): \n20 [9]\nCELL (9, 5): \n25\nCELL (10, 1): \nG\nCELL (10, 2): \nMinimum Corner Side Setback (feet) [8]\nCELL (10, 3): \n20\nCELL (10, 4): \n20 [9]\nCELL (10, 5): \n25\nCELL (11, 1): \nH\nCELL (11, 2): \nMinimum Interior Side Setback (feet)\nCELL (11, 3): \n10\nCELL (11, 4): \n10 [9] [10]\nCELL (11, 5): \n15\nCELL (12, 1): \nI\nCELL (12, 2): \nMinimum Rear Setback (feet)\nCELL (12, 3): \n10\nCELL (12, 4): \n10 [9]\nCELL (12, 5): \n15\nCELL (13, 1): \nJ\nCELL (13, 2): \nMinimum Distance Between Buildings, Front-to-Back (feet) [11]\nCELL (13, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (13, 4): \n30\nCELL (13, 5): \nCELL (14, 1): \nK\nCELL (14, 2): \nMinimum Distance Between Buildings, Side-to-Side (feet) [11]\nCELL (14, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (14, 4): \n15\nCELL (14, 5): \nCELL (15, 1): \nL\nCELL (15, 2): \nMinimum Accessory Building Setback (feet)\nCELL (15, 3): \nCELL (15, 4): \n8\nCELL (15, 5): \n10\nCELL (16, 1): \nM\nCELL (16, 2): \nMaximum Building Height (feet)\nCELL (16, 3): \nCELL (16, 4): \n35 [12]\nCELL (16, 5): \n\nNEW PAGE 121\nARTICLE 151.3 Zoning Districts\nSection 3.5 Residential Districts\n3.5.6 Village Residential (VR) District\nNOTES:\n[1] Maximum residential density may be increased to 4.35 units per acre on lots served by public sewer.\n[2] Minimum lot area may be reduced to 10,000 square feet on lots served by public sewer.\n[3] Minimum lot area may be reduced to 8,000 square feet on lots served by public sewer.\n[4] Lots on a cul-de-sac street shall maintain a minimum frontage of 35 feet and shall maintain 80 percent of the required minimum lot width at a\npoint located 50 feet from the street right-of-way edge.\n[5] May be reduced to 75 feet on lots on lots served by public sewer and located within 5,280 feet from a designated village center boundary.\n[6] Applied to the entire development or parent parcel.

This is done in order to:\nA.\nConserve open land, including those areas containing productive agricultural soils, unique and sensitive natural\nfeatures such as floodplains, wetlands, river and stream corridors, areas with mature hardwood trees, and\nwatersheds;\nB.\nPromote existing rural character particularly in areas visible from major roadways in the County;\nC.\nRetain and protect existing environmental, natural, and cultural resources;\nD.\nCreate a linked network of open lands; and\nE.\nProvide reasonable economic use of the land.\nFIGURE 6.5.1: CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION\nMON\nLEGEND\nLot Line\nPrivate Road\nTrail\nWoodland\nFarmland\n6.5.2.\nAPPLICABILITY\nA.\nType of Development\nThis conservation subdivision option shall be limited to development of single-family detached residential dwellings\non individual lots in subdivisions of more than five lots.
