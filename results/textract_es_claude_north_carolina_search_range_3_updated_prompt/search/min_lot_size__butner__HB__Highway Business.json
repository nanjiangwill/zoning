The location of required front, side, and rear yards\non irregularly shaped lots shall be determined by the Ordinance Administrator. Such determination\nshall be based on the spirit and intent of this ordinance in order to achieve an appropriate spacing\nand location of buildings and structures on individual lots.\n6.7.7 Allowable yard encroachments for residential use. Building features and architectural\nelements may encroach into required yards or setbacks only in accordance with the following\nstandards.\n(A) Balconies, stoops, open porches, bay windows, steps, mechanical units, raised doorways,\nand similar architectural features are permitted to encroach into a setback a maximum of four feet.\n(B) First floor encroachments shall not extend into the right-of-way.\n(C) Side yard encroachments shall not be closer than five feet to a lot line.\n6.7.8 Height limitation exceptions. The height limitations of this ordinance shall not apply to\nspires, belfries, cupolas, and domes not intended for residential purposes, nor to monuments,\nwater towers, observation towers, power transmission towers, chimneys, elevator shaft enclosures,\nflag poles, and similar structures, provided such structures meet the required provisions of the\nstate's Building Code.

Principal structures in residential\nzoning districts must be situated in such a manner that their primary entrance faces the primary\nstreet frontage on which they are located.\n6.7.10 Prevailing front setbacks. In the RT and RMX Zoning Districts the prevailing front\nsetback of neighboring developed lots shall be utilized to determine the minimum front setback of\nundeveloped lots which are located on a block face where at least 50% of the lots have been\ndeveloped with a single-family or two-family (duplex) dwelling that was constructed prior to the\neffective date of this ordinance. The minimum front setback shall be defined by establishing the\naverage, or prevailing, front setback of the closest three residential structures on either side of the\nundeveloped lot. In no case shall structures located more than 500 feet from the property line of an\nundeveloped lot be used to establish a prevailing front setback.\n\u00a7 6.8 DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS.\n6.8.1 Purpose. The purpose of this section is to present the dimensional standards for all\nprincipal and accessory structures and uses allowed in this ordinance. These standards may be\nfurther modified by other requirements found in other articles where applicable.\n6.8.2 Dimensional standards table.
