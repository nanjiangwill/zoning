Building Placement, Parking, and Vehicle Access.\n(1.) Buildings will range from 10' to 18' behind the street curb-line in Mixed Use\n(\"MU\"), Main Street (\"MS\"), and \"TNDO\" districts. Within the limits described\nabove, front setbacks will vary depending upon site conditions. Special site\nconditions such as topography, pattern of lot widths, or setbacks of existing\nbuildings on the same block permit a larger setback. Setbacks should be used in a\nmanner that encourages pedestrian activity. For example, squares or spatially\ndefined plazas within building setback areas can act as focal points for\npedestrians.\n(a.) Corners: Setback at street corners will generally replicate frontage conditions.\nSide setbacks on a minor residential street may be less than the front\ndimension.\n(2.) Side and rear setbacks will vary according to side and rear buffer requirements as\nset forth in Article 11, with a minimum 0-foot setback when no buffer is required.\n(3.) Front and rear building facades shall be generally parallel to frontage property\nlines. The fa\u00e7ade shall be determined by the massing of the building. Buildings\nin all locations should relate the principal fa\u00e7ade to the sidewalk and public space\nof the street.\n(4.) Parking shall be located primarily to the rear of the building; side-yard parking\nshall occupy no more than 35% of the primary frontage line and shall not be\nplaced in any side-yard abutting an intersecting street. Where dimensions of\nexisting lots restrict parking behind buildings, the limitations on side-yard parking\nmay be modified.\n(5.) Hedges, garden walls, or knee walls may be built on property lines or as the\ncontinuation of building walls. A garden wall, hedge or knee wall a minimum 2.5'\nin height, maximum 3.5' in height, shall be installed along any street frontage\nadjacent to parking areas. Knee walls should be built of brick, stone or other\ndecorative masonry material, or should be built of wrought iron or other\ndecorative metal, and shall generally match the architectural style of Chadbourn.\n(6.)

Building facades at street frontage lines shall be pedestrian oriented and of\npedestrian scale. The building's design shall promote pedestrian activity and\npedestrian-driven commerce. The sidewalk shall be an extension of the street\nlevel businesses' operations. As such, pedestrians should be able to preview\nbusinesses' merchandise and/or dine from the sidewalk.

For buildings with flat roofs, building height shall be measured as the vertical\ndistance from the mean elevation of the existing grade to the highest finished roof\nsurface. The height of parapet walls is not counted in the building height\ncalculations and may vary depending upon the need to screen mechanical\nequipment.\n(2.) For buildings with pitched roofs, building heights shall be measured as the\nvertical distance from the mean elevation of the finished grade to a point\nrepresenting the midpoint of the peak and leave heights.\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 26\n\nNEW PAGE 210\n(3.) Building height to the ridge may vary depending on the roof pitch.\n(4.) Buildings shall have no less than 2 stories.

Each building should be designed to form part of a larger composition of the\narea in which it is situated. Adjacent buildings should thus be of similar scale,\nheight, and configuration to maintain compatibility with structures within the\nTown.\n(e.) Drive-through customer services, if permitted in the district, must be located\nat the rear of the building or on a side which does not abut a street to maintain\ncompatibility with structures within the Town.\n(f.)
