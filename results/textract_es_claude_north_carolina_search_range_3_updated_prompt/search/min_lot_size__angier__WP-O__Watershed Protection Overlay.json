Conditional zoning districts.\n3.5.1 Purpose.\nA.\nConditional zoning districts are created to correspond to each of the base zoning districts. Conditional\nZoning (CZ) Districts allow specific uses to be established in accordance with prescribed conditions\npertaining to an individual project.\nB.\nThe purpose is to provide a voluntary alternative procedure for the rezoning of a property for a specific\nuse. A broad range of uses are permitted in the base district. However, there are instances where a\nbase zoning district designation is clearly inappropriate for a property, but a specific use or uses\npermitted under this district and subject to development requirements would be consistent with the\nspirit and intent of this ordinance. Conditional zoning districts, herein established, are intended to\naccommodate such situations. This voluntary procedure is intended for firm development proposals,\nand is neither intended nor suited for securing early zoning for tentative uses which may not be\nundertaken for a long period of time.\nC.\nJust as there are nine base zoning districts, there are nine corresponding Conditional Zoning Districts.\n3.5.2 Applicability.\nA.\nProperty may be placed in a Conditional Zoning District only in response to a petition by the owners of\nall the property to be included.\nCreated: 2023-08-11 10:27:33 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 11, Update 1)\nPage 20 of 221\nCELL (1, 1): \nCZ OSR\nCELL (1, 2): \nConditional Zoning Open Space and Recreational\nCELL (2, 1): \nCZ RA-30\nCELL (2, 2): \nConditional Zoning Low Density Residential-Agricultura\nCELL (3, 1): \nCZ R-15\nCELL (3, 2): \nConditional Zoning Low to Medium Density Residential\nCELL (4, 1): \nCZ R-10\nCELL (4, 2): \nConditional Zoning Medium Density Residential\nCELL (5, 1): \nCZ R-6\nCELL (5, 2): \nConditional Zoning High Density Residential\nCELL (6, 1): \nCZ O&I\nCELL (6, 2): \nConditional Zoning Office & Institutional\nCELL (7, 1): \nCZ CB\nCELL (7, 2): \nConditional Zoning Central Business\nCELL (8, 1): \nCZ GC\nCELL (8, 2): \nConditional Zoning General Commercial\nCELL (9, 1): \nCZ CP\nCELL (9, 2): \nConditional Zoning Commerce Park\n\nNEW PAGE 21\nB.\nSpecific conditions applicable to these districts may be proposed by the petitioner or the town or its\nagencies, but only those conditions mutually approved by the town and the petitioner may be\nincorporated into the requirements of the district.

Overlay districts.\nOverlay zoning districts are established to provide land use regulations in addition to those created by the\nbase zoning districts herein. These overlay districts are implemented when necessary due to special circumstances.\nThere are two overlay zoning districts in Angier that provide for the protection of special environmental features of\nthe town, as follows:\n3.6.1 Watershed Protection Overlay (WP-O). The following regulations were adopted April 2005 in\naccordance with the state model ordinance:\n3.6.1.1 Intent.\nA.\nThe purpose of the Watershed Protection Overlay District is to prevent significant future water quality\ndeterioration in existing or potential future drinking water reservoirs and rivers that receive\nstormwater runoff form land within the Town of Angier. Protection of all water supplies within the\nstate, in accordance with minimum standards, was mandated by the Water Supply Watershed\nProtection Act passed by the General Assembly in 1989. The quality of water in drinking water\nreservoirs and rivers can be affected by human activities including farming, obstruction of highways\nand streets, subdivision development, industrial development, and other land disturbing activities.\nTypes of water pollutants resulting from these activities include sediment, bacterial contamination,\nheavy metals, synthetic organic compounds, and low-level radioactivity.\nB.\nThe intent of the Watershed Protection Overlay District is to apply a set of regulations involving land\nuse and, in some cases, structural Best Management Practices (BMP's) that protect the watersheds by\nreducing the pollution from future development that enters the drinking water supplies. Land use\nmanagement practices involve minimum lot sizes, maximum allowed density, and built-upon area\nrestrictions, since built-upon areas such as streets, rooftops, and driveways are a major source of\npollution. Structural Best Management Practices allow for more intensive land uses by providing for\ntemporary detention of stormwater runoff so that pollutants may settle.\nC.\nThe Watershed Protection Overlay District as hereby established overlay other zoning districts\nestablished in this ordinance.

Conditional\nZoning (CZ) Districts allow specific uses to be established in accordance with prescribed conditions\npertaining to an individual project.\nB.\nThe purpose is to provide a voluntary alternative procedure for the rezoning of a property for a specific\nuse. A broad range of uses are permitted in the base district. However, there are instances where a\nbase zoning district designation is clearly inappropriate for a property, but a specific use or uses\npermitted under this district and subject to development requirements would be consistent with the\nspirit and intent of this ordinance. Conditional zoning districts, herein established, are intended to\naccommodate such situations. This voluntary procedure is intended for firm development proposals,\nand is neither intended nor suited for securing early zoning for tentative uses which may not be\nundertaken for a long period of time.\nC.\nJust as there are nine base zoning districts, there are nine corresponding Conditional Zoning Districts.\n3.5.2 Applicability.\nA.\nProperty may be placed in a Conditional Zoning District only in response to a petition by the owners of\nall the property to be included.\nCreated: 2023-08-11 10:27:33 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 11, Update 1)\nPage 20 of 221\nCELL (1, 1): \nCZ OSR\nCELL (1, 2): \nConditional Zoning Open Space and Recreational\nCELL (2, 1): \nCZ RA-30\nCELL (2, 2): \nConditional Zoning Low Density Residential-Agricultura\nCELL (3, 1): \nCZ R-15\nCELL (3, 2): \nConditional Zoning Low to Medium Density Residential\nCELL (4, 1): \nCZ R-10\nCELL (4, 2): \nConditional Zoning Medium Density Residential\nCELL (5, 1): \nCZ R-6\nCELL (5, 2): \nConditional Zoning High Density Residential\nCELL (6, 1): \nCZ O&I\nCELL (6, 2): \nConditional Zoning Office & Institutional\nCELL (7, 1): \nCZ CB\nCELL (7, 2): \nConditional Zoning Central Business\nCELL (8, 1): \nCZ GC\nCELL (8, 2): \nConditional Zoning General Commercial\nCELL (9, 1): \nCZ CP\nCELL (9, 2): \nConditional Zoning Commerce Park\n\nNEW PAGE 21\nB.\nSpecific conditions applicable to these districts may be proposed by the petitioner or the town or its\nagencies, but only those conditions mutually approved by the town and the petitioner may be\nincorporated into the requirements of the district.

Overlay districts.\nOverlay zoning districts are established to provide land use regulations in addition to those created by the\nbase zoning districts herein. These overlay districts are implemented when necessary due to special circumstances.\nThere are two overlay zoning districts in Angier that provide for the protection of special environmental features of\nthe town, as follows:\n3.6.1 Watershed Protection Overlay (WP-O). The following regulations were adopted April 2005 in\naccordance with the state model ordinance:\n3.6.1.1 Intent.\nA.\nThe purpose of the Watershed Protection Overlay District is to prevent significant future water quality\ndeterioration in existing or potential future drinking water reservoirs and rivers that receive\nstormwater runoff form land within the Town of Angier. Protection of all water supplies within the\nstate, in accordance with minimum standards, was mandated by the Water Supply Watershed\nProtection Act passed by the General Assembly in 1989. The quality of water in drinking water\nreservoirs and rivers can be affected by human activities including farming, obstruction of highways\nand streets, subdivision development, industrial development, and other land disturbing activities.\nTypes of water pollutants resulting from these activities include sediment, bacterial contamination,\nheavy metals, synthetic organic compounds, and low-level radioactivity.\nB.\nThe intent of the Watershed Protection Overlay District is to apply a set of regulations involving land\nuse and, in some cases, structural Best Management Practices (BMP's) that protect the watersheds by\nreducing the pollution from future development that enters the drinking water supplies. Land use\nmanagement practices involve minimum lot sizes, maximum allowed density, and built-upon area\nrestrictions, since built-upon areas such as streets, rooftops, and driveways are a major source of\npollution. Structural Best Management Practices allow for more intensive land uses by providing for\ntemporary detention of stormwater runoff so that pollutants may settle.\nC.\nThe Watershed Protection Overlay District as hereby established overlay other zoning districts\nestablished in this ordinance. The new use of any land or new structure within the Watershed\nProtection Overlay District shall comply with the use regulations applicable to the underlying zoning\ndistrict as well as the requirements of the Watershed Protection Overlay District.\nCreated: 2023-08-11 10:27:33 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 11, Update 1)\nPage 21 of 221\nCELL (1, 1): \nWP-O\nCELL (1, 2): \nWatershed Protection Overlay\nCELL (2, 1): \nFDP-O\nCELL (2, 2): \nFlood Damage Prevention Overlay\n\nNEW PAGE 22\nD.\nA Watershed Protection Overlay District will be applied to the Town of Angier's portion of watersheds\nthat have been classified as WS-IV watersheds by the North Carolina Environmental Management\nCommission in its implementation of the Water Supply Watershed Protection Act of 1989.
