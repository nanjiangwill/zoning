Purpose. The purpose of establishing supplementary requirements for development in\ndowntown Pilot Mountain is to protect and enhance the visual character of development and\nto preserve the unique streetscape of downtown by encouraging compatibility among\ndowntown structures. It is not the intent of this overlay district to eliminate architectural\nfreedom or discourage innovative design, but rather to complement the Town of Pilot\nMountain's Development Ordinance and development guidelines for Downtown.\n2.\nApplicability. Buildings within the Downtown Design Overlay (DDO) District exhibit design\nelements that contribute to the unique sense of character of downtown Pilot Mountain.\nSpecifically, buildings tend to have flat or low pitch roofs concealed by the front facade\nparapet, no front or side yard setback, large storefront windows on the street level floor and\nstrong horizontal separations between the first and any upper floors created by windows and/\nor changes in fa\u00e7ade materials.\nIn order to continue and, in some cases, recreate the historic development pattern of\ndowntown Pilot Mountain, the following standards shall apply to all new construction,\nadditions and substantial modifications to existing structures located within the Downtown\nDesign Overlay (DDO) District. For the purposes of this section substantial modification shall\nbe defined as any work which involves the alteration of the building's footprint, construction of\nadditional stories, changes in roof pitch, modification of building fenestration and entryways,\nmaterial changes to the building fa\u00e7ade, or painting.\n3. Exemptions. When in compliance with all other town ordinances, the following types of\nprojects are exempt from the standards of the Downtown Design Overlay (DDO) district:\na. Interior and exterior alterations of buildings that were originally designed and built for\nsingle-family residential use and continue to be used for single-family residential use.\nb. Underground construction which does not consist of any above ground components,\nincluding utility boxes, pipes, poles or similar appurtenant features;\nC. Conducting regular maintenance work on buildings, landscaping, or grounds,\n(including parking lots), which does not significantly alter the appearance or function\nof the building, landscaping or grounds;\nd. Interior remodeling work, which does not involve the alteration of any building\ncomponent that does not alter any exterior building component;\ne. Landscape maintenance and upkeep, excluding the replacement trees;\nf. Temporary uses and structures;\ng. Routine roof maintenance and repair, when using like materials; and\nh. Painting of murals on the side and/or rear fa\u00e7ade of buildings.\n4. Design Standards\n\nNEW PAGE 81\na. Front Build-to Line. The front building wall of each new principal structure within the\nDDO shall be constructed so that at least eighty percent (80%) of the width of the\nprimary facade is set back no more than six (6') feet from the edge of the right-of-way\nof Main Street.

Purpose. The purpose of establishing supplementary requirements for development in\ndowntown Pilot Mountain is to protect and enhance the visual character of development and\nto preserve the unique streetscape of downtown by encouraging compatibility among\ndowntown structures. It is not the intent of this overlay district to eliminate architectural\nfreedom or discourage innovative design, but rather to complement the Town of Pilot\nMountain's Development Ordinance and development guidelines for Downtown.\n2.\nApplicability. Buildings within the Downtown Design Overlay (DDO) District exhibit design\nelements that contribute to the unique sense of character of downtown Pilot Mountain.\nSpecifically, buildings tend to have flat or low pitch roofs concealed by the front facade\nparapet, no front or side yard setback, large storefront windows on the street level floor and\nstrong horizontal separations between the first and any upper floors created by windows and/\nor changes in fa\u00e7ade materials.\nIn order to continue and, in some cases, recreate the historic development pattern of\ndowntown Pilot Mountain, the following standards shall apply to all new construction,\nadditions and substantial modifications to existing structures located within the Downtown\nDesign Overlay (DDO) District. For the purposes of this section substantial modification shall\nbe defined as any work which involves the alteration of the building's footprint, construction of\nadditional stories, changes in roof pitch, modification of building fenestration and entryways,\nmaterial changes to the building fa\u00e7ade, or painting.\n3. Exemptions. When in compliance with all other town ordinances, the following types of\nprojects are exempt from the standards of the Downtown Design Overlay (DDO) district:\na. Interior and exterior alterations of buildings that were originally designed and built for\nsingle-family residential use and continue to be used for single-family residential use.\nb. Underground construction which does not consist of any above ground components,\nincluding utility boxes, pipes, poles or similar appurtenant features;\nC. Conducting regular maintenance work on buildings, landscaping, or grounds,\n(including parking lots), which does not significantly alter the appearance or function\nof the building, landscaping or grounds;\nd. Interior remodeling work, which does not involve the alteration of any building\ncomponent that does not alter any exterior building component;\ne. Landscape maintenance and upkeep, excluding the replacement trees;\nf. Temporary uses and structures;\ng. Routine roof maintenance and repair, when using like materials; and\nh. Painting of murals on the side and/or rear fa\u00e7ade of buildings.\n4.
