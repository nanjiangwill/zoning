Minimum lot sizes are not applicable to single-family cluster\ndevelopments projects; however, the total number of lots shall not exceed the number of lots\nallowed for single-family detached developments. The overall residential density or\nnonresidential built-upon area shall not exceed that allowed for the critical area or the\nbalance of the watershed, whichever is applicable.\n4. Buffer Zone Required\na. A buffer zone for the purposes of this requirement is defined as an area of natural\nor\nplanted vegetation through which storm water runoff flows in a diffuse manner so that\nthe runoff does not become channelized and which provides for infiltration of the\nrunoff and filtering of pollutants. The buffer zone is measured from the normal pool\nelevation of impounded structures and from the bank of each side of streams and\nrivers.\nb. No new development is allowed in the buffer zone, except for water dependent\nstructures and public projects such as road crossings and green ways where no\npractical alternative exists.\nC. These activities should minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff away from the\nsurface waters and maximize the utilization of storm water best management\npractices.\nd. A minimum thirty (30') foot vegetative buffer zone for development activities is\nrequired along all perennial waters indicated on the most recent versions of U.S.G.S.\n1:24,000 (7.5 minute) scale topographic maps or as determined by local government\nstudies, unless a high density option is chosen and then a one-hundred (100') foot\nbuffer zone is required.

WSII-BW (O) WSII-Balance of Watershed (Overlay). The WSII-BW (O) is established as an\noverlay district to impose lower standards in the balance of the watershed area because the\nrisk of water quality degradation from pollution is less than in the critical area of the\nwatershed. The regulations of this district will allow residential uses at a maximum of one (1)\ndwelling unit per acre and non-residential development at twelve percent (12%) built-upon\narea. Projects must minimize built-upon surface area, direct storm water away from surface\nwaters and incorporate Best Management Practices to minimize water quality impacts. Non-\ndischarging landfills and sludge applications sites are allowed.\na. Limitations on Certain Permitted Uses\ni. Agriculture, provided that all agricultural activities will be encouraged to\nparticipate in the agricultural Cost Share Program and subject to the\nprovisions of the Food Security Act of 1985 and the Food, Agriculture,\nConservation and Trade Act of 1990.\nii. Silviculture, subject to the provisions of the Forest Practices Guidelines\nRelated to Water Quality (15 N.C.A.C. 11.0101 - 11.0209).\niii.

For purposes of density calculations, total project acreage shall not\ninclude any area within the designated right-of-way of any public or private\nstreet within the project, nor shall it include any area within the project donated\nor dedicated to the public, except for storm water control structures approved\nunder the high-density option.

WSII-CA (O) Watershed II Critical Area (Overlay). The WSII-CA(O) is established as an\noverlay district to impose higher standards in the critical area because the risk of water\nquality degradation from pollution is greater than in the balance of the watershed, most of\nwhich lies within the extraterritorial boundary of the town.
