The purpose of this section is to encourage and provide for flexibility and\ninnovation in the design and location of structures and land development, to provide for mixtures of\nhousing types and land use, to provide for the most efficient use of land resources, and to provide\nan opportunity to develop land areas in a manner different from the standard arrangement of one\nprincipal building on one lot. Residential densities are calculated on a project basis, thus allowing\nthe clustering of buildings in order to create useful open spaces and preserve natural site features.\nIt is further intended that a Planned Unit Development will be in harmony with the character of the\n48 of 198\n4/30/24, 21:02\n\nNEW PAGE 49\nFirefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/2050bacc-5248-438d-91.\ndistrict in which it is located.\n(2) Planned Unit Development defined. Any development where more than one principal\nbuilding or use is proposed to be constructed on a single lot, or any building with a gross floor area\nof 25,000 square feet or more, shall be deemed a Planned Unit Development (PUD). Residential\nunits within a PUD may include single-family detached or attached units, townhouse developments,\ngarden apartments, patio homes, condominiums, and other type residential units excluding mobile\nhomes and mobile home parks.\n(3) Land development standards. The following land development standards shall apply for all\nPlanned Unit Developments. PUDs may be located in the R-3 districts as conditional uses, subject\nto a finding by the Board of Adjustment that certain conditions be met:\n(a) Ownership control. The land in a PUD shall be under single ownership or management\nby the applicant before final approval and/or construction, or proper assurances (legal title or\nexecution of a binding sales agreement) shall be provided that the development can be\nsuccessfully completed by the applicant.\n(b) Density requirements. There are no density requirements for non-residential uses as\nlong as the proposed project does not violate the intent of the district in which it is located. The\nproposed residential density of the PUD (dwelling units per acre as shown in \u00a7 154.105) shall\nconform to that permitted in the district in which the development is located. If the PUD lies in more\nthan one district, the number of allowable dwelling units must be separately calculated for each\nportion of the PUD that is in a separate district, and must then be combined to determine the\nnumber of dwelling units allowable in the entire Planned Unit Development.\n(c) Frontage requirements. PUDs shall have access to a highway or road suitable for the\nscale and density of development being proposed.\n(d) Land uses. A mixture of land uses shall be allowed in any PUD. However, within\nresidential districts, non-residential uses shall not constitute the primary use in the PUD, and non-\nresidential uses shall be carefully designed to complement the residential uses within the PUD. All\nPUDs must be compatible with and not violate the intent of the zoning district.\n(e) Minimum requirements.\n1. Waived. The normal minimum lot size, setbacks and frontage requirements are hereby\nwaived for the PUD, provided that the spirit and intent of this section is complied with in the total\ndevelopment plan, as determined by the Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment shall\nexercise ultimate discretion as to whether the total development plan does comply with the spirit\nand intent of this section.\n2. Height limitations. No building or structure shall exceed the height limitations of the\ndistrict in which it is located.\n3.\nRequired distance between buildings. The minimum distance between buildings shall be\n20 feet or as otherwise specified by the Board of Adjustment to ensure adequate air, light, privacy,\nand space for emergency vehicles.\n4.\nAccess to common use areas; streets, walkways, etc. Every dwelling unit shall have\naccess to a public or private street, walkway or other area dedicated to common use, and there\nshall be provision for adequate vehicular circulation to all development properties in order to ensure\nacceptable levels of access for emergency vehicles. All roads within a Planned Unit Development\nshall meet the minimum construction standards for subdivision roads of the North Carolina\n49 of 198\n4/30/24, 21:02\n", "page_number": 47, "page_range":
