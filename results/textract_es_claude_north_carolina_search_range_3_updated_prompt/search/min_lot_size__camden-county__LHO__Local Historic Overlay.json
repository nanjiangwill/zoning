RULES OF MEASUREMENT\n10.2.1. PURPOSE\nThe purpose of this section is to clarify the rules of measurement and exemptions that apply to all principal and accessory\nuses allowed in this Ordinance. These standards may be modified by other applicable sections of this Ordinance.\n10.2.2.\nMEASUREMENTS, GENERALLY\nA.\nStraight Lines\nUnless otherwise stated in this Ordinance, distances specified in this Ordinance are to be measured as the length of\nan imaginary straight line joining two points.\nB.\nRounding\nAll calculations that result in a fractional unit or part of a whole number, the number shall be rounded up to the next\nhighest whole number, unless otherwise provided in this section or elsewhere in this Ordinance.\nC.\nIrregular Shapes\nIn cases where an irregular shape complicates the application of these standards, the UDO Administrator shall\ndetermine the applicable dimensional, setback, or bulk standards.\nD.\nSeparation\n1.\nLot to Lot\nWhen the provisions of this Ordinance require separation between two or more lots, or a lot and another\nfeature, separation shall be measured by drawing straight lines from the nearest point of one lot line to the\nnearest point of the lot line subject to the separation requirement (see Figure 10.2.2.D: Separation).\n2.\nUse Type to Use Type\nWhen the provisions of this Ordinance require one use type to be separated from another use type,\nseparation shall be measured by drawing straight lines from the nearest point of the wall of the existing or\nproposed principal structure to the nearest point of the wall of the existing or proposed structure subject to\nthe separation requirement.\nFIGURE 10.2.2.D: SEPARATION\nA\nLEGEND\nA\nLot-to-Lot Separation\nB Use Type-to-Use\nType Separation\nB\nLot Line\nCELL (1,
