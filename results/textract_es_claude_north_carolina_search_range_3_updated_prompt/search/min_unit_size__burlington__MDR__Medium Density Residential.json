1.53 acres.\nb) Zoning district maximum density: 4.85 units per acre: 1.53x4.85 = 7.42.\nc) Maximum residential density = 8 units (fractions are rounded upwards for tenths).\nb. Density rounding is permitted to the tenths place but is not permitted to the hundredths place.\nC. Land area associated with floodplains and riparian buffers may be included in the calculation of\nthe square footage of a tract or site for the purposes of determining the maximum residential\ndensity.\nd. Land area located within a right-of-way shall not be included in the calculation of allowable density.\ne. Maximum residential density in a particular zoning district may be increased beyond the amount\nstated in CHAPTER 3. ZONING DISTRICTS, in accordance with the standards in Section 7.6,\nSustainability Incentives.\n2. Calculation of Maximum Number of Lots\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\nThe maximum number of lots is calculated by dividing the total square footage of a lot or tract by the\nminimum lot area for the type of use proposed, the resulting number (the quotient) is then rounded\ndownwards to the next lowest whole number to produce the total number of lots permissible for the\ntype of use proposed. The effective density of a lot or tract may differ based on the type of use being\nproposed.\ni.\nExample 1: 67,000 Square-foot Site in the MDR District for Single-family\nDetached Dwelling Lots\na) Lot size: 67,000 square feet.\nb) Minimum lot area for a single-family detached dwelling: 9,000 square feet.\nc) Maximum number of single-family detached dwelling lots: 67,000 / 9,000 = 7.44, or 7\nsingle-family detached lots (fractions are rounded downwards).\nii. Example 2: 67,000 Square-foot Site in the MDR district for Single-family\nAttached Dwelling lots\na) Lot size: 67,000 square feet.\nb) Minimum lot area for single-family attached dwelling: 9,000 square feet + 1,600 square\nfeet for each unit.\nc) Maximum number of single-family attached dwelling lots: (67,000 - 9,000) / 1,600 = 36.25\nor 36 single-family attached lots (fractions are rounded downwards).\n3. Calculation of Allowable Residential Yield\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\nAllowable residential yield is the lesser of the maximum allowable density or the maximum number of\nlots for a given site.\ni.\nExample 1: 67,000 Square -foot Site in the MDR District for Single-Family\nDetached Dwelling lots\na) Maximum density (based on Example 1 in Sub-section 1 above): 8 units.\nb) Maximum number of lots (based on Example i in Sub-section 2 above): 7 lots.\nc) Allowable residential density = 7 units.\nii. Example 2: 67,000 Square -foot Site in the MDR District for Single-Family\nAttached Dwelling lots\na) Maximum density (based on Example 1 in Sub-section 1 above): 8 units.\nb) Maximum number of lots (based on Example ii in Sub-section 2 above): 36 lots.\nc) Allowable residential density = 8 units.\n4. Density Equivalence\na. Accessory dwelling units associated with a single-family residential principal use shall not be\ncounted towards the maximum allowable residential density.\nb. When calculating the density for a private dormitory associated with an educational use, two\nbedrooms in a private dormitory shall be equivalent to one regular dwelling unit.\nC. Maximum density amounts do not apply to student housing or lodging on college or university\ncampuses when the housing is owned or operated by the college or university. In these instances,\nresidential land uses are considered as an accessory to the college or university principal use.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \n8-14\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\nNEW PAGE 527\nCHAPTER 8 MEASUREMENT AND DEFINITIONS\nSection 8.3 Rules of Measurement\nG.

The mid-point of the roof between the ridge and the leaves for a gable, hip, or gambrel roof; or\nd. To the highest point of a dome, shed, or cricket-style roof.\n3. Story\nA building story is the portion of a building where all rooms share the same floor and ceiling level.\na. A crawlspace or basement with an average ceiling height of less than seven feet is not considered\nas a story.\nb. An attic with an average ceiling height of less than six feet is not considered a story.\n4. Exceptions\na. Except when proposed within the AHO, the following features are exempted from the maximum\nheight requirements in this Ordinance:\ni. Parapet walls of less than five feet in height above the roof deck;\nii.\nSpires, steeples, minarets, belfries, cupolas, domes, and similar architectural features not\nintended for human habitation;\niii. Water tanks, vent housings, elevator housings, and equipment covers;\niv. Chimneys, vent pipes, skylights, or mechanical equipment; and\nV.

ALLOWABLE RESIDENTIAL DENSITY\nResidential density is the maximum allowable number of residential dwelling units permitted on a particular\nsite, tract, lot, or other unit of land area, typically expressed as a maximum number of residential units\nper acre. Maximum residential density alone may not produce the allowable residential yield since the\nminimum lot area must also be taken into account. Allowable residential yield is the lesser of the maximum\nresidential density or the maximum number of lots.\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\n1. Calculation of Maximum Residential Density\n(AMENDED 3.4.21 UDOTA-01-21; 6.21.22 UDOTA-3-22; 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\na. Maximum residential density is calculated by dividing the square footage of a lot by the number\nof square feet in an acre (43,560), then multiplying the maximum number dwelling units allowed\nin the zoning district, and rounding the product upwards (in the tenths place) to remove any\nfractions.\nCity of Burlington\nUnified Development Ordinance\n8-13\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\nCELL (1, 1): \nTABLE 8.3.E: ALLOWABLE ENCROACHMENT INTO REQUIRED SETBACKS\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\nCELL (1, 2): \nTABLE 8.3.E: ALLOWABLE ENCROACHMENT INTO REQUIRED SETBACKS\nCELL (2, 1): \nFEATURE\nCELL (2, 2): \nMAXIMUM ALLOWABLE ENCROACHMENT DISTANCE INTO A REQUIRED SETBACK\nCELL (3, 1): \nTool Shed\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\nCELL (3, 2): \nMay be located within rear yard but no closer than five feet from any lot line,\nand no closer than five feet to the principal structure\nCELL (4, 1): \nUnderground Structures\n(including septic systems\nbut excluding swimming\npools)\nCELL (4, 2): \nMay be located in any required setback but no closer than three feet from any\nlot line\nCELL (5, 1): \nVegetation and\nLandscaping Features\nCELL (5, 2): \nMay be located in any required setback\nCELL (6, 1): \nVehicular Off-street\nParking Area\nCELL (6, 2): \nMay be located in any required setback provided that no parking area is\nlocated within five feet of the street right-of-way\nCELL (7, 1): \nWell House (functional or\naesthetic)\nCELL (7, 2): \nMay be located in any required setback, but shall be no closer than eight feet\nfrom a right-of-way\n\nNEW PAGE 526\nCHAPTER 8 MEASUREMENT AND DEFINITIONS\nSection 8.3 Rules of Measurement\ni.\nExample 1: 67,000 Square-foot Site in the MDR District\na) Lot size: 67,000 square feet 43,560 = 1.53 acres.\nb) Zoning district maximum density: 4.85 units per acre: 1.53x4.85 = 7.42.\nc) Maximum residential density = 8 units (fractions are rounded upwards for tenths).\nb. Density rounding is permitted to the tenths place but is not permitted to the hundredths place.\nC. Land area associated with floodplains and riparian buffers may be included in the calculation of\nthe square footage of a tract or site for the purposes of determining the maximum residential\ndensity.\nd. Land area located within a right-of-way shall not be included in the calculation of allowable density.\ne. Maximum residential density in a particular zoning district may be increased beyond the amount\nstated in CHAPTER 3. ZONING DISTRICTS, in accordance with the standards in Section 7.6,\nSustainability Incentives.\n2. Calculation of Maximum Number of Lots\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\nThe maximum number of lots is calculated by dividing the total square footage of a lot or tract by the\nminimum lot area for the type of use proposed, the resulting number (the quotient) is then rounded\ndownwards to the next lowest whole number to produce the total number of lots permissible for the\ntype of use proposed. The effective density of a lot or tract may differ based on the type of use being\nproposed.\ni.\nExample 1: 67,000 Square-foot Site in the MDR District for Single-family\nDetached Dwelling Lots\na) Lot size: 67,000 square feet.\nb) Minimum lot area for a single-family detached dwelling: 9,000 square feet.\nc) Maximum number of single-family detached dwelling lots: 67,000 / 9,000 = 7.44, or 7\nsingle-family detached lots (fractions are rounded downwards).\nii. Example 2: 67,000 Square-foot Site in the MDR district for Single-family\nAttached Dwelling lots\na) Lot size: 67,000 square feet.\nb) Minimum lot area for single-family attached dwelling: 9,000 square feet + 1,600 square\nfeet for each unit.\nc) Maximum number of single-family attached dwelling lots: (67,000 - 9,000) / 1,600 = 36.25\nor 36 single-family attached lots (fractions are rounded downwards).\n3. Calculation of Allowable Residential Yield\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\nAllowable residential yield is the lesser of the maximum allowable density or the maximum number of\nlots for a given site.\ni.\nExample 1: 67,000 Square -foot Site in the MDR District for Single-Family\nDetached Dwelling lots\na) Maximum density (based on Example 1 in Sub-section 1 above): 8 units.\nb) Maximum number of lots (based on Example i in Sub-section 2 above): 7 lots.\nc) Allowable residential density = 7 units.\nii. Example 2: 67,000 Square -foot Site in the MDR District for Single-Family\nAttached Dwelling lots\na) Maximum density (based on Example 1 in Sub-section 1 above): 8 units.\nb) Maximum number of lots (based on Example ii in Sub-section 2 above): 36 lots.\nc) Allowable residential density = 8 units.\n4. Density Equivalence\na. Accessory dwelling units associated with a single-family residential principal use shall not be\ncounted towards the maximum allowable residential density.\nb. When calculating the density for a private dormitory associated with an educational use, two\nbedrooms in a private dormitory shall be equivalent to one regular dwelling unit.\nC. Maximum density amounts do not apply to student housing or lodging on college or university\ncampuses when the housing is owned or operated by the college or university. In these instances,\nresidential land uses are considered as an accessory to the college or university principal use.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \n8-14\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\nNEW PAGE 527\nCHAPTER 8 MEASUREMENT AND DEFINITIONS\nSection 8.3 Rules of Measurement\nG. GROSS FLOOR AREA (GFA)\nGross floor area (GFA) shall be defined as the sum in square feet of all floors of the building measured\nfrom the exterior face of the exterior walls. The gross floor area shall include or exclude areas as indicated\nbelow:\n1. Areas Included in Gross Floor Area\na. All enclosed habitable space.\nb. Elevators, hallways, and stairwells on stories containing habitable space.\n2. Areas Excluded from Gross Floor Area\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\na. Unenclosed porches or decks.\nb. Off-street parking areas, including the elevators, hallways, mechanical equipment, and stairwells\nserving structured parking.\nC. Utility services areas devoted to the electric service, the potable water service, the wastewater\nsystem, the telephone service, the cable service, or to a backup generator.\nd.\nMechanical areas and uninhabited enclosed spaces on tops of roofs not intended for general\nstorage.\nH. HEIGHT\n1. Measurement\nBuilding height shall be measured from the finished or established grade elevation following any land\ndisturbing activities.\n2. Maximum Height\nBuilding height is the vertical distance from a point established as the mean elevation of the finished\ngrade along the front fa\u00e7ade of a building to any of the following points (see Figure 8.3.H: Building\nHeight):\na. The highest point of a flat roof (excluding coping or parapet walls shorter than five feet above the\nroof deck);\nb. The deck line of a mansard roof;\nC. The mid-point of the roof between the ridge and the leaves for a gable, hip, or gambrel roof; or\nd. To the highest point of a dome, shed, or cricket-style roof.\n3. Story\nA building story is the portion of a building where all rooms share the same floor and ceiling level.\na. A crawlspace or basement with an average ceiling height of less than seven feet is not considered\nas a story.\nb. An attic with an average ceiling height of less than six feet is not considered a story.\n4. Exceptions\na. Except when proposed within the AHO, the following features are exempted from the maximum\nheight requirements in this Ordinance:\ni. Parapet walls of less than five feet in height above the roof deck;\nii.\nSpires, steeples, minarets, belfries, cupolas, domes, and similar architectural features not\nintended for human habitation;\niii.
