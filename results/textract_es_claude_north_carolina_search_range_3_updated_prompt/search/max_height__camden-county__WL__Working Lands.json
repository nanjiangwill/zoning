The\nWL\ndistrict is primarily intended to preserve and protect bona fide farms\nand resource lands for current or future agricultural use as well as to\nprotect the rural character of the area. One of the primary tools for\ncharacter protection is the requirement to configure residential\nsubdivisions of more than five lots as conservation subdivisions. The\nWorking\nconservation subdivision approach seeks to minimize the visibility of\nnew residential development from adjacent roadways through proper\nplacement and screening, and allows farmers to capture a portion of\nthe land's development potential while continuing to farm.\nLands\nConservation subdivisions allow a portion of a tract or site to be\ndeveloped with single-family detached homes while the balance of the\nsite is left as conservation or agricultural land. The district also\naccommodates a wide range of agricultural and agricultural-related\nuses like \"agri-tourism\" as well as service and support uses to the rural\ncommunity, including day care, educational uses, public safety\nfacilities, parks, and utility features.\nB.\nDimensional Requirements\nCamden County\n3-14\nLast Updated:\nUnified Development Ordinance\nAugust 1, 2022\nCELL (1, 1):

The\nWL\ndistrict is primarily intended to preserve and protect bona fide farms\nand resource lands for current or future agricultural use as well as to\nprotect the rural character of the area. One of the primary tools for\ncharacter protection is the requirement to configure residential\nsubdivisions of more than five lots as conservation subdivisions. The\nWorking\nconservation subdivision approach seeks to minimize the visibility of\nnew residential development from adjacent roadways through proper\nplacement and screening, and allows farmers to capture a portion of\nthe land's development potential while continuing to farm.\nLands\nConservation subdivisions allow a portion of a tract or site to be\ndeveloped with single-family detached homes while the balance of the\nsite is left as conservation or agricultural land. The district also\naccommodates a wide range of agricultural and agricultural-related\nuses like \"agri-tourism\" as well as service and support uses to the rural\ncommunity, including day care, educational uses, public safety\nfacilities, parks, and utility features.\nB.\nDimensional Requirements\nCamden County\n3-14\nLast Updated:\nUnified Development Ordinance\nAugust 1, 2022\nCELL (1, 1):
