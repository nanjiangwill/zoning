Usable area within buffers\nd. Reserved Civic Space\n2. The open space of the Reserved Sector may be considered a TDR transfer area\nthat is available for the transfer of development rights from the Reserved Sector to\nadjacent or contiguous Transect Zones. The TDR's shall be available for use in\nmeeting, but not exceeding, the allocated densities of the Transect Zones (see\nTable 7.2.1, Development Standards for Transect Zones and Specialized Zones).\nAreas from which development rights have been transferred from the Reserved\nSector become integrated into the Preserved Sector.\nSection 7.2.7 Density Calculations\nA. Net Site Area - The area of a Master Development Plan shall be considered the Net\nSite Area. The Net Site Area shall be allocated to the various Transect Zones and\nSpecialized Zones.\nB. Overall Density - The overall density for each Transect Zone, as established in Table\n7.2.1, shall be calculated in terms of units per acre. For purposesof density\ncalculation, the area of a Transect Zone shall include the thoroughfares and land\nallocated to Civic Use or Open Space by TDR provided that Civic Buildings shall be\ncalculated in the overall density in the same manner as are private use buildings.\nC.\nEstablishment of Density Units - A single unit of density shall equal the following\nnumber of units or square footage as per the respective use:\n1. Residential - 1 Residential Unit equals 1 Density Unit\n8\n\nNEW PAGE 111\n2. Lodging (Hotel, etc.) - Two (2) lodging bedrooms equals one (1) Density Unit\n3. Office, Retail, Restaurant, or Entertainment - 1,500 gross square feet equals\none (1) Density Unit.\nSection 7.2.8 Civic Spaces\nA. General\n1. Civic Spaces are public sites permanently dedicated to open space.\n2. Civic Buildings are sites dedicated for buildings generally operated by the\nMunicipal, State or Federal government.\nB. Civic Space Specific to Transect Zones\n1. Each Transect Zone (A, B, and C) shall assign at least five percent (5%) of its\nNet Site Area to Civic Space except that Zone A may transfer any Civic Space\narea in excess of five percent (5%) to Zone B to qualify Zone B for the five\npercent (5%) minimum.\n2. A Civic Space shall be located within one-quarter (0.25) mile (1,320 feet) of\nthe geographic center of each Transect Zone.\n3. A Civic Space shall be located within eight-hundred (800) feet of every lot in\nresidential use.\n4. At least one (1) Civic Space within every Master Development Plan\nconsisting of an area in excess of five (5) acres shall be designed and equipped\nas a playground.\n5. Each Civic Space shall have a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of its\nperimeter enfronting a Thoroughfare.\n6. Civic Spaces shall be designed as generally described in Table 7.2.2, Civic\nSpace Design Standards. Table 7.2.2 diagrams the intended types of Civic\nSpace.
