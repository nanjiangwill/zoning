Due to the potential for parking areas to use a large\npercentage of a development site, efforts should be made to accurately estimate the\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 12 - Page\n4\n\nNEW PAGE 307\nparking needs of the principal use. Strategies such as shared parking and remote parking\nshould be used to maximize the use of existing parking available in the area in which a\nuse is to be located. Parking areas shall be designed to minimize breaks in the pedestrian\nenvironment along the public street and create safe and comfortable passage for\npedestrians. The following standards shall therefore be met.\n12.11-1\nLocation of Parking Lots. Parking lots shall be placed behind buildings where\npractical; persons who wish to vary from this standard will have to appeal to the\nPlanning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator. Side of the building parking will be\npermitted only as indicated by Building Type and shall be measured along the build-\nto line. Off-street parking is not permitted in front of the primary building facade,\nexcept where specified in an adopted street section, detailed as a public plaza, or as\napproved by the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator as part of site plan\nreview and approval.\n12.11-2\nLimitation on Uninterrupted Areas of Parking. Uninterrupted areas of parking lot\nshall be limited in size. Large parking lots shall be broken by buildings and/or\nlandscape features. See Figure 12.11-2 below:\nFigure 12.11-2: Example of parking lot broken up by landscaping.\n12.11-3\nEnclosure of Parking Lots. Parking lots shall be enclosed by tree planting and/or\nbuilding walls(s). Plantings shall be in accordance with the provisions of Article 11,\nsee 11.6-4. For small lots (thirty-six spaces or less), landscaping shall be required at\nthe perimeter; for large lots (more than thirty-six spaces), landscaping shall be at the\nperimeter and placed to break the lot into parking areas of no more than thirty-six\nspaces.\n12.11-4\nPedestrian Corridors. Parking lots shall be designed to allow pedestrians to safely\nmove from their vehicles to the building. On small lots, this may be achieved by\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 12 Page 5\n\nNEW PAGE 308\nproviding a sidewalk at the perimeter of the lot. On larger lots, corridors within the\nparking area should channel pedestrians from the car to the perimeter of the lot or to\nthe building(s). These corridors should be delineated by a paving material which\ndiffers from that of vehicular areas and planted to provide shade and an edge. Small\nposts or bollards may be used to define/protect the pedestrian corridors. The\nminimum width of the sidewalk or pedestrian corridor shall be five (5) feet, with\nvehicle encroachment calculated as extending two (2) feet beyond curb or wheel stop.\n12.11-5\nDriveway Width. To maintain pedestrian comfort and calm the speed of entering\ntraffic, driveways to parking areas should be no wider than 24 feet. Driveways\nconnecting to state roads shall meet the requirements of the NC Department of\nTransportation.\n12.11-6\nInterconnection of Parking Lots. To the extent practicable, adjoining parking lots\nserving non-residential buildings shall be interconnected. When vehicular\nconnections are not practical, pedestrian walkways shall be provided to enable\npedestrian connections between parking lots.\n12.11-7\nPaving of Parking Lots. All commercial driveway and parking areas shall be\npaved with asphalt, concrete, pervious pavement and/or pavers, or brick pavers except\nfor areas used for overflow, special events, and peak parking.

Parking areas for manufacturing and industrial uses in the Industrial (IND)\nDistrict provided they are constructed with an all-weather surface.\n(4.) Parking areas for tracked heavy construction equipment, skid-mounted equipment\nand similar equipment, provided they are constructed with an all weather surface.\nFor paved parking areas, curb and gutter or an equivalent drainage system shall be\nprovided along the periphery of the parking lot, except where it is determined by the\nPlanning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator that such system is not practical for\nstorm drainage and/or water quality purposes.
