Purpose.\nThe Conditional Zoning Districts allow for the establishment of certain uses, which, because of\ntheir nature or scale, have particular impacts on both the immediate area and the community as a\nwhole. The development of these uses cannot be predetermined or controlled by general district\nstandards. In order to accommodate these uses, this Section establishes specific development\nstandards for these uses, which allow for flexibility in development while protecting existing\ndeveloped areas. The permitted uses and development standards are contained within each\ndistrict. The process for approval of a Conditional Zoning District is explained in Chapter 6,\nPart 2.\nPART 2: MIXED-USE DISTRICTS (MX-1, MX-2, and MX-3)\nSection 11.201. Purpose.\nThe Mixed Use Districts are hereby established in order to accommodate the development of\nplanned communities that may incorporate a full range of housing types and, in some instances,\ncompatible nonresidential uses that provide goods, services, and employment primarily to serve\nthe residents of the planned community. In order to encourage high quality design and\ninnovative arrangement of buildings and open space uses throughout the project, these districts\nprovide substantial flexibility from the conventional use and dimensional requirements of the\ngeneral districts. Three mixed-use districts are established with varying degrees of development\nintensity to address the application of mixed use to various locations within the community. The\ndevelopmental and locational criteria for the districts are as follows:\n11 1\nCELL (1, 1): \nMX-1:\nCELL (1, 2): \nThis district permits only residential mixed-use development and is applicable to\ndevelopments 10 acres or larger. This district is intended to be located within any\nresidential areas in the community.\nCELL (2, 1): \nMX-2:\nCELL (2, 2): \nThis district permits residential mixed use development (dwellings and permitted\naccessory uses and structures) on tracts which are 10 acres or larger and\nresidential mixed use and nonresidential use development on tracts which are 36\nacres or larger.
