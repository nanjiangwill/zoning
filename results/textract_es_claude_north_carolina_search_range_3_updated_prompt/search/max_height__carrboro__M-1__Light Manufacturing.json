Accordingly, the following conditional zoning districts may be established:\nR-20-CZ, R-15-CZ, R-10-CZ, R-7.5-CZ, R-3-CZ, R-2-CZ, R-R-CZ, R-S.I.R.-CZ, and\nR-S.I.R.-2-CZ\nB-1(C)-CZ, B-1(G)-CZ, B-2-CZ, B-3-CZ, B-3-T-CZ, B-4-CZ, CT-CZ, O-CZ, O/A-CZ,\nM-1-CZ, M-2-CZ, M-3-CZ (AMENDED 4/27/10; 6/23/15; 10/23/18)\nThere may also be established a HR-CC-CZ zoning district, pursuant to the purpose\nstatement and criteria described in Section 15-136.1.\n(b)\nThe conditional zoning districts authorized by this section may be applied to\nproperty only in response to a petition signed by all the owners of the property to be included\nwithin such district.\n(c)\nSubject to the provisions of subsections (k), (1), and (n), the uses permissible\nwithin a conditional zoning district authorized by this section, and the regulations applicable to\nproperty within such a district, shall be those uses that are permissible within and those\nregulations that are applicable to the conventional use zoning district to which the conditional\ndistrict corresponds, except as those uses and regulations are limited by conditions imposed\npursuant to subsection (f) of this section. For example, property that is rezoned to a B-2-CZ\ndistrict may be developed in the same manner as property that is zoned B-2, subject to any\nconditions imposed pursuant to subsection (d).
