The town encourages cluster developments as defined in Appendix A [Definitions]. Cluster developments, as defined in Appendix A [Definitions], require modification of lot size\nstandards; individual lots may be somewhat smaller but the sum of reductions in lot area becomes common recreation area for the benefit of all residents of the cluster development. The\nrecreation area is increased and the intensity of development is controlled. Cluster developments also allow the developer greater design flexibility and will permit reasonable use of land with\ndifficult topography.\n(b) Approval requirements. The town council may approve a cluster development in any residential district, or the HR-L or HR-M Special Districts, if it finds that:\n(1) The tract proposed for cluster development is at least two (2) acres in size.\n(2) Public, separate, water supply and sewerage connections are available for every subdivided lot.\n(3)\nThe total number of lots proposed for the tract, excluding parcels of reserved recreation area, is not greater than the number determined by multiplying the total gross land area by the\nmaximum density established in section 3.8 for that zoning district.\n(4) The recreation area reserved within the tract shall conform to the recreation area standards of section 5.5.\n(5) The minimum amount of land reserved as recreation area shall be the sum of all reductions in minimum gross land area as a result of the cluster form of development, combined with the\nminimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5. Only the minimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5 may be dedicated outside the boundaries of the land being\nsubdivided as specified in section 5.5.2.\n(c)\nReductions in lot and setback requirements. For lots created as part of a cluster development, minimum gross land area, minimum lot width, and minimum setback requirements may be reduced\nas follows:\n(1) Minimum lot size requirements specified in section 3.8 may be reduced to five thousand, five hundred (5,500) square feet gross land area.\n(2) Minimum lot width requirements specified in section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to fifty (50) feet.\n(3) Minimum street setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the street lot line forms an exterior boundary of the cluster development.\n(4)\nMinimum interior setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to eight (8) feet except where the interior lot line\nforms a boundary of the cluster development.\n(5) Minimum solar setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the north lot line forms\na\nboundary of the cluster development.\n(d) Floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations. For lots created as part of a cluster development, floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations, as shown in Table 3.8-1, shall be\ncalculated using the gross land area of the lot or the minimum lot size for the zoning district, whichever is greater.\n(Ord.

This section promotes the public health, safety and welfare of the town by promoting housing of high quality located in neighborhoods throughout the community for households of\na\nvariety of income levels, ages and sizes in order to meet the town's goal of preserving and promoting a culturally and economically diverse population in our community.\nBased upon the review and consideration of reports and analyses of the housing supply in the town, the town finds and determines that the diversity of its housing stock has declined for many reasons\nincluding increasing property values and construction costs. The town recognizes the need to provide affordable housing to households of a broad range of income levels in order to maintain a diverse\npopulation and to provide housing for those who live or work in the town. Without intervention, the trend toward rising housing prices will result in an increasingly inadequate supply of affordable housing\nfor town residents and local employees, which will have a negative impact upon the ability of local employers to maintain an adequate local work force and will otherwise be detrimental to the public health,\nsafety and welfare of the town and its residents. Since the remaining land appropriate for new residential development within the town is limited, it is essential that a reasonable proportion of such land be\ndeveloped into housing units affordable to low- and moderate-income households and working families. The town finds and determines that additional market rate development would displace and\neliminate opportunities for additional affordable housing in the town unless the restrictions on use established by this section are included. This displacement would create the following threats to the\nhealth, safety, or the general welfare of the community:\nIncreases in travel time and distances for persons who provide services or are employed in the town, but who cannot find decent, affordable shelter, which in turn increases traffic congestion,\nreduces air and water quality, and has an adverse impact on public health resulting from excessive commuting; and\nAn imbalance in population diversity; and\nInconsistency with the vision for future development and the specific policies of the town's comprehensive plan.\nThe regulations set forth in this section further a key goal of the town's comprehensive plan: to create and preserve affordable housing opportunities. The regulations also support other goals of the\ntown including the reduction of traffic congestion and associated air pollution; and the prevention of sprawl through the maintenance of the urban services boundary. Documentation exists demonstrating\nthat the construction of residential dwelling units in Chapel Hill generates need for affordable housing for workers and families. These regulations are intended to provide a structure for cooperative\nparticipation by the public and private sectors in the production of affordable housing.\n3.10.1 Applicability and Minimum Project Size.\n(a) Single-family and two-family units. This section applies to all development that includes:\n(1) At least five (5) single-family dwelling units or two-family dwelling units; or\n(2) At least five (5) single-family lots; or\n(3) Two-family lots in which six (6) or more residential units are allowed by the Chapel Hill Land Use Management Ordinance, either individually or as part of the same subdivision.\n(b) Multifamily units. This section applies to all development that includes:\n(1) New development that creates at least five (5) multifamily dwelling units; or\n(2) Any vertical mixed use building that creates at least five (5) multifamily dwelling units; or\n(3) Renovation or reconstruction of an existing building that contains multifamily dwelling units, and that increases the number of dwelling units from the number of dwelling units in the original\nstructure by at least five (5); or\n(4) Any change in use of all or part of an existing building from a nonresidential use to a residential use that has at least five (5) dwelling units.\n3.10.2 Affordable Dwelling Units or Lots Required.\n(a) General requirement. A development that is subject to this section shall provide the number of affordable dwelling units required by Table 3.10-1, below.\nTable 3.10-1 Inclusionary Zoning Requirements\n(1) The set-\n(b) Calculation of units required.\naside\n(1) For development of multifamily dwelling units:\nrequirement\nA. The required number of affordable dwelling units is based on the total number of dwelling units that are approved by the town.\nfor the town\nB. To calculate the number of affordable dwelling units required in a development subject to these regulations, the total number of approved unrestricted units shall be\ncenter is\nmultiplied by the percentage established in subsection 3.10.2(a), above. If the product includes a fraction, the fraction of a unit shall be provided in the form of a payment in\nreduced in\nlieu of providing dwelling units, as described in section 3.10.3.\norder to\naddress\nC.\nIf the property is redeveloped or expanded, additional affordable dwelling units shall be provided and shall be based upon the additional units approved by the town. A\ndifferences\nrequirement to provide affordable dwelling units shall be triggered if the resulting number of units is five (5) or more greater than what already exists.\nin\n(2) For subdivision proposals:\ndevelopment\nA.

Except when MU-V\ndevelopment is separated from the residential district by an arterial street with a right-of-way of one hundred (100) feet or greater, in which case the setbacks of the underlying zoning district\nwould apply.\n(2)\nMinimum interior setback adjacent to residentially zoned land shall be equal to the interior setback applicable in the adjacent residential district.\n(3) Minimum solar setback adjacent to residentially zoned land shall be equal to the solar setback applicable in the adjacent residential district.\n(4) The primary height limitation applicable at any of the modified setbacks identified in (1)-(3) above shall not exceed thirty-five (35) feet.\n3.8.5 Reserved.\n3.8.6 Reserved.\nEditor's note- Ord. No. 2010-06-21/0-11, 4, adopted June 21, 2010, repealed subsection 3.8.5, Housing Floor Area Restrictions for Major Subdivisions and subsection 3.8.6, Alternatives to Floor Area\nRestrictions of the Land Use Development Ordinance; provided, however, that in the event Section 2 of this ordinance No. 2010-06-21/O-11 is, subsequent to its enactment, ruled void or unenforceable in its\nentirety or in substantial part by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction, Sections 3.8.5 and 3.8.6 shall be automatically reinstated without the need for further action by the Town Council.\n3.8.7 Incentive for Residential Construction in Town Center (TC) Districts.\nThe purpose of this section is to provide an incentive for the construction of dwelling units in the town center.\n(a) The amount of floor reserved for residential uses on new or expanded lots shall be excluded from the floor area ratio calculation as follows:\nTC Residential Floor Area Bonus\n3.8.8 Cluster Development.\n(a) Generally. The town encourages cluster developments as defined in Appendix A [Definitions]. Cluster developments, as defined in Appendix A [Definitions], require modification of lot size\nstandards; individual lots may be somewhat smaller but the sum of reductions in lot area becomes common recreation area for the benefit of all residents of the cluster development. The\nrecreation area is increased and the intensity of development is controlled. Cluster developments also allow the developer greater design flexibility and will permit reasonable use of land with\ndifficult topography.\n(b) Approval requirements. The town council may approve a cluster development in any residential district, or the HR-L or HR-M Special Districts, if it finds that:\n(1) The tract proposed for cluster development is at least two (2) acres in size.\n(2) Public, separate, water supply and sewerage connections are available for every subdivided lot.\n(3)\nThe total number of lots proposed for the tract, excluding parcels of reserved recreation area, is not greater than the number determined by multiplying the total gross land area by the\nmaximum density established in section 3.8 for that zoning district.\n(4) The recreation area reserved within the tract shall conform to the recreation area standards of section 5.5.\n(5) The minimum amount of land reserved as recreation area shall be the sum of all reductions in minimum gross land area as a result of the cluster form of development, combined with the\nminimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5. Only the minimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5 may be dedicated outside the boundaries of the land being\nsubdivided as specified in section 5.5.2.\n(c)\nReductions in lot and setback requirements. For lots created as part of a cluster development, minimum gross land area, minimum lot width, and minimum setback requirements may be reduced\nas follows:\n(1) Minimum lot size requirements specified in section 3.8 may be reduced to five thousand, five hundred (5,500) square feet gross land area.\n(2) Minimum lot width requirements specified in section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to fifty (50) feet.\n(3) Minimum street setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the street lot line forms an exterior boundary of the cluster development.\n(4)\nMinimum interior setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to eight (8) feet except where the interior lot line\nforms a boundary of the cluster development.\n(5) Minimum solar setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the north lot line forms\na\nboundary of the cluster development.\n(d) Floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations. For lots created as part of a cluster development, floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations, as shown in Table 3.8-1, shall be\ncalculated using the gross land area of the lot or the minimum lot size for the zoning district, whichever is greater.\n(Ord.

The conditional zoning district shall include a condition\nrequiring recordation of a deed in accordance with the requirements of subsection (2), below.\n(2) Dedication.\nPrior to issuance of a building permit, the owner of the transferor parcel shall record a deed in the chain of title of the transferor parcel expressly restricting the use of the land in perpetuity to\nopen space, agricultural lands or street/road right-of-way. The deed restriction shall be expressly enforceable by the town council, and a boundary plat for the transferor parcel shall be recorded\nreflecting the restriction.\n(d) Evidence of restriction required for development approval.\nA developer of a receiver site must submit, in conjunction with his/her application for development approval, evidence that the transferor parcel has been restricted to non-development uses and\nthat a boundary plat has been recorded in accordance with the above provisions. No plat for a subdivision in conjunction with which severable development rights are exercised shall be recorded\nby the register of deeds, and no new building, or part thereof, or addition to or enlargement of an existing building, that is part of a development project in conjunction with which severable\ndevelopment rights are exercised shall be occupied, until documents have been recorded in the office of the register of deeds transferring title from the owner of the severable development rights\nto the receiver.\n(Ord.

No. 2010-06-21/0-11, 4, adopted June 21, 2010, repealed subsection 3.8.5, Housing Floor Area Restrictions for Major Subdivisions and subsection 3.8.6, Alternatives to Floor Area\nRestrictions of the Land Use Development Ordinance; provided, however, that in the event Section 2 of this ordinance No. 2010-06-21/O-11 is, subsequent to its enactment, ruled void or unenforceable in its\nentirety or in substantial part by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction, Sections 3.8.5 and 3.8.6 shall be automatically reinstated without the need for further action by the Town Council.\n3.8.7 Incentive for Residential Construction in Town Center (TC) Districts.\nThe purpose of this section is to provide an incentive for the construction of dwelling units in the town center.\n(a) The amount of floor reserved for residential uses on new or expanded lots shall be excluded from the floor area ratio calculation as follows:\nTC Residential Floor Area Bonus\n3.8.8 Cluster Development.\n(a) Generally. The town encourages cluster developments as defined in Appendix A [Definitions]. Cluster developments, as defined in Appendix A [Definitions], require modification of lot size\nstandards; individual lots may be somewhat smaller but the sum of reductions in lot area becomes common recreation area for the benefit of all residents of the cluster development. The\nrecreation area is increased and the intensity of development is controlled. Cluster developments also allow the developer greater design flexibility and will permit reasonable use of land with\ndifficult topography.\n(b) Approval requirements. The town council may approve a cluster development in any residential district, or the HR-L or HR-M Special Districts, if it finds that:\n(1) The tract proposed for cluster development is at least two (2) acres in size.\n(2) Public, separate, water supply and sewerage connections are available for every subdivided lot.\n(3)\nThe total number of lots proposed for the tract, excluding parcels of reserved recreation area, is not greater than the number determined by multiplying the total gross land area by the\nmaximum density established in section 3.8 for that zoning district.\n(4) The recreation area reserved within the tract shall conform to the recreation area standards of section 5.5.\n(5) The minimum amount of land reserved as recreation area shall be the sum of all reductions in minimum gross land area as a result of the cluster form of development, combined with the\nminimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5. Only the minimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5 may be dedicated outside the boundaries of the land being\nsubdivided as specified in section 5.5.2.\n(c)\nReductions in lot and setback requirements. For lots created as part of a cluster development, minimum gross land area, minimum lot width, and minimum setback requirements may be reduced\nas follows:\n(1) Minimum lot size requirements specified in section 3.8 may be reduced to five thousand, five hundred (5,500) square feet gross land area.\n(2) Minimum lot width requirements specified in section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to fifty (50) feet.\n(3) Minimum street setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the street lot line forms an exterior boundary of the cluster development.\n(4)\nMinimum interior setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to eight (8) feet except where the interior lot line\nforms a boundary of the cluster development.\n(5) Minimum solar setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the north lot line forms\na\nboundary of the cluster development.\n(d) Floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations. For lots created as part of a cluster development, floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations, as shown in Table 3.8-1, shall be\ncalculated using the gross land area of the lot or the minimum lot size for the zoning district, whichever is greater.\n(Ord.

Change in use.\na.\nA change in use must comply with the parking requirements unless the town manager determines the use has the same or a lesser parking demand than the previous use.\nb. Where required parking spaces for the new use exceed the required parking spaces for the existing use, additional parking is only required for the difference between the current parking\nspaces required and the parking spaces required for the new use.\nB. Vehicle parking.\n1. Required spaces. The minimum and maximum parking spaces are provided in the table below and are required unless an alternative is approved by the town manager.\n2. Outdoor dining. Outdoor dining located in the build-to zone or a forecourt permitted under Section 3.11.2.6 are exempt from the calculation of required vehicle parking spaces.\n3. Parking maximums. Parking spaces provided in an underground or structured parking garage do not count toward the maximum number of spaces permitted.\n4. Appearance of Structured Parking. Structured parking visible from the public realm shall be architecturally compatible with the principal building as deemed appropriate by the Community\nDesign Commission. An architectural screen that utilizes durable materials and/or other features offering visual interest shall be provided.\nC. Required parking.

Reductions.\na. A reduction of up to twenty (20) percent of the minimum number of required vehicular parking spaces may be permitted through the granting of an alternative ratio by the town manager\nif, based on substantial evidence, the manager finds that compliance with the full minimum off-street vehicular parking space requirements of this section would not be required by the\napplicant's proposed use. This reduction applies to bicycle parking spaces as well, provided that the ratio between Class A and Class B spaces remains the same as the requirement in this\nsection.\nb. A total reduction of up to forty (40) percent of the minimum number of required vehicular and bicycle parking spaces may be permitted for projects serving the elderly or handicapped,\nfollowing a positive recommendation from the planning director and approval of the town manager.\nC. Motorcycle and scooter parking may substitute for required parking spaces. Existing parking may be converted to take advantage of this provision.\ni. Motorcycle and scooter parking may substitute for up to five (5) vehicle spaces or five (5) percent of the required parking spaces, whichever is less. For every two (2) motorcycle or\nscooter parking spaces provided, the vehicle parking space requirement is reduced by one (1) space.\nii. Motorcycle and scooter parking spaces must be identified or designated through the use of signage or pavement markings.\nd. A reduction of up to twenty (20) percent of the minimum parking requirements may be achieved by providing a transportation management plan subject to approval by the town manager\nor subject to approval by the town council if the proposed use requires town council approval. The transportation management plan shall identify efforts to promote the use of alternate\nmodes of transportation and may include required parking and/or payment to the Town of Chapel Hill Parking Fund in accord with Chapter 11A of the Chapel Hill Code of Ordinances for a\nportion of the required spaces.\ne. A reduction of up to fifty (50) percent of the minimum number of required vehicular parking spaces is permitted if the mix of uses within a proposed development contains at least twenty-\nfive (25) percent of the floor area devoted to Residential uses and at least twenty-five (25) percent of the floor area devoted to Commercial uses.\nf. A reduction of the number of required spaces may be achieved through a shared parking analysis certified by a professional engineer and subject to approval by the town manager. Such\nan analysis may include, where appropriate, considerations of peak hour usage, mode split, internal capture, remote parking as defined in this section, transportation demand\nmanagement, and other approved parking management strategies.\ng. Nothing in this section precludes an applicant from pursuing Shared Parking as outlined in Section 5.9.3.\nD. Location of parking. Required vehicle parking must be located on the same lot as the use they are intended to serve, except as listed below.\n1. On-street parking.\na. Each on-street parking space may be used to reduce the total required parking spaces by one (1) space, provided that the on-street space is located on a public right-of-way immediately\nabutting the subject property.\nb.\nEach on-street parking space may only be counted for one (1) property. Where a space straddles an extension of a property line, the space may only be counted by the owner whose\nproperty abuts fifty (50) percent or more of the on-street parking space.\n2. Remote parking.\na. All required parking spaces may be located off-site, in a commercial parking lot or as shared parking associated with another land use, if the parking area is located within six hundred sixty\n(660) feet from the primary entrance of the use served.\nb. Up to fifty (50) percent of the required parking spaces may be located more than six hundred sixty (660) feet off-site, if the parking area is located within one thousand two hundred (1,200)\nfeet from the primary entrance of the use served.\nC. Specifically designated parking spaces for employees may be located off-site up to two thousand six hundred forty (2,640) feet from the primary entrance of the use served.\nd. All remote parking spaces used to meet an on-site parking requirement must be located within the boundaries of the Form District.\ne. The distances referred to above are measured by the most direct route of travel on the ground and are measured in the following manner:\ni. From the front door of the principal structure on the applicant's property;\nii. In a straight line to the nearest public sidewalk, street, road or highway;\niii. Along a public sidewalk, walkway, street, road, or highway by the nearest route; and\niv. To the edge of the off-site parking area to be used by the applicant to meet parking requirements.\nE. Bicycle parking.\n1. Required Spaces\na. The minimum required bike spaces required are provided in the Table above and are required unless an equivalent or better alternative is approved by the town manager.\nb. In no case is a single occupiable space or unit required to provide more than 20 bicycle parking spaces.\n2.\nGeneral requirements. Bicycle parking may be provided through various types of facilities, provided the facility meets the following:\na. Each required bicycle parking space is at least two (2) feet by six (6) feet;\nb. Bicycle racks are securely anchored, are easily usable with both u-locks and cable locks and support a bicycle at two (2) points of contact to prevent damage to the bicycle wheels and\nframe;\n78 of
