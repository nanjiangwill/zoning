The Board of Commissioners finds trees\nand landscaping:\n1) Provide visual buffering and enhance the beautification of the Town;\n2) Safeguard and enhance property values;\n3) Conserve energy;\n4) Enhance groundwater recharge;\n5) Abate storm water runoff and soil erosion; and,\n6) Reduce noise, glare, and heat.\nB) Vehicle Accommodation Area (VAA) Exemptions\nThe following are exemptions from the landscaping provisions of this Section for VAAs:\n1) Single-family and two family residential parking areas;\n2) Truck loading areas in front of overhead doors;\n3) Truck maneuvering and parking areas unconnected to and exclusive of any vehicle\nparking;\n4) Surfaced areas not to be used for vehicle parking, driving, or maneuvering, provided they\nare made inaccessible to vehicles by a barrier such as bollards, curbs, or fencing;\n5) Vehicle displays, sales, service, and storage areas (parking facilities for these uses are\nsubject to shading requirements); and,\n6) Parking areas under covered stalls and in public garages.\nC) Landscaping Plan Required.\nAll proposed developments and expansions of existing development which result in high or\nmoderately-high impervious surface ratio (ISR) intensity, as defined hereinafter, shall submit\na landscaping plan for review containing the following information:\n1) Landscaping Plan Requirements.\nWhen required, this section and section 18 of this Ordinance, shall work collectively to\nform the site plan needed for such development. A landscaping plan shall contain the\nfollowing items:\na) General location, type, and quantity of plant material;\nb) Existing, protected, or exceptional trees as defined in section 14-B of this Ordinance;\nc) Existing plant material and areas to be left in their natural state;\nd) Location, size and labels for all proposed plants;\ne) Plant lists with common name, quantity, spacing, and size of all proposed landscaping\nmaterial at the time of planting;\nf)\nLocation and description of other landscape improvements such as islands, earth\nberms, walls, fences, buffer yards, sculptures, fountains, street furniture, lights,\ncourtyards, or paved areas;\ng) Planting and installation details;\nh) Location of proposed building(s);\ni) Location of VAAs and internal traffic patterns;\nj) Location of overhead and underground utilities;\n152\n\nNEW PAGE 177\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\nk) The landscaping plan shall be drawn to scale, include a North arrow, necessary\nlegends; and,\n1)\nThe location and description of any barriers to be erected to protect any vegetation\nfrom damage both during and after construction.\n2) Applicability.\nExcept for those properties and developments which subsection C-3 of this section\napplies, a landscaping plan is required when:\na)\nA new principal building, new use, or open use of land is constructed, reconstructed,\nor established after the effective date of this Ordinance;\nb) Any development which changes the amount of impervious surface by more than\nfifteen percent (15%). The extent which these standards apply is determined by the\ntable below. These expansions shall include change of use, expansions of buildings,\nparking areas, open uses of land, or combinations thereof.\nTable 15-1 Expansion of Impervious Surface\n3) Exemptions.\nThe following are exempt from this subsection:\na) Developments of less than eight thousand square feet (8000 ft2);\nb) Single-family residential lots;\nc) Expansions of less than fifteen percent (15%) of the ISR as defined in Table 15-1 of\nthis section;\nd) Lots in the Historic Waterfront Business District (H-WBD) and the Historic Business\nDistrict (H-BD) which do not provide off-street parking; and,\ne) Landscaping requirements of this section shall be applied equally to all similarly\nsituated properties. Modifications to these standards may be granted in writing by the\nadministrator if the administrator finds any of the following circumstances exist on\nthe proposed building site or surrounding properties:\ni) Natural land characteristics such as topography or existing vegetation on the\nproposed building site would achieve the same intent of this section;\nii) Innovative landscaping or architectural design is employed on the building site\nwhich would achieve an equivalent shading, aesthetic, and buffering effect;\niii) The required landscaping would be ineffective at maturity due to the proposed\ntopography of the site and/or the location of the improvements on the site; and,\niv) No landscaping shall be required in areas where the Technical Review Committee\n(TRC) finds it would interfere with traffic safety.\nD) Impervious Surface Intensity (ISI).\nVAAs and impervious surface areas shall be categorized according to their impervious\nsurface ratios as specified in Table 15-2.\nTable 15-2 Impervious Surface Intensity Classification\n153\nCELL (1, 1): \nExpansions (% of original ISR)\nCELL (1, 2): \nApplication of Landscaping Requirements\nCELL (2, 1): \n0 15 %\nCELL (2, 2): \nExempt\nCELL (3, 1): \n16 45 %\nCELL (3, 2): \nApplies to expanded areas only\nCELL (4, 1): \n45 % and more\nCELL (4, 2): \nApplies to the whole lot(s)\nCELL (1, 1): \nImpervious Surface Ratio (ISR)\nCELL (1, 2): \nImpervious Surface Intensity (ISI)\nCELL (2, 1): \n0.86-1.0\nCELL (2, 2): \nHigh\nCELL (3, 1): \n0.70-0.85\nCELL (3, 2): \nModerately High\nCELL (4, 1): \n0.41-0.69\nCELL (4, 2): \nModerate\nCELL (5, 1): \n0.40 and below\nCELL (5, 2): \nLow\n\nNEW PAGE 178\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\n1) Requirements.\nThe following are requirements for VAAs:\na) Layout.\nLandscaping areas shall be provided in VAAs and impervious surfaces to provide\nvisual relief from broad expanses of pavement and to channelize and define areas for\npedestrian and vehicular circulation.
