Accessory uses and structures that are clearly related to and incidental to the permitted principal use or structure on\nthe lot (Section 9-3-33).\n2. Fences and walls. Fences consisting of masonry, rock, wire or wooden material and hedges may be installed on the\nboundaries of any residential lot, provided that the height of such fencing, walls or hedges shall be limited to a maximum\nheight of five (5) feet between the street right-of-way line and the normal building line for that section adjacent to the street.\nFencing, walls and hedges on all other boundaries of residential property shall be limited to a maximum of eight (8) feet in\nheight. Retaining walls and required screenings shall not be subject to the above height requirements. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No.\n37-02)\nSec. 9-3-37 Location of driveways.\nAll new driveways on city-maintained rights-of-way shall be a minimum of one-hundred (100) feet from the nearest street\nintersection, or as close to one-hundred (100) feet as possible without prohibiting access for that property onto at least one\npublic right-of-way on which it fronts. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02)\nSec. 9-3-38 Sidewalks.\nNew developments shall construct sidewalk along the public right-of-way if the property is within three hundred (300) feet\nof existing sidewalk on the same side of the right-of-way. If sidewalk already exists on the other side of the right-of-way, no\nnew sidewalk is required. However, all new development on the south side of Centennial Boulevard shall construct sidewalk.\nAll new sidewalks shall meet the following requirements:\n1. Concrete sidewalks, minimum five (5) feet wide, shall be built along all street frontages of the lot according to city\nspecifications (four (4) inches thick except at non-residential driveways it shall be six (6) inches thick). The sidewalk shall be\nseparated from the street by a minimum four (4) foot wide planting strip unless on-street parking is provided. The planting\nstrip width may be reduced when there is insufficient right-of-way on existing streets. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02)\nSec. 9-3-39 Transportation impact study.\nA transportation impact study (TIS) may be required by the City of Claremont for any development or property that\nexperiences a change in zoning classification after the effective date of this chapter and is projected to generate one\nthousand (1,000) daily trips. A TIS shall be required for all development that experiences a change in zoning classification\nafter the effective date of this chapter and is projected to generate one thousand five hundred (1,500) daily trips. A TIS may\nbe required by the City of Claremont for any redevelopment or change in use of an existing occupied development that has\nexperienced a change in zoning classification after the effective date of this chapter that would generate one thousand\n(1,000) additional daily trips, and shall be required when the subject development is expected to generate one thousand five\nhundred (1,500) additional daily trips, subject to the exception set out below.\nWhen sufficient information on the proposed development is available for the City of Claremont to determine that the\naforementioned criteria is met, a TIS shall be submitted with all preliminary plats, site plans, site plan revisions, and special\nuse permit applications. The trip rates shall be based on trip generation rates contained in the latest edition of Trip\nGeneration published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers or any local trip generation rates either published or\napproved by the City of Claremont. Additional trips shall be determined by subtracting the gross trip generation of the\nexisting use from the gross trip generation of the proposed use. The additional trip calculation shall apply to property that is\noccupied at the time of submittal or has been occupied at any time prior to submittal.\nIf a development or property experiences a change in zoning classification after the effective date of this chapter and\nspecial circumstances exist, the City of Claremont may require a TIS without regard to the expected trip generation of the\ndevelopment. Factors that would warrant such a requirement are:\n1. There are existing levels of service deficiencies in the area of the proposed development. (\"Level of Service\" as\ndefined in the Highway Capacity Manual - Transportation Research Board Special Report 209) and/or\n2. Available accident data and/or operational and geometric factors indicate safety concerns.\nNotwithstanding the above, a TIS shall not be required if the property to be rezoned or developed has been the subject of\na TIS within the previous three (3) years and the projected trip generation of the newly proposed development is equal to or\nless than the previous study performed and the trip distribution has not significantly changed. As a part of subdivision, site\nplan and driveway permit approval, the City of Claremont may require needed transportation improvements for the property\nrequesting development approval; however, a TIS shall not be utilized as a means for staff to require the party developing\nthe property to make needed transportation improvements remote from the property for which the TIS is submitted, nor shall\nidentified deficiencies in level of service automatically preclude approval of the proposed development.\nThe TIS shall address the proposed land use, the trip generation therefrom, site access, modal splits if appropriate,\nimpacts on the transportation system from the proposed development, and physical improvements or enforceable\nmanagement strategies to mitigate negative impacts. At a minimum, the TIS shall identify the improvements necessary to\n\nNEW PAGE 21\nmaintain Level of Service D for streets and intersections as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual - Transportation\nResearch Board Special Report 209. Any TIS, whether required or voluntarily prepared, must be prepared by a licensed\nengineer in accordance with city guidelines. Additionally, the TIS should be reviewed and approved by city staff before being\nconsidered by City Council or any planning agency of the city.\nDevelopments/properties that have not experienced a change in zoning classification since the effective date of this\nchapter are not required to prepare a TIS as a part of their site plan approval.

The zoning map shall be retained in the office of the City Clerk. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No.\n37-02)\nSec. 9-3-43 Rules governing boundaries.\nWhere, due to the scale, lack of detail or illegibility of the zoning map, there is uncertainty, contradiction or conflict as to\nthe intended location of any zoning district boundary as shown thereof, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall make an\ninterpretation of said map upon request of any person. Any person aggrieved by such interpretation may appeal such\ninterpretation to the Board of Adjustment. The Zoning Enforcement Officer and the Board of Adjustment, in interpreting the\nzoning map or deciding any appeal, shall apply the following standards:\n1. Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets or highways, street lines,\nor railroad right-of-way lines or such lines extended, such centerlines, street lines or railroad right-of-way lines shall be\nconstrued to be such boundaries.\n2. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to\nbe said boundaries.\n3. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets, highways,\nor railroads, or rights-of-way of same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such\ndistance there from as indicated on the zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use\nof the scale shown on said zoning map.\n4. Where a district boundary line divides a lot in single ownership, the district requirements for the least restricted portion\nof such lot shall be deemed to apply to the whole thereof, provided that such extensions shall not include any part of such a\nlot more than thirty-five (35) feet beyond the district boundary line. The term \"least restrictive\" shall refer to zoning\nrestrictions, not lot or tract size.

General requirements:\n(1) Along existing streets, new buildings shall respect the general spacing of structures, building mass and scale, and\nstreet frontage relationships of existing buildings.\n(2) New buildings which exceed the scale and volume of existing buildings may demonstrate compatibility by varying the\nmassing of buildings to reduce perceived scale and volume. Building massing illustrates the application of design\ntechniques to reduce the visual perception of size and integrate larger buildings with pre-existing smaller buildings.\n(3)\nOn new streets, allowable building and lot types will establish the development pattern.\n2.
