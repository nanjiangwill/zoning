Intent. The Mixed-Use Districts (MU-1 and MU-2) are established to provide\nopportunities for both compatible and sustainable re-development where\nunderutilized commercial properties already exist as well as infill sites where site\nspecific land planning of new development creates opportunities for businesses\nand various housing designs sharing community amenities and enhancements.\nExisting auto-oriented street, lot, and building designs can create uncomfortable\npedestrian environments; however, with careful site planning these areas will allow\na greater number of residents to walk or bike to businesses and services with an\ninterconnected network of streets and sidewalks. Allowed building/lot types are\nHighway Commercial, Urban Workplace, Shop-front, Detached House, Attached\nHouse, and Multi-family. Dominant uses in this district are residential, retail and\noffice. The Mixed-Use Districts are expected to serve Chadbourn residents as well\nas persons who travel from surrounding communities. The development pattern in\nthis district acknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access\nprovided to promote safety for the motoring public. Development standards in the\nMixed-Use Districts promote the creation of a pleasant pedestrian-friendly auto-\noriented environment while enabling a compatible transition to uses in adjacent\ndistricts.\n(B.)

Allowed building/lot type is Highway Commercial.\nThe Industrial District (IND) is established to provide locations for industrial uses that,\ndue to the scale of the buildings and/or the nature of the use, cannot be integrated into the\ncommunity. Uses within the Industrial District are buffered from adjacent uses. The\ndominant uses in this district are manufacturing and warehouse storage. Small scale\nmanufacturing and storage that is compatible with less intensive uses can and should be\nlocated in other non-residential or mixed-use districts. The Industrial District is reserved\nfor uses which require very large buildings and/or large parking and loading facilities.\nThe Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay District (TNDO) provides an\nalternative opportunity applicable only upon request for a Zoning Map Amendment for\nthe development of new neighborhoods and the revitalization or extension of existing\nneighborhoods.

Traditional\nNeighborhood Developments (TND's) provide a mixture of housing types and prices,\nprominently sited civic or community building(s), stores/offices/workplaces, and\nchurches to provide a balanced mix of activities. A Traditional Neighborhood\nDevelopment (TND) has a recognizable center and clearly defined edges; optimum size is\na quarter mile from center to edge. A TND is urban in form, is typically an extension of\nthe existing developed area of the Town and has an overall residential density of up to\neleven (11) dwelling units per acre. TNDO districts should have a significant portion of\nland dedicated to improved open spaces, and reserve un-improved open spaces where\nenvironmentally sensitive areas are located.\nThe Scenic Corridor Overlay District (SCO) is established to protect the pastoral scenes\nand open spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and visitors traveling the\nmajor entrance roads and gateways to the Town. The pastoral scenes and undeveloped\nproperty along the entrance roads and gateways contribute significantly to Chadbourn's\ncommunity character and sense of place. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District provides\ndevelopment options for the owners of the property abutting the entrance roads and\ngateways. The goal of this district is to protect the scenic value of the corridors through a\nmix of incentives and development standards. These standards will preserve the\nsuburban character of the Town by maintaining the sense of a suburban corridor in an\nurban environment; provide an aesthetically appealing experience for those traveling the\ncorridor; provide multi-modal transportation options for travel; and promote a safe\ntransportation corridor for motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians.\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 5\n\nNEW PAGE 137\nThe Heavy Industry Overlay District (HIO) is established to protect all environments\nfrom the negative impacts of certain activities and types of development. It is the intent\nof this district to provide and permit certain public and private heavy industrial uses and\nfacilities that incorporate hazardous materials and/or scientific technology, including\nwholesale, distribution, storage, processing, manufacturing and production. However, it\nis required that industries in this district take all necessary actions including but not\nlimited to installation of apparatus and technological equipment available to prevent\nnegative impacts on the environment and the community from the emissions of smoke,\ndust, fumes, noise and vibrations and other activities and/or products resulting from such\nhazardous industrial activities in accordance with federal, state and local regulations.\nThe Mini Farm Overlay District (MFO) permits buildings to be grouped on a site, parcel,\nor property in order to optimize the use of land and resources for both residential and\nagricultural purposes. By clustering development at a density no greater than one unit\nper developed acre, projects developed in accordance with these standards can obtain\ndensity bonuses while preserving unique natural features for agricultural use. The Mini\nFarm Overlay District mandates the dedication of both agricultural land and open space\nwith density bonuses provided as an incentive for adhering to the standards. It is the\nintent of this district to be used for new development in undeveloped outlying areas of the\nTown and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. Allowed building/lot type is Detached House.\nThe Manufactured Home Overlay District (MHO) is established to protect the standard of\nliving and neighborhood conditions. Established standards that will enable the use of\ninnovative manufactured homes with a higher aesthetic standard will invigorate these\ncommunities. Non-conforming manufactured home parks that have not received\napproval for continuation would be amortized over a period of time to allow the\nowner/operator to meet reasonable financial payback expectations in accordance with\naccepted practices in North Carolina. Existing parks could be limited to less fundamental\nstandards and specifications, while new parks are required to meet a higher standard.\nThese parks may be ideally suited for alternative designs such as Tiny House, Park\nModel and other styles of housing where installation standards are considered temporary.\nThe overlay could be expanded to apply to permanent installations of

Allowed building/lot types include Highway\nCommercial, Urban Workplace, and Shop-front.\nThe Vehicle Service and Repair District (VSR) is established to provide locations for\nspecific uses that, due to their unique characteristics and importance to the community,\nand the traveling public, require different criteria and specifications than typical\ncommercial development. Development standards in the Vehicle Service and Repair\nDistrict acknowledge that the automobile is the primary mode of transportation in\nsuburban communities and there is a vital need for such businesses to be located in close\nproximity to one another. Uses within the Vehicle Service and Repair District are\nbuffered from adjacent uses. The dominant uses in this district are vehicle oriented\nand/or dependent and include vehicle-based services, vehicle repair shops and disabled\nvehicle storage areas. The Vehicle Service and Repair District is reserved for uses which\nrequire broad maneuvering spaces and avoid pedestrian interaction with potentially\nhazardous conditions. Goals of the Vehicle Service and Repair District include providing\na pleasant environment for motorists, a safe environment for pedestrians along the\nnetwork of streets and pedestrian facilities; promoting the safety of motorists and\npedestrians; and preserving the capacity of Main Street and it's interconnecting network\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 4\n\nNEW PAGE 136\nof streets outside the core area as shown in the adopted Town Plan. Uses in this district\ninclude heavy commercial goods and services for motor vehicles, and some limited\nindustrial. Allowed building/lot type is Highway Commercial.\nThe Industrial District (IND) is established to provide locations for industrial uses that,\ndue to the scale of the buildings and/or the nature of the use, cannot be integrated into the\ncommunity. Uses within the Industrial District are buffered from adjacent uses. The\ndominant uses in this district are manufacturing and warehouse storage. Small scale\nmanufacturing and storage that is compatible with less intensive uses can and should be\nlocated in other non-residential or mixed-use districts. The Industrial District is reserved\nfor uses which require very large buildings and/or large parking and loading facilities.\nThe Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay District (TNDO) provides an\nalternative opportunity applicable only upon request for a Zoning Map Amendment for\nthe development of new neighborhoods and the revitalization or extension of existing\nneighborhoods. These neighborhoods are structured upon a fine network of\ninterconnecting pedestrian-oriented streets and other public spaces. Traditional\nNeighborhood Developments (TND's) provide a mixture of housing types and prices,\nprominently sited civic or community building(s), stores/offices/workplaces, and\nchurches to provide a balanced mix of activities. A Traditional Neighborhood\nDevelopment (TND) has a recognizable center and clearly defined edges; optimum size is\na quarter mile from center to edge. A TND is urban in form, is typically an extension of\nthe existing developed area of the Town and has an overall residential density of up to\neleven (11) dwelling units per acre. TNDO districts should have a significant portion of\nland dedicated to improved open spaces, and reserve un-improved open spaces where\nenvironmentally sensitive areas are located.\nThe Scenic Corridor Overlay District (SCO) is established to protect the pastoral scenes\nand open spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and visitors traveling the\nmajor entrance roads and gateways to the Town. The pastoral scenes and undeveloped\nproperty along the entrance roads and gateways contribute significantly to Chadbourn's\ncommunity character and sense of place. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District provides\ndevelopment options for the owners of the property abutting the entrance roads and\ngateways. The goal of this district is to protect the scenic value of the corridors through a\nmix of incentives and development standards. These standards will preserve the\nsuburban character of the Town by maintaining the sense of a suburban corridor in an\nurban environment; provide an aesthetically appealing experience for those traveling the\ncorridor; provide multi-modal transportation options for travel; and promote a safe\ntransportation corridor for motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians.\nChadbourn Development Ordinance
