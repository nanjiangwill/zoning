Building sites should be clustered in order to minimize their impact on the landscape\nand preserve views and historical features.\nH. Public Spaces\nPublic spaces are required or encouraged in mixed-use, commercial, or employment nodes\nbased upon the requirements of the specific planning area. The design and location of urban\nopen space on a site is important factor in a successful pedestrian environment. To ensure\nthat the open space is well-used, it is essential to locate and design it carefully in accordance\nwith the following general standards:\nUrban open spaces shall be fronted by streets and buildings to encourage its use\nand its safety.\nThe space shall be located where it is visible and easily accessible from homes and\npublic areas (building entrances, streets, sidewalks).\nThe space should be located to take views and sun exposure into account.\nThe space shall be well-buffered from moving cars so that users can enjoy and relax\nin the space.\nThe space shall be visible from streets or internal drives, but should not be wholly\nexposed to them.\nThe space shall be partially enclosed with building walls, freestanding walls,\nlandscaping, raised planters, or on-street parking to help buffer it and create a\ncomfortable \"outdoor room.\"\nSee Section 7, Parks and Open Space, for additional information.\nI. Exceptions\nExceptions from the site and building design standards established in this section may be\napproved by the Planning Director to preserve mature trees and natural features.\n4.3.2 GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPMENT OR REDEVELOPMENT IN EXISTING BUILDINGS\nThis section is intended to ensure the compatibility of infill development and redevelopment\nto surrounding neighborhoods and shall apply to new construction and the expansion of\nexisting buildings. As a means to provide guidance for the design of buildings that integrate\nwell into the context of Davidson, this section identifies the following key features necessary\nto ensure compatibility. When developing in the Village Infill Planning Area, in addition to\nthe standards below, see Section 2 for development in the Village Infill Overlay District.\nD. Street Frontage: Street trees should be preserved.\nE.\nRhythm of Development along the Street: Established building rhythms along\nstreet frontages should be continued. Larger buildings can be integrated into\nsmaller-scale neighbohrhoods by creating repetitive bays with facade articulation.\nF. Building Orientation: Main entrances, and other primary building fa\u00e7ade elements\nshould be oriented toward the street. Courtyard buildings should orient main\nentrances toward courtyards that open to the street and serve as a semi-public\nextension of the public realm.\nG.
