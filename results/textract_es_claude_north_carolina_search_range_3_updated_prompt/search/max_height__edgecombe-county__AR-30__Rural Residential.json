SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL (R-30) DISTRICT\nA.\nR-30 DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENT\nThe Single- Family Residential (R-30) district has a suburban character typically comprised of single-\nfamily detached residential uses in numerous locations throughout the County's planning jurisdiction.\nAllowable residential densities are around one and one-half units an acre but may be increased based\non design quality or open space provision. Lot sizes are generally larger than in neighborhoods and\nmore urbanized portions of the County and tend to be landscaped or include undisturbed vegetation.\nMost uses are not served by public potable water and sanitary wastewater services, though\nneighborhood-scale water and wastewater facilities may be present. Most buildings are low-rise in\nheight, or between one and three stories tall. Off-street parking is common. Neighborhood-scale or\nlow-intensity nonresidential and institutional uses like schools, religious institutions, parks, and minor\nutility uses are allowed, provided they do not detract from the quiet, residential character of the district.\nIn order to maintain compatibility with surrounding uses and ensure a high quality of development, all\nactivities shall comply with the standards in Article 6.

RURAL RESIDENTIAL (AR-30) DISTRICT\nA.\nAR-30 DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENT\nThe Rural Residential (AR-30) district is established to protect rural and undeveloped land from\npremature development at densities that are inconsistent with the County's adopted policy guidance.\nThe district is also intended to protect established and future agricultural and forestry activities.\nProtection of rural character and appearance is a central goal of the district, and as such, all residential\nsubdivisions of five or more lots are configured as a conservation subdivision (see Section 2.3.6,\nConservation Subdivision) unless each lot in the subdivision is larger than 10 acres in area. A limited\nrange of supporting institutional and agricultural land uses are permitted and uses requiring public\nutilities like potable water and sewer service are discouraged. All development in the district shall be in\naccordance with the dimensional requirements in this section and the applicable use standards in\nArticle 4, Land Uses. In order to maintain compatibility with surrounding uses and ensure a high quality\nof development, all activities shall comply with the standards in Article 6.
