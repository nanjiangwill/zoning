LAND USES\n$4.2. Principal Uses\nAn \".\" symbol in a cell of the summary use table indicates that the specific use type is not\npermitted in the corresponding zoning district.\nF.\nCHANGE OF USE\n1. Several of the provisions in this Ordinance are applied at the time of a change in use. For\nthe purposes of this Ordinance, each of the following shall constitute a \"change in use:\"\ni.\nWhen an existing principal use is replaced by a new principal use that is of a different\nuse classification, use category, or use type designation (see Section $4.7, Unlisted\nUses);\nii. When an existing principal use that is conducted entirely indoors becomes conducted\nentirely outdoors, or vice versa;\niii. When an existing use type that is a nonconfoming use changes to a different use type\nthat is also nonconforming, regardless of whether the newer nonconforming use is\nmore intense than the prior nonconforming use;\niv. Any change in an existing use or development site that triggers the application of a\ndiffering set of building code requirements, such as the switch from residential\nrequirements to non-residential or combined use requirements;\nV. When an existing principal use intensifies or expands (with or without a shift in the use\ntype) in a manner that increases the average daily trips associated with the use by 100\npercent or more; and\nvi. If a combined or multiple principal use is changed in ways where the mixture of use\ntypes changes or where the relative proportion of floor area devoted to one of the\nexisting use types is modified to the extent that the total minimum off-street parking\nstandards for the entire development are changed.\n2. Conversion from one use type to the same use type under the same or a different owner is\nnot a change in use. Additions or expansions of an existing use may require the need for\ncompliance with development or design standards in this Ordinance.\n3. Changes of use type within a planned development district do not constitute a change in\nuse provided the new use types is identified in the planned development terms and\nconditions document. The addition of a new or unlisted use types within a planned\ndevelopment shall require an amendment to the planned development district.\n4.\nAddition or conversion of secondary uses or the operation of a temporary use does not\nconstitute a change in principal use.\nG.\nCOMBINATION OR MULTIPLE PRINCIPAL USES\nDevelopments with combination or multiple principal uses, such as shopping centers, shall:\n1. Incorporate only those use types allowed in the applicable zoning district;\n2. Comply with all the use standards that apply to each use type in the development; and\n3. Comply with the required method of establishment for the use type identified in Table 4.2.1,\nPrincipal Use Table.\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage\n230\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n\nNEW PAGE 231\nARTICLE 4.

STREETSCAPE BUFFERS\nA.\nPURPOSE AND INTENT\nStreetscape buffers are proposed to soften the view of development from the arterial and\ncollector street rights-of-way, and are intended to:\n1. Enhance pedestrian orientation and encourage pedestrian travel;\n2. Address urban heat islands by providing shade for streets and sidewalks;\n3. Provide shade on pavement;\n4. Support property values by enhancing the aesthetic character of the community; and\n5. Provide habitat for flora and fauna.\nB.\nAPPLICABILITY\n1. The standards in this section shall apply to all lot lines bounded by the following features,\nwhether existing or identified in the County's adopted policy guidance.\ni. Collector streets; and\nii. Arterial streets.\n2. In cases where a future street is planned but its approximate location is not indicated on an\nadopted or approved County map or plan, streetscape buffering shall not be required on\nlots abutting the future street alignment.\nC.\nEXEMPTION\n1. Streetscape buffers are not required along lot lines abutting the following features:\ni. Driveways, private drives, or alleys;\nii. Lot lines abutting platted street rights-of-way that are or have remained unopened for\nat least 15 years; or\niii.

A \"P\" in a cell of the principal use table indicates that the specific use type is permitted by-\nright in the corresponding zoning district, subject to compliance with any referenced use\nstandards and any other applicable standards in this Ordinance.\n2.

Several of the provisions in this Ordinance are applied at the time of a change in use. For\nthe purposes of this Ordinance, each of the following shall constitute a \"change in use:\"\ni.\nWhen an existing principal use is replaced by a new principal use that is of a different\nuse classification, use category, or use type designation (see Section $4.7, Unlisted\nUses);\nii. When an existing principal use that is conducted entirely indoors becomes conducted\nentirely outdoors, or vice versa;\niii. When an existing use type that is a nonconfoming use changes to a different use type\nthat is also nonconforming, regardless of whether the newer nonconforming use is\nmore intense than the prior nonconforming use;\niv. Any change in an existing use or development site that triggers the application of a\ndiffering set of building code requirements, such as the switch from residential\nrequirements to non-residential or combined use requirements;\nV. When an existing principal use intensifies or expands (with or without a shift in the use\ntype) in a manner that increases the average daily trips associated with the use by 100\npercent or more; and\nvi. If a combined or multiple principal use is changed in ways where the mixture of use\ntypes changes or where the relative proportion of floor area devoted to one of the\nexisting use types is modified to the extent that the total minimum off-street parking\nstandards for the entire development are changed.\n2. Conversion from one use type to the same use type under the same or a different owner is\nnot a change in use. Additions or expansions of an existing use may require the need for\ncompliance with development or design standards in this Ordinance.\n3. Changes of use type within a planned development district do not constitute a change in\nuse provided the new use types is identified in the planned development terms and\nconditions document. The addition of a new or unlisted use types within a planned\ndevelopment shall require an amendment to the planned development district.\n4.\nAddition or conversion of secondary uses or the operation of a temporary use does not\nconstitute a change in principal use.\nG.\nCOMBINATION OR MULTIPLE PRINCIPAL USES\nDevelopments with combination or multiple principal uses, such as shopping centers, shall:\n1. Incorporate only those use types allowed in the applicable zoning district;\n2. Comply with all the use standards that apply to each use type in the development; and\n3.
