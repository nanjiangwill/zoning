However, unless carefully\nregulated, sandwich board signs can create hazards for pedestrians and a cluttered and\nunattractive appearance. The following design standards are established to permit\nsandwich board signs to be utilized in a fashion which meets community safety and\ndesign expectations, as well as the need for businesses to market their products and\nservices.\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 17 - Page 14\nCELL (1, 1): \nTemporary\nSign Type\nCELL (1, 2): \nAllowable\nZoning\nDistricts\nCELL (1, 3): \nRequirements\nCELL (2, 1): \nSandwich\nboard signs\nCELL (2, 2): \n\"AG\",\n\"MS\",\n\"CIV\",\n\"MU\",\n\"C-74\",\n\"C-410\",\n\"VSR\", &\n\"IND\"\nCELL (2, 3): \nOne sign per occupancy having direct access onto\nany public or private sidewalk where sign is\nplaced. \"Direct access\" shall mean an occupancy\nhaving a public entrance immediately from the\nsidewalk where the sign is placed.

Sandwich board signs shall not exceed four feet in height and 30 inches in width.\n(B.) Sandwich board signs shall be located only on sidewalks that serve the establishment\nwith which they are associated.\n(C.) Five feet of sidewalk clearance shall be provided along at least one side of the sign\nto allow for unobstructed pedestrian access in accordance with ADA regulations.\n(D.) Sandwich board signs are intended to inform and orient pedestrians to business\nlocations and available products and services. Consequently, such signs shall be\nplaced twenty (20) feet to the primary public entrance to the occupancy with which\nthey are associated and shall be oriented to communicate information primarily to\npedestrian traffic utilizing the sidewalk on which they are located as opposed to\nvehicular traffic utilizing nearby public or private streets or private drives and parking\nareas.\n(E.) Sandwich board signs shall be moved to an indoor location for storage during times\nwhen the associated businesses are not open for customers.\n(F.) Standard design for sandwich board signs. Sandwich board signs shall be located in\nframes constructed of black anodized aluminum, black wrought-iron, or wood which\nhas been painted black, as illustrated in the following photographs. Plastic, PVC, or\nother similar materials shall not be used as the frame. The display area within the\nframe shall be constructed of durable metal or wood if containing permanent\nmessages; such permanent messages shall be applied to the display area with paint,\nmetal or durable vinyl or shall consist of carved wood or cut metal lettering or\nimages. Sandwich board signs containing changeable message display areas may be\nconstructed of chalk board style materials, durable plastic (such as a \"dry erase\"\nboard), or similar materials, provided the display area background is either black,\ndark green or white in color and that the changeable message is applied using erasable\nchalk or erasable ink in a handwritten application. Unless otherwise specified, a\nmuted color palette shall be used for any background or message, including lettering\nand images.\nExample of Standard Sandwich Board Sign Frame\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 17 - Page 15\n\nNEW PAGE 384\n(G.) Alternative design for sandwich board signs. As an alternative to the standard\ndesign described above, the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator may\npermit alternative sandwich board sign designs which exhibit a distinctive and\ncreative flair which the owner would otherwise be unable to replicate if the standard\nframe design was used. Such signs shall not contain changeable copy and images and\nlettering shall be permanently attached, painted, cut or carved onto the sign using a\nmuted palette of colors. Wooden signs are preferred, but all such signs shall be made\nof durable materials.
