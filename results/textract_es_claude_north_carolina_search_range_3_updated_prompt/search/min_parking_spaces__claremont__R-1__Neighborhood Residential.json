A TIS shall be required for all development that experiences a change in zoning classification\nafter the effective date of this chapter and is projected to generate one thousand five hundred (1,500) daily trips. A TIS may\nbe required by the City of Claremont for any redevelopment or change in use of an existing occupied development that has\nexperienced a change in zoning classification after the effective date of this chapter that would generate one thousand\n(1,000) additional daily trips, and shall be required when the subject development is expected to generate one thousand five\nhundred (1,500) additional daily trips, subject to the exception set out below.\nWhen sufficient information on the proposed development is available for the City of Claremont to determine that the\naforementioned criteria is met, a TIS shall be submitted with all preliminary plats, site plans, site plan revisions, and special\nuse permit applications. The trip rates shall be based on trip generation rates contained in the latest edition of Trip\nGeneration published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers or any local trip generation rates either published or\napproved by the City of Claremont. Additional trips shall be determined by subtracting the gross trip generation of the\nexisting use from the gross trip generation of the proposed use. The additional trip calculation shall apply to property that is\noccupied at the time of submittal or has been occupied at any time prior to submittal.\nIf a development or property experiences a change in zoning classification after the effective date of this chapter and\nspecial circumstances exist, the City of Claremont may require a TIS without regard to the expected trip generation of the\ndevelopment. Factors that would warrant such a requirement are:\n1. There are existing levels of service deficiencies in the area of the proposed development. (\"Level of Service\" as\ndefined in the Highway Capacity Manual - Transportation Research Board Special Report 209) and/or\n2. Available accident data and/or operational and geometric factors indicate safety concerns.\nNotwithstanding the above, a TIS shall not be required if the property to be rezoned or developed has been the subject of\na TIS within the previous three (3) years and the projected trip generation of the newly proposed development is equal to or\nless than the previous study performed and the trip distribution has not significantly changed. As a part of subdivision, site\nplan and driveway permit approval, the City of Claremont may require needed transportation improvements for the property\nrequesting development approval; however, a TIS shall not be utilized as a means for staff to require the party developing\nthe property to make needed transportation improvements remote from the property for which the TIS is submitted, nor shall\nidentified deficiencies in level of service automatically preclude approval of the proposed development.\nThe TIS shall address the proposed land use, the trip generation therefrom, site access, modal splits if appropriate,\nimpacts on the transportation system from the proposed development, and physical improvements or enforceable\nmanagement strategies to mitigate negative impacts. At a minimum, the TIS shall identify the improvements necessary to\n\nNEW PAGE 21\nmaintain Level of Service D for streets and intersections as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual - Transportation\nResearch Board Special Report 209. Any TIS, whether required or voluntarily prepared, must be prepared by a licensed\nengineer in accordance with city guidelines.

(Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02; Ord. of 6-6-16,\nNo. 22-15)\nSec. 9-3-192 Planting specifications.\n1. Industrial zones (M-1) that abut residential zones (R-1, R-2). A planted buffer shall reach a minimum height of eight (8)\nfeet. Plants used on a buffer shall be a species that forms a continuous year-round opaque screen within three (3) years\nafter planting. The planted buffer shall be composed of two (2) rows of plants no more than ten (10) feet apart in each row.\nOne (1) of the plant types listed in subsection 4. below shall be used, and the plants shall be located no further apart than\nthe distance indicated for each plant type. The planted buffer area shall be at least ten (10) feet wide.\n2. Commercial or business zones (B-1, B-2, B-3) that abut residential zones (R-1, R-2) and non-residential uses in\nresidential zones (R-1, R-2). A planted buffer shall reach a minimum height of six (6) feet. Plants used on a buffer shall be a\nspecies that forms a continuous year-round opaque screen within three (3) years after planting. The planted buffer shall be\ncomposed of one (1) row of plants no more than ten (10) feet apart in the row. One (1) of the plant types listed in subsection\n4. below shall be used, and the plants shall be located no further apart than the distance indicated for each plant type. The\nplanted buffer area shall be at least ten (10) feet wide.\n3. Buffer topographic considerations and other exceptions.\na. The required height of the planted buffer shall be measured in relation to the elevation of the edge of the adjacent area\nto be screened. In such cases as the ground elevation of the location at which the screen is to be planted is less than the\nelevation of the proposed building site, the required height of the screen shall be increased in an amount equal to said\ndifference in elevation.\nb.\nIn lieu of compliance with the above buffer and screening requirement, an applicant may submit to the Planning\nDirector for his or her review and approval a detailed plan and specifications for landscaping and screening.\nC. In situations where the topography would render most practical required screening noneffective, the Planning Director\nmay allow the screening to be located outside of the required buffer and placed in a location that will enable the screening to\nbe effective in meeting the intent of this section.\n4. Plant types and spacing. Below are listed the types of plants that shall be used in planted buffers and the maximum\ndistance each plant type shall be planted apart. Substitution for another plant type not listed is to be made in writing to the\nZoning Administrator and is subject to verification that the proposed plant will thrive and provide adequate screening. No\nmore than thirty percent (30%) of the total plantings in a buffer shall be deciduous plants.\nCELL (1, 1): \nPlant\nCELL (1, 2): \nDistance Apart\n(in feet)\nCELL (2, 1): \nArbor Vitae\nCELL (2, 2): \n4\nCELL (3, 1): \nLigustrum Japonicum and varieties\nCELL (3, 2): \n5\nCELL (4, 1): \nPhotinia\nCELL (4, 2): \n5\n\nNEW PAGE 87\n(Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02; Ord. of 6-6-16, No. 22-15)\nSec. 9-3-193 Additional planting specifications.\n1.

All plant types required in this article shall consist of plants at least three (3) feet in height when planted.\n3. When two (2) rows of plantings are required, plants shall be staggered in a triangular pattern so that there is a plant\nspaced the required distance apart as specified in Section 9-3-192.4.\n4. When the existing natural buffer provides adequate screening, the existing buffer should remain. The Zoning\nEnforcement Officer shall determine if sufficient buffer does exist.\n5. When industrial and commercial property is developed adjacent to vacant property zoned residential, a buffer shall be\nrequired.\n6. The buffer shall be shown in detail on the site plan approved by the City of Claremont.\n7. The buffer shall be installed and approved before a certificate of occupancy will be granted except when seasonal\nweather conditions are not conducive. In this situation a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued for up to sixty\n(60) days.\n8.
