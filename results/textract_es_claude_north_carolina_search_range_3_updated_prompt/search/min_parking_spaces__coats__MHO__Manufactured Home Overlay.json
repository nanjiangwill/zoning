It\nis important that such properties, while nonconforming, be adequately maintained and\npermitted to continue, but not expanded or enlarged in any fashion that increases the\nextent of nonconformity. Where possible, such nonconformities should be made, wholly\nor incrementally, conforming.\n22.2\nApplication and Exceptions\nThe provisions of this section apply only to lawful nonconformities, except as noted\nbelow. Nonconformities other than lawful nonconformities shall be considered violations\nof the Coats Development Ordinance. This article shall not apply, however, to any feature\nwhich is the subject of a variance from particular regulations that has been granted by an\nauthorized reviewing board or commission or to applications of flexible development\nstandards or modifications authorized by this Ordinance to such features. Where a\nvariance or flexible development standard determination has been granted in writing for a\nfeature which does not otherwise conform to the requirements of this chapter, that feature\nshall be deemed conforming. Nonconformities associated with signs are addressed in\nArticle 17.\n22.3\nDimensional Nonconformities\n22.3-1 Lawfully Established Nonconforming Lots. Lawfully established nonconforming lots\nhaving one or more dimensional nonconformities may be used for any permitted or\nspecial use allowed in the zoning district in which the lot is located provided that any\nstructure or expansion/addition to an existing structure proposed for the use meets all\napplicable dimensional and numerical requirements and all applicable procedures\nare\nfollowed. Such lots may be recombined with adjoining lots to increase the extent of\ntheir conformity provided new nonconformities are not created.\n22.3-2 Structures, including Signs. Structures of any type having one or more dimensional\nnonconformities may be used for any permitted or special use allowed in the zoning\ndistrict in which the structure is located, and, upon any change in use, shall comply\nwith the landscaping, buffering, and parking requirements of Articles 11 and 12.\nStructures may be expanded or enlarged; provided the extent of the applicable\nnonconformity is not increased or new nonconformities are not created by expansion\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 22 - Page 1\n\nNEW PAGE 427\nor enlargement. Expansions, enlargements or reconstruction of such structures to an\nextent equal to or greater than fifty percent of appraised value, shall require such\nstructures to meet all applicable dimensional and numerical requirements, except\ndensity, which may be retained at the prior nonconforming level but not increased.\nFor the purpose of this section, the value of any expansions, enlargements, or\nreconstruction of such structures over a three-year period shall be cumulated in\ncalculating the fifty percent threshold. A structure undergoing renovation (defined in\nArticle 3) having a renovation cost equal to or greater than fifty percent of the\nstructure's appraised value shall not be subject to the above provisions but shall be\nrequired to meet the landscaping, buffering, and parking provisions of Articles 11 and\n12. Signs shall also comply with the provisions of Article 17, Section 17.13 of this\nOrdinance.\n22.4\nNonconforming Uses\n22.4-1 Discontinuation of Nonconforming Uses. A nonconforming use is allowed to\ncontinue unless the use is discontinued for any reason for a period of 730 or more\nconsecutive days, and there are no substantial good faith efforts to re-establish the use\nduring this period. Obtaining permits to maintain the existing use or significant\ncontinuous efforts to market the property for sale or lease for the existing use (e.g.,\nMLS listing, Realtor contract, etc.) shall be regarded as substantial good faith efforts.\nA nonconforming use shall be deemed discontinued after a period of 1095\nconsecutive days regardless of any substantial good faith efforts to re-establish the\nuse. Thereafter, the structure or property associated with the use may be used only\nfor conforming use. Where multiple nonconforming uses occupy the same premises,\nthe reallocation of any combination of the nonconforming uses shall be allowable\nprovided there is no net increase in the gross area of the combined nonconforming\nuses. Special uses discontinued for a period of 730 or more consecutive days shall be\nregarded as nonconforming uses and shall not be re-established without new special\nuse permit approval.\n22.5\nNonconformities Associated with Manufactured Homes.\nDimensional or use nonconformities associated with manufactured homes shall be\naddressed in the following manner.\n22.5-1 Replacement of One Manufactured Home with Another Manufactured Home in an\nEstablished Manufactured Housing Park. Such replacement shall be permitted\nwithout regard to dimensional nonconformity provided that the replacement\nmanufactured home is constructed to the United States Department of Housing and\nUrban Development (HUD) standards, the replacement home is placed in the same\nlocation as the original home, and such replacement occurs within 365 days of the\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 22 - Page 2\n\nNEW PAGE 428\nremoval of the original manufactured home. In all other situations, replacement shall\nbe prohibited.\n22.5-2 Replacement of One Manufactured Home with Another Manufactured Home in Areas\nOther Than a Lawfully Established Manufactured Housing Park or Area Covered by a\nManufactured Home Overlay. Such replacement shall be permitted provided that\nnew dimensional nonconformities are not created, the replacement manufactured\nhome is constructed to the United States Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment (HUD) standards, the replacement home is placed in the same general\nlocation as the original home, the replacement home conforms to the development\nstandards listed in Section 10.1-36, and such replacement occurs within 365 days of\nthe last day of occupancy of the original manufactured home. In instances where a\nreplacement home exceeds the external dimensions of the original home, the external\ndimensions of the replacement home shall not be considered a non-conformity\nprovided the home does not encroach into any required minimum yard other than\nsuch area of encroachment existing under the original home. In all other situations,\nreplacement shall be prohibited.\n22.6\nMaintenance and Repair\nIn the interest of the public safety and health, structural alterations or remodeling of\nnonconforming structures or conforming structures on nonconforming lots that are\nrequired by any public law, and SO ordered by a public officer in authority, shall be\npermitted. Routine maintenance shall also be permitted for nonconforming situations SO\nlong as no expansion of the nonconformity in conflict with the provisions of this Article\noccurs as a result of the maintenance.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 22 - Page 3\n", "page_number": 426, "page_range": [426, 427, 428], "highlight": ["structure is located, and, upon any change in use, shall comply\nwith the landscaping, buffering, and <em>parking</em>", "<em>requirements</em> of Articles 11 and 12.", "Manufactured Home in Areas\nOther Than a Lawfully Established Manufactured Housing Park or Area Covered by a\n<em>Manufactured</em>", "<em>Home</em> <em>Overlay</em>."], "score": 5.44079, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Manufactured Home Overlay\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MHO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MHO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MHO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking space for each\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [426, 427, 428]}
