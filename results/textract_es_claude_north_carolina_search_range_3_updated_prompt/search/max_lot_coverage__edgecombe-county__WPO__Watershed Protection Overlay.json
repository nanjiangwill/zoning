Buildings\nhave a wide range of sizes and heights, based on their function. The district also accommodates the\nancillary service uses necessary to support the predominant office and institutional development but is\nnot intended as a retail district. Retail, personal service, and other commercial uses permitted as\naccessory to an office or institutional use should not occupy more than ten percent of the floor area\nand should be configured to minimize visibility from off-site areas. The OI district also serves as a\ntransition area between higher intensity commercial uses and nearby lower density single-family\nresidential neighborhoods. In order to maintain compatibility with surrounding uses and ensure a high\nquality of development, all activities shall comply with the standards in Article 6.
