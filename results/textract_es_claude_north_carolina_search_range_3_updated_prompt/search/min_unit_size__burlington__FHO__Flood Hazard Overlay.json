Calculation of Maximum Number of Lots\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\nThe maximum number of lots is calculated by dividing the total square footage of a lot or tract by the\nminimum lot area for the type of use proposed, the resulting number (the quotient) is then rounded\ndownwards to the next lowest whole number to produce the total number of lots permissible for the\ntype of use proposed.

Example 2: 67,000 Square-foot Site in the MDR district for Single-family\nAttached Dwelling lots\na) Lot size: 67,000 square feet.\nb) Minimum lot area for single-family attached dwelling: 9,000 square feet + 1,600 square\nfeet for each unit.\nc) Maximum number of single-family attached dwelling lots: (67,000 - 9,000) / 1,600 = 36.25\nor 36 single-family attached lots (fractions are rounded downwards).\n3. Calculation of Allowable Residential Yield\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\nAllowable residential yield is the lesser of the maximum allowable density or the maximum number of\nlots for a given site.\ni.\nExample 1: 67,000 Square -foot Site in the MDR District for Single-Family\nDetached Dwelling lots\na) Maximum density (based on Example 1 in Sub-section 1 above): 8 units.\nb) Maximum number of lots (based on Example i in Sub-section 2 above): 7 lots.\nc) Allowable residential density = 7 units.\nii.

Density Equivalence\na. Accessory dwelling units associated with a single-family residential principal use shall not be\ncounted towards the maximum allowable residential density.\nb. When calculating the density for a private dormitory associated with an educational use, two\nbedrooms in a private dormitory shall be equivalent to one regular dwelling unit.\nC.
