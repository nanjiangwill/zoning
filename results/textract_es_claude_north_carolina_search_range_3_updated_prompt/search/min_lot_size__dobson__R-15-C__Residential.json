Some land uses are of such a\nnature and scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediate area and on the entire\ncommunity, which cannot be predetermined and controlled by the standards of a general use district. In\naddition, this process will ensure compatibility with the Town's Land Use Plan and other adopted plans. The\nreview process established in this Article provides for a specific review process subject to specific conditions\nwhich mitigate concerns with the proposed development and ensure compatibility of the use with the\nsurrounding community.\n8.2 - General Requirements.\nProperty may be placed in a conditional district only in response to a petition by the owners of all the\nproperty to be included. Specific conditions applicable to these districts may be proposed by the petitioner\nor the Town, but only those conditions mutually approved by the Town and the petitioner may be\nincorporated into approval and permit requirements.
