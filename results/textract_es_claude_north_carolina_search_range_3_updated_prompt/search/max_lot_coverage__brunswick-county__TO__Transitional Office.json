Planned Development is generally larger scale projects to ensure sufficient open space can be\nincorporated into the development design. The Planned Development option provides increased design flexibility with varied development and\nhousing types, provided certain enhancements are incorporated into the design of the project.\nB. Conventional Development\nConventional development is a pattern of development that conforms with standard dimensional requirements and typically provides a majority\nof property owners with substantial area on their own property.\nDEVELOPMENT TYPES\nCONVENTIONAL\nPLANNED DEVELOPMENT\nExample Lot Yield: 308 Lots\nExample Lot Yield: 308 Lots\n4.3.1. Planned Development\nA. Intent\nThe intent of a Planned Development (PD) is to promote quality development by providing flexibility in the mixture of uses and in meeting\ndimensional and other requirements of this Ordinance. A PD utilizes exceptional design and best management practices that result in\ndevelopment that is aesthetically pleasing, promotes environmental sensitivity and makes more efficient use of the land, resulting in increased\nopen space.\nB. Planned Development Approval\nPlanned Development projects shall be approved in accordance with the Planned Development approval process found in Section 3.3.3 and the\nsite plan requirements as outlined in Article 3.\nC. Development Intensity\nThe building area coverage and number of dwelling units in a project utilizing the PD development standards shall be calculated as follows:\n1. The building area coverage shall be the dimensional standards of the applicable zoning District (i.e., R-7500, C-LD, etc.). However, the\ndeveloped area may be increased as a result of utilizing exceptional design and/or best management practices as provided in Section 6.1,\nDesign Flexibility. The extent of the allowable increase will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Planning Director (minor site plans)\nor the Planning Board (major site plans) in relation to the extent of the successful use of exceptional design and best management practices\nin the project site plan.\n2. The allowable number of dwelling units in a project shall be determined by dividing the gross site area of the development project by the\nnumber of dwelling units (density) permitted in the underlying district.\nCommentary: For example, the density for R-6000 with water and sewer is 7.3. The allowable number of units for a PD project with 20 acres\nwith an underlying R-6000 district would be up to 143 units, provided all other requirements were satisfied.\n3. Increases in the number of dwelling units permitted in a project may be considered through the density bonus provisions in this article.\nCommentary: There is no guarantee that the maximum density can be achieved on a particular site due to consideration such as required\nopen space, site area devoted to easements or roadways, and other site specific issues.\nD. Uses Permitted within Planned Developments\nUses permitted in the underlying district are permitted in Planned Developments. For residential development, the type of dwellings proposed\n(e.g., single family, multi-family, cottage style, cluster, etc.) shall be approved in conjunction with the PD approval. Mixed use projects are\nencouraged within residential and commercial Planned Developments to reduce travel and maximize the use of land. In residential districts,\n43 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\nNEW PAGE 44\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nnon-residential uses are allowed in approved Planned Developments as follows:\n1. Commercial and other non-residential uses within a residentially zoned PD shall be the same as those uses in the Commercial Low Density\n(C-LD) and Neighborhood Commercial (NC) Zoning Districts per Section 5.2.\n2. Business Park uses may be permitted within a PD per Section 5.2 subject to approval by the Planning Board of the specific uses. Decisions by\nthe Planning Board regarding the inclusion of Business Park uses in a PD shall be based on considerations including, but not limited to, the\ntype of proposed uses, size of the proposed operations in relation to the overall development, the character and nature of surrounding area.\n3. No more than twenty percent of the total acreage within a residentially zoned PD may be designated for non-residential, excluding golf\ncourses and other similar facilities.\n4. Non-residential uses within residentially zoned PDs shall be designed and located to be easily accessible to residents of the development. It\nis expected that such uses will also serve patrons from outside the development.\n5. Such use shall, at minimum, have one internal access to the development.\n6. Within non-residentially zoned PDs, the uses shall be the same as those uses in the underlying district along with uses in the C-LD and NC\ndistricts, including residential uses. Business Park uses may be permitted within a non-residentially zoned PDs subject to approval by the\nPlanning Board of the specific uses; provided however such specific approval of uses shall not be required for property zoned C-I or I-G.\nE. Planned Development Requirements\nPlanned Developments are subject to the site plan and improvement requirements of Article 6. Design and Performance Standards. Additionally,\nPDs are also subject to the following general requirements:\n1. Recreation Area\nOpen space and recreation area shall be provided as required in the subject district (per the PD dimensional table). See Section 6.4.4.B.\n2. Water and Wastewater\nGenerally, public or community water and wastewater service shall be required in all PD. However, the Planning Board may waive this\nrequirement during the PD approval process.\n3. Ownership of Development Site\nThe development site to be subdivided may be held in single ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, the site shall\nbe developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.\n4. PD Perimeter Compatibility\nCommentary: Generally, the perimeter buffer is required along all exterior boundaries, even if the adjacent property is vacant. This is intended\nto provide visual protection for residents of the PD and any development which may occur on adjacent properties.\nF. Buffers\n1. It is preferable that all buffers shall be a natural, undisturbed wooded area where possible, and shall count towards the provision of open\nspace for the development. See Section 6.3, Required Buffers.\n2. A project boundary buffer with a minimum opacity of 0.6 shall be required along all boundaries of a PD except portions of the project\nlocated adjoining a street or roadway. Adjustments to the buffering requirements may be allowed by the Planning Director for minor\nPlanned Developments and by the Planning board for major Planned Developments.\n3. A street buffer shall be required along all boundaries of a PD fronting on a street or roadway.\n4. Additional landscaping and buffering requirements may apply. See Section 6.2, Landscaping and Buffering.\nG. Private Utilities\n1. Provision of all utility services, including, but not limited to: gas, water, sewer, electric, cable, and telephone, shall be underground.\n2.\nAdequate easements and rights-of-way for ingress and egress for maintenance shall be provided.\nH. Street/Internal Trafficways\n1. Creative design of circulation routes and trafficways is encouraged. A base characteristic of a PUD is that the internal circulation routes or\nstreets do not follow fixed linear geometric lines as do most streets. Instead, circulation routes are curvilinear and of meandering character,\nto preserve tree and landscape features. Generous use of design elements such as curved streets, private restrictions for extremely low\nspeeds and other features to achieve slower-paced traffic movements are strongly encouraged.\n2. A minimum right-of-way of at least 35 feet in width shall be required for all internal roadways. Additionally right-of-way may be required to\naccommodate wider roads or utilities.\n3. A minimum paved street width of 20 feet shall be required for all internal two-way roadways. One-way roadways shall require a minimum\npaved street width of 14 feet.\n44 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n", "page_number": 42, "page_range": [42, 43, 44], "highlight": ["CELL (15, 2): \n<em>Transitional</em> <em>Office</em>\nCELL (16, 1): \nWQP\nCELL (16, 2): \nWater Quality Protection\n\nNEW PAGE", "Development Intensity\nThe building area <em>coverage</em> and number of dwelling units in a project utilizing", "The building area <em>coverage</em> shall be the dimensional standards of the applicable zoning District (i.e.", "No more than twenty <em>percent</em> of the total acreage within a residentially zoned PD may be designated for", "<em>to</em> residents of the development."], "score": 10.300989, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Transitional Office\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"TO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"TO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"TO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building area as % of lot\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"pervious surface\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"percent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"%\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per cent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ratio\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 168\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nNotes:\n[1] Required Opacity X 100 = % Required Opacity (e.g., .2 times 100 = 20% Required Opacity).\n[2] When Alternative 3 is selected, the fence type must be 100% opaque and comprised of either wooden or vinyl material.\n[3] When Alternative 4 is selected, the wall must be designed in conformance with Section 6.3.10.A Walls, and Section 6.3.10, Walls, Berms,\nand Fences within Buffers.\nCommentary: Suppose you are required to install a buffer with an opacity of 0.6 and you elect to use Alternative 1.

Hardship Relief\nThe buffer requirement may be modified by the Planning Director upon a finding that a modification would be consistent with the purpose and\nintent of this Article, with any adopted land use plans, that such modification would not adversely affect the land use compatibility or public\ninterest, and complies with one or more of the following criteria:\n1. The affected buffer is parallel to and adjoins an existing utility or drainage easement of at least 50 feet in width;\n2.\nThe affected buffer is between uses that are to be developed under a common development plan or series of development plans; or\n3. The affected buffer adjoins a property that has a joint use agreement with the parcel under site plan;\n4. When buffering the adjoining property would serve no practical purpose due to the nature and/or use of the property, such as\nundevelopable land (wetlands, etc.), industrial use, public or private utility, etc.\n6.3.10.

All required plantings should be placed along the interior side of the fence (facing the developed area of the subject property).\nC. Berm with Vegetation\n1. The Planning Director may allow a reduction of up to 25% of the required buffer depth when a berm meeting these requirements is\nprovided.\n2.\nAn earthen berm may be used in conjunction with planted vegetation provided that the combined height of the berm and planted vegetation\nshall be at least six feet and provide approximately 75% opacity within one year of planting.\n3. The slope of the berm shall be stabilized with vegetation and no steeper than 3:1. The height of the berm may not exceed six feet, with a\nlevel or rounded area on top of the berm. The berm shall be constructed of compacted earth.\n4. Prior to issuance of the first certificate of compliance, berms shall be planted to ensure coverage by live plant material within three to five\nyears.\n5. When berms are planned to be installed within required buffers, storm drainage plans submitted with an application shall be designed to\nanticipate a 100-year storm event.\nCommentary: Berms can dramatically alter the drainage patterns in an area, and result in significant flooding both within a development and\nin areas abutting a development. Therefore, it is important to understand any potential impacts.\n6.4 SCREENING\n6.4.1. Applicability\nA. The following uses shall be screened as required by this section:\n1. Outdoor storage and loading areas.\n2. Self-storage warehouses not located in an industrial district.\n3. Air handlers and similar mechanical equipment in multifamily or nonresidential development not located on roof tops.\n4. Trash handling facilities, including dumpsters and recycling.\n5. Solar Collector (Accessory).\nB. The features and uses listed above need not be screened from similar features and uses on adjoining lots, except where project boundary\nbuffers would be required pursuant to Section 6.3.9.\nC. Screening shall not be required for temporary construction activities undertaken during construction or modification of a building, structure, or\nsite.\n6.4.2. Standards\nFeatures and uses specified above shall provide a visual obstruction from neighboring properties in conformance with the following standards:\nA. All Uses\n1. When visible from an adjoining residential use or residentially zoned property (including across a street), the screen shall be composed of\nview-obscuring vegetation (used individually, or in combination with), a wall, semi-opaque fence, or berm designed to obscure views to a\nheight of six feet from the ground, except for mechanical equipment which shall be screened to the height of the equipment plus six inches.\n2. When adjoining any other use or zoning district, outdoor storage and mechanical equipment may be screened by chain link fencing with\nslats inserted to a height of six feet from the ground, except for mechanical equipment which shall be screened to the height of the\nequipment plus six inches.\n3. One upright shrub shall be installed per four linear feet of any screen wall or fence that faces off-site. These plantings shall be placed such\nthat they obscure the screen wall or fence and shall be credited toward any plantings required elsewhere in this Ordinance.\n4. Plants must be at least two feet tall at the time of installation and reach the desired height within three to five years of planting. All berms,\nwhen provided, must be covered with plant materials within three to five years.\n5. All landscaping shall be maintained in accordance with Section 6.1.6, Requirements for Maintaining Planted Areas.\n6. Enclosures shall be required around all dumpsters except temporary construction dumpsters.\n(Ord. No. UDO-19-02, \u00a7 11, 9-19-19)\n6.4.3.

Applicability\n1. Projects with 10 or more dwellings shall provide open space and recreation area in conformance with this Section. Only the portion of the\nproject devoted to residential use shall be used in determining the minimum open space requirement. Non-residential elements of projects\nshall be exempt from the requirements of this Section.\nCommentary: This is to capture phased or separate developments that may, when taken in part fall under the thresholds, but taken in whole will\nmeet the threshold.\nB. Amounts of Open Space and Recreation Area to be Provided\nWhen required, open space shall be provided in the amounts indicated in the tables below.\nUnless specifically reduced by the Planning Director, at least 15% of the required open space must be in the form of usable recreation area\n(see Section 6.4.4.C.2.i, below)\nC. Open Space and Recreation Area Standards\n1. Open Space Standards\ni. All open space shall be unoccupied or predominately unoccupied by buildings or other impervious surfaces. Unoccupied or\npredominately unoccupied by buildings or other impervious surfaces shall mean that not more than five percent of the area of any\nrequired open space shall be occupied by such surfaces. Open space shall be identified on plats as being permanently set aside. Except\nin the RR district, open space shall be exclusive of any individual lots.\nii. In order to be included in the calculation for required open space, the following minimum dimensions shall be satisfied:\n(a) Open space shall have a minimum horizontal dimension of 15 feet.\n(b) No individual open space shall have a minimum area of less than 2,000 square feet.\niii. Uses of open space may include the following:\n(a) Conservation areas for natural, archeological or historical resources;\n(b) Ecologically sensitive wetlands such as marsh, Carolina Bays, pocosins and swamps;\n(c) Bona fide agriculture, horticulture, silviculture or pasture uses, provided that all applicable best management practices are used to\nminimize environmental impacts;\n(d) Walking or bicycle trails, provided they are constructed of pervious paving materials;\n(e) Water trails;\n(f) Landscaped stormwater management facilities;\n(g) Easements for drainage, access, and underground utility lines; and\n(h) Other conservation-oriented uses compatible with the purposes of these regulations.\n(i) Up to 100% of a golf course may be included in the calculations for useable open space.\niv. Open space does not include the following:\n(a) Roads, parking lots and impervious surfaces, except as specifically authorized; and\n(b) Agricultural and forestry activities not conducted according to accepted best management practices.\n2.

Design Flexibility\nFlexibility is provided in this Ordinance to promote quality development through the use of exceptional design principles and best management\npractices. The intent is to promote the use of exceptional design methods to achieve quality development without imposing financial or regulatory\nburdens on projects.\nLow Impact Development (LID) and other best management practices improve the environmental quality and sustainability of development. Many\nare very cost effective and can result in short and/or long-term cost savings. Use of these practices is strongly encouraged in the planning and\ndesign of projects.\nCredit toward meeting the buffer, recreation, open space, stormwater and other requirements of this Ordinance for residential and non-residential\nprojects may be obtained by utilizing best management practices, exceptional site and structure design, tree resource management, historic\nresource protection and other similar design practices. Examples of these techniques include the following:\nA. Site and/or structure design that reflects exceptional aesthetic elements and is consistent with the character and context of the community;\nB. Naturally shaped landscaped stormwater ponds with recreational features such as trails, bridges, gazebos, etc.;\nC. Tree resource management such as protecting large contiguous areas of heritage trees;\nD. Stormwater management utilizing LID methods such as bioretention;\nE. Connecting recreational elements with established greenways, trails, parks, etc.; and\nF. Green Growth techniques to conserve and connect highly sensitive areas.\nCommentary: Information and references regarding selected best management practices is provided in Appendix E.\n159 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\nNEW PAGE 160\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nAlternative design using exceptional methods that result in equivalent or superior compliance with the purpose and intent of this Ordinance may be\napproved by the Planning Director, in consultation with other County departments and/or outside agencies as deemed necessary.\n(Ord. No. UDO-16-02, \u00a7 25, 3-7-16)\n6.1.2. Trees and Landscaping\nA. Landscape Plan Required\n1. A landscape plan shall be submitted in conjunction with a required site plan. For minor site plan applications, the landscaping may be shown\non the site plan, as opposed to a separate landscape plan.\n2. Landscaping requirements for Parking Lots is provided in Section 6.12.10 Vehicular Use Area Landscaping.\n3. A Landscape Architect or other person with landscape design knowledge (this could include the land owner) shall prepare all landscape\nplans, except where expressly exempted by the Planning Director. The landscape plan shall adequately detail the requirements of this\nSection.\n4. As much as possible, landscape designs should incorporate as much contiguous undeveloped areas into their plans. Whether left\nundisturbed during development or planted during site development, the purpose is to create suitable wildlife habitat and corridors that\nfacilitate movement to adjoining forestland.\n5. Approved planting materials are provided in the standard plant list (see Appendix B for approved lists of Canopy Trees, Understory Trees\nand Shrubs). Alternative plant materials may be substituted if a letter of approval is provided from the N.C. Cooperative Extension. The\nplants approved for substitution shall be added to the standard plant list.\n6. Use of known invasive or problem plants is strongly discouraged (see Appendix B for plant listings and more detailed information).\n6.1.3. Tree Survey Required\nThe primary objective of tree survey requirements is to provide better information about the presence and location of heritage trees (see Section\n6.1.4.B) on sites proposed for development. This information is needed before plans for development are so far advanced that it is unreasonable\nand impractical to modify the plans to protect the trees identified on the tree survey. Tree survey requirements do not obligate a property owner or\ndeveloper to save trees by modifying a plan for development. However, knowing the location and size of heritage trees helps the staff evaluate\npossible modifications to the proposed plans to preserve heritage trees and improve the appearance of proposed development. Canopy trees\nshould be retained or installed to cover a minimum of 15% of the site. Coverage can be estimated by visual estimates, aerial photography or by land\nsurvey methods.\nA. Heritage Tree Survey\n1. A heritage tree survey shall be required for any multifamily development, nonresidential development, major subdivisions or planned\ndevelopment, with applications for site plan, preliminary plat, development plan, or special use permit. The heritage tree survey shall show\nthe general location, species and size of trees listed below. However, a heritage tree survey shall not be required for land in the floodway\n(unless filled or developed in accordance), preserved wetlands and wetland buffers, steep slope areas, and stream buffers.\n2. For purposes of this Ordinance, a heritage tree shall be defined as follows:\ni.\nA flowering Dogwood, Live Oak, Long Leaf Pine, Redbay, Black Tupelo or Laurel Oak with a trunk diameter measurement of 4\" or greater\nmeasured at 4.5 feet above ground;\nii. Any tree species included in the planting table (See Section 6.1.5.C) with a trunk calipen measurement of 18\" or greater measured at 4.5\nfeet above ground;\n3. For development plans where specific building locations are not shown, a more generalized survey of vegetation may be provided in lieu of a\nheritage tree survey. This survey shall describe existing forest stands, indicating the average species and size of trees on the tract. A more\nspecific survey should be provided in conjunction with preparation of specific development plans.\n4. Having better information about the location of heritage trees is not especially useful where plans call for the preservation of large areas in\nundisturbed vegetation. An example is the pervious portions of developments in watershed protection districts. Producing such information\nadds to the project's cost without providing information that could result in project redesign. Where unique site conditions or a proposed\ndevelopment arrangement indicate that the required heritage tree survey would produce little useful information, the Planning Director shall\nhave the authority to waive the requirements for a heritage tree survey for all or a portion of the tract.\n6.1.4. Credit for Existing Vegetation\nA. General\nThe retention of \"existing vegetation\" shall be maximized within the proposed landscaping, parking and buffer areas. When retaining existing\nvegetation within the buffer area, only clearing methods that do not disturb the root structure shall be allowed within the dripline of tree\ncanopies. Existing native habitat or plant material located within the proposed landscaping or buffer area that meets the percent opacity\nrequirements (See Section 6.3.9.A.4, Buffer Alternatives Table [Required Opacity]) of these regulations may be counted toward the total buffer\n160 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\nNEW PAGE 161\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nrequired between adjoining land uses, or toward total landscaping requirements. If the existing vegetation has been counted toward the total\nrequired buffer or landscaping and is subsequently removed or dies, it shall be replaced with the appropriate buffer or landscaping material.\nB. Heritage Trees\n1. With the exception of clearing required for required driveways or street connections, the retention of heritage trees within a proposed\nlandscaping or buffer area shall be required. The Planning Director shall have the authority to permit the selective removal of heritage trees\non a case by case basis.\n2. The preservation of heritage trees located on the interior of the lot is encouraged, but shall not be required.\nC. Credit for Existing Vegetation\nIn order to encourage the preservation of established vegetation, credit shall be given for preservation within the proposed buffer or other\nrequired landscaping areas on a one-for-one basis. In limited cases, the Planning Director may allow the applicant to count established\nvegetation located outside of the required planting area towards the landscaping requirement.\nD. Clear-Cutting\n1. With Forestry Activities\nProperties should not be clear-cut during the conduct of forestry or silvicultural activities. To maintain the visual character of the site from\nadjoining properties and right-of-way, a vegetated perimeter buffer shall be maintained while tree harvesting for forestry occurs. All existing\nvegetation located in a required side or rear yard shall be maintained, exclusive of areas required for access to the site or connection to\nadjoining sites. Along public rights-of-way, all existing vegetation located in a required street yard shall be maintained, exclusive of areas\nrequired for access to the site.\n2. Prior to Development\nProperties shall not be clear-cut prior to undertaking development activities. Along public rights-of-way, a buffer consisting of all existing\nvegetation located in a required street yard shall be maintained, exclusive of areas required for access to the site. Applications proposing\ndevelopment of properties that failed to maintain such a buffer prior to development may be denied for a period of up to five years from the\ndate of clearing in conformance with N.C.G.S. \u00a7 160D-921(c).\n3. During Development\nProperties shall not be clear cut while undertaking development activities. The preservation of the maximum amount of existing vegetation\nand selective removal of existing trees throughout the site is strongly encouraged during project design and construction. In order to\nencourage such preservation, the Planning Director may count established vegetation preserved during development towards the\nlandscaping requirement (see paragraph C, above) where the percent opacity requirement is met (See Section 6.3.9.A.4, Buffer Alternatives\nTable [Required Opacity]).\nCommentary: Clear-cutting trees should be avoided especially areas along roadways. Trees and plantings along roadways are desirable and\nprovides a better visual appearance for the traveling public. Additional benefits include decreasing stormwater runoff, reduction of site\nerosion and potentially favorable tax implications. Contact with the NC Forestry Service for forestry management guidance is strongly\nencouraged prior to undertaking clearing activity.\n(Ord. of UDO-17-01, \u00a7 19; Ord. No. UDO-21-01, 31, 5-17-21)\n6.1.5. Design of Landscaping and Buffers\nA. Design, Installation and Establishment Standards\nLocation of plants and design of landscaping, including maintenance, shall be according to sound landscape and horticultural principles. The use\nof native vegetation and other lower maintenance landscape materials is desired to promote environmental protection, energy efficiency, and\nwater conservation.\n1. Landscape plans submitted for approval for the purposes of satisfying the requirements of this Section shall clearly indicate the name,\nlocation, and size of vegetation to be installed as well as trees to be preserved.\n2. Plant material should be chosen from the lists of recommended plant species contained in Appendix and shall adhere to the minimum\nspecifications therein. Plant materials shall be reviewed for variety and suitability with regard to the eventual size and spread, susceptibility\nto diseases and pests, and appropriateness to existing soil, climate and site conditions.\n3. The height and canopy size at maturity of trees and other plantings should be considered with regard to potential conflicts with overhead\nlighting, utilities, etc.\nB. Issuance of Certificate of Occupancy\nA permanent certificate of occupancy shall not be issued, until all seeding, trees, and plant material have been placed in accordance with the\n161 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n", "page_number": 159, "page_range": [159, 160, 161], "highlight": ["The intent is <em>to</em> promote the use of exceptional design methods <em>to</em> achieve quality development without", "<em>Coverage</em> can be estimated by visual estimates, aerial photography or by land\nsurvey methods.\nA.", "native habitat or plant material located within the proposed landscaping or buffer area that meets the <em>percent</em>", "Prior <em>to</em> Development\nProperties shall not be clear-cut prior <em>to</em> undertaking development activities.", "during development towards the\nlandscaping requirement (see paragraph C, above) where the <em>percent</em> opacity"], "score": 5.285635, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Transitional Office\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"TO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"TO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"TO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building area as % of lot\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"pervious surface\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"percent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"%\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per cent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ratio\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 43\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nPlanned Development is typified by clustering residential, mixed use or non-residential development on a single parcel or smaller lot sizes (with\nsmaller yards) for additional common open space. Planned Development is generally larger scale projects to ensure sufficient open space can be\nincorporated into the development design. The Planned Development option provides increased design flexibility with varied development and\nhousing types, provided certain enhancements are incorporated into the design of the project.\nB. Conventional Development\nConventional development is a pattern of development that conforms with standard dimensional requirements and typically provides a majority\nof property owners with substantial area on their own property.\nDEVELOPMENT TYPES\nCONVENTIONAL\nPLANNED DEVELOPMENT\nExample Lot Yield: 308 Lots\nExample Lot Yield: 308 Lots\n4.3.1. Planned Development\nA. Intent\nThe intent of a Planned Development (PD) is to promote quality development by providing flexibility in the mixture of uses and in meeting\ndimensional and other requirements of this Ordinance. A PD utilizes exceptional design and best management practices that result in\ndevelopment that is aesthetically pleasing, promotes environmental sensitivity and makes more efficient use of the land, resulting in increased\nopen space.\nB. Planned Development Approval\nPlanned Development projects shall be approved in accordance with the Planned Development approval process found in Section 3.3.3 and the\nsite plan requirements as outlined in Article 3.\nC. Development Intensity\nThe building area coverage and number of dwelling units in a project utilizing the PD development standards shall be calculated as follows:\n1. The building area coverage shall be the dimensional standards of the applicable zoning District (i.e., R-7500, C-LD, etc.). However, the\ndeveloped area may be increased as a result of utilizing exceptional design and/or best management practices as provided in Section 6.1,\nDesign Flexibility. The extent of the allowable increase will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Planning Director (minor site plans)\nor the Planning Board (major site plans) in relation to the extent of the successful use of exceptional design and best management practices\nin the project site plan.\n2. The allowable number of dwelling units in a project shall be determined by dividing the gross site area of the development project by the\nnumber of dwelling units (density) permitted in the underlying district.\nCommentary: For example, the density for R-6000 with water and sewer is 7.3. The allowable number of units for a PD project with 20 acres\nwith an underlying R-6000 district would be up to 143 units, provided all other requirements were satisfied.\n3. Increases in the number of dwelling units permitted in a project may be considered through the density bonus provisions in this article.\nCommentary: There is no guarantee that the maximum density can be achieved on a particular site due to consideration such as required\nopen space, site area devoted to easements or roadways, and other site specific issues.\nD. Uses Permitted within Planned Developments\nUses permitted in the underlying district are permitted in Planned Developments. For residential development, the type of dwellings proposed\n(e.g., single family, multi-family, cottage style, cluster, etc.) shall be approved in conjunction with the PD approval. Mixed use projects are\nencouraged within residential and commercial Planned Developments to reduce travel and maximize the use of land. In residential districts,\n43 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\nNEW PAGE 44\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nnon-residential uses are allowed in approved Planned Developments as follows:\n1. Commercial and other non-residential uses within a residentially zoned PD shall be the same as those uses in the Commercial Low Density\n(C-LD) and Neighborhood Commercial (NC) Zoning Districts per Section 5.2.\n2. Business Park uses may be permitted within a PD per Section 5.2 subject to approval by the Planning Board of the specific uses. Decisions by\nthe Planning Board regarding the inclusion of Business Park uses in a PD shall be based on considerations including, but not limited to, the\ntype of proposed uses, size of the proposed operations in relation to the overall development, the character and nature of surrounding area.\n3. No more than twenty percent of the total acreage within a residentially zoned PD may be designated for non-residential, excluding golf\ncourses and other similar facilities.\n4. Non-residential uses within residentially zoned PDs shall be designed and located to be easily accessible to residents of the development. It\nis expected that such uses will also serve patrons from outside the development.\n5. Such use shall, at minimum, have one internal access to the development.\n6. Within non-residentially zoned PDs, the uses shall be the same as those uses in the underlying district along with uses in the C-LD and NC\ndistricts, including residential uses. Business Park uses may be permitted within a non-residentially zoned PDs subject to approval by the\nPlanning Board of the specific uses; provided however such specific approval of uses shall not be required for property zoned C-I or I-G.\nE. Planned Development Requirements\nPlanned Developments are subject to the site plan and improvement requirements of Article 6. Design and Performance Standards. Additionally,\nPDs are also subject to the following general requirements:\n1. Recreation Area\nOpen space and recreation area shall be provided as required in the subject district (per the PD dimensional table). See Section 6.4.4.B.\n2. Water and Wastewater\nGenerally, public or community water and wastewater service shall be required in all PD. However, the Planning Board may waive this\nrequirement during the PD approval process.\n3. Ownership of Development Site\nThe development site to be subdivided may be held in single ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, the site shall\nbe developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.\n4. PD Perimeter Compatibility\nCommentary: Generally, the perimeter buffer is required along all exterior boundaries, even if the adjacent property is vacant. This is intended\nto provide visual protection for residents of the PD and any development which may occur on adjacent properties.\nF. Buffers\n1. It is preferable that all buffers shall be a natural, undisturbed wooded area where possible, and shall count towards the provision of open\nspace for the development. See Section 6.3, Required Buffers.\n2. A project boundary buffer with a minimum opacity of 0.6 shall be required along all boundaries of a PD except portions of the project\nlocated adjoining a street or roadway. Adjustments to the buffering requirements may be allowed by the Planning Director for minor\nPlanned Developments and by the Planning board for major Planned Developments.\n3. A street buffer shall be required along all boundaries of a PD fronting on a street or roadway.\n4. Additional landscaping and buffering requirements may apply. See Section 6.2, Landscaping and Buffering.\nG. Private Utilities\n1. Provision of all utility services, including, but not limited to: gas, water, sewer, electric, cable, and telephone, shall be underground.\n2.\nAdequate easements and rights-of-way for ingress and egress for maintenance shall be provided.\nH. Street/Internal Trafficways\n1. Creative design of circulation routes and trafficways is encouraged. A base characteristic of a PUD is that the internal circulation routes or\nstreets do not follow fixed linear geometric lines as do most streets. Instead, circulation routes are curvilinear and of meandering character,\nto preserve tree and landscape features. Generous use of design elements such as curved streets, private restrictions for extremely low\nspeeds and other features to achieve slower-paced traffic movements are strongly encouraged.\n2. A minimum right-of-way of at least 35 feet in width shall be required for all internal roadways. Additionally right-of-way may be required to\naccommodate wider roads or utilities.\n3. A minimum paved street width of 20 feet shall be required for all internal two-way roadways. One-way roadways shall require a minimum\npaved street width of 14 feet.\n44 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\nNEW PAGE 45\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\n4. Pedestrian-oriented communities also are encouraged to enhance the quantity of pedestrian activity and to improve the quality of the\npedestrian experience. Planned subdivisions must adhere to the design standards for drainage and paving found in Section 6.11.5, Streets.\n5. Where the development is bound by two or more NC DOT on-system roads, at minimum access to each road shall be provided. Siren\nactivated gate systems shall be required for all unattended gates.\n6. Adequately constructed and maintained bike and/or hiking trails shall be counted toward the open space requirement. Bicycle lanes and\nmulti-use pathways that extend the minimum right-of-way width shall be designed in accordance with the North Carolina Bicycle Facilities\nPlanning and Design Guidelines Manual.\nI. Modifications of Standards Using Planned Development\nModification of the base dimensional standards shall require approval by the Planning Director (minor site plan) or the Planning Board (major\nsite plan) in conjunction with the Planned Development approval process found in Section 3.3.3.\nJ.
