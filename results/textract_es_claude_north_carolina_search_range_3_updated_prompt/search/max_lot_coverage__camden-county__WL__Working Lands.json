The\nWL\ndistrict is primarily intended to preserve and protect bona fide farms\nand resource lands for current or future agricultural use as well as to\nprotect the rural character of the area. One of the primary tools for\ncharacter protection is the requirement to configure residential\nsubdivisions of more than five lots as conservation subdivisions. The\nWorking\nconservation subdivision approach seeks to minimize the visibility of\nnew residential development from adjacent roadways through proper\nplacement and screening, and allows farmers to capture a portion of\nthe land's development potential while continuing to farm.\nLands\nConservation subdivisions allow a portion of a tract or site to be\ndeveloped with single-family detached homes while the balance of the\nsite is left as conservation or agricultural land. The district also\naccommodates a wide range of agricultural and agricultural-related\nuses like \"agri-tourism\" as well as service and support uses to the rural\ncommunity, including day care,

DISTRICT\nA.\nPurpose Statement\nThe Rural Residential (RR) district is established to accommodate\nlow density residential neighborhoods and supporting uses on lots\nRR\nnear bona fide farms and agricultural areas in the rural portion of\nthe County. The district is intended to accommodate residential\ndevelopment in ways that will not interfere with agricultural activity\nor negatively impact the rural character of the County. One of the\nRural\nprimary tools for character protection is the requirement to\nconfigure residential subdivisions of more than five lots as\nconservation subdivisions. The conservation subdivision approach\nseeks to minimize the visibility of new residential development from\nadjacent roadways through proper placement and screening. The\nResidential\ndistrict accommodates several differing agricultural uses and\nsingle-family detached homes. It also allows supporting uses like\neducational facilities, parks, public safety facilities, and utilities.\nDistrict regulations discourage uses that interfere with the\ndevelopment of residential dwellings or that are detrimental to the\nrural nature of the district.\nCamden County\nUnified Development Ordinance\n3-18\nLast Updated:\nAugust 1, 2022\nCELL (1, 1): \nB.\nCELL (1, 2): \nDimensional Requirements\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (2, 1): \n#\nCELL (2, 2): \nSTANDARD TYPE\nCELL (2, 3): \nREQUIREMENTS FOR\nTRADITIONAL\nDEVELOPMENT\nCELL (2, 4): \nREQUIREMENTS FOR\nCONSERVATION\nSUBDIVISIONS [1]\nCELL (3, 1): \nA\nCELL (3, 2): \nMinimum Development Size (acres)\nCELL (3, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (3, 4): \n10\nCELL (4, 1): \nB\nCELL (4, 2): \nMaximum Residential Density (units/acre)\nCELL (4, 3): \n0.5\nCELL (4, 4): \n1\nCELL (5, 1): \nC\nCELL (5, 2): \nMinimum Lot Area (acres)\nCELL (5, 3): \n2\nCELL (5, 4): \n1\nCELL (6, 1): \nD\nCELL (6, 2): \nMinimum Lot Width (feet) [2]\nCELL (6, 3): \n125\nCELL (6, 4): \n60\nCELL (7, 1): \nE\nCELL (7, 2): \nMaximum Lot Coverage (% of lot area) [3]\nCELL (7, 3): \n24\nCELL (7, 4): \n72\nCELL (8, 1): \nF\nCELL (8, 2): \nMinimum Open Space (% of development size) [4]\nCELL (8, 3): \nNone\nCELL (8, 4): \n50\nCELL (9, 1): \nG\nCELL (9, 2): \nMinimum Front Setback (feet)\nCELL (9, 3): \n50\nCELL (9, 4): \n20\nCELL (10, 1): \nH\nCELL (10, 2): \nMinimum Corner Side Setback (feet)\nCELL (10, 3): \n50\nCELL (10, 4): \n20\nCELL (11, 1): \nI\nCELL (11, 2): \nMinimum Interior Side Setback (feet)\nCELL (11, 3): \n25\nCELL (11, 4): \n10\nCELL (12, 1): \nCELL (12, 2): \nMinimum Rear Setback (feet)\nCELL (12, 3): \n25\nCELL (12, 4): \n15\nCELL (13, 1): \nK\nCELL (13, 2): \nMinimum Distance Between Buildings, Front-to-Back (feet) [5]\nCELL (13, 3): \n20\nCELL (13, 4): \n10\nCELL (14, 1): \nL\nCELL (14, 2): \nMinimum Distance Between Buildings, Side-to-Side (feet) [5]\nCELL (14, 3): \n15\nCELL (14, 4): \n5\nCELL (15, 1): \nM\nCELL (15, 2): \nMinimum Accessory Building Setback (feet)\nCELL (15, 3): \n10\nCELL (15, 4): \n3\nCELL (16, 1): \nN\nCELL (16, 2): \nMaximum Building Height (feet)\nCELL (16, 3): \n35 [6]\nCELL (16, 4): \n35\n\nNEW PAGE 109\nARTICLE 151.3 Zoning Districts\nSection 3.5 Residential Districts\n3.5.3 Rural Residential (RR) District\nNOTES:\n[1] Residential developments of five or more lots shall be configured as a conservation subdivision in accordance with the standards in\nSection 6.5.
