In determining the value of work in\nregard to this section, the value of multiple projects within the most recent two-year period shall be\naggregated.

In hilly\nterrain, clustering of buildings is encouraged as a strategy to avoid destroying sensitive natural\nareas.\n(f) Buildings shall be designed to harmonize with the existing topography, thereby minimizing\nland disruption.\n(g) Grading shall be held to a minimum and should complement natural land forms (such as\nsmooth gradations or terracing).\n(2) Relationships of the project to adjoining area.\n(a) Building projects shall not be designed as isolated units, but instead shall reflect the\ncontext of the adjoining properties.\n(b) Grading shall blend gently with contours of adjacent properties.\n(c) Buildings at the ends of streets, or at street corners, shall serve as visual \"terminals,\"\nserving to both unify and conclude the architectural statement made on the street.\n(d) Proposed recreation areas or uses shall complement nearby existing uses.

In making\nsuch a determination, the Board shall consider the following standards.\n(a) Use. Accessory systems are to be located on the same tract of land as a permitted\nresidential dwelling or commercial building, and are to be designed such that their primary function\nis to produce energy for consumption by the residential dwelling or commercial building with which\nthey share the lot or tract of land.\n(b) Frequency. A maximum of one wind energy system-accessory unit is permitted per lot.\n(c) Site location and setback. Accessory units are not permitted in street yards (the portion\nof the yard that abuts a street or road and is nearer to the street or road than the primary structure\non the lot). Wind energy systems may not be located in or overhang above the required building\nsetbacks for a lot or tract.\n(d) Height. Accessory units may not extend to a height of greater than 15 feet above the\nhighest point of the structure to which they are accessory or 50 feet in total height, whichever is\nlesser. Total height shall be measured vertically from the highest point of the wind energy system to\nthe ground.

Units cannot produce more than 40 decibels when in operation, measured at the\nlot line.\n(f) Operation. Units are required to have a cut-in speed of at least seven miles per hour.\n\"Cut-in speed\" is the wind velocity at which a wind energy system begins operation.\n(g) Compliance with other applicable laws. Wind energy systems must comply with\napplicable FAA regulations, including any necessary approvals for installations close to airports.\nEvidence of compliance or non-applicability shall be submitted with the application. Wind energy\nsystems must also comply with any other applicable state or local laws, including the \"Ridge Line\nLaw\" (G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 113A-205 et seq.).\n(h) Appearance. Wind energy systems shall maintain a galvanized finish or be painted to\nconform to the surrounding environment to reduce visual obtrusiveness. No wind energy system\nshould have any signage, or writing or pictures that may be construed as advertising placed on it at\nany time. In addition no flags, streamers or decorative items may be attached to the wind energy\nsystem.\n(i) Building permit requirements. A building permit shall be required. Building permit\napplications for wind energy systems shall be accompanied by standard drawings of the wind\nenergy system structure, including the tower, base, and footings. An engineering analysis of the\ntower certified by a licensed professional engineer which includes standards for ice/wind loading\nshall also be submitted. This analysis may be supplied by the manufacturer. A North Carolina\nregistered professional engineer must certify that the fall zone of the wind energy system and\nappurtenances will be within the boundaries of the property on which it is located.\n(j) Utility notification. No wind energy system shall be installed until evidence has been given\nthat the utility company has been informed of the customer's intent to install an interconnected\ncustomer-owned generator. Off-grid systems shall be exempt from this requirement.\n(k) Removal of defective or abandoned wind energy systems. Any wind energy system that\nis not functional shall be repaired by the owner or removed. In the event that the town becomes\naware of any wind energy system that is not operated for a continuous period of six months, the\ntown will notify the landowner by registered mail and provide 45 days for a written response. In\nsuch a response, the landowner shall set forth reasons for the operational difficulty and provide a\nreasonable timetable for corrective action. If the town deems the timetable for corrective action as\nunreasonable, the town shall notify the landowner and such landowner shall remove the energy\nsystem with 120 days of receipt of the notice.\n(S) Manufacturing/processing, light.\n(1) Purpose.

For\npurposes of this subdivision, the ODOR THRESHOLD is defined as the minimum concentration in\nair of a agas, vapor, or particulate matter that can be detected by the olfactory systems of a panel\nof healthy observers.\n(e) Require for its operations a daily average of more than 200 gallons of water per\nemployee.\n(f) Create any electrical disturbance that adversely affects any operations or equipment\nother than those of the creator of such disturbance, or otherwise causes, creates, or contributes to\nthe interference with electronic signals (including television and radio broadcasting transmissions)\nto the extent that the operation of any equipment not owned by the creator of such disturbance is\nadversely affected.\n(g) Store materials necessary for the manufacturing or processing activity in a location\nwhere such materials are visible from beyond the boundaries of the property on which the\nmanufacturing/processing facility is located.\n(h) Semi-trucks or tractor trailers may be used to deliver or pick up materials but may not\nremain on the premises continuously for more than 48 hours.
