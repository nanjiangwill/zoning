Rescission of Conditional Districts. The applicant shall secure a valid building\npermit or obtain approval of a site-specific development plan within a 12-month period\nfrom date of approval of the conditional district unless otherwise specified.

Use of the Designations Z and S in Table of Permissible Uses.\n16-10.2.1. Subject to Section 16-10.3, when used in connection with a particular use in the\nTable of Permissible Uses herein, the letter \"Z\" means that the use is permissible in the\nindicated zone with a zoning permit issued by the administrator. The letter \"S\" means a\nspecial use permit must be obtained from the Board of Commissioners.\n16-10.2.3. Subject to Section 16-10.3, use of the designation \"ZS\" means that a zoning permit\nmust be obtained if the development is located on a lot of one acre or less while a special use\npermit, respectively, must be obtained for all developments on lots in excess of one acre.\n16-10.2.4. Use of the designation\" Z\" and \"S\" for combination uses is explained in Section 16-\n10.10.\nSection 16-10.3. Board of Commissioners Jurisdiction Over Uses Otherwise Permissible With a\nZoning Permit. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, whenever the Table of\nPermissible Uses (interpreted in the light of Section 16-10.2 and the other provisions of this\narticle) provides that a use in a non-residential zone is permissible with a zoning permit, a special\nuse permit shall be required if the administrator finds that the proposed use would have an\nextraordinary impact on neighboring properties or the general public. In making this\ndetermination, the administrator shall consider, among other factors, whether the use is\nproposed for an undeveloped or previously developed lot, whether the proposed use constitutes\na change from one principal use classification to another, whether the use is proposed for a site\nthat poses peculiar traffic or other hazards or difficulties, and whether the proposed use is\nsubstantially unique or is likely to have impacts that differ substantially from those presented by\nother uses that are permissible in the zoning district in question.\nSection 16-10.4. Zoning Administrator Jurisdiction Over Uses Otherwise Permissible with SUP.\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of this article, whenever the Table of Permissible Uses\n(interpreted in the light of Section 16-10.2 and other provisions of this article) provides that a use\nin the CB, GB, or OI zoning district is permissible with special use permit, only a zoning permit\nshall be required instead if the administrator determines that the new use involves no more than\na change from one business to another, that no new substantial construction is involved, and\nthat the change in use would have a negligible adverse impact on neighboring property and the\npublic health and safety.\nSection 16-10.5. Permissible Uses and Specific Exclusions. The presumption established by this\nchapter is that most legitimate uses of land are permissible within at least one zoning district in\nthe town's planning jurisdiction. Therefore, because the list of permissible uses set forth in\nherein, (Table of Permissible Uses) cannot be all-inclusive, those uses that are listed may be\ninterpreted to include other uses that
