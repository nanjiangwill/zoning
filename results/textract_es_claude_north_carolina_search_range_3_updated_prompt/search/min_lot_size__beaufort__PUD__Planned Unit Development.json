is defined as an area characterized by an orderly integration of residential,\ncommercial (inclusive of offices and institutions), industrial, and open space land uses which\nconform to the design requirements contained herein.\nThe procedure for establishment of a PUD is provided in Article X of the Town of Beaufort\nSubdivision Ordinance. The Town recognizes the PUD as a special district where the\ndeveloper/owner proposes an integrated expansion of land combining mixed uses. The PUD\nwill be divided into sub-districts with each sub-district being one of the recognized districts\nwithin this Ordinance. Development within such sub-districts must be consistent with the\nrequirements and limitations of the normal district it correlates with, and this PUD section and\nits chapters and subchapters, the most stringent will apply.\nPUD developers are required to submit a site plan for review, as established in section 18 of\nthis Ordinance, in order for the planning board and Board of Commissioners (BOC) to look at\nthe relationships between the mixed use development. There are no minimum lot sizes or\nsetback requirements in this district however when the PUD comes for review, those items will\nbe evaluated to make sure they conform to the standards set forth in this section of this\nOrdinance.\nDuring consideration and approval of the master plan for a PUD project, or a preliminary plat\nfor a section of the master plan of the PUD project, the BOC, following a recommendation\nfrom the planning board, may vary the minimum requirements of this Ordinance or the Town\nof Beaufort Subdivision Ordinance. The master plan or preliminary plat applicant must show\nhow the PUD will be enhanced aesthetically, the environment will be better protected, or for\nany other reason the BOC determines appropriate, as long as the BOC determines such\nvariance does not harm the public interest. Density within a mixed use district may be varied\nfrom the limit specified within the district as long as the maximum overall density limit of six\ndwelling units per acre is maintained.\n1) Accessory Building Setback Requirements.\nAll accessory buildings must comply with the setback requirements as set forth in section\n2-F, section 6, section 15, and all sections of this Ordinance.\n2) Building Height Limitations.\nThe maximum building height for this district is forty feet (40').\n3) Permitted Uses.\nAll uses are allowed in the PUD District as a Special Use.\n4) PUD Minimum Size.\nFifteen acres.\n5) Maximum Overall Density.\nSix dwelling units per acre.\n101\n\nNEW PAGE 122\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\n6) Open Space Requirements.\nA minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the total PUD area shall be maintained as open\nspace. Street right-of-ways, parking lots, building areas (as defined), and lots held in\nindividual ownership shall not constitute any part of the required open space; however,\nbuilding areas for recreational facilities may be computed as open space. The BOC may\nalso require the owner/developer of the PUD to provide the Town with an option to\npurchase open space sites at a fair market value for the development of future public\nrecreational areas and/or municipal facilities. This option shall become null and void if the\nTown has not exercised the option prior to the completion of seventy percent (70%) of the\nproposed dwelling units within the PUD. Any open space land use not included under the\napproval of the PUD preliminary plat must be reviewed by the planning board and\napproved by the BOC prior to its development.\n7) Owner Association Required.\nThe creation of an owners association shall be mandatory for all PUD developments.\na) The owners association shall be organized and established as a legal entity prior to the\nconveyance of any lot, townhome, or condominium within the PUD project.\nb) Membership in the owners' association shall be mandatory for each owner of a lot,\ntownhome, or condominium within the PUD project.\nc) The owners association shall have the authority to assess its members to produce\nrevenues to cover the expenses of the association. Such assessments will be secured by\na lien.\nd)\nThe association shall be responsible for the payment of premiums for liability\ninsurance, taxes, maintenance of recreational and other facilities located on common\nareas, payment of assessment for public and private capital improvements made to or\nfor the benefit of the common areas, payment of assessment and maintenance of any\nprivate street, and for such other purposes as the organizing documents provide.\ne) A PUD may have a master association where all lot, townhome, and condominium\nowners are mandatory members. There also may be additional owners associations\nor\n\"section associations\" for the individual housing sections developed within a PUD\nwhere only the lot, townhome, or condominium owners in such section are members.\n8) Residential Development.\nThe applicable area, yard, and height requirements as contained in section 4 of this\nOrdinance shall be adhered to. With the exception of pre-designated lots employing the\nzero lot line provisions, the applicable yard setback requirements for single-family\nstructures shall be based upon the square footage of the lot. All multi-family developments\nshall adhere to the applicable development regulations contained herein. The approved\npreliminary and final site plans for the PUD project shall designate the district category\nwhich shall apply to each parcel of property.\n9) Commercial Development.\nAny commercial land use will be developed under the regulations of this Ordinance. No\ncommercial construction may begin until at least fifty percent (50%) of the proposed\nresidential dwelling units or five hundred TCA dwelling units within the PUD, whichever\nis smaller, are completed and ready for occupancy.\n102\n", "page_number": 120, "page_range": [120, 121, 122], "highlight": ["CELL (13, 2): \nUtility Facility\n\nNEW PAGE 121\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town

The purpose of this district is to provide\nrelief to existing lots of record which make them difficult to be developed as single-family\nresidences. The RS-5 district has a fifty percent (50%) lot coverage restriction which must be\nmaintained. No buildings, houses, or structures, excepting noncommercial docks or piers as\nspecified in section 2-H of this Ordinance, will be erected on the south side of Front Street in\nthis district.

This includes residential and commercial uses with a low noise and traffic\nimpact which would generally be considered compatible with a residential area which may or\nmay not have buffering requirements as documented in section 19 of this Ordinance. Uses in\nthis district which require potable water or sanitary sewer must be connected to municipal\nwater and municipal sewer.\nI) PUD Planned Unit Development.\nPurpose: This district is defined as an area characterized by an orderly integration of\nresidential, commercial (inclusive of offices and institutions), industrial, and open space land\nuses which conform to the design requirements contained herein.\nJ) CS-MU Cedar Street Mixed-Use District.\nPurpose: The reason for this district is to protect, enhance and guide the redevelopment of the\nCedar Street corridor by reducing visual clutter through the implementation of commercial\ndesign standards and selecting the appropriate type of uses for this district. These standards are\ndesigned to improve the aesthetics, traffic congestion and provide for a solid and vibrant tax\nbase as well as promote the public health, safety and welfare of the town.\nK) H-BD Historic Business District.\nPurpose: The intent of this district is to allow land and structures which provide personal\nservices, retailing, and business services compatible with the district's historic character. This\ndistrict should be limited to the Town's Historic Overlay District and may be subject to\nadditional requirements found within the \"Design Guidelines for the Beaufort Historic District\n& Landmarks.' Uses in this district which require potable water or sanitary sewer must be\nconnected to municipal water and municipal sewer.\n63\n", "page_number": 81, "page_range": [81, 82, 83], "highlight":
