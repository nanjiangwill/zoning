It shall\nnot be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use\ncan be made of the property.\n2.\nThe hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location,\nsize or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as\nhardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general\npublic, may not be the basis for granting a variance.\n3.\nThe hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The\nact of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the\ngranting of the variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.\n4.\nThe requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the ordinance,\nsuch that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.\nb.\nOther Considerations\nIn addition to the making the required findings in subsection (a) above, the BOA may also consider\nthe following:\n1.\nThe variance approval is the minimum necessary to make possible the reasonable use of\nthe land, building, or structure;\n2.\nAll property taxes on the land subject to the variance application have been paid in full;\n3.\nNone of the following may be used as the basis for approving a variance:\nA.\nNeither the nonconforming use of lands, buildings, or structures in the same\nzoning district, or the permitted use of lands, buildings, or structures in other\nzoning districts, or personal circumstances;\nB.\nA request for a particular use that is expressly, or by inference, prohibited in the\nzoning district;\nC.\nHardships resulting from factors other than application of the relevant standards\nof this Ordinance;\nD.\nThe fact that land or a structure may be utilized more profitably or be more\nmarketable with a variance;\nE.\nThe citing of other conforming or nonconforming uses of land or structures in the\nsame or other zoning districts; or\nF.\nFinancial hardship.\n2.\nSpecial Flood Hazard Area Variance Review Standards\nThe standards for variance to the special flood hazard area provisions is in Section 2.3.26.C, Variance\nProcedure.\n3.\nWatershed Protection Variance Review Standards\nDecisions or recommendations on applications to the watershed protection standards shall be based on the\nfollowing three findings (subsections a-c), which shall be supported by written findings of fact and\nconclusions of law:\na.\nThere are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter\nof the Ordinance.

Merely proving that\nthe variance would permit to be made from the property will not be considered adequate\nto justify the BOA in granting a variance. Moreover, the BOA shall consider whether the\nvariance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of this Ordinance that will make\npossible the reasonable use of his or her property.\n2.\nThe hardship results from the application of the Ordinance to the property rather than from\nother factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship.\n3.\nThe hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such as its size,\nshape, or topography, which is different from that of neighboring property.\n4.\nThe hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly\nviolates this Ordinance, or who purchases the property after the effective date of the\nOrdinance, and then comes to the BOA for relief.\nCamden County\n2-63\nLast Updated:\nUnified Development Ordinance\nFebruary 4, 2019\n", "page_number": 80, "page_range": [80, 81, 82], "highlight": ["allow certain deviations from the dimensional standards of this Ordinance (such as\nheight, setback, <em>lot</em>", "<em>coverage</em>, or similar numerical standards) when the landowner demonstrates that, owing to special\ncircumstances", "Variances to the special flood hazard area provisions in Section\nPROCEDURE\n3.8.3, <em>Special</em> <em>Flood</em> <em>Hazard</em>", "<em>Area</em> <em>Overlay</em> (<em>SFHA</em>), are processed\nin accordance with the procedure described in this section and the", "Pre-application Conference\nstandards in Section 3.8.3, <em>Special</em> <em>Flood</em> <em>Hazard</em> <em>Area</em> <em>Overlay</em>\n(<em>SFHA</em>)."], "score": 17.723211, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Special Flood Hazard Area Overlay\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"SFHA\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"SFHA\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"SFHA\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building area as % of lot\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"pervious surface\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"percent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"%\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per cent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ratio\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 214\nARTICLE 151.4 Use Regulations\nSection 4.4 Use-Specific Standards\n4.4.4 Commercial Uses\nBed and breakfast inn uses shall comply with the following standards:\na.\nA bed and breakfast inn shall take place within a building that was designed for and used as\na\nsingle-family detached dwelling.\nb.\nA bed and breakfast inn shall be operated primarily by persons who reside within the dwelling unit,\nwith the assistance of not more than the equivalent of one, full-time employee.\nC.\nThe building that houses the dwelling unit may not be expanded by more than ten percent of its\noriginal floor area, nor may rooms for rent be added onto or created within accessory buildings.\nd.\nThere shall be at least one parking space per sleeping room.\ne.\nThere shall only be one kitchen and all meals served on the premises shall be for overnight quests.\nf.\nNot more than one sign may be erected on the lot where such a use is located.
