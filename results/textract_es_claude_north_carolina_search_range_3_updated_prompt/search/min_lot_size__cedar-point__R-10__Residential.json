PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING REQUIREMENTS\nSubject to other standards outlined within this Ordinance, including Section 7.3\nBUFFERS, all required parking areas shall be required to adhere to the following\nadditional interior buffering requirements:\n1. For every ten (10) required parking spaces, there shall be an area within the\nparking lot four hundred (400) square feet in area either left in a natural vegetative\nstate or planted with trees and shrubs. Exception: medical facility parking lots\nmay be as obstruction free and conducive to water, ice and debris minimization\nand removal as practicable. Landscaping within parking areas, particularly, but\nnot limited to, independent internal vegetated islands that may interfere with\naccess is therefore not required.\n2. For commercial/industrial land uses that, due to their overall size, are required to\nprovide more than fifty (50) parking spaces to support the proposed land use, the\nTown of Cedar Point shall allow for a reduction in the number of required parking\nspaces based on the following incentive plan:\n(a)\nRequired Parking spaces may be reduced by ten (10) percent if there is an\nadditional one thousand (1,000) square feet of land area within the required\nparking lot dedicated as interior buffer space;\n(b)\nRequired parking spaces may be reduced by twenty (20) percent if there is\nan additional three thousand (3,000) square feet of land area within the\nrequired parking lot dedicated as interior buffering space;\n(c) Required parking spaces may be reduced by thirty (30) percent if there is an\nadditional five thousand (5,000) square feet of land area within the required\nparking lot dedicated as interior buffering space;\n(d)\nThese allowances shall be in addition to the mandatory buffering\nrequirements outlined within this section\n3. The maintenance and upkeep of all interior buffer areas shall be the responsibility\nof the property owner.\n4. Unless deemed improbable by the Cedar Point Planning Board, all interior buffer\nareas shall be used as bio-retention storm water devices not to be included as part\nof the overall storm water retention for the project.\n5.\nAt least fifty (50) percent of the trees planted shall be of a shade/canopy species\nas referenced in Appendix B and other vegetation that may be suitable for the area\nper Cedar Point Planning Board and other technical assistance personnel as\ndeemed necessary.\n6. In support of the above, the following standards shall apply to interior plantings:\n(a) All plantings shall be evenly distributed throughout the parking facility.\n(b) All interior plantings shall be curbed or otherwise physically protected.\nWhen practical, interior planting areas should be used as storm water\ndevices. This can be accomplished with inverted curb sections, grates,\npipes, etc.\n(c) Consecutive parking spaces shall incorporate landscape peninsulas no more\nPage\n185\n", "page_number": 183,

PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING REQUIREMENTS\nSubject to other standards outlined within this Ordinance, including Section 7.3\nBUFFERS, all required parking areas shall be required to adhere to the following\nadditional interior buffering requirements:\n1. For every ten (10) required parking spaces, there shall be an area within the\nparking lot four hundred (400) square feet in area either left in a natural vegetative\nstate or planted with trees and shrubs. Exception: medical facility parking lots\nmay be as obstruction free and conducive to water, ice and debris minimization\nand removal as practicable. Landscaping within parking areas, particularly, but\nnot limited to, independent internal vegetated islands that may interfere with\naccess is therefore not required.\n2. For commercial/industrial land uses that, due to their overall size, are required to\nprovide more than fifty (50) parking spaces to support the proposed land use, the\nTown of Cedar Point shall allow for a reduction in the number of required parking\nspaces based on the following incentive plan:\n(a)\nRequired Parking spaces may be reduced by ten (10) percent if there is an\nadditional one thousand (1,000) square feet of land area within the required\nparking lot dedicated as interior buffer space;\n(b)\nRequired parking spaces may be reduced by twenty (20) percent if there is\nan additional three thousand (3,000) square feet of land area within the\nrequired parking lot dedicated as interior buffering space;\n(c) Required parking spaces may be reduced by thirty (30) percent if there is an\nadditional five thousand (5,000) square feet of land area within the required\nparking lot dedicated as interior buffering space;\n(d)\nThese allowances shall be in addition to the mandatory buffering\nrequirements outlined within this section\n3. The maintenance and upkeep of all interior buffer areas shall be the responsibility\nof the property owner.\n4. Unless deemed improbable by the Cedar Point Planning Board, all interior buffer\nareas shall be used as bio-retention storm water devices not to be included as part\nof the overall storm water retention for the project.\n5.\nAt least fifty (50) percent of the trees planted shall be of a shade/canopy species\nas referenced in Appendix B and other vegetation that may be suitable for the area\nper Cedar Point Planning Board and other technical assistance personnel as\ndeemed necessary.\n6. In support of the above, the following standards shall apply to interior plantings:\n(a) All plantings shall be evenly distributed throughout the parking facility.\n(b) All interior plantings shall be curbed or otherwise physically protected.\nWhen practical, interior planting areas should be used as storm water\ndevices. This can be accomplished with inverted curb sections, grates,\npipes, etc.\n(c) Consecutive parking spaces shall incorporate landscape peninsulas no more\nPage\n185\n\nNEW PAGE 186\nthan fifteen (15) spaces apart and at least the ends of all parking rows.\nPeninsulas shall contain at least one hundred (100) square feet in area and\nat least eight (8) feet in width, measured from back of curb/barrier to back\nof curb/barrier.\n7. For every protected tree, as defined in Section 7.4, which is retained in a parking\nfacility and/or street yard in addition to the requirements of Sections 7.4.E and\n7.5.I., a reduction to the interior planting requirement fifteen percent (15%) may\nbe allowed. The reduction shall be limited to a maximum credit of four (4)\nprotected trees retained.\n8. When a parking facility is within fifty (50) feet of the public right-of-way a\nperimeter planted strip shall be installed, consisting of a buffer (three feet or less\nin height) incorporated into the street-yard.\n9. The Board of Commissioners may waive all or part of the requirements of this\nsection for any facility, which is limited to periodic or intermittent use for\nvehicular parking, such as parking lots for churches or recreational facilities,\nprovided the facility is completely covered by grass or otherwise presents a\nlandscaped effect.\n10. The Board of Commissioners may waive the requirements of this section for\ntemporary parking lots when determined that a waiver is necessary to relieve\nhardship and will not violate the purposes of this section. Any such waiver shall\nnot exceed one year.\n7.14\nPOSTING REQUIREMENTS FOR STRUCTURES\nA. PURPOSE AND INTENT\nIt is the general purpose and intent of this section to protect and promote the public\nhealth, safety, and general welfare by requiring the posting of the correct and current\n911-address on each structure or residence.\nB. APPLICABILITY\nAll new and existing residential and non-residential structures must meet the\nrequirements of this section.\nC. TIME REQUIREMENTS\nWithin 30 days of assignment or notification of change of a structure number, the\nowner of said structure shall post the assigned structures current and correct 911-\naddress in compliance with the requirements herein.\nD. POSTING LOCATIONS\nThe official 911-address number must be displayed on the front of a building or at the\nentrance to a building, which is most clearly visible from the street or road during\nboth day and night.\nIf a building is more that seventy-five (75) feet from any road, the address number\nshall be displayed at the end of the driveway or easement nearest the road, which\nprovides access to the building.\nE.
