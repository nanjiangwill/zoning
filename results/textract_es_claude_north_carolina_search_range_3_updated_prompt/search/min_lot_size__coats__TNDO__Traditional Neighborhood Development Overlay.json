A TND\nis urban in form, is typically an extension of the existing developed area of the\nTown and has an overall residential density of up to eleven (11) dwelling units per\nacre. TNDO districts should have a significant portion of land dedicated to\nimproved open spaces, and reserve un-improved open spaces where\nenvironmentally sensitive areas are located.\n(B.)
