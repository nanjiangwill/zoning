The Board of Commissioners recognizes that the Parking Requirements\nset forth in Figure 10-1 cannot and does not cover every possible\nsituation that may arise. Therefore, in cases not specifically covered, the\nZoning Administrator is authorized to determine the parking\nrequirements using this table as a guide. The Zoning Administrator may\nalso require more parking or allow less parking whenever s/he finds that\nsuch a deviation is more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in the\nTable of Parking Requirements.\n10.1.6.\nImprovement and Location Standards.\nA.
