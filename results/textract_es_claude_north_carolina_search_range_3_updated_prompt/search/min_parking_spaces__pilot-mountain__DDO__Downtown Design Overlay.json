However, this\nexemption is not applicable to multiple contiguous lots under single ownership.\n3. Cluster Development. Minimum lot sizes are not applicable to single-family cluster\ndevelopments projects; however, the total number of lots shall not exceed the number of lots\nallowed for single-family detached developments.

Buffer Zone Required\na. A buffer zone for the purposes of this requirement is defined as an area of natural\nor\nplanted vegetation through which storm water runoff flows in a diffuse manner so that\nthe runoff does not become channelized and which provides for infiltration of the\nrunoff and filtering of pollutants. The buffer zone is measured from the normal pool\nelevation of impounded structures and from the bank of each side of streams and\nrivers.\nb. No new development is allowed in the buffer zone, except for water dependent\nstructures and public projects such as road crossings and green ways where no\npractical alternative exists.\nC. These activities should minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff away from the\nsurface waters and maximize the utilization of storm water best management\npractices.\nd. A minimum thirty (30') foot vegetative buffer zone for development activities is\nrequired along all perennial waters indicated on the most recent versions of U.S.G.S.\n1:24,000 (7.5 minute) scale topographic maps or as determined by local government\nstudies, unless a high density option is chosen and then a one-hundred (100') foot\nbuffer zone is required.

Division of Community Assistance.\nb.\nThe Ordinance Administrator shall keep a record of minor and major watershed\nvariances to these overlay provisions. The record of all minor watershed variances\nshall be submitted to the Environmental Management Commission on an annual\nbasis and shall provide a description of each project receiving a variance and the\nreasons for granting the variance.\n6.
