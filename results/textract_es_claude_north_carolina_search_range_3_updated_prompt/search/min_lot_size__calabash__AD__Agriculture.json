Corner Lots.\n(A)\nOn corner lots, the side yard on that side of the lot abutting the side street shall not\nbe less than one-half the front yard setback requirement on that side street.\n(B)\nAccessory buildings on corner lots located on that side of the lot abutting the side\nstreet shall not project beyond the full front yard requirement on that side street.\nNote 3.\nAll buildings in the Central Business and Highway Commercial Districts shall be\npermanent fully enclosed construction.

Front Yard Modifications in Residential Districts.\n(A)\nWhere 50% or more of the lots in any block or within 600 feet on both sides of the\nproposed structure, whichever is less, is composed of lots which have been\ndeveloped with buildings whose front, side, or rear yards are less than the minimum\nrequired as specified in the dimensional requirements, the required front, side or\nrear yard shall be the average depth of front, side or rear yards of the developed\nlots, or the minimum dimensional requirements as specified in the Table of Area,\nYard, and Height Requirements, whichever is less. Provided further that if any lot\nlies between two buildings which are less than 100 feet apart, the required front\nand/or rear yards for such lot shall be no greater than the average front and/or rear\nyard of the two adjoining lots or 25 feet, whichever is more.\n(B)\nWhen 50% or more of the lots in any block or within 600 feet on both sides of the\nproposed structure, whichever is less, is composed of lots with buildings that have\nfront yards greater than the minimum required front yard, as specified in the Table\nof Area, Yard, and Height Requirements, the required front yard shall be the\naverage depth of front yards on the developed lots. Provided further that if any lot\nlies between two buildings which are less than 100 feet apart, the required front\nyard for such lot shall be no less than the average front yard of the two adjoining\nlots.\nNote 6. Other Yard Modifications.\nWhere through lots occur, the required front yard shall be provided on both streets.\nArchitectural features such as open or enclosed fire escapes, steps, outside stairways,\nbalconies and similar features, and uncovered porches may not project more than four\nfeet into any required yard. Sills, cornices, leaves, gutters, buttresses, ornamental features,\nand similar items may not project into any required yard more than 30 inches.\n(A)\nRelief From Zoning Set Back Requirements: Property owners wishing to\nconstruct new structures or additions on their property may seek relief from\nbuilding setbacks based on one of the following:\n(1) The irregular shape of the parcel (i.e., pie shaped lots) makes conformance\nwith all the building setbacks impractical to design or build a new home\nequal to 20% of the gross parcel area.\n(2) The location of a new septic field (as required by the County Health\nDepartment) on the property prevents conformance as noted in Item 1\nabove.\n(3) The location of an unchanged existing septic field (as previously approved\nby the County Health Department) on the property prevents conformance as\nnoted in Item 1 above.\nArticle 11.
