Nonconforming uses may be continued subject to the limitations noted herein. For purposes of determining whether a right to\ncontinue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section, all buildings, activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to\nbe considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building or one space in a\nnonconforming manufactured home park for 90 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as\nthe apartment building or manufactured home park as a whole is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a\nnonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter.\n(A) Expansions: no nonconforming use shall be extended, expanded, enlarged or moved to occupy a different or greater area of land,\nbuildings or structures than was occupied by such use at the time it became nonconforming; provided, however, a nonconforming use may be\nextended throughout any parts of a building which were specifically designed and arranged for such use at the time it became nonconforming.\n(B) No building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered\nunless such building or structure is thereafter devoted to a conforming use; provided, however, such building or structure may be enlarged or\nextended upon prior authorization from the Board of Adjustment, which authorization shall not be granted unless the Board of Adjustment\nmakes each of the following findings of fact.\n(1) The proposed enlargement or extension shall be minor or insignificant in relation to the existing building or structure.\n(2) The proposed enlargement or extension shall not increase the intensity of the nonconforming use, which is to say, it will not result in\nan increase in dwelling units for a residential use nor in gross floor area for a nonresidential use.\n(3) The proposed enlargement or extension is designed so that it will not render the use of the property any less compatible than it is in\nits existing circumstances.\n(4) The authorization of such proposed enlargement or extension is not otherwise contrary to the public health, safety or welfare.\n(C) (1) A nonconforming use of a structure may not be changed to another nonconforming use unless such change is authorized by the\nBoard of Adjustment.
