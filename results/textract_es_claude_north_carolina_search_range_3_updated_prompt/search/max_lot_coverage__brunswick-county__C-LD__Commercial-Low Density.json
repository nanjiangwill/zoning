Planned Development\nA. Intent\nThe intent of a Planned Development (PD) is to promote quality development by providing flexibility in the mixture of uses and in meeting\ndimensional and other requirements of this Ordinance. A PD utilizes exceptional design and best management practices that result in\ndevelopment that is aesthetically pleasing, promotes environmental sensitivity and makes more efficient use of the land, resulting in increased\nopen space.\nB. Planned Development Approval\nPlanned Development projects shall be approved in accordance with the Planned Development approval process found in Section 3.3.3 and the\nsite plan requirements as outlined in Article 3.\nC. Development Intensity\nThe building area coverage and number of dwelling units in a project utilizing the PD development standards shall be calculated as follows:\n1. The building area coverage shall be the dimensional standards of the applicable zoning District (i.e., R-7500, C-LD, etc.). However, the\ndeveloped area may be increased as a result of utilizing exceptional design and/or best management practices as provided in Section 6.1,\nDesign Flexibility. The extent of the allowable increase will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Planning Director (minor site plans)\nor the Planning Board (major site plans) in relation to the extent of the successful use of exceptional design and best management practices\nin the project site plan.\n2. The allowable number of dwelling units in a project shall be determined by dividing the gross site area of the development project by the\nnumber of dwelling units (density) permitted in the underlying district.\nCommentary: For example, the density for R-6000 with water and sewer is 7.3. The allowable number of units for a PD project with 20 acres\nwith an underlying R-6000 district would be up to 143 units, provided all other requirements were satisfied.\n3. Increases in the number of dwelling units permitted in a project may be considered through the density bonus provisions in this article.\nCommentary: There is no guarantee that the maximum density can be achieved on a particular site due to consideration such as required\nopen space, site area devoted to easements or roadways, and other site specific issues.\nD. Uses Permitted within Planned Developments\nUses permitted in the underlying district are permitted in Planned Developments. For residential development, the type of dwellings proposed\n(e.g., single family, multi-family, cottage style, cluster, etc.) shall be approved in conjunction with the PD approval. Mixed use projects are\nencouraged within residential and commercial Planned Developments to reduce travel and maximize the use of land. In residential districts,\n43 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\nNEW PAGE 44\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nnon-residential uses are allowed in approved Planned Developments as follows:\n1. Commercial and other non-residential uses within a residentially zoned PD shall be the same as those uses in the Commercial Low Density\n(C-LD) and Neighborhood Commercial (NC) Zoning Districts per Section 5.2.\n2. Business Park uses may be permitted within a PD per Section 5.2 subject to approval by the Planning Board of the specific uses. Decisions by\nthe Planning Board regarding the inclusion of Business Park uses in a PD shall be based on considerations including, but not limited to, the\ntype of proposed uses, size of the proposed operations in relation to the overall development, the character and nature of surrounding area.\n3. No more than twenty percent of the total acreage within a residentially zoned PD may be designated for non-residential, excluding golf\ncourses and other similar facilities.\n4. Non-residential uses within residentially zoned PDs shall be designed and located to be easily accessible to residents of the development. It\nis expected that such uses will also serve patrons from outside the development.\n5. Such use shall, at minimum, have one internal access to the development.\n6. Within non-residentially zoned PDs, the uses shall be the same as those uses in the underlying district along with uses in the C-LD and NC\ndistricts, including residential uses. Business Park uses may be permitted within a non-residentially zoned PDs subject to approval by the\nPlanning Board of the specific uses; provided however such specific approval of uses shall not be required for property zoned C-I or I-G.\nE. Planned Development Requirements\nPlanned Developments are subject to the site plan and improvement requirements of Article 6. Design and Performance Standards. Additionally,\nPDs are also subject to the following general requirements:\n1. Recreation Area\nOpen space and recreation area shall be provided as required in the subject district (per the PD dimensional table). See Section 6.4.4.B.\n2. Water and Wastewater\nGenerally, public or community water and wastewater service shall be required in all PD. However, the Planning Board may waive this\nrequirement during the PD approval process.\n3. Ownership of Development Site\nThe development site to be subdivided may be held in single ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, the site shall\nbe developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.\n4. PD Perimeter Compatibility\nCommentary: Generally, the perimeter buffer is required along all exterior boundaries, even if the adjacent property is vacant. This is intended\nto provide visual protection for residents of the PD and any development which may occur on adjacent properties.\nF. Buffers\n1. It is preferable that all buffers shall be a natural, undisturbed wooded area where possible, and shall count towards the provision of open\nspace for the development. See Section 6.3, Required Buffers.\n2. A project boundary buffer with a minimum opacity of 0.6 shall be required along all boundaries of a PD except portions of the project\nlocated adjoining a street or roadway. Adjustments to the buffering requirements may be allowed by the Planning Director for minor\nPlanned Developments and by the Planning board for major Planned Developments.\n3. A street buffer shall be required along all boundaries of a PD fronting on a street or roadway.\n4. Additional landscaping and buffering requirements may apply. See Section 6.2, Landscaping and Buffering.\nG. Private Utilities\n1. Provision of all utility services, including, but not limited to: gas, water, sewer, electric, cable, and telephone, shall be underground.\n2.\nAdequate easements and rights-of-way for ingress and egress for maintenance shall be provided.\nH. Street/Internal Trafficways\n1. Creative design of circulation routes and trafficways is encouraged. A base characteristic of a PUD is that the internal circulation routes or\nstreets do not follow fixed linear geometric lines as do most streets. Instead, circulation routes are curvilinear and of meandering character,\nto preserve tree and landscape features. Generous use of design elements such as curved streets, private restrictions for extremely low\nspeeds and other features to achieve slower-paced traffic movements are strongly encouraged.\n2. A minimum right-of-way of at least 35 feet in width shall be required for all internal roadways. Additionally right-of-way may be required to\naccommodate wider roads or utilities.\n3. A minimum paved street width of 20 feet shall be required for all internal two-way roadways. One-way roadways shall require a minimum\npaved street width of 14 feet.\n44 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n", "page_number": 42, "page_range": [42, 43, 44], "highlight": ["<em>C</em>-<em>LD</em> <em>Commercial</em> <em>Low</em> <em>Density</em>;\nB.

Workforce units shall be incorporated throughout the project, and shall not be distinguishable from market-rate units through location,\ngrouping, design or other physical characteristics.\niv. In single-family and duplex developments, lot sizes and yard requirements in internal lots may be reduced up to 20% in order to\nincorporate the additional units; however, no decrease in lot size or yard requirements in perimeter lots shall be permitted.\nV. In multifamily housing developments, height allowance up to 60 feet with flexible setback requirements may be allowed, depending on\nthe design of the project, number of units, etc.\nvi. Units added through this program shall not increase the amount of open space otherwise required for the project.\nvii. Affordability limits in rental units shall be adhered to for a minimum of 15 years. An annual report shall be provided by the project\ndeveloper or manager to the County or designated personnel which identifies the incomes of persons residing in the workforce units,\nand the rents or initial sales price being charged, to verify these are within the established limits.\nviii. Affordability in for-sale units shall be required to be adhered to only in the initial sale.\nix. Compliance measures may be required at the time of approval, including but not limited to contracts, restrictive covenants, deed\nrestrictions, and stipulated penalties.\nB.

Existing vegetation should be used to satisfy these planting requirements where possible (see Section 6.1.4, Existing Vegetation).\nCredit may also be given for use of best management practices and exceptional design.\nMINIMUM REQUIRED PROJECT BOUNDARY BUFFER\n167 of 293\n3/10/24. 20:38\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nRural Low\nDensity\nResidential\nCELL (1, 3): \nR-7500,\nR-6000,\nand SBR-6000\nCELL (1, 4): \nMR-3200 and\nN-C\nCELL (1, 5): \nC-I\nCELL (1, 6): \nC-LD and RU-I\nCELL (1, 7): \nI-G\nCELL (2, 1): \nRural Residential\nCELL (2, 2): \n0 1 /0 2\nCELL (2, 3): \n.2/.2\nCELL (2, 4): \n.4/.6\nCELL (2, 5): \n.2/.8\nCELL (2, 6): \n.2/.8\nCELL (2, 7): \n.2/1.0\nCELL (3, 1): \nR-7500, R-6000, and SBR-6000\nCELL (3, 2): \n.2/.2\nCELL (3, 3): \n0 /0 2\nCELL (3, 4): \n.2/.4\nCELL (3, 5): \n.2/.6\nCELL (3, 6): \n.2/.6\nCELL (3, 7): \n.2/1.0\nCELL (4, 1): \nMR-3200 and N-C\nCELL (4, 2): \n.4/.6\nCELL (4, 3): \n.2/.4\nCELL (4, 4): \n0 /0 2\nCELL (4, 5): \n.2/.6\nCELL (4, 6): \n.2/.6\nCELL (4, 7): \n.2/1.0\nCELL (5, 1): \nC-I\nCELL (5, 2): \n.6/.8\nCELL (5, 3): \n.4/.6\nCELL (5, 4): \n.4/.6\nCELL (5, 5): \n0/0\nCELL (5, 6): \n.2/.4\nCELL (5, 7): \n.2/1.0\nCELL (6, 1): \nC-LD and RU-I\nCELL (6, 2): \n.6/.8\nCELL (6, 3): \n.4/.6\nCELL (6, 4): \n.4/.6\nCELL (6, 5): \n.2/.4\nCELL (6, 6): \n0/0 2\nCELL (6, 7): \n.2/1.0\nCELL (7, 1): \nI-G\nCELL (7, 2): \n.8/1.0\nCELL (7, 3): \n.8/1.0\nCELL (7, 4): \n.6/1.0\nCELL (7, 5): \n.6/1.0\nCELL (7, 6): \n.4/.6\nCELL (7, 7): \n0/0\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (2, 1): \nBuffer Depth and Plants Required Per 100 Linear Feet\nCELL (2, 2): \nBuffer Depth and Plants Required Per 100 Linear Feet\nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (2, 5): \nCELL (3, 1): \nRequired Opacity [1]\nCELL (3, 2): \nAlternative 1\nPlantings\nCELL (3, 3): \nAlternative 2\nPlantings\nCELL (3, 4): \nAlternative 3 Plantings +\n6-Foot (Height) Fence [2]\nCELL (3, 5): \nAlternative 4 Plantings +\n6-Foot (Height) Wall [3]\nCELL (4, 1): \n0.2\nCELL (4, 2): \n10 feet\n1 canopy\n1 understory\n7 shrubs\nCELL (4, 3): \n10 feet\n1 canopy\n2 understory\n3 shrubs\nCELL (4, 4): \nNot available\nCELL (4, 5): \nNot available\nCELL (5, 1): \n0.4\nCELL (5, 2): \n20 feet\n2 canopy\n4 understory\n25 shrubs\nCELL (5, 3): \n20 feet\n2 canopy\n6 understory\n9 shrubs\nCELL (5, 4): \n15 feet width\n3 understory\n3 shrubs\nCELL (5, 5): \n10 feet width\n3 understory\n3 shrubs\n\nNEW PAGE 168\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nNotes:\n[1] Required Opacity X 100 = % Required Opacity (e.g., .2 times 100 = 20% Required Opacity).\n[2] When Alternative 3 is selected, the fence type must be 100% opaque and comprised of either wooden or vinyl material.\n[3] When Alternative 4 is selected, the wall must be designed in conformance with Section 6.3.10.A Walls, and Section 6.3.10, Walls, Berms,\nand Fences within Buffers.\nCommentary: Suppose you are required to install a buffer with an opacity of 0.6 and you elect to use Alternative 1. Your buffer would have to\nbe 30 feet deep (on average) and you would have to plant 3 canopy tress, 6 understory trees, and 34 shrubs for every 100 feet of buffer\nlength.\n5. In lieu of a project boundary buffer, the Street Buffer applies (See Section 6.3.8) when both a 1) recorded easement for ingress and egress or\na right-of-way exists (whether developed or undeveloped) and 2) a zoning district designation of the adjacent parcel(s) is different than that\nof the subject parcel.\n6. When proposed residential units adjoin an existing bona fide farming activity in a Voluntary Agricultural District, the minimum buffer depth\nshall be 50 feet, with a minimum opacity of 0.2.\nB. Hardship Relief\nThe buffer requirement may be modified by the Planning Director upon a finding that a modification would be consistent with the purpose and\nintent of this Article, with any adopted land use plans, that such modification would not adversely affect the land use compatibility or public\ninterest, and complies with one or more of the following criteria:\n1. The affected buffer is parallel to and adjoins an existing utility or drainage easement of at least 50 feet in width;\n2.\nThe affected buffer is between uses that are to be developed under a common development plan or series of development plans; or\n3. The affected buffer adjoins a property that has a joint use agreement with the parcel under site plan;\n4. When buffering the adjoining property would serve no practical purpose due to the nature and/or use of the property, such as\nundevelopable land (wetlands, etc.), industrial use, public or private utility, etc.\n6.3.10. Walls, Berms and Fences in Buffers\nWhere walls, berms or fences are built within any required buffer, they shall meet the following requirements.\nA. Walls\n1. A finished side of the wall shall face off site.\n2. All required plantings should be placed along the interior side of the wall (facing the developed area of the subject property).\nB. Fences\n1. A finished side of the fence shall face off site and see Note 2 in Buffer Alternatives Table (Section 6.3.9.A.4) for allowed fence types.\n168 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\nCELL (1, 1): \n0.6\nCELL (1, 2): \n30 feet\n3 canopy\n6 understory\n34 shrubs\nCELL (1, 3): \n30 feet\n3 canopy\n8 understory\n13 shrubs\nCELL (1, 4): \n20 feet width\n0 canopy\n3 understory\n3 shrubs\nCELL (1, 5): \n15 feet width\n0 canopy\n3 understory\n3 shrubs\nCELL (2, 1): \n0.8\nCELL (2, 2): \n50 feet\n5 canopy\n7 understory\n43 shrubs\nCELL (2, 3): \n50 feet\n4 canopy\n10 understory\n17 shrubs\nCELL (2, 4): \n35 feet width\n0 canopy\n5 understory\n7 shrubs\nCELL (2, 5): \n25 feet width\n0 canopy\n5 understory\n7 shrubs\nCELL (3, 1): \n1.0\nCELL (3, 2): \n80 feet\n5 canopy\n8 understory\n49 shrubs\nCELL (3, 3): \n80 feet\n4 canopy\n11 understory\n19 shrubs\nCELL (3, 4): \n60 feet width\n0 canopy\n5 understory\n7 shrubs\nCELL (3, 5): \n40 feet width\n0 canopy\n5 understory\n7 shrubs\n\nNEW PAGE 169\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n2. Fencing shall be between six to ten feet in height.\n3. Fences shall be maintained in a structurally safe and attractive condition and with a finished face located towards the adjoining property.\n4. All required plantings should be placed along the interior side of the fence (facing the developed area of the subject property).\nC. Berm with Vegetation\n1. The Planning Director may allow a reduction of up to 25% of the required buffer depth when a berm meeting these requirements is\nprovided.\n2.\nAn earthen berm may be used in conjunction with planted vegetation provided that the combined height of the berm and planted vegetation\nshall be at least six feet and provide approximately 75% opacity within one year of planting.\n3. The slope of the berm shall be stabilized with vegetation and no steeper than 3:1. The height of the berm may not exceed six feet, with a\nlevel or rounded area on top of the berm. The berm shall be constructed of compacted earth.\n4. Prior to issuance of the first certificate of compliance, berms shall be planted to ensure coverage by live plant material within three to five\nyears.\n5. When berms are planned to be installed within required buffers, storm drainage plans submitted with an application shall be designed to\nanticipate a 100-year storm event.\nCommentary: Berms can dramatically alter the drainage patterns in an area, and result in significant flooding both within a development and\nin areas abutting a development. Therefore, it is important to understand any potential impacts.\n6.4 SCREENING\n6.4.1. Applicability\nA. The following uses shall be screened as required by this section:\n1. Outdoor storage and loading areas.\n2. Self-storage warehouses not located in an industrial district.\n3. Air handlers and similar mechanical equipment in multifamily or nonresidential development not located on roof tops.\n4. Trash handling facilities, including dumpsters and recycling.\n5. Solar Collector (Accessory).\nB. The features and uses listed above need not be screened from similar features and uses on adjoining lots, except where project boundary\nbuffers would be required pursuant to Section 6.3.9.\nC. Screening shall not be required for temporary construction activities undertaken during construction or modification of a building, structure, or\nsite.\n6.4.2. Standards\nFeatures and uses specified above shall provide a visual obstruction from neighboring properties in conformance with the following standards:\nA. All Uses\n1. When visible from an adjoining residential use or residentially zoned property (including across a street), the screen shall be composed of\nview-obscuring vegetation (used individually, or in combination with), a wall, semi-opaque fence, or berm designed to obscure views to a\nheight of six feet from the ground, except for mechanical equipment which shall be screened to the height of the equipment plus six inches.\n2. When adjoining any other use or zoning district, outdoor storage and mechanical equipment may be screened by chain link fencing with\nslats inserted to a height of six feet from the ground, except for mechanical equipment which shall be screened to the height of the\nequipment plus six inches.\n3. One upright shrub shall be installed per four linear feet of any screen wall or fence that faces off-site. These plantings shall be placed such\nthat they obscure the screen wall or fence and shall be credited toward any plantings required elsewhere in this Ordinance.\n4. Plants must be at least two feet tall at the time of installation and reach the desired height within three to five years of planting. All berms,\nwhen provided, must be covered with plant materials within three to five years.\n5. All landscaping shall be maintained in accordance with Section 6.1.6, Requirements for Maintaining Planted Areas.\n6. Enclosures shall be required around all dumpsters except temporary construction dumpsters.\n(Ord. No. UDO-19-02, \u00a7 11, 9-19-19)\n6.4.3.
