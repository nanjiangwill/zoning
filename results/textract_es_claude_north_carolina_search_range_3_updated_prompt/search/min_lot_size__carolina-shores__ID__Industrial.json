The Board of Education shall promptly decide whether it still wishes the site to be reserved. If the Board of Education does wish to\nreserve the site, the subdivision shall not be approved without such reservation. The Board of Education shall then have 18 months beginning\non the date of final approval of the subdivision within which to acquire the site by purchase or by initiating condemnation proceedings.

In these cases, the Board of Commissioners may require that the parcels be connected by a dedicated strip of land at least 30\nfeet in width.\n(b) Two-thirds of the dedicated land shall be usable for active recreation. Furthermore, lakes and other bodies of water may not be\n\nNEW PAGE 34\nincluded in computing any of the dedicated land area. Land dedicated only for greenways need not follow the requirements of this division (J)\n(3)(b).\n(c) The shape of the portion of the dedicated land which is deemed suitable for active recreation shall be sufficiently square or round to\nbe usable for any or all recreational facilities and activities, such as athletic fields and tennis courts, when a sufficient amount of land is\ndedicated to accommodate the facilities.

Gradients adjacent to existing and proposed streets\nshall allow for reasonable access to the dedicated land. Where the dedicated land is located adjacent to a street, the developer or subdivider\nshall remain responsible for the installation of utilities, sidewalks and other improvements required along that street segment.\n(f) Dedicated parks, recreation and open space areas shall have a sufficient natural or human-made buffer or screen to minimize any\nnegative impacts on adjacent residents.\n(4) The payment of fees, in lieu of the dedication of land, may occur at the request of the subdivider or developer. However, the decision\nto require the dedication of land for recreational purposes, or a payment of a fee in lieu, shall be made by the Board of Commissioners prior to\npreliminary plat approval after having received a recommendation from the Planning Board and having evaluated the proposed dedication and\nthe relationship the dedication would have with the town's overall recreational needs.\n(a) The fees in lieu of dedication shall be paid prior to final plat approval.\n(b) The amount of the payment shall be the product of:\n1. The number of acres to be dedicated, as required by this division (J); and\n2. The assessed value for property tax purposes of the land being subdivided, adjusted to reflect its current fair market value at the\ntime the payment is due to be paid.\n(c) Procedures for determining the amount of the payment are as follows.\n1. An appraisal of the land in the development shall be performed by a professional land appraiser selected by the developer from an\napproved list maintained by the Board of Commissioners. Professional land appraiser refers to a land appraiser who, in the opinion of the\nBoard of Commissioners, has the expertise and/or certification to perform an adequate appraisal.\n2. The appraisal shall not be done prior to submission of the preliminary plat. The cost of the appraisal shall be borne by the\ndeveloper.\n(5) At the time of filing a preliminary plat, the subdivider shall designate thereon the area or areas to be dedicated pursuant to this\nsection. If the subdivider desires to make a payment in lieu of the dedication of land, a letter to that effect shall be submitted with the\npreliminary plat. The Board of Commissioners reserves the right to approve or disapprove dedication of parcels for public park, recreation or\nopen space, or payment in lieu of.\n(6) Where a dedication of land is required, the dedication shall be shown on the final plat when submitted, and the plat shall be\naccompanied by an executed general warranty deed conveying the dedicated land to the town. Where a payment in lieu of dedication is\napproved by the Board of Commissioners, the payment will be made before the final plat is signed and recorded.\n(7) The Board of Commissioners shall have the authority to sell land dedicated pursuant to this section. The proceeds of the sale shall be\nused for the acquisition and/or development of other recreation, park or open space sites, or for sidewalk development serving the subdivision\nor more than one subdivision in the immediate area.\n(8) The town encourages neighborhood or property owner associations or management to construct, operate and maintain private parks\nand recreation. The construction, operation or maintenance of the private facilities shall not, however, diminish or eliminate the responsibility\nand obligations of the subdivider under this section.\n(9) Greenways may be credited against the requirements of this section, provided that the greenways are part of the town's greenway\nplan and dedicated to public use.\n(10) This chapter may not require a power line to be buried if the line existed above ground when the development's plat or development\nplan was initially approved (even if the power line was subsequently relocated) and the power line is located outside the parcel of land\ncontaining the subdivision or development plan.\n(L) Street construction. To provide for the orderly growth and development of the town, and to coordinate the streets and highways within\nproposed subdivisions with existing or planned streets and highways, a subdivider or developer may be required in lieu of required street\nconstruction and as a condition to plat approval, to provide funds which the town may use for the construction of roads to serve the occupants,\nresidents, or invitees of the subdivision or development and these funds may be used for roads which serve more than one subdivision or\ndevelopment within the area. All funds received by the town pursuant to this division shall be used only for development of roads, including\ndesign, land acquisition, and construction. The town may undertake these activities in conjunction with the North Carolina Department of\nTransportation under an agreement between the town and the Department of Transportation. Any formula adopted to determine the amount\nof funds the subdivider or developer is to pay in lieu of required street construction shall be based on the trips generated from the subdivision\nor development. A combination of partial payment of such funds and partial dedication of constructed streets may be required when the Board\nof Commissioners determines that such a combination is in the best interests of the public in the area to be served.\n(Ord. eff. 9-6-2012, \u00a7 5.7; Am.
