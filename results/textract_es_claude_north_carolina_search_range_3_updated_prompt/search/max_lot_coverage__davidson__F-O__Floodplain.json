DESCRIPTION\nThe Lakeshore Planning Area is located at the entrance to Davidson from I-77, within\neasy walking and bicycling distance to large employment centers and downtown\nDavidson, and with ample access and vistas to Lake Norman, Lake Davidson, and\nLake Cornelius. The Lakeshore Planning Area contains opportunities for high density\nresidential development integrated within corporate, commercial and retail mixed-\nuse development. This planning area is within the state-mandated watershed overlay\ndistrict; thus the development should be higher and denser development with a smaller\nfootprint. Shorelines must be preserved for public use and aesthetic character.\nB. PERMITTED USES\nThe following table establishes the permitted uses for the Lakeshore Planning Area.

DESCRIPTION\nThe Central Business District Planning Area provides a balance of land uses with\nhigher density commercial activities, employment opportunities, and residential uses\nat the gateway to Davidson from I-77. The purpose of this planning area is primarily\ncommercial development within a pedestrian-friendly neighborhood. Residential units\non upper floors are encouraged. This mixture of uses promotes walking, keeps spending\nlocal, strengthening the local economy, and reduces dependence on automobiles by\ncreating a neighborhood with many different service and retail establishments in a small\narea. Architectural design guidelines ensure an attractive and durable built environment\nunlike typical interstate interchanges.\nB.
