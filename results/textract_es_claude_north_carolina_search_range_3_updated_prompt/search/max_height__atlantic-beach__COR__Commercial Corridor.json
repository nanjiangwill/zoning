It also includes a reference to any\nspecific standards that may apply to a particular use type.\n2.\nUse types are organized by one of four (4) different use classifications (residential, institutional, commercial,\nor industrial), and all the rows within a particular use classification have the same color.\n3.\nWithin each use classification, use types are further organized by use category. See Section 18.4.2, Use\nClassifications, Categories, and Types, for more details on the use category organizing system.\nB.\nUses Permitted By Right. A \"P\" in a cell of the principal use table indicates that the specific use type is\npermitted by right in the corresponding zoning district, subject to compliance with any additional standards\nreferenced in the principal use table.\nC.\nUses Requiring Special Use Review. An \"S\" in a cell of the principal use table indicates that the specific use\ntype is permitted in the corresponding zoning district only upon approval of a special use permit in\naccordance with Section 18.2.4.R, Special Use Permit, and any additional standards referenced in the\nprincipal use table.\nD.\nProhibited Uses.\n1.\nA \".\" in a cell of the principal use table indicates that the specific use type is prohibited in the corresponding\nzoning district.\n2.\nThe following principal uses are prohibited throughout the Town's zoning jurisdiction in all zoning districts:\na.\nHazardous materials handling;\nb.\nOff-premise signage, including outdoor advertising or billboards;\n135 of 355\n4/13/24, 12:13\n", "page_number": 133, "page_range": [133, 134, 135], "highlight": ["in <em>height</em>.\ne.", "and have a lot frontage of at least forty (40)\nlinear <em>feet</em>; and\nb)\nAll upper <em>story</em> residential units", "Incentives.\na)\nQualifying development may exceed the <em>maximum</em> <em>height</em> by two (2) <em>feet</em> and the maximum density", "provided.\nb)\nQualifying development may exceed the <em>maximum</em> <em>height</em> by two (2) <em>feet</em> and the maximum residential", "<em>height</em> by two (2) <em>feet</em> and the maximum residential density\nby 0.5 units per acre for each four hundred"], "score": 21.735102, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Commercial Corridor\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"COR\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"COR\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"COR\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 132\nAtlantic Beach, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n[6] Developments subject to a State stormwater permit are exempted from these standards.\n3.
