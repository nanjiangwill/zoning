MIXED USE (MX) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Mixed Use (MX) district is intended to foster functional neighborhoods where City\nresidents and visitors can live, work, shop, and recreate without travelling large distances\nbetween differing uses. Buildings are built close to the sidewalk and served by public\ngathering areas that create places for people to congregate and interact. The district\nencourages a fine-grained network of streets and pedestrian ways that allow a wide\nfreedom of movement and choices in transportation mode, including public transit. Land\nuses are mixed (including both residential and non-residential) either in the same building\n(vertical integration) or on the same development site (horizontal integration), and are\nlocated in close proximity to one another. Mixed use districts are located on principal and\nminor arterials as well as collector streets. The district allows a wide variety of housing\ntypes to promote population density and to support nearby retail, dining, and entertainment\nestablishments. The district discourages the establishment of single-use, monolithic, and\nautomobile-oriented forms of development that require large areas of off-street parking.\nNOTES:\n(AMENDED 06.21.22 UDOTA-03-22)\n[1] Includes duplex, triplex, and quadriplex dwellings.\n[2] 10,000 for duplex buildings; 15,000 for triplex buildings; 20,000 for quadriplex buildings; and 5,400 for a single-family\nattached development plus an additional 1,600 square feet per single-family attached unit in the development.\n[3] This is a minimum development size, not a minimum lot area.\n[4] Development in the WPO is subject to Section 3.20.F, Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay (WPO) District.\n[5] Increased to 90% for lots in pocket neighborhoods and 80% for lots in bungalow courts.\n[6] Not applied to single-family attached lots but the entire development shall maintain a max. lot coverage of 50%.\n[7] Applied to entire development (not individual lots) when configured as a pocket neighborhood or bungalow court.\n[8] Standards applied to entire development, not individual lots.\n[9] Open space set-aside requirements applied to single-family detached subdivisions of six or more lots and developments\ncomprised of six or more duplex, triplex, or quadriplex buildings.

HEAVY INDUSTRIAL (HI) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Heavy Industrial (HI) district is established to\naccommodate heavy manufacturing, assembly, fabrication,\nprocessing, distribution, storage, and research and\ndevelopment. The district accommodates large-scale\nindustrial uses including outdoor operations or storage with\nextensive movement of vehicles, materials, and goods, truck\ntraffic and greater potential for adverse environmental and\nvisual impacts on neighboring lands. The district also allows\nlimited forms of heavier commercial use types but residential\ndevelopment is prohibited (except for caretaker quarters as an\naccessory use). District standards are intended to prevent the\nestablishment of any use types that would interrupt industrial\noperations. District standards require that no land or structure\nbe used for any purpose that causes noxious or offensive\nodors, gas fumes, smoke, dust, vibration, or noise that\nsubstantially interferes with other nearby uses.\nB.
