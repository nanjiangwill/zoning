corridor without negatively\ndissecting the community. Development standards in the US 15 Commercial District acknowledge\nthat the automobile is the primary mode of transportation. Development and design standards\nencourage pedestrian scale development along a secondary street network serving larger projects.\nGoals of the US 15 Commercial District include providing a pleasant environment for motorists, a\nsafe environment for pedestrians along the secondary network of streets and pedestrian facilities;\nensuring the safety of motorists and pedestrians; and preserving the capacity of the Bypass to\naccommodate high traffic volumes at higher speeds. Uses in this district include services,\nemployment, residential and industrial. Allowed building/lot types include Urban Workplace,\nShop-front Commercial, and Civic Building.\nThe INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT (IND) is established to provide locations for industrial uses that, due to\nthe scale of the buildings and/or the nature of the use, cannot be integrated into the community.\nUses within the Industrial District are buffered from adjacent uses. The dominant uses in this\ndistrict are manufacturing and warehouse storage. Small scale manufacturing and storage that is\ncompatible with less intensive uses can and should be located in other non-residential or mixed\nuse districts. The Industrial District is reserved for uses which require very large buildings and/or\nlarge parking and loading facilities. Allowed building and lot types are Highway Commercial and\nCivic Building.\nThe OPEN SPACE PRESERVE DISTRICT (OSP) is established to preserve and protect\nenvironmentally sensitive lands (e.g. floodways, wetlands, undisturbed buffers, slopes in excess\nof 10%), or properties already under public or private ownership otherwise restricted by\nconservation easements. This district is reserved for publicly held lands under permanent\nconservation easements or for privately held lands owned by one or more land trust(s) where\nrecorded conservation easements restrict development potential. [Amended December 6, 2016\nper Ord. 2016-0-22]\nThe MINI FARM OVERLAY DISTRICT (MFO) permits buildings to be grouped on a site, parcel, or\nproperty in order to optimize the use of land and resources for both residential and agricultural\npurposes. By clustering development at a density no greater than one unit per developed acre,\nprojects developed in accordance with these standards preserve unique natural features for\nagricultural use. The Mini Farm Overlay District mandates the dedication of both agricultural land\nand open space. It is the intent of this district to be used for new development in undeveloped\noutlying areas of the City and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. Allowed building/lot type is Detached\nHouse.\nThe SCENIC CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT (SCO) is established to protect the pastoral scenes and\nopen spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and visitors traveling the major entrance\nroads and gateways to the City. The pastoral scenes and undeveloped property along the entrance\nroads and gateways contribute significantly to Creedmoor's community character and sense of\nplace. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District provides development options for the owners of the\nproperty abutting the entrance roads and gateways. The goal of this district is to protect the scenic\nvalue of the corridors through a mix of incentives and development standards. These standards\nwill preserve the rural character of the City by maintaining the sense of a rural corridor in an urban\nenvironment; provide an aesthetically appealing experience for those traveling the corridor;\nprovide multi-modal transportation options for travel; and ensure a safe transportation corridor\nfor motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. The Detached House lot/building type is allowed in this\ndistrict.\nThe HAZARDOUS INDUSTRY OVERLAY DISTRICT (HIO) is established to protect all environments\nfrom the negative impacts of certain activities and types of development. It is the intent of this\nsection to provide and permit certain public and private heavy industrial uses and facilities that\nincorporate hazardous materials and/or scientific technology, including: wholesale, distribution,\nstorage, processing, manufacturing and production. However, it is required that industries in this\nArticle 8 - Page 3\n\nNEW PAGE 102\ndistrict take all necessary actions including but not limited to installation of apparatus and\ntechnological equipment available to prevent negative impacts on the environment and the\ncommunity from the emissions of smoke, dust, fumes, noise and vibrations and other activities\nand/or products resulting from such hazardous industrial activities in accordance with federal,\nstate and local regulations.\n8.4\nZONING DISTRICT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nThe following development standards are established for each of the following primary general use zoning\ndistricts to ensure the orderly development of the City of Creedmoor.\n8.4-1\nAGRICULTURE DISTRICT (AG)\nA.\nINTENT. The AGRICULTURE DISTRICT (AG) is established to protect lands used for agricultural\nproduction, agricultural based businesses and related activities. Farm land is a defining\nelement of Creedmoor's identity and the protection of these lands aids in preserving the\ncharacter of the City. Permitted uses are limited, with an emphasis on uses that are\nagricultural in nature. Development density is very low to encourage preservation of\nagricultural lands. The Agriculture District can also be used to protect open spaces.\nB. PERMITTED USES\nUses permitted by right (P). See Table of Uses (Table 8.1)\nUses permitted with additional standards (AS).
