These flag regulations do not supersede the Scenic Corridor Overlay (SCO) requirements. If a\nproperty has a SCO along its frontage, flags must be placed outside of the designated SCO easement, per\nSection 8.5-3 of this Ordinance. These flag regulations do not supersede the U.S. Flag Code (4 USC Ch.1),\nand in case of conflict federal flag regulations override local Ordinance requirements.\nT.

Signs extending over vehicular travel areas shall maintain a minimum clear distance between\nthe finished grade surface material and any portion of the sign and its associated support structure of\nfourteen (14) feet.\n17.7-2 PERMANENT SIGN REQUIREMENTS. The following tables and text provide the design, construction,\nand dimensional requirements for permanent signs that require a permit. Requirements include copy\narea, number, type of illumination, and letter height for both attached and freestanding signs.

Only one general attached sign (blade, V-type, or flat) is allowed per street or parking frontage.\nB. Only one monument or pole freestanding sign is allowed per street frontage.\nC.

New streets which are obviously in alignment with others already\nexisting and named shall bear the names of the existing streets where practical. In no case shall the\nnames of new streets phonetically resemble existing street names.

All detached accessory structures twelve (12) feet or\nless in any dimension in all zoning districts shall maintain a minimum building separation of five (5) feet, as\nmeasured from the overhang. All detached accessory structures greater than twelve (12) feet in any dimension\nin all zoning districts shall maintain a minimum building separation of ten (10) feet, as measured from the\noverhang, per the North Carolina Building Code.

A zoning permit issued by the Planning, Zoning and Subdivision Administrator\nshall be required for all fences and walls. The process for obtaining a zoning permit is set forth in\nArticle 7 of this Ordinance.\nB.\nHeight. The maximum height of a fence or wall shall be six (6) feet when located in a side or rear\nyard and behind the front fa\u00e7ade of the home or primary building in a downtown or residential\ndistrict, including (MS, MSP, R/MST, SFR, AG). The maximum height of a fence or wall shall be four\n(4) feet when located in the front yard and in front of the fa\u00e7ade of the primary building in a\ndowntown or residential district, including (MS, MSP, R/MST, SFR, AG). The maximum height of a\nfence or wall shall be eight (8) feet when located in a commercial, civic, or industrial district,\nincluding (C-15, C-56, IND, CIV). A higher fence or wall may be allowed when associated with a\nrecreational facility, such as a tennis court or ball field, when associated with a utility or electrical\nsubstation, or when associated with a government facility. Taller fences may be permitted by the\nPlanning, Zoning and Subdivision Administrator when associated with swimming pools, as stated\nin Section 2.13-7 of this Ordinance.\nC.\nConstruction & Materials. The finished side of all fences shall face off-site. If fence support posts\nare visible on one side only, that side shall be deemed the unfinished side. Chain link fencing is\nprohibited in downtown and residential districts, including (MS, MSP, R/MST, SFR). Chain link\nfencing is allowed, with an opaque screen attached to the outside or a landscaped screen planted\noutside the fence that will achieve a minimum height of six (6) feet within three (3) years of\nplanting, in commercial, industrial, civic, and agricultural zoning districts, including (C-15, C-56,\nArticle 2 - Page 6\n\nNEW PAGE 13\nIND, CIV, AG). Razor wire, concertina wire, barbed wire and similar fencing materials are prohibited\nin downtown and residential districts, including (MS, MSP, R/MST, SFR) and on sites adjacent to\nresidential uses or residentially zoned properties. Barbed wire is allowed where associated with a\nutility or government facility.\nD. Walls. Walls shall be constructed of one or a combination of the following materials: stucco over\nconcrete block, exposed aggregate concrete, brick, stone, or architectural block in a structurally\nsafe and attractive condition. Alternative walls may be permitted with the approval of the\nPlanning, Zoning and Subdivision Administrator, or designee, if such alternative walls provide a\nsimilar level of opacity to that of the listed materials and are in keeping with the architecture of\nthe development. No wall shall be located within any required drainage, utility, or other recorded\nor dedicated easement. Retaining walls built to support a grade eight (8) feet or more higher than\nthe grade at the interior of the wall may be constructed taller than the limits of this Ordinance,\nwith justification from an engineer and with the approval of the Planning, Zoning and Subdivision\nAdministrator.\nE. Fences and walls shall not be erected over easements such as, but not limited to, access\neasements, utility easements, drainage easements, or any other public easement, without the\nexplicit approval of the Public Works Department, Planning Department, or associated utility. If\nfences or other barriers are allowed to cross such easements, the easement owner may require\nthe installer or landowner to install gates or other access points per standards and specifications\nset by the easement owner to ensure access to such easements in the future as necessary and to\nminimize damage to private property.\n2.13-3 PARKING LOTS. For parking lots as principal or accessory uses, the landscape and buffering standards\nof Article 11 and the off-street parking requirements of Article 12 shall control.\n2.13-4 ON-SITE LAND CLEARING AND INERT DEBRIS (LCID) LANDFILL.\nA.

Further, any parcel or lot which contains any part of any such\nlandfill must have notification of the existence and extent of the landfill recorded as part of the\ndeed for the lot or parcel.\nD.\nNo portion of any such landfill may be located within thirty-five (35) feet of any property line which\nconstitutes the external boundary of the project. This includes structures, equipment storage,\nparking areas and fill areas, except that access drives may cross this area.\nE.\nA surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit in an amount to be determined by the consulting\nengineer must be provided to ensure that any active landfill area will be closed in an approved\nfashion.
