Description:\nThe apartment building is a residential building accommodating several households. This building type traditionally\ncoexists with a variety of other building types. A successful contemporary design permits its integration with other residential\ntypes through the coordination of site and building design (see architectural regulations). Apartment complexes should be\none (1) or more separated buildings similar in their scale on the public street to large detached housing.\n4. Special conditions:\na. The intention of buildings in all locations must be to relate the principal facade to the sidewalk and public space of the\nstreet.\nb. Corners: Setback at street corners will generally replicate frontage conditions. However, side setbacks on a minor\nstreet may be less than the front dimension.\nC. Within the limits described, front and side setbacks will vary depending upon site conditions. Setbacks should be used\nin a manner which encourages pedestrian activity. Squares or spatially defined plazas within building setback areas can act\nas focal points for pedestrians.\n(Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02; Ord. of 6-6-16, No. 22-15)\nSec. 9-3-69 Building type/apartment building.\n1.

Description:\nThis building type generally comprises fast food retail, drive through banks, motels and other highway dependent uses.\nThese regulations are designed to bring these building types into a framework of city streets. This building type shall be\nlimited to the Highway Business District.\n4. Special conditions:\na. Buildings in all locations should relate a principal facade to the sidewalk and public space of the street.\nb. Corners: Setback at street corners will generally replicate frontage conditions.\n(Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02; Ord. of 10-5-15, No. 05-15; Ord. of 6-6-16, No. 22-15)\nSec. 9-3-67 Building type/highway business.\n1. Permitted height and uses:\na. Building height shall be measured as the vertical distance from the highest finished grade relative to the street\nfrontage, up to the leaves or the highest level of a flat roof.\nb. The height of parapet walls may vary depending upon the need to screen mechanical equipment.\nC. Building height to the ridge may vary depending on the roof pitch.\nd. Permitted uses are indicated above.\n2. Architectural standards:\na. Principles:\n(1) Building elevations fronting or visible from public streets shall be clad with masonry, wood, vinyl siding, stucco, or\nsimilar material. Metal paneling may not comprise a street fronting building face.\n(2) All walls not visible from a public right-of-way may be constructed of split face block, bricks, wood or vinyl siding, or\nmetal paneling but shall be painted to match the overall scheme of the rest of the building.\n(3) Mobile units may not be used as permanent workplace buildings.\n(4) At a minimum, the Americans with Disabilities Act standards for accessibility shall be met.\nb. Configurations:\n(1) Two (2) wall materials may be combined horizontally on one (1) facade. The \"heavier\" material should be below and\ncan cover the first floor only (i.e. brick below wood siding).\nC. Techniques:\n(1) All rooftop equipment shall be enclosed in a building material that matches the structure or is visually compatible with\nthe structure. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02)\nSec. 9-3-68 Lot type/apartment building.\n1. Building placement/parking/vehicular access:\na. Buildings shall be placed on the lot within the zone represented by the hatched area. In most cases, the build-to-line\nwill range from ten (10) feet to twenty-five (25) feet behind street right-of-way. Special site conditions such as topography,\npattern of lot widths, or setbacks of existing buildings permit a smaller or larger building setback. In urban conditions,\napartments may be set up to the property line at the sidewalk, including corner conditions.\nb. Building facades shall be generally parallel to front property lines. All buildings shall front onto a public street.\nC. Parking shall be located to the rear of the building.\nd. Points of permitted access to the parking are indicated by arrows.\ne. Trash containers shall be located in the rear parking area (see parking regulations).\nf. Mechanical equipment at ground level shall be placed on the parking lot side of building and away from buildings on\nadjacent sites.\ng. Apartment buildings are only permitted as a Planned Unit Development - Residential.\n\nNEW PAGE 38\nh. Only permitted where both municipal water and sewer serve the site.\ni. The density shall not exceed twelve (12) units per acre for any development.\n2. Encroachment/pedestrian access:\na. For buildings set back from sidewalk, balconies, stoops, stairs, open porches, bay windows, and lawnings are permitted\nto encroach into setback area up to eight (8) feet.\nb. Decks, porches, and balconies are permitted to encroach into the established rear yard up to twenty-five (25) feet.\nC. For buildings set up to the sidewalk, upper level balconies and bay windows may encroach a maximum of five (5) feet\nzero (0) inches over the sidewalk.\nd. Main pedestrian access to the building is from the street (indicated by larger arrow). Secondary access may be from\nparking areas (indicated by smaller arrow).\ne. When required, concrete sidewalks, minimum five (5) feet wide, shall be built along all street frontages of the lot\naccording to city specifications (four (4) inches thick except at non-residential driveways it shall be six (6) inches thick). The\nsidewalk shall be separated from the street by a minimum four (4) wide planting strip unless on-street parking is provided.\nThe planting strip width may be reduced when there is insufficient right-of-way on existing streets.\n3. Description:\nThe apartment building is a residential building accommodating several households. This building type traditionally\ncoexists with a variety of other building types. A successful contemporary design permits its integration with other residential\ntypes through the coordination of site and building design (see architectural regulations). Apartment complexes should be\none (1) or more separated buildings similar in their scale on the public street to large detached housing.\n4. Special conditions:\na. The intention of buildings in all locations must be to relate the principal facade to the sidewalk and public space of the\nstreet.\nb. Corners: Setback at street corners will generally replicate frontage conditions. However, side setbacks on a minor\nstreet may be less than the front dimension.\nC. Within the limits described, front and side setbacks will vary depending upon site conditions. Setbacks should be used\nin a manner which encourages pedestrian activity. Squares or spatially defined plazas within building setback areas can act\nas focal points for pedestrians.\n(Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02; Ord. of 6-6-16, No. 22-15)\nSec. 9-3-69 Building type/apartment building.\n1. Permitted height and uses:\na. Building height shall be measured as the vertical distance from the highest finished grade relative to the street\nfrontage, up to the leaves or the highest level of a flat roof.\nb. The height of parapet walls may vary depending on the need to screen mechanical equipment.\nC. Building height to ridge may vary depending on the roof pitch.\nd. Permitted uses are indicated above.\n2. Architectural standards:\na. Principles:\n(1) To perpetuate the unique building character of the city and its environs, and to re-establish its local identity,\ndevelopment shall generally employ building types that are sympathetic to the historic architectural vocabulary of the area in\ntheir massing and external treatment.\n(2) Building elevations fronting or visible from public streets shall be clad with masonry, wood, vinyl siding, stucco, or\nsimilar material. Metal paneling may not comprise a street fronting building face.\n(3) The front elevations facing the street and the overall massing shall communicate an emphasis on the human scale\nand the pedestrian environment.\n(4) Each building should be designed to form part of a larger composition of the area in which it is situated. Adjacent\n\nNEW PAGE 39\nbuildings should thus be of similar scale, height, and configuration.\n(5) Building silhouettes should be generally consistent. The scale and pitch of roof lines should thus be similar across\ngroups of buildings.\n(6) Porches should form a predominant motif of house designs, and be located on the front or to the side of the dwelling.\nWhen attached to the front, they should extend over at least fifteen percent (15%) of the front facade. All porches should be\nconstructed of materials in keeping with those of the main building.\n(7) Front loaded garages, if provided, shall meet the standards of Section9-3-27.\n(8)\nAt a minimum, the Americans with Disabilities Act standards for accessibility shall be met.\nb. Configurations:\n(1) Main roofs on residential buildings shall be symmetrical gables or hips with a pitch of between 4:12 and 12:12.\nMonopitch (shed) roofs are allowed only if they are attached to the wall of the main building. No monopitch shall be less\nthan 4:12. All accessory buildings shall have roof pitches that conform to those of the main building.\n(2) Balconies should generally be simply supported by posts and beams. The support of cantilevered balconies should\nbe assisted by visible brackets.\n(3) Two (2) wall materials may be combined horizontally on one (1) facade. The \"heavier\" material should be below.\n(4) Exterior chimneys should be finished in brick or stucco or compatible material to structure.\nC. Techniques:\n(1) Overhanging leaves may expose rafters.\n(2) Flush eaves should be finished by profiled molding or gutters. (Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02)\nSec. 9-3-70 Lot type/detached house.\n1. Building placement/parking/vehicular access:\nType \"A\" Typical Condition - All Residential\na. Buildings shall be placed on the lot within the zone represented by the hatched area.\nAlong new streets, the build-to line is twenty-five (25) feet behind the street right-of-way. Special site conditions such as\ntopography or lot widths permit a larger setback.\nAlong existing streets, front build-to lines shall be equal to the average setbacks for buildings on the same side of the\nstreet within three hundred (300) feet. Only in the most exceptional circumstances having to do with extreme topography or\nvery special design composition may such placement be varied.\nSide setbacks shown may be revised to twelve (12) feet on one side and four (4) feet on the other adjacent side to\naccommodate driveways as necessary in certain site conditions as determined by the Planning Board in new subdivision\ndevelopment only.\nb. Garages may be detached, or attached to the main dwelling, with or without habitable rooms above. Garages,\ncarports, and parking shall meet the standards of Section 9-3-27.\nC. A detached garage may be located only in the rear yard.\nd. Points of permitted front or rear access to parking indicated by arrows.\ne. Main pedestrian access to the building is from the street. Secondary access may be from parking areas. If a sidewalk\nis present, the house's front facade must face the sidewalk.\nf. For buildings set back from sidewalk, balconies, stoops, stairs, open porches, bay windows, and awnings are permitted\nto encroach into the front setback area up to eight (8) feet.\ng. Decks must be constructed only in rear yard area and are permitted to encroach into the rear setback up to twenty-five\n(25) feet.\n2. Building placement/parking/vehicular access:\na.
