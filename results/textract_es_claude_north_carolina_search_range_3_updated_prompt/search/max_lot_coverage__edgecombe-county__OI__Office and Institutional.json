Buildings\nhave a wide range of sizes and heights, based on their function. The district also accommodates the\nancillary service uses necessary to support the predominant office and institutional development but is\nnot intended as a retail district. Retail, personal service, and other commercial uses permitted as\naccessory to an office or institutional use should not occupy more than ten percent of the floor area\nand should be configured to minimize visibility from off-site areas. The OI district also serves as a\ntransition area between higher intensity commercial uses and nearby lower density single-family\nresidential neighborhoods. In order to maintain compatibility with surrounding uses and ensure a high\nquality of development, all activities shall comply with the standards in Article 6.

Buildings\nhave a wide range of sizes and heights, based on their function. The district also accommodates the\nancillary service uses necessary to support the predominant office and institutional development but is\nnot intended as a retail district. Retail, personal service, and other commercial uses permitted as\naccessory to an office or institutional use should not occupy more than ten percent of the floor area\nand should be configured to minimize visibility from off-site areas. The OI district also serves as a\ntransition area between higher intensity commercial uses and nearby lower density single-family\nresidential neighborhoods. In order to maintain compatibility with surrounding uses and ensure a high\nquality of development, all activities shall comply with the standards in Article 6.

SOLAR ENERGY CONVERSION\nA.\nPURPOSE\n1. The purpose of these standards is to facilitate the construction, installation, and operation\nof solar energy conversion uses in Edgecombe County in a manner that promotes economic\ndevelopment and ensures the protection of health, safety, and welfare while also avoiding\nadverse impacts to important areas such as agricultural lands, endangered species habitats,\nconservation lands, and other sensitive lands.\n2. It is the intent of these standards to encourage the development of solar energy conversion\nuses that reduce reliance on foreign and out-of-state energy resources, bolster local\neconomic development and job creation, support the diversification of the State's energy\nportfolio, strengthen energy and grid security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce\nlocal air and water pollution, and aid North Carolina in meeting its Renewable Portfolio\nStandard.\n3.\nThese standards are not intended to abridge safety, health, or environmental requirements\ncontained in other applicable codes, standards, or ordinances. These provisions shall not\nnullify any local, State, or federal laws.\nB.\nAPPLICABILITY\n1.
