Urban Residential Districts: location: purposes.\n(1)\nUrban areas are recognized as unique areas with many assets and opportunities. In order\nto foster the urban characteristics of these areas, development here should promote an\nenvironment of diverse uses at higher than normal density which encourages pedestrian\nactivities, needs and movement, while at the same time recognizing the limited supply of\nurban land. As such this requires special zoning classifications in order to implement the\ngoals and objectives of these vital areas of the community. Further it is necessary and\ndesirable to promote the residential nature of these areas through zoning classifications,\nwhich are intended to realize the growing opportunities for new infill development and\nredevelopment. Such residential development, properly located and developed, can\nenhance and support the overall mix of uses characteristic of urban areas. Therefore, the\npurpose of this Section is to establish the urban residential districts.\n(2)\nUrban residential districts are intended for use in special areas of the community and thus\nmay be considered for limited application. Generally, special plans or policy guides will\nbe used to determine applicability. The official Zoning Map of the City of Charlotte will\ndesignate urban residential district boundaries.\n(3)\nThese districts are designed to provide standards and incentives, which will promote the\ndevelopment or redevelopment of urban areas that contain a mix of land uses with a\npredominantly residential character. Emphasis is given to provisions, which will provide\nopportunities for imaginative new urban development compatible with the development\nobjectives of these areas. Accordingly, the development objectives are:\n(a)\nTo maximize residential development potentials in urban areas;\n(b)\nTo establish a predominantly residential character with residential neighborhoods;\n(c)\nTo provide for sufficient local retail and office uses to support residential areas;\n(d)\nTo protect all residential areas from inappropriate and intrusive uses;\n(e)\nTo maximize open space and other amenities within residential areas;\n(f)\nTo protect and enhance existing single family residential areas from uses which by\ntheir scale and characteristics may be inappropriate;\n(g)\nTo provide for the efficient utilization of scarce urban land; and\n(h)\nTo reward development projects through a density bonus system for including\nspecific development features which significantly further the overall goals for\nthese areas and which enhance the urban residential environment.\n9-45\n\nNEW PAGE 196\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 4 : URBAN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS\nSection 9.402. Urban Residential Districts: established.\nIn order to provide densities and other development standards which are compatible with urban\ncharacteristics, the following zoning classifications are established:\nSection 9.403. Urban Residential Districts: uses permitted by right.\n(1)\nUR-1: Uses permitted by right within the UR-1 district are detached, duplex, attached\ndwellings and group homes for up to 6 residents.\n(2)\nUR-2: Uses permitted by right within the UR-2 district are detached, duplex, triplex,\nquadraplex, attached, multi-family dwellings and group homes for up to 10 residents.\nBusiness or office uses are allowed but limited to those permitted in the B-1\nNeighborhood Business District, except that no drive-in windows or automotive sales,\nservice or repair are permitted. The maximum gross floor area of these business uses is 50\npercent of the ground floor area of the building in which they are located and any single\ntenant or use shall be limited to a maximum of 3,000 square feet. There is no restriction\nas to where within the structures these uses may be located.\n(Petition No. 2002-34, \u00a7 9.403(2), 4-15-02)\n(3)\nUR-3: Uses permitted by right within the UR-3 district are detached, duplex, triplex,\nquadraplex, attached, multi-family dwellings and group homes for up to 10 residents.\nBusiness or office uses limited to those permitted in B-1 neighborhood business districts\n9-46\nCELL (1, 1): \n(1)\nCELL (1, 2): \nUrban Residential-1 district (UR-1): The intent of this district is to protect and enhance\ndesignated single family areas and to encourage appropriate infill development within\nthese areas.\nCELL (2, 1): \n(2)\nCELL (2, 2): \nUrban Residential-2 district (UR-2): The intent of this district is to promote maximum\nopportunities for moderate density residential development.
