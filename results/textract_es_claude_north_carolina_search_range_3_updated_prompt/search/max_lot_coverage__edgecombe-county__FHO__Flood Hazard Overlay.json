DISTRICTS\n$3.4. Overlay Zoning Districts\n3.4.3. FLOOD HAZARD OVERLAY (FHO) DISTRICT\nA.\nSTATUTORY AUTHORIZATION\nThe Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; Parts 3\nand 4 of Article 18 of Chapter 153A; and Part 121, Article 6 of Chapter 153A of the North\nCarolina General Statutes, delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt\nregulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.\nB.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n1. The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of Edgecombe County are subject to periodic\ninundation which results in loss of life, property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of\ncommerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood\nprotection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the\npublic health, safety, and general welfare.\n2. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains\ncausing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas\nof uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.\nC.\nSTATEMENT OF PURPOSE\nIt is the purpose of these standards to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and\nto minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by\nprovisions designed to:\n1.\nRestrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or\nerosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;\n2.\nRequire that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected\nagainst flood damage at the time of initial construction;\n3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective\nbarriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;\n4. Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or\nflood damage; and\n5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood\nwaters, or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\nD.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objectives of these standards are to:\n1. Protect human life, safety, and health;\n2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\n3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally\nundertaken at the expense of the general public;\n4. Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;\n5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and gas mains, electric,\ntelephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;\n6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood\nprone areas; and\n7. Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area.\nE.\nEFFECTIVE DATE\nThese standards shall become effective on June 2, 2015.\nF.\nDEFINITIONS\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage\n179\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n\nNEW PAGE 180\nARTICLE 3.

DEFINED\nA unified development is a development of residential, non-residential, or mixed uses occupying two or\nmore lots that is planned, designed, constructed, and operated as a single unit, development, or entity.\nLots within a unified development may or may not be under common ownership. Unified\ndevelopments are treated as a singular lot or development site with respect to many of the standards\nin Article 6. Standards.\n6.14.2. DESIGNATION\nThe establishment of a unified development must be requested by all owners of land within the\nproposed boundary of the development and the designation of a unified development may only be\nmade by the Zoning Administrator in accordance with the standards in this Ordinance.\n6.14.3. IDENTIFIED ON PLAT\n6.14.4. PERMITS AND APPLICATIONS\nRegardless of designation as a unified development, permits and development approvals issued under\nthis Ordinance shall only apply to the lots identified in the written notice of decision issued by the\nCounty.\n6.14.5. RELATIONSHIP TO DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS\nUnless subject to an administrative adjustment, variance, or other allowable alternative authorized by\nthis Ordinance, each lot, yard, and structure located within a unified development shall comply with\nthe\ndimensional requirements for the zoning district where located.\n6.14.6. ACCESS AND CIRCULATION\nLots and structures located within a unified development shall be accessed by shared or common\ndriveways. In no instance shall ingress or egress from a unified development be limited to a specific lot,\nuse, or structure.\n6.14.7. EXTERIOR LIGHTING\nThe standards in Section 6.3.9, Maximum Illumination Levels, shall not apply to lot lines bounded on\ntwo or more sides by the same unified development. The standards do apply to lot lines along the\nperimeter of the unified development.\n6.14.8. LANDSCAPING\nParking lots abutting lot lines of lots also located within the same unified development are exempted\nfrom the standards in Section 6.5.8.C, Perimeter Plantings, and Section 6.5.9, Perimeter Buffers, but\nshall be subject to the standards in Section 6.5.10, Streetscape Buffers.\n6.14.9.
