MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (MDR) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Medium Density Residential (MDR) district is established to accommodate moderate\ndensity residential development and complimentary uses in suburban-to-urban settings\nthroughout the City's jurisdiction. Use of the conservation subdivision configuration\nis\noptional for residential subdivisions of five lots or more. The district accommodates\nutilities as well as various neighborhood-supporting institutional uses such as parks,\nschools, and public safety facilities. District regulations discourage uses that interfere\nwith the development of residential neighborhoods or that are detrimental to the\nresidential nature of the district. Conservation subdivisions, pocket neighborhoods, or\nbungalow courts are allowed as optional forms of development.\nNOTES:\n(AMENDED 06.21.22 UDOTA-03-22; AMENDED 12.6.22 UDOTA-05-22)\n[1] Includes duplex, triplex, and quadriplex dwellings.\n[2] Increased to 7 units per acre in a pocket neighborhood, bungalow court, or conservation subdivision.\n[3] Decreased to 6,000 square feet for lots in pocket neighborhoods, bungalow courts, and conservation subdivisions.\n[4] 10,000 for duplex buildings; 15,000 for triplex buildings; 20,000 for quadriplex buildings; and 9,000 for a single-family attached\ndevelopment plus an additional 1,600 square feet per single-family attached unit in the development.\n[5] This is a minimum development size, not a minimum lot area.\n[6] Dev. in the WPO is subject to built-upon limits in Section 3.20.F, Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay (WPO) District.\n[7] Increased to 90% for lots in pocket neighborhoods, 80% for lots in bungalow courts, and 99% for lots in conservation subdivisions.\n[8] Applied to the entire single-family attached development, not to individual lots with an individual single-family attached dwelling.\n[9] Applied to entire development (not individual lots) if a pocket neighborhood, bungalow court, or conservation subdivision.\n[10] Standards applied to entire development, not individual lots.\n[11] Open space set-aside requirements applied to single-family detached subdivisions of six or more lots and development comprised of six\nor more duplex, triplex, or quadriplex buildings. All single-family attached and multi-family development shall provide open space set-aside.\n[12] Open space set-aside shall be configured with at least 50 percent devoted to active recreation features in accordance with Section 7.1,\nOpen Space Set-Aside.\n[13] In cases where development is in a subdivision established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, no setback shall be required to\nbe greater than the average setback of existing residential structures on the same side of the block or within a distance of 500 feet\nhorizontally on either side when blocks are not present.\n[14] On corner lots of record, the street setback may be reduced by 50 percent on the long side of the lot.\n[15] Reduced to as low as 3 feet for dwellings in pocket neighborhoods, bungalow courts, and conservation subdivisions.\n[16] Duplex dwellings may utilize a side yard setback that is the same as a single-family detached dwelling.\n[17] Duplex, triplex, quadplex, and single-family attached buildings with party walls may maintain a sideyard setback of zero along party\nwalls.\n[18] 20 feet required from lot lines abutting single-family detached residential dwellings.\n[19] Applied in lieu of side or rear setbacks in multi-building developments.\n[20] Development in the AHO is subject to maximum building heights in Section 3.20.B, Airport Height Overlay (AHO) District.\nCity of Burlington\nUnified Development Ordinance\n3-28\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\nCELL (1, 1): \nB.

MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (MDR) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Medium Density Residential (MDR) district is established to accommodate moderate\ndensity residential development and complimentary uses in suburban-to-urban settings\nthroughout the City's jurisdiction. Use of the conservation subdivision configuration\nis\noptional for residential subdivisions of five lots or more. The district accommodates\nutilities as well as various neighborhood-supporting institutional uses such as parks,\nschools, and public safety facilities. District regulations discourage uses that interfere\nwith the development of residential neighborhoods or that are detrimental to the\nresidential nature of the district. Conservation subdivisions, pocket neighborhoods, or\nbungalow courts are allowed as optional forms of development.\nNOTES:\n(AMENDED 06.21.22 UDOTA-03-22; AMENDED 12.6.22 UDOTA-05-22)\n[1] Includes duplex, triplex, and quadriplex dwellings.\n[2] Increased to 7 units per acre in a pocket neighborhood, bungalow court, or conservation subdivision.\n[3] Decreased to 6,000 square feet for lots in pocket neighborhoods, bungalow courts, and conservation subdivisions.\n[4] 10,000 for duplex buildings; 15,000 for triplex buildings; 20,000 for quadriplex buildings; and 9,000 for a single-family attached\ndevelopment plus an additional 1,600 square feet per single-family attached unit in the development.\n[5] This is a minimum development size, not a minimum lot area.\n[6] Dev. in the WPO is subject to built-upon limits in Section 3.20.F, Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay (WPO) District.\n[7] Increased to 90% for lots in pocket neighborhoods, 80% for lots in bungalow courts, and 99% for lots in conservation subdivisions.\n[8] Applied to the entire single-family attached development, not to individual lots with an individual single-family attached dwelling.\n[9] Applied to entire development (not individual lots) if a pocket neighborhood, bungalow court, or conservation subdivision.\n[10] Standards applied to entire development, not individual lots.\n[11] Open space set-aside requirements applied to single-family detached subdivisions of six or more lots and development comprised of six\nor more duplex, triplex, or quadriplex buildings.

It is the intent of this section that the information required to be presented in\nthe site analysis map be produced primarily from existing sources, maps, in order to ensure the\nprocess is economical for the applicant.\nb. Step 2-Site Inspection\nAfter receipt of the site analysis map, the Planning Director shall schedule a site inspection of the\nland with the applicant. The applicant or the applicant's representative shall attend the site\ninspection with a City staff member. The purpose of this site visit is to:\ni. Familiarize the staff with the existing site conditions and natural and historic features of the\nsite;\nii.\nIdentify potential site development issues, including the best location for the development to\nensure its visibility from surrounding residential areas and major roadways is minimized; and\niii. Provide an opportunity to discuss site development concepts, including the general layout of\nconservation areas and potential locations for proposed structures, utilities, streets, and other\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \n6-29\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\nNEW PAGE 442\nCHAPTER 6 SUBDIVISIONS\nSection 6.10 Conservation Subdivision\ndevelopment features. Comments made by the staff during the site inspection shall be\ninterpreted as being only suggestive. No official decision on the conservation and development\nplan shall be made during the site inspection.\nC. Step 3-Conservation and Development Areas Map\nBased on the site analysis map and the information obtained during the site inspection, the\napplicant shall prepare a conservation and development areas map that depicts proposed primary\nconservation areas, secondary conservation areas, and development areas, in accordance with\nSection 6.10.E, Delineation of Conservation and Development Areas.\nd. Step 4-Conservation and Development Plan\nBased on the site analysis map, the information obtained during the site inspection, and the\nconservation and development areas map, the applicant shall prepare and submit to the Planning\nDirector a conservation and development plan. The conservation and development plan shall\ninclude the following:\ni. A site analysis map;\nii. A conservation and development areas map; and\niii.

Primary Conservation Areas\na. Features to be Preserved\nThe following features shall be located and delineated on the conservation and development areas\nmap, and shall be preserved in the following priority order as primary conservation areas:\ni.\nAreas with existing mature trees around the perimeter of the site;\nii. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers designated 404 wetlands;\niii. Riparian buffers and other lands within 50 feet of estuarine or other surface waters;\niv. Areas with impermeable soils; and\nV. Habitat utilized by endangered or threatened species or designated Natural Heritage Areas.\nb. Amount to be Preserved\nAll areas occupied by features comprising a primary conservation area shall be set aside and\nreserved for conservation purposes in accordance with the following standards:\ni.\nPrimary Conservation Area is Less than Minimum Required\nIn cases where the geographic area occupied by all features comprising the primary\nconservation area is less than the minimum required conservation area, then all lands\ncomprising the primary conservation area shall be set aside.\nii. Primary Conservation Area Exceeds the Minimum Required\na) In the event the geographic area of all features identified and prioritized as the primary\nconservation area results in a primary conservation area exceeding the conservation area\nrequirement, priority for retention shall be given to the highest quality portion of the\nfeatures to be conserved. (For example, conservation of the first type of prioritized\nfeatures constitute 47 percent of a site, and the next prioritized feature consists of five\npercent and the minimum required conservation area is 50 percent of the site area, the\napplicant may identify which portions of the features exceeding the 50 percent\nconservation area requirement will be designated for conversion to development area).\nb) Development on lands made available for conversion to development area shall be in\naccordance with the standards in this Ordinance.\nC. Allowable Uses\nUses located within a primary conservation area shall be limited to:\ni.\nPervious pedestrian trails, walkways, and boardwalks;\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \n6-31\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n", "page_number": 441, "page_range": [441, 442, 443], "highlight": ["Where Allowed\nSingle-family detached residential subdivisions of more than five lots in the LDR, <em>MDR</em>,", "Conservation subdivision lots in the LDR and <em>MDR</em> districts shall comply with the dimensional\nstandards", "<em>Maximum</em> <em>Lot</em> <em>Coverage</em>\na.", "Conservation subdivision lots in the LDR and <em>MDR</em> zoning districts shall comply with the <em>maximum</em>\n<em>lot</em> <em>coverage</em>", "Conservation subdivision lots in the PD district shall comply with the <em>maximum</em> <em>lot</em> <em>coverage</em>\nrequirements"], "score": 29.689508, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Medium Density Residential\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MDR\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MDR\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MDR\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building area as % of lot\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"pervious surface\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"percent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"%\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per cent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ratio\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 152\nCHAPTER 3 ZONING DISTRICTS\nSection 3.10 Medium Density Residential (MDR) District\nF.

MEDIUM INDUSTRIAL (MI) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Medium Industrial (MI) district is established to\naccommodate modern, technologically-based, clean\nindustrial development that takes place in highly\ncontrolled environments. Typical activities taking place in\nthe district include bio-engineering, pharmaceuticals,\nprecision fabrication and assembly, and research and\ndevelopment. The district does not allow heavy industrial\nuses, residential uses, or retail, except as accessory uses.\nDistrict standards are intended to prevent the\nestablishment of any use types that would interrupt\nindustrial operations. District standards require that no\nland or structure be used for any purpose that causes\nnoxious or offensive odors, gas fumes, smoke, dust,\nvibration, or noise that substantially interferes with other\nnearby uses.\nB.
