Required yards and setback distances\nshall be measured from the property line or street right-of-way line to the nearest portion of\nany building or structure foundation/footprint, excluding:\n(1)\nFor side yard the outermost four feet of any leave, gutter, canopy, or similar fixture.\n(2)\nA deck or patio if no portion of the same extends more than 2 inches above grade, not\nto extend within five (5) feet of any lot line.\n(3)\nAny structure that is a mere appendage to a building, such as a flagpole or fountain.\n(4)\nFences.\nSection 5.6.2. Through Lots (Double Frontage) and Corner Lots\n(A)\nIn the case of \"through lots\" (also referred to as \"double frontage lots\"), the lot shall be considered\nto have two front lot lines on each street frontage.\n(B)\nFor corner lots, the side having the shortest street frontage is considered the front for setback\npurposes. The UDO Administrator may waive this requirement and determine the front yard\nto\nbe on the street front that is in line with the prevailing pattern of front yards on the street in\norder to be consistent with the established pattern of the street.\nSection 5.6.3 Height Limit Exemptions\nExcept as may otherwise be prohibited by the FAA regulations, the height limitations of this\nOrdinance shall not apply to public buildings, church spires, belfries, cupolas, and domes not\nintended for residential purposes, or to monuments, water towers, observation towers, power\ntransmission towers, telecommunication towers, silos, grain elevators, chimneys, smokestacks,\nderricks, conveyors, flag poles, radio, masts, aerials, and similar structures, provided the structures meet\nthe required State Building Code.\nSection 5.6.4 Lot Coverage\n(A) In determining the percentage of building coverage permitted on a lot, the ground floor area\nof the dwelling, roofed porches, carports, garages, accessory buildings, and all impervious\nsurfaces shall be included.\n(B) Not more than 30% of total lot area may be covered by impervious surfaces.
