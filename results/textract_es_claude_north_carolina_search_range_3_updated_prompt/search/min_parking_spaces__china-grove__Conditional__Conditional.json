In many cases, however, meeting\ncurrent building design, landscaping, parking, paving, or driveway requirements may be physically\nimpossible or cost-prohibitive. Rather than allowing these sites to become vacant, abandoned, or\ndeteriorated, the provisions of Section 5.9, Nonconforming Sites and Buildings Developed Prior to\nAugust 1, 2006, grant re-use projects a greater degree of flexibility in meeting current ordinance\nrequirements.\n7.8.4 Alternative Compliance\nWhere meeting the building design requirements of Section 13.4.1.4 is impracticable due to unique site\nconditions or existing development patterns, Town Council may approve development which meets or\nexceeds the intent of these standards through the Conditional Zoning process.\n7.8.5 Other Requirements\nA.
