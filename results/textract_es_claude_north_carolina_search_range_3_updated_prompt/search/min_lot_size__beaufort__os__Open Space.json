The Town recognizes the PUD as a special district where the\ndeveloper/owner proposes an integrated expansion of land combining mixed uses. The PUD\nwill be divided into sub-districts with each sub-district being one of the recognized districts\nwithin this Ordinance. Development within such sub-districts must be consistent with the\nrequirements and limitations of the normal district it correlates with, and this PUD section and\nits chapters and subchapters, the most stringent will apply.\nPUD developers are required to submit a site plan for review, as established in section 18 of\nthis Ordinance, in order for the planning board and Board of Commissioners (BOC) to look at\nthe relationships between the mixed use development. There are no minimum lot sizes or\nsetback requirements in this district however when the PUD comes for review, those items will\nbe evaluated to make sure they conform to the standards set forth in this section of this\nOrdinance.\nDuring consideration and approval of the master plan for a PUD project, or a preliminary plat\nfor a section of the master plan of the PUD project, the BOC, following a recommendation\nfrom the planning board, may vary the minimum requirements of this Ordinance or the Town\nof Beaufort Subdivision Ordinance. The master plan or preliminary plat applicant must show\nhow the PUD will be enhanced aesthetically, the environment will be better protected, or for\nany other reason the BOC determines appropriate, as long as the BOC determines such\nvariance does not harm the public interest. Density within a mixed use district may be varied\nfrom the limit specified within the district as long as the maximum overall density limit of six\ndwelling units per acre is maintained.\n1) Accessory Building Setback Requirements.\nAll accessory buildings must comply with the setback requirements as set forth in section\n2-F, section 6, section 15, and all sections of this Ordinance.\n2)
