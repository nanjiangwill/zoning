Designation of Transitional Office Overlay\n1. A Transitional Office Overlay may only be established as a zoning map change in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.8, Rezoning.\n2. A Transitional Office Overlay may only be established in any residential base district, and may be established over more than one residential\nbase district.\nC. Permitted Uses\n1.

Brunswick County has numerous waterways, marshes, Carolina Bays, pocosins, and other water courses that contribute to the County's\nscenic character and serve as a reminder of the important place these water courses hold in the County's history.\n2. The water courses are also an important natural resource and amenity to residents of and visitors to Brunswick County, and the scenic views\nassociated with these watercourses are an important attraction to residents and visitors to Brunswick County, which in large part is\neconomically dependent upon tourism.\n3.\nThe intent of the Viewshed Protection Overlay is to protect and enhance the scenic character of Brunswick County's riparian areas and water\ncourses, with the broader goal of ensuring the preservation of views from within these scenic areas as well as views of these areas from\nadjacent lands.\nB. Designation of Viewshed Protection Overlay\n1. A Viewshed Protection Overlay may only be established as a zoning map change in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.8,\nRezoning.\n2. The ordinance adopting the overlay district shall clearly designate the name and geographic limits of the watercourse to be protected (i.e.\ncan't just say Intercoastal Waterway, it must specify the extents of the district along the length of the watercourse).\n3. The following watercourses are designated (VS) Viewshed Protection Overlays:\nC. Applicability\n1. Generally, the requirements of this Viewshed Protection Overlay District apply to all structures within 300 feet of the normal high water line\nof a designated watercourse.\n2. However, the Planning Director may waive these requirements for structures related to an industrial use that is located in the RU-I or I-G\nzoning districts.\n3. These requirements shall not apply to water oriented commercial uses (see Section 5.1.4.)).\nD. Development Standards\n1. Portions of structures facing a protected watercourse that exceed 50 feet in height shall be set back a minimum of two feet for each\nadditional one foot in height above 50 feet. The Planning Director shall have the authority to determine which portions of a structure are\nconsidered to be \"facing\" the protected watercourse for the purposes of these regulations.\n2. With the exception of Water Oriented Commercial Uses (see Section 5.1.4.J), and permitted height obstructions (see Section 5.4.13.C) the\nmaximum height of any structure may not exceed 75 feet.\n4.8.8. WQP: Water Quality Protection\nA. Purpose and Intent\n1. It is the intent of Brunswick County to bolster those regulations of state and federal government as to the unique quality of the water of the\nLockwood Folly River associated with naturally occurring shellfish beds.\n2. The quality of these defined waters has been affected by such activities as forestry, farming, construction of roads, growth of towns, and\nrural and suburban residential development, as well as industrial processes associated with the fishing industry.\n3. Numerous types of water pollutants have been identified by state studies. No one or even several types or causes of such degradation have\nbeen determined as having more impact than any other.\n59 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\nCELL (1, 1): \nWatercourse\nCELL (1, 2): \nFrom\nCELL (1, 3): \nTo\nCELL (2, 1): \nName\nCELL (2, 2): \nLocation\nCELL (2, 3): \nLocation\nCELL (3, 1): \nIntracoastal Waterway (IWW)\nCELL (3, 2): \nBorder with New Hanover County\nCELL (3, 3): \nSouth Carolina State Line\nCELL (4, 1): \nLockwood Folly River\nCELL (4, 2): \nGenoes Point to Mullet Creek\nCELL (4, 3): \nTo and across the Intracoastal Water to\nSheep Island\nCELL (5, 1): \nTown Creek\nCELL (5, 2): \nUS Hwy 17\nCELL (5, 3): \nNC 133\nCELL (6, 1): \nShallotte River\nCELL (6, 2): \nUnincorporated Areas of Brunswick County\nCELL (6, 3): \n\nNEW PAGE 60\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n4. The intent of this Water Quality Protection District is to apply a set of regulations for water quality protection, to specifically described areas\nof land abutting a specifically described water area; which is encompassed by a line drawn to extend across the Lockwood Folly River from\nGenoe's Point to Mullet Creek, southly to and across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway.\nB. Applicability\n1. The requirements and standards of the WQP- Water Quality Protection Overlay shall apply to all lands shown on a special Zoning Overlay\nMap made a part of this District, whereby all land parcels of public record included are clearly shown. This District includes an area extending\n575' landward of the mean high water line, with any lot or parcel falling within such distance being included entirely within this overlay zone.\n2. Parcels smaller than one acre in size shall be exempt from the requirements of this Section.\n3. Such waters have been defined by the State as being those waters south from a line extending from Genoes Point to Mullet Creek, to and\nacross the Intracoastal Water to Sheep Island.\nC. Incorporation of Studies by Reference\n1. Among the specific studies establishing the WQP District have been the March, 1989 publication entitled \"Report on Coastal Resource Waters\n- Intensive Study,\" by the Division of Environmental Management, N.C. Department of Natural Resources and Community Development, and\nthe August, 1989, publication entitled \"Lockwood Folly River Basin Water Quality Evaluation Report.\" Those studies are included by reference.\n2. The State of North Carolina has concluded the quality of the waters within the boundaries of the District had so declined there could be no\nassurance the proposed regulations would result in the goal of these waters being open full seasons for shell fishing. The Environmental\nManagement Commission did, under N.C. Administrative Code, Subordinance 2B, Surface Water Standards, Monitoring, Section .0219, Water\nQuality Management Plans, sub-section (b) establish a defined area of the mouth of this river, as above described, to be protected by a\nWater Quality Management Plan with specific actions which became effective January 1, 1990, included herein by reference.\nD. Application Requirements\nApplications for all development meeting the applicability requirements in the paragraph above shall require an approved Sedimentation\nErosion Control Plan be filed.\nE. Development Standards\nAll development within a WQP- Water Quality Protection Overlay shall:\n1. Limit the built upon impervious area to no more than 25% of the lot;\n2. Provide a buffer zone of at least 30' from any wetland or water line;\n3. Limit any structures to being at least 75' from the mean high water line; and\n4. Comply with any additional standards imposed by State or Federal regulations.\n4.9 VOLUNTARY AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT PROGRAM\nCommentary: The Voluntary Agricultural District is not an overlay zoning district, and is not implemented in the same was as a zoning district would\nbe.\n4.9.1.
