This is done in order to:\nA.\nConserve open land, including those areas containing productive agricultural soils, unique and sensitive natural\nfeatures such as floodplains, wetlands, river and stream corridors, areas with mature hardwood trees, and\nwatersheds;\nB.\nPromote existing rural character particularly in areas visible from major roadways in the County;\nC.\nRetain and protect existing environmental, natural, and cultural resources;\nD.\nCreate a linked network of open lands; and\nE.\nProvide reasonable economic use of the land.\nFIGURE 6.5.1: CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION\nMON\nLEGEND\nLot Line\nPrivate Road\nTrail\nWoodland\nFarmland\n6.5.2.\nAPPLICABILITY\nA.\nType of Development\nThis conservation subdivision option shall be limited to development of single-family detached residential dwellings\non individual lots in subdivisions of more than five lots.
