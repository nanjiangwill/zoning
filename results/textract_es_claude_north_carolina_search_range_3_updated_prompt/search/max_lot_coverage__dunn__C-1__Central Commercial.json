Where required as part of a buffer yard, fencing or walls must adhere to the provisions\nbelow. Nothing in this Section shall prohibit the owner of a single-family dwelling from constructing a\nseparate fence along the borders of such property, provided that all required buffer plantings are\nmaintained.\na.
