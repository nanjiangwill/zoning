Development in this District should rely predominantly on individual wells and septic tank systems for\ndomestic water supply and sewage disposal, respectively, although clustered residential development served by public water and wastewater\nsystems may be allowed.\nB. R-7500, R-6000, and SBR-6000\nThe R-7500, R-6000, and SBR-6000 districts are established to provide for orderly suburban residential development. A limited number of\ncommercial and civic uses are allowed, subject to the restrictions necessary to preserve and protect the residential character of the\nneighborhood. A special permit process for higher intensity development is also allowed, using discretion to balance issues of higher density\nwith improved amenities. Due to the higher intensity developments contained in this district, it is intended to be applied to properties served by\npublic sewer and water systems.\nC. MR-3200\nThis district is established as an area in which the principal use of the land is for high density residential purposes, not to exceed fourteen\ndwelling units per acre. The district also provides for the development of less intensive residential uses, as well as for compatible supporting\nnon-residential uses. Due to the higher intensity developments contained in this district, it is intended to be applied only to properties served by\npublic sewer and water systems.\n4.4.2.

Districts\nA. C-LD: Commercial-Low Density\nThis District is intended primarily to be used in outlying areas, adjacent to major thoroughfares, with yards and other provisions for reducing\nconflicts with adjacent residential uses, and with substantial setbacks to reduce marginal friction on adjacent major thoroughfares. Commercial\nuses in this District will serve the needs of residential neighborhoods for auto-dependent commercial facilities; and serve the needs of highway\noriented tourist business.\nB. N-C: Neighborhood-Commercial\nThe N-C, Neighborhood-Commercial District is primarily intended to accommodate very low intensity office, retail and personal service uses\nwithin and adjoining residential areas. The district is established to provide convenient locations for businesses which serve the needs of\nsurrounding residents, including low intensity office, retail, and personal service uses, without disrupting the character of the neighborhood.\nCompatibility with nearby residences is reflected in design standards for both site layout and buildings. In addition, uses in the N-C District will\nhave minimal infrastructure demands.\nC. C-I: Commercial-Intensive\nThe C-I District is intended for uses which require close access to major highways. Anticipated uses include those which are necessary to service\nmore intensive commercial and industrial districts, such as warehousing, storage, moving, service and repair, distribution, wholesaling,\nmarketing of specialty goods and light manufacturing plants.\n4.5.2. Permitted Uses in Commercial Districts\nOnly uses specifically listed in the use table in Section 5.2 as a permitted (\"P\"), permitted subject to limited use standards (\"L\"), or permitted subject\nto special use permit (\"SUP\") shall be permitted in Commercial districts.\n4.5.3.
