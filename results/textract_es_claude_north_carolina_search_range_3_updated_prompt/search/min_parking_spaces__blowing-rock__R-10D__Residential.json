More Specific Use Controls. Whenever a development could fall within more\nthan one use classification in the Table of Permissible Uses, the classification that most closely\nand most specifically describes the development controls. For example, a small doctor's office\nor clinic clearly falls within the 3.110 classification (Office and service operations conducted\nentirely indoors and designed to attract customers or clients to the premises). However,\nclassification 3.130, \"Physicians and dentists offices and clinics occupying not more than 10,000\nsquare feet of gross floor area\" more specifically covers this use and therefore is controlling.\nSection 16-10.12. Short-Term Rentals. The Board finds that short-term rentals (STRs) are an\nappropriate use given the residential/resort character of Blowing Rock's planning jurisdiction,\nprovided that specific controls are in place to regulate parking, trash, noise, tenant safety, and\nother related effects thereby protecting neighborhood property values, and the health, safety,\nand the general welfare of Town citizens and visitors.\nShort-term rentals are defined as the rental, lease, or offer to make available, any attached or\ndetached residential dwelling unit, or portion thereof, by way of a rental agreement, lease,\nlicense, or any other means, (whether oral or written) for compensation or consideration, for a\nduration that is less than 28 consecutive days. The following standards shall apply to all short-\nterm rentals with the Town's planning jurisdiction:\na) A zoning permit must be initially obtained for a change in use for each dwelling unit that is to\nbe rented for a period of less than 28 days. The permit is not valid until a satisfactory\ninspection is completed.\nb) A local contact person or management company contact information must be clearly posted\non the interior of the dwelling unit, and the person/company shall be available to respond to\ncomplaints or emergencies within one (1) hour.\nc) Sufficient off-street parking must be provided for each bedroom to be rented. The parking\nspace must meet the minimum dimensional requirements in Section 16-20.6. Short-term\nrental units that exist on July 1, 2018, are grandfathered with respect to parking, but each\nbedroom added after this date requires an additional parking space.\nd) Adequate trash and recycling containers must be provided. If collection containers are kept\nin an enclosure bin, the bin must meet minimum design standards defined in the Town Code\n(ex. Placed within 6 to 12 feet of the edge of the street, opaque screening at least four feet\nhigh, etc.).\ne) The dwelling unit must be equipped with operable smoke detectors and carbon monoxide\ndetectors consistent with the NC Building Code.\nf)\nThe 911 address must be posted on the front of the house or dwelling unit with 3.5-inch\nreflective numbers (6-inch reflective number if commercial or multi-family) or on the\n10-6\n\nNEW PAGE 101\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nproperty according to Section 7-17 of the Town Code. The 911 address must be clearly posted\non the interior of the dwelling unit to notify tenants in case of emergency.\n16-10.12.1. In addition to those areas zoned to allow short-term rentals (CB, TC, GB, OI), there\nare other areas where short-term rentals are permissible including Chetola Resort and Royals\nOaks Condominiums (Overlay District).

For all other changes in use, no additional parking is required.\n16-20.3.2. A one-time addition of bathrooms, storage or equipment areas less than 250\nsquare feet is not required to provide additional parking.\n16-20.3.3. Short-term rentals that legally exist on or before July 1, 2018 are grandfathered\nwith respect to required parking. If any dwelling unit is expanded to add a bedroom that will\nbe used for short-term rentals, the owner must provide an off-street parking space that\nmeets the dimensional requirements of the Land Use Code.\nSection 16-20.4. Flexibility in Administration Required. The Board recognizes that, due to the\nparticularities of any given development, the inflexible application of the parking standards set\nforth in herein may result in a development either with inadequate parking spaces or parking\nspace far in excess of its needs. The former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking\nviolations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots. The latter\nsituation results in a waste of money as well as a waste of space that could more desirably be\nused for valuable development or environmentally useful open space. Therefore, as suggested in\nSection 16-20.1, the permit-issuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive\nrequirements of 16-20.2 and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever it finds\nthat such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in Section 16-20.1.\n16-20.4.1. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the permit-issuing authority may\nallow deviations from the parking requirements set forth in 16-20.1.5 when it finds that:\na) A residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly; or\nb) A business is primarily oriented toward walk-in trade.\n16-20.4.2. Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the\npresumptive parking requirements set forth in 16-20.2 it shall enter on the face of the permit\nthe parking requirement that it imposes and the reasons for allowing or requiring the\ndeviation.\n16-20.4.3. If the permit-issuing authority concludes, based upon information it receives in the\nconsideration of a specific development proposal, that the presumption established by\nSubsection 16-16-20.2 for a particular use classification is erroneous, it shall initiate a request\nfor an amendment to the Table of Parking Requirements in accordance with the procedures\nset forth in Article 20.\nSection 16-20.5. Payment of Fee in Lieu of Providing Required Parking Spaces. With respect to\nproperties within the TC, CB and O-I districts that are developed for commercial purposes, the\npermit-issuing authority may authorize the developer to forego the construction of parking\nspaces otherwise required on the developer's property pursuant to the provisions of this Article\nfor commercial uses if:\na) the permit-issuing authority finds that the parking needs of such development can be met by\npublic parking facilities that are located or expected to be constructed within a reasonable\ntime within reasonable proximity to the proposed development, and\nb)\nthe developer pays to the Town for each such space that is not constructed a fee in lieu of\nproviding that space in an amount determined as provided herein.

For example, if there is only one building on\na lot and a florist shop that is the sole tenant of that building moves out and is replaced by a\nclothing store, that constitutes a change in use even though both tenants fall within principal\nuse classification 2.110. However, if the florist shop were replaced by another florist shop,\nthat would not constitute change in use since the type of business or enterprise would not\nhave changed. Moreover, if the florist shop moved out of a rented space in a shopping center\nand was replaced by a clothing store, that would not constitute a change in use since there is\nmore than one business on the lot and the essential character of the activity conducted on\nthat lot (shopping center - combination use) has not changed.\n16-10.8.1. A mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice-\nversa does not constitute a change in use. Whether a change in use occurs shall be\ndetermined by comparing the two active uses of the property without regard to any\nintervening period during which the property may have been unoccupied, unless the\nproperty has remained unoccupied for more than 180 consecutive days or has been\nabandoned.\n16-10.8.2. A mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in the\nname shall not be regarded as a change in use.\nSection 16-10.9. Manufacturing/Processing, Etc. Uses. The Board finds that the\nresidential/resort character of the area within Blowing Rock's planning jurisdiction is\nincompatible with the development of such area for uses within the 4.000 classification of the\nTable of Permissible Uses (manufacturing, processing, etc.) except to the extent that such uses\ncreate none of the negative impacts often associated with such manufacturing/processing uses.\nTherefore, no 4.000 classification use within any zoning district may:\na) Emit from a vent, stock, chimney, or combustion process any smoke that is visible to the\nnaked eye.\nb) Generate noise that tends to have an annoying or disruptive effect upon uses located outside\nthe immediate space occupied by the 4.000 use if that use is one of several on the lot or uses\nlocated on adjacent lots.\nc) Generate any ground transmitted vibration that is perceptible to the human sense of touch\nmeasured at the outside boundary of the immediate space occupied by the enterprise\ngenerating the vibration if the enterprise is one of several located on a lot, or the lot line if\n10-4\n\nNEW PAGE 99\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nthe enterprise generating the vibration is the only enterprise located on a lot.\nd)\nGenerate any odor that reaches the \"odor threshold\" measured at the outside boundary of\nthe immediate space occupied by the enterprise generating the odor, or the lot line if the\nenterprise generating the odor is the only enterprise located on a lot. For purposes of this\nsubdivision, the \"odor threshold\" is defined as the minimum concentration in air of a gas,\nvapor, or particulate matter that can be detected by the olfactory systems of a panel of\nhealthy observers.\ne) Require for its operations a daily average of more than 200 gallons of water per employee.\nf) Create any electrical disturbance that adversely affects any operations or equipment other\nthan those of the creator of such disturbance, or otherwise causes, creates, or contributes\nto\nthe interference with electronic signals (including television and radio broadcasting\ntransmissions) to the extent that the operation of any equipment not owned by the creator\nof such disturbance is adversely affected.\nSection 16-10.10. Combination Uses. When a combination use comprises two or more principal\nuses that require different types of permits (zoning or special use), then the permit authorizing\nthe combination use shall be:\na) A special use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a special use permit.\nb) A zoning permit in all other cases.\nThis is indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses by the designation Z and S in each of the columns\nadjacent to the 29.000 classification.\n16-10.10.1. Subject to Section 16-10.10.2 when a combination use in an R-6 or R-10 zoning\ndistrict consists of a residential subdivision and a multi-family development, the total density\npermissible on the lot shall be determined by having the developer indicate on the plans the\nportion of the total lot that will be developed for each purpose and calculating the density\nfor each portion as if it were a separate lot.\n16-10.10.2. Notwithstanding Section 16-12.2.2 whenever a combination use consists of a\nstandard residential subdivision and a multi-family development, and the subdivided portion\nof the tract contains lots that exceed the minimum lot size requirements set forth in Section\n16-181, but that do not exceed an average of 30,000 square feet, then the density of the\nportion of the tract developed for multi-family purposes may be increased beyond the\npermissible density calculated in accordance with Section 16-10.10.1. The increase in density\nshall be determined as follows:\na) The minimum lot size requirement for the applicable zoning district shall be subtracted\nfrom each lot that exceeds the minimum lot size, and the remainders totaled.\nb) The sum derived from the calculation in subdivision (1) shall be divided by the minimum\nlot size requirement. Fractions shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.\nc)\nThe product of the calculation in subdivision (2) shall yield the number of additional multi-\nfamily dwelling units that may be located within the portion of tract developed for multi-\nfamily purposes.\n10-5\n\nNEW PAGE 100\nTown Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n16-10.10.3. When a residential use is combined with a non-residential use in a business\ndistrict, the lot must have at least the minimum square footage required for the residential\nuse alone.\n16-10.10.4. When two principal uses are combined, the total amount of parking required for\nthe combination use shall be determined by cumulating the amount of parking required for\neach individual principal use according to the relative amount of space occupied by that use.\nSection 16-10.11. More Specific Use Controls. Whenever a development could fall within more\nthan one use classification in the Table of Permissible Uses, the classification that most closely\nand most specifically describes the development controls. For example, a small doctor's office\nor clinic clearly falls within the 3.110 classification (Office and service operations conducted\nentirely indoors and designed to attract customers or clients to the premises). However,\nclassification 3.130, \"Physicians and dentists offices and clinics occupying not more than 10,000\nsquare feet of gross floor area\" more specifically covers this use and therefore is controlling.\nSection 16-10.12. Short-Term Rentals. The Board finds that short-term rentals (STRs) are an\nappropriate use given the residential/resort character of Blowing Rock's planning jurisdiction,\nprovided that specific controls are in place to regulate parking, trash, noise, tenant safety, and\nother related effects thereby protecting neighborhood property values, and the health, safety,\nand the general welfare of Town citizens and visitors.\nShort-term rentals are defined as the rental, lease, or offer to make available, any attached or\ndetached residential dwelling unit, or portion thereof, by way of a rental agreement, lease,\nlicense, or any other means, (whether oral or written) for compensation or consideration, for a\nduration that is less than 28 consecutive days. The following standards shall apply to all short-\nterm rentals with the Town's planning jurisdiction:\na) A zoning permit must be initially obtained for a change in use for each dwelling unit that is to\nbe rented for a period of less than 28 days. The permit is not valid until a satisfactory\ninspection is completed.\nb) A local contact person or management company contact information must be clearly posted\non the interior of the dwelling unit, and the person/company shall be available to respond to\ncomplaints or emergencies within one (1) hour.\nc) Sufficient off-street parking must be provided for each bedroom to be rented. The parking\nspace must meet the minimum dimensional requirements in Section 16-20.6. Short-term\nrental units that exist on July 1, 2018, are grandfathered with respect to parking, but each\nbedroom added after this date requires an additional parking space.\nd) Adequate trash and recycling containers must be provided. If collection containers are kept\nin an enclosure bin, the bin must meet minimum design standards defined in the Town Code\n(ex. Placed within 6 to 12 feet of the edge of the street, opaque screening at least four feet\nhigh, etc.).\ne) The dwelling unit must be equipped with operable smoke detectors and carbon monoxide\ndetectors consistent with the NC Building Code.\nf)\nThe 911 address must be posted on the front of the house or dwelling unit with 3.5-inch\nreflective numbers (6-inch reflective number if commercial or multi-family) or on the\n10-6\n", "page_number": 98, "page_range": [98, 99, 100], "highlight": ["<em>requirements</em> for the overall use are altered.\nc) If the original use is a combination use or planned", "the Town's planning jurisdiction:\na) A zoning permit must be initially obtained for a change in use <em>for</em>", "<em>each</em> <em>dwelling</em> <em>unit</em> that is to\nbe rented for a period of less than 28 days.", "company shall be available to respond to\ncomplaints or emergencies within one (1) hour.\nc) Sufficient <em>off</em>-<em>street</em>", "<em>parking</em> must be provided for each bedroom to be rented."], "score": 8.283652, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Residential\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R-10D\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R10D\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R-10D\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking space for each\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 218, 219, 220, 221, 224, 225, 226]}
