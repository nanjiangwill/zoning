Intent. The Residential Main Street Transition District (RMST) provides for the\ncompletion of residential neighborhoods in the residential area(s) surrounding the\nMain Street and contiguous Civic Districts through in-fill development. The intent\nof this district is to recognize that gradual transformation of existing development\nto high quality mixed density residential development is needed to support the\ncentral core of the Town. Higher density residential development allows a greater\nnumber of households to walk or bike, thus supporting businesses while reducing\nthe parking demand and providing environmental and health benefits. Allowed\nbuilding/lot types in these districts are the Detached House, Attached House, and\nMulti-Family Building. Streets in the Residential Main Street Transition District\nshould be interconnected, with streets and sidewalks providing a connection from\nChadbourn's Main Street and other mixed-use districts to the Single-Family\nResidential districts surrounding these neighborhoods. A range of housing types is\nencouraged. Criteria for the mix of building types establishes compatibility.\n(B.) Listed Uses:\n(1.)

Trees and shrubs in islands should be set back at least three feet from\nthe curb to allow for the operation of car doors.\n11.7 Reforestation of Slopes Steeper than 3:1\n11.7-1 Tree Cover Required.
