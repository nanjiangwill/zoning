Districts\nA. C-LD: Commercial-Low Density\nThis District is intended primarily to be used in outlying areas, adjacent to major thoroughfares, with yards and other provisions for reducing\nconflicts with adjacent residential uses, and with substantial setbacks to reduce marginal friction on adjacent major thoroughfares. Commercial\nuses in this District will serve the needs of residential neighborhoods for auto-dependent commercial facilities; and serve the needs of highway\noriented tourist business.\nB. N-C: Neighborhood-Commercial\nThe N-C, Neighborhood-Commercial District is primarily intended to accommodate very low intensity office, retail and personal service uses\nwithin and adjoining residential areas. The district is established to provide convenient locations for businesses which serve the needs of\nsurrounding residents, including low intensity office, retail, and personal service uses, without disrupting the character of the neighborhood.\nCompatibility with nearby residences is reflected in design standards for both site layout and buildings. In addition, uses in the N-C District will\nhave minimal infrastructure demands.\nC. C-I: Commercial-Intensive\nThe C-I District is intended for uses which require close access to major highways. Anticipated uses include those which are necessary to service\nmore intensive commercial and industrial districts, such as warehousing, storage, moving, service and repair, distribution, wholesaling,\nmarketing of specialty goods and light manufacturing plants.\n4.5.2. Permitted Uses in Commercial Districts\nOnly uses specifically listed in the use table in Section 5.2 as a permitted (\"P\"), permitted subject to limited use standards (\"L\"), or permitted subject\nto special use permit (\"SUP\") shall be permitted in Commercial districts.\n4.5.3. Development Standards\nA. Applicability\nThe following standards shall apply to all development within a Commercial zoning district.

Dimensions\nWTFs shall conform to the following dimensional requirements:\n(a) Height\n(1) Attached WTF: The top of the WTF may not be more than 30 feet above the building or structure to which it is attached.\n(2) Freestanding WTF Measurement: This measure shall include the foundation of the WTF, but exclude lightning rods for the\ndissipation of lighting or lights required by the FAA that do not provide support for any antennae.\n(3) Freestanding WTF in Residential Districts: In the RR District, the maximum height shall be 250 feet. In the R-7500, R-6000, and\nSBR-6000 Districts, the maximum height shall be 200 feet. However, increases in height of up to 20% may be allowed by Board of\nAdjustment as part of the special use permit approval with a certification by a registered engineer that the setbacks provide\nadequate fall area in case of a tower collapse.\n(4)\nFreestanding WTF in Nonresidential Districts: In the N-C District, the C-I and C-LD, and all other nonresidential districts\nthe\nmaximum height shall be 300 feet. However, increases in height of up to 20% may be allowed by Board of Adjustment as part of\nthe special use permit approval with a certification by a registered engineer that the setbacks provide adequate fall area in case\nof a tower collapse.\n(5) Mitigation of an existing WTF (see paragraph 6 \"Mitigation\" on page 5-50). The maximum height of a new WTF arising from\nmitigation shall not exceed 125% of the height of the tallest WTF that is being mitigated.\n(b) Setbacks\n(1) Attached WTF: The building or structure to which the WTF will be attached shall maintain the normal setbacks of the district.\n(2) Freestanding Concealed WTF: In the N-C district and all residential districts, setbacks shall be determined according to the\nunderlying zoning district, plus an additional six inches for every one-foot of tower height. In all other districts, setbacks for WTFs\nshall be determined according to the underlying zoning district.\n(3) Freestanding Nonconcealed WTF: Setbacks for WTFs shall be determined according to the underlying zoning district, plus an\nadditional six inches of setback (on each side) for every one-foot of tower height. The Board of Adjustment may approve\nreductions to this setback requirement as a part of the special use permit approval with a certification by a registered engineer\nthat the resulting setbacks provide adequate fall area in case of a tower collapse.\n(4)\nMitigation of an existing WTF: A new WTF approved as mitigation shall not be required to meet setback requirements so long as\nthe new WTF is no closer to any property lines or dwelling units as the WTF being mitigated.\nCommentary: Refer to Section 4.3.3.B for the underlying zoning district setbacks for WTFs proposed in residential zoning districts.

Residential District Intent Statements\nA. RR: Rural Low Density Residential\nThe Rural Low Density Residential District is intended to accommodate nonresidential agricultural uses and low density residential development,\nas well as limited nonresidential uses that are supportive of the County's traditional agricultural orientation including farming, silviculture\noperations and related activities. Development in this District should rely predominantly on individual wells and septic tank systems for\ndomestic water supply and sewage disposal, respectively, although clustered residential development served by public water and wastewater\nsystems may be allowed.\nB. R-7500, R-6000, and SBR-6000\nThe R-7500, R-6000, and SBR-6000 districts are established to provide for orderly suburban residential development. A limited number of\ncommercial and civic uses are allowed, subject to the restrictions necessary to preserve and protect the residential character of the\nneighborhood. A special permit process for higher intensity development is also allowed, using discretion to balance issues of higher density\nwith improved amenities. Due to the higher intensity developments contained in this district, it is intended to be applied to properties served by\npublic sewer and water systems.\nC. MR-3200\nThis district is established as an area in which the principal use of the land is for high density residential purposes, not to exceed fourteen\ndwelling units per acre. The district also provides for the development of less intensive residential uses, as well as for compatible supporting\nnon-residential uses. Due to the higher intensity developments contained in this district, it is intended to be applied only to properties served by\npublic sewer and water systems.\n4.4.2. Permitted Uses\nOnly uses specifically listed in the use table in Section 5.2 as a permitted (\"P\"), permitted subject to limited use standards (\"L\"), or permitted subject\nto special use permit (\"SUP\") shall be permitted in Residential districts.\n4.4.3.

Districts\nA. C-LD: Commercial-Low Density\nThis District is intended primarily to be used in outlying areas, adjacent to major thoroughfares, with yards and other provisions for reducing\nconflicts with adjacent residential uses, and with substantial setbacks to reduce marginal friction on adjacent major thoroughfares. Commercial\nuses in this District will serve the needs of residential neighborhoods for auto-dependent commercial facilities; and serve the needs of highway\noriented tourist business.\nB. N-C: Neighborhood-Commercial\nThe N-C, Neighborhood-Commercial District is primarily intended to accommodate very low intensity office, retail and personal service uses\nwithin and adjoining residential areas. The district is established to provide convenient locations for businesses which serve the needs of\nsurrounding residents, including low intensity office, retail, and personal service uses, without disrupting the character of the neighborhood.\nCompatibility with nearby residences is reflected in design standards for both site layout and buildings. In addition, uses in the N-C District will\nhave minimal infrastructure demands.\nC. C-I: Commercial-Intensive\nThe C-I District is intended for uses which require close access to major highways. Anticipated uses include those which are necessary to service\nmore intensive commercial and industrial districts, such as warehousing, storage, moving, service and repair, distribution, wholesaling,\nmarketing of specialty goods and light manufacturing plants.\n4.5.2. Permitted Uses in Commercial Districts\nOnly uses specifically listed in the use table in Section 5.2 as a permitted (\"P\"), permitted subject to limited use standards (\"L\"), or permitted subject\nto special use permit (\"SUP\") shall be permitted in Commercial districts.\n4.5.3.
