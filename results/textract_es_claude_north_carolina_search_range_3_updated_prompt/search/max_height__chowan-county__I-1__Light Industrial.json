(See Article V for permitted uses\nand Article VI for specific area and yard requirements.)\nI.\nB-3, Neighborhood Commercial District. This district is defined as certain\nareas that are designed to serve limited retail, office, service, and moderate\ndensity residential uses.

This district is defined as an area where\nmanufacturing establishments may be developed. The purpose of this district is\nto permit the normal operations of almost all industries except those that would\nbe detrimental to adjoining properties. Excluded from this district are those\nindustries which deal primarily in hazardous products such as explosives. This\ndistrict is intended to serve limited manufacturing, warehousing, wholesaling, and\nrelated commercial and service activities that have little or no adverse impact\nupon adjoining properties.

This district is defined as an area to serve a wide\nrange of assembling, fabricating, manufacturing, warehousing, wholesaling, and\nsupport retail and service uses. The Heavy Industrial District is established for\nthe purpose of providing appropriate locations and development regulations for\nuses which may require special measures to ensure compatibility with adjoining\nproperties.

All other rules, regulations, and\nconditions which may be offered by the property owner and approved by the\nBoard of County Commissioners as part of the rezoning process shall also apply.\nProperty may be placed in a conditional zoning district only in response to a\npetition by the owners of all of the property proposed to be included in the\nconditional zoning district. Requirements for conditional zoning districts are\ndelineated in Section 14.07.\n4.04\nOverlay Zoning Districts\nOverlay districts establish certain regulations that are in addition to those of the\nunderlying general use or conditional zoning districts. Property within a designated\noverlay district may be used in a manner permitted in the underlying general use or\nconditional zoning districts only if and to the extent such use is also permitted in the\napplicable overlay district.\nA.\nAP, Airport Protection Overlay District.
