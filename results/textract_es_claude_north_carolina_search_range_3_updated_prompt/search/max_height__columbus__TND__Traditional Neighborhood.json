The Mixed-Use District (MU) is established to provide opportunities for compatible and sustainable re-\ndevelopment where underutilized commercial properties already exist. The existing auto-oriented street, lot, and building\ndesigns can create uncomfortable pedestrian environments; however, with careful site planning these areas will allow\na\ngreater number of residents to walk or bike to businesses and services with an interconnected network of streets and\nsidewalks. Dominant uses in this district are residential, retail and office. The Mixed-Use District is expected to serve\nColumbus residents as well as persons who travel from surrounding communities. The development pattern in this district\nacknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access provided to ensure safety for the motoring public.\nDevelopment standards in the Mixed-Use District ensure the creation of a pleasant auto-oriented environment while enabling\na compatible transition to uses in adjacent districts. This District is available for rezoning only with the consent of the\nproperty owner(s).\n(2) Residential density limits.\n(a) Single Family Detached:\n7 unit/acre;\n(b) Single Family Attached: 17 units/acre; and\n(c) Multifamily:\n28 units/acre.\n(3) Dimensional standards.\n(Unless a greater standard is otherwise required)\n(B) Regulations pertaining to Traditional Neighborhood Districts (TND).\n(1) Intent. The Traditional Neighborhood Development District (TND) provides for the development of new\nneighborhoods and the revitalization or extension of existing neighborhoods. These neighborhoods are structured upon a\nfine network of interconnecting pedestrian oriented streets and other public spaces. Traditional Neighborhood Developments\n(TND's) provide a mixture of housing types and prices, prominently sited civic or community building(s),\nstores/offices/workplaces, and churches to provide a balanced mix of activities.

A TND is\nurban in form, is typically an extension of the existing developed area of the Town, and has an overall residential density of\nup to 16 dwelling units per acre. TND districts should have a significant portion of land dedicated to open spaces. This\nDistrict is available for rezoning only with the consent of the property owner(s).\n(2) Residential density limits.\n(a) Single-family detached: seven units/acre;\n(b) Single-family attached: 12 units/acre; and\n(c) Multifamily development standards.\n1. The multi-family development shall not exceed a total of seventy-two (72) dwelling units.\n2. The maximum permitted density for the multi-family development shall be 14 1/2 units per acre.\n3. The permitted building and lot types for the multi-family development in a single-family area shall be the\ndetached house and the attached house building and lot types.\n4. All parking for the multi-family development shall be located behind the building. The parking area shall be\nscreened from adjacent properties and from the street with a screening device.\n5. The buildings in the multi-family development shall be architecturally compatible with single family structures on\nthe street on which the multi-family building is proposed. Elements that shall be incorporated into the design of the multi-\nfamily building to ensure architectural compatibility are:\na. The multi-family building shall be constructed of building materials similar to those used on single family\nstructures on the street.\nb. The roof pitch of the multi-family building shall be the same as that of the single-family structures on the street.\nC. The fenestration of the multi-family building by location and size of windows and doors shall be similar to that of\nthe single-family homes on the street.\nd. Color renderings of the proposed building must be submitted with the application to ensure architectural\ncompatibility.\n6. No multi-family building shall be located closer than 48 feet to an existing multi-family building or development.\nThe distance shall be measured along centerline of streets from the edge of the property proposed for development to the\nclosest edge of the property on which the existing multi-family building or development is located.\n(3) TND general requirements.\n(a) Along existing streets, new buildings shall respect the general spacing of structures, building mass and scale, and\nstreet frontage relationships of existing buildings.\n1. New buildings which adhere to the scale, massing, volume, spacing, and setback of existing buildings along\nfronting streets exhibit demonstrable compatibility.\n2. New buildings which exceed the scale and volume of existing buildings may demonstrate compatibility by varying\nthe massing of buildings to reduce perceived scale and volume.\n(b)\nOn new streets, allowable building and lot types will establish the development pattern.\n(c) A master plan in compliance with Traditional Neighborhood Development standards shall be provided with the\nzoning permit submittal for a general district TND. The master plan shall include a topographic survey and shall show the\nlocation and hierarchy of streets and public open spaces, location of residential, commercial, and civic building lots, street\nsections and/or plans, a master sign program, an outline of any additional regulatory intentions, phasing, and any other\ninformation, including building elevations, which may be required to evaluate the interior pedestrian environment and\nconditions at project edges.\n(d) Minimum Development Size: eight acres.\n(e) Maximum Development Size: none.\n(4) TND design requirements.\n(a) Neighborhood form.\n1. The area of the TND shall be divided into blocks, streets, lots, and open space.\n2. Similar land uses shall generally front across each street. Dissimilar categories shall generally abut at rear lot\nlines. Corner lots which front on streets of dissimilar use shall generally observe the setback established on each fronting\nstreet.\n(b) Streets, alleys and blocks.\n1. Public streets shall provide access to all tracts and lots.\n\nNEW PAGE 22\n2. Streets and alleys shall, wherever practicable, terminate at other streets within the neighborhood and connect to\nexisting and projected streets outside the development.\n3. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 250 feet in length, must be accessed from a street providing internal or external\nconnectivity, shall be permanently terminated by a vehicular turnaround, and are listed only where topography makes a\nstreet connection impracticable\n4. Vehicular turnarounds of various configurations are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately\nprovided.\n5. Pedestrian connections should be provided as extensions of terminating streets where not precluded by\ntopography or other physical constraints.\n6. The average perimeter of all blocks within the TND should not exceed 1,350 feet. No block face should have a\nlength greater than 500 feet without a dedicated alley or pathway providing through access.\n7. A continuous network of rear alleys shall provide vehicular access to lots 49 feet or less in width.\n8. Utilities may run along alleys provided that a permanent public access and utility easement is recorded for the full\nlength of alley being used for utilities or public services such as garbage collection.\n9. TND streets shall be organized according to a hierarchy based on function, size, capacity, and design speed;\nstreets and rights-of-way are therefore expected to differ in dimension. The proposed hierarchy of streets shall be indicated\non the submitted site plan. Each street type in a TND shall be separately detailed. An array of elements that are combined to\nmeet the purposes of TND neighborhood streets: building placement line, optional utility allocation, sidewalk, planting strip,\ncurb and gutter, optional parallel parking, and travel lane(s). Alternative methods of assembling the required street elements\nwill be considered to allow neighborhood street designs that are most appropriate to setting and use.\n10. To prevent the buildup of vehicular speed, disperse traffic flow, and create a sense of visual enclosure, long\nuninterrupted segments of straight streets should be avoided. Methods to achieve this interruption include:\n(i) A street can be interrupted by intersections designed to calm the speed and disperse the flow of traffic and\nterminate vistas with a significant feature (building, park, natural feature);\n(ii) A street can be terminated with a public monument, specifically designed building facade, or a gateway to the\nensuing space;\n(iii) Perceived street length can be reduced by a noticeable street curve where the outside edge of the curve is\nbounded by a building or other vertical elements that hug the curve and deflect the view; and\n(iv) Other traffic calming configurations are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately provided.\n(c) Buildings and lots.\n1. All lots shall share a frontage line with a street or square; lots fronting a square shall be provided rear alley\naccess.\n2. Consistent build-to lines shall be established along all streets and public space frontages; build-to lines determine\nthe width and ratio of enclosure for each public street or space. A minimum percentage build-out at the build-to line shall be\nestablished on the plan along all streets and public square frontages.\n3. Large-scale, single use facilities (conference spaces, theaters, athletic facilities, etc.) shall generally occur behind\nor above smaller scale uses of pedestrian orientation.\n(d) Open space.

IX, passed -\n\u00a7 154.067 BUILDING HEIGHT OVERLAY DISTRICTS.\n(A) Reason for regulation. It is recognized that two major characteristics of the town greatly contribute to the atmosphere,\ncultural heritage and appeal of the whole community. Specifically, the scenic mountain views bounding the town on the north\nand north west and the historic county courthouse located in the middle of town both offer a sense of place and community\nto the town's residents and add to the attractiveness of the area. It is further recognized that the height of buildings, if left\nunregulated or inadequately regulated, can detract from these two features. Therefore, building heights shall be regulated\nbased on the location of the subject building in relation to mountain view-sheds and to the historic county courthouse.\n(B) Establishment of Building Height Overlay Districts The boundaries of the Building Height Overlay Districts shall be\ndepicted on a map named the \"Town of Columbus Building Height Overlay District Map\" and shall be made part of this\nchapter upon adoption of this section.\n(C) Districts. For the purposes of determining maximum building heights, the town shall be divided into the following\nBuilding Height Overlay Districts:\n(1) General;\n(2) Courthouse; and\n(3) Mountain View-Shed.\n(D) General Building Height District. In this district no building shall be taller than 36 feet. However, if the average\nelevation (above mean sea level) of the ridgelines of existing adjacent buildings situated on lots having a common boundary\nwith the subject parcel upon which the proposed building is to be situated (adjacent lots that are vacant not being included in\nthis calculation) is less than the elevation (above mean sea level) determined by measuring 36 feet vertically from the\naverage grade of the proposed building envelope on the subject parcel, then the proposed building shall be no taller than\nthat average. In the event that the average elevation (above mean sea level) of the existing buildings' ridgelines on the\nsurrounding adjacent properties is such that the subject parcel is rendered unbuildable (meaning a single story building with\nan appropriate roof is not feasible), then the proposed building shall have a height not exceeding 29 feet. The determination\nthat a subject parcel is rendered unbuildable under this division (D) shall be at the discretion of the approving administrator,\nboard, or council.\n(E) Courthouse Building Height District. In this district no building's ridgeline shall have an elevation higher than the\nelevation defined by the plane of the soffit of the eave of the roof of the historic county courthouse; however, in no case shall\na buildings height be taller than 29 feet.\n(F) Mountain View-Shed District. Buildings on areas of high elevation are highly visible from surrounding public spaces.\nAs such, buildings in this district shall not be more than 29 feet tall.\n(G) Height. The height of a building shall be measured from the grade of the average grade of the property to the highest\nridge of the roof of the structure.\n(Ord., Art. IX, \u00a7 900, passed - -; Ord. passed - -)\n\u00a7 154.068 FLOOR AREA.\n(A) Potential.

A TND is\nurban in form, is typically an extension of the existing developed area of the Town, and has an overall residential density of\nup to 16 dwelling units per acre. TND districts should have a significant portion of land dedicated to open spaces. This\nDistrict is available for rezoning only with the consent of the property owner(s).\n(2) Residential density limits.\n(a) Single-family detached: seven units/acre;\n(b) Single-family attached: 12 units/acre; and\n(c) Multifamily development standards.\n1. The multi-family development shall not exceed a total of seventy-two (72) dwelling units.\n2. The maximum permitted density for the multi-family development shall be 14 1/2 units per acre.\n3. The permitted building and lot types for the multi-family development in a single-family area shall be the\ndetached house and the attached house building and lot types.\n4. All parking for the multi-family development shall be located behind the building. The parking area shall be\nscreened from adjacent properties and from the street with a screening device.\n5. The buildings in the multi-family development shall be architecturally compatible with single family structures on\nthe street on which the multi-family building is proposed. Elements that shall be incorporated into the design of the multi-\nfamily building to ensure architectural compatibility are:\na. The multi-family building shall be constructed of building materials similar to those used on single family\nstructures on the street.\nb. The roof pitch of the multi-family building shall be the same as that of the single-family structures on the street.\nC. The fenestration of the multi-family building by location and size of windows and doors shall be similar to that of\nthe single-family homes on the street.\nd. Color renderings of the proposed building must be submitted with the application to ensure architectural\ncompatibility.\n6. No multi-family building shall be located closer than 48 feet to an existing multi-family building or development.\nThe distance shall be measured along centerline of streets from the edge of the property proposed for development to the\nclosest edge of the property on which the existing multi-family building or development is located.\n(3) TND general requirements.\n(a) Along existing streets, new buildings shall respect the general spacing of structures, building mass and scale, and\nstreet frontage relationships of existing buildings.\n1. New buildings which adhere to the scale, massing, volume, spacing, and setback of existing buildings along\nfronting streets exhibit demonstrable compatibility.\n2. New buildings which exceed the scale and volume of existing buildings may demonstrate compatibility by varying\nthe massing of buildings to reduce perceived scale and volume.\n(b)\nOn new streets, allowable building and lot types will establish the development pattern.\n(c) A master plan in compliance with Traditional Neighborhood Development standards shall be provided with the\nzoning permit submittal for a general district TND. The master plan shall include a topographic survey and shall show the\nlocation and hierarchy of streets and public open spaces, location of residential, commercial, and civic building lots, street\nsections and/or plans, a master sign program, an outline of any additional regulatory intentions, phasing, and any other\ninformation, including building elevations, which may be required to evaluate the interior pedestrian environment and\nconditions at project edges.\n(d) Minimum Development Size: eight acres.\n(e) Maximum Development Size: none.\n(4) TND design requirements.\n(a) Neighborhood form.\n1. The area of the TND shall be divided into blocks, streets, lots, and open space.\n2. Similar land uses shall generally front across each street. Dissimilar categories shall generally abut at rear lot\nlines. Corner lots which front on streets of dissimilar use shall generally observe the setback established on each fronting\nstreet.\n(b) Streets, alleys and blocks.\n1. Public streets shall provide access to all tracts and lots.\n\nNEW PAGE 22\n2. Streets and alleys shall, wherever practicable, terminate at other streets within the neighborhood and connect to\nexisting and projected streets outside the development.\n3. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 250 feet in length, must be accessed from a street providing internal or external\nconnectivity, shall be permanently terminated by a vehicular turnaround, and are listed only where topography makes a\nstreet connection impracticable\n4. Vehicular turnarounds of various configurations are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately\nprovided.\n5. Pedestrian connections should be provided as extensions of terminating streets where not precluded by\ntopography or other physical constraints.\n6. The average perimeter of all blocks within the TND should not exceed 1,350 feet. No block face should have a\nlength greater than 500 feet without a dedicated alley or pathway providing through access.\n7. A continuous network of rear alleys shall provide vehicular access to lots 49 feet or less in width.\n8. Utilities may run along alleys provided that a permanent public access and utility easement is recorded for the full\nlength of alley being used for utilities or public services such as garbage collection.\n9. TND streets shall be organized according to a hierarchy based on function, size, capacity, and design speed;\nstreets and rights-of-way are therefore expected to differ in dimension. The proposed hierarchy of streets shall be indicated\non the submitted site plan. Each street type in a TND shall be separately detailed. An array of elements that are combined to\nmeet the purposes of TND neighborhood streets: building placement line, optional utility allocation, sidewalk, planting strip,\ncurb and gutter, optional parallel parking, and travel lane(s). Alternative methods of assembling the required street elements\nwill be considered to allow neighborhood street designs that are most appropriate to setting and use.\n10. To prevent the buildup of vehicular speed, disperse traffic flow, and create a sense of visual enclosure, long\nuninterrupted segments of straight streets should be avoided. Methods to achieve this interruption include:\n(i) A street can be interrupted by intersections designed to calm the speed and disperse the flow of traffic and\nterminate vistas with a significant feature (building, park, natural feature);\n(ii) A street can be terminated with a public monument, specifically designed building facade, or a gateway to the\nensuing space;\n(iii) Perceived street length can be reduced by a noticeable street curve where the outside edge of the curve is\nbounded by a building or other vertical elements that hug the curve and deflect the view; and\n(iv) Other traffic calming configurations are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately provided.\n(c) Buildings and lots.\n1. All lots shall share a frontage line with a street or square; lots fronting a square shall be provided rear alley\naccess.\n2. Consistent build-to lines shall be established along all streets and public space frontages; build-to lines determine\nthe width and ratio of enclosure for each public street or space. A minimum percentage build-out at the build-to line shall be\nestablished on the plan along all streets and public square frontages.\n3. Large-scale, single use facilities (conference spaces, theaters, athletic facilities, etc.) shall generally occur behind\nor above smaller scale uses of pedestrian orientation.\n(d) Open space. The provision and design of open space shall comply with the requirements set forth herein.\n(e) Parking, landscaping and buffers shall comply with the requirements set forth herein.\nCELL (1, 1):

The Mixed-Use District (MU) is established to provide opportunities for compatible and sustainable re-\ndevelopment where underutilized commercial properties already exist. The existing auto-oriented street, lot, and building\ndesigns can create uncomfortable pedestrian environments; however, with careful site planning these areas will allow\na\ngreater number of residents to walk or bike to businesses and services with an interconnected network of streets and\nsidewalks. Dominant uses in this district are residential, retail and office. The Mixed-Use District is expected to serve\nColumbus residents as well as persons who travel from surrounding communities. The development pattern in this district\nacknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access provided to ensure safety for the motoring public.\nDevelopment standards in the Mixed-Use District ensure the creation of a pleasant auto-oriented environment while enabling\na compatible transition to uses in adjacent districts.

to ensure proper operation of septic tanks and wells. In no case, however, shall minimum lot area be\nless than specified in this table.\n(2) On all corner lots, a 15-foot side yard setback is required except in the CBD, where a five-foot side yard setback is\nrequired.\n(3) In the CBD, where adjacent buildings have front yard setbacks less than five feet, the minimum front setback may be\nequivalent to the adjacent properties.\n(4) Regulations pertaining to mobile home parks are contained in Chapter 150\n(5) Regulations pertaining to Mixed Use (MU) Districts and Traditional Neighborhood Districts (TND) are contained in \u00a7\u00a7\n154.066(A) and 154.066(B), respectively.\n(Ord., Art. IX, passed -\n\u00a7 154.067 BUILDING HEIGHT OVERLAY DISTRICTS.\n(A) Reason for regulation. It is recognized that two major characteristics of the town greatly contribute to the atmosphere,\ncultural heritage and appeal of the whole community. Specifically, the scenic mountain views bounding the town on the north\nand north west and the historic county courthouse located in the middle of town both offer a sense of place and community\nto the town's residents and add to the attractiveness of the area. It is further recognized that the height of buildings, if left\nunregulated or inadequately regulated, can detract from these two features. Therefore, building heights shall be regulated\nbased on the location of the subject building in relation to mountain view-sheds and to the historic county courthouse.\n(B) Establishment of Building Height Overlay Districts The boundaries of the Building Height Overlay Districts shall be\ndepicted on a map named the \"Town of Columbus Building Height Overlay District Map\" and shall be made part of this\nchapter upon adoption of this section.\n(C) Districts. For the purposes of determining maximum building heights, the town shall be divided into the following\nBuilding Height Overlay Districts:\n(1) General;\n(2) Courthouse; and\n(3) Mountain View-Shed.\n(D) General Building Height District. In this district no building shall be taller than 36 feet. However, if the average\nelevation (above mean sea level) of the ridgelines of existing adjacent buildings situated on lots having a common boundary\nwith the subject parcel upon which the proposed building is to be situated (adjacent lots that are vacant not being included in\nthis calculation) is less than the elevation (above mean sea level) determined by measuring 36 feet vertically from the\naverage grade of the proposed building envelope on the subject parcel, then the proposed building shall be no taller than\nthat average. In the event that the average elevation (above mean sea level) of the existing buildings' ridgelines on the\nsurrounding adjacent properties is such that the subject parcel is rendered unbuildable (meaning a single story building with\nan appropriate roof is not feasible), then the proposed building shall have a height not exceeding 29 feet. The determination\nthat a subject parcel is rendered unbuildable under this division (D) shall be at the discretion of the approving administrator,\nboard, or council.\n(E) Courthouse Building Height District. In this district no building's ridgeline shall have an elevation higher than the\nelevation defined by the plane of the soffit of the eave of the roof of the historic county courthouse; however, in no case shall\na buildings height be taller than 29 feet.\n(F) Mountain View-Shed District. Buildings on areas of high elevation are highly visible from surrounding public spaces.\nAs such, buildings in this district shall not be more than 29 feet tall.\n(G) Height. The height of a building shall be measured from the grade of the average grade of the property to the highest\nridge of the roof of the structure.\n(Ord., Art. IX, \u00a7 900, passed - -; Ord. passed - -)\n\u00a7 154.068 FLOOR AREA.\n(A) Potential. Large scale commercial development has the potential to pose many challenges to a relatively small\ncommunity such as the town. The development can overwhelm local police services, undermine a current diversified\ncommercial market, strain the character of the local community, cause excessive vehicular congestion, and can be difficult\nCELL (1, 1): \nIndustrial\nDistrict\n(IND)\nCELL (1, 2): \nSame as\nHC\nCELL (1, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (1, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (1, 5): \n80\nCELL (1, 6): \n30\nCELL (1, 7): \n60\nCELL (1, 8): \n10\nCELL (1, 9): \n20\nCELL (1, 10): \n50\nCELL (2, 1): \nPublic\nService\nDistrict (PD)\nCELL (2, 2): \nSame as\nHC\nCELL (2, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (2, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (2, 5): \n80\nCELL (2, 6): \n30\nCELL (2, 7): \n60\nCELL (2, 8): \n10\nCELL (2, 9): \n20\nCELL (2, 10): \n50\n\nNEW PAGE 25\nto handle once left vacant. As such, the town finds it necessary to limit the allowable floor area of commercial development\nin order to ensure that the development is carried out in a manner that is appropriate and consistent with the character of the\ntown.\n(B) Commercial development. The building footprint of any structure and any accessory structure in the aggregate to be\nused for any commercial enterprise shall not be larger than 10,000 square feet in size. The building's footprint shall be\nconstrued to mean the perimeter line created by the edge of the roof of any structure and building on a lot in the aggregate.\nFor the purposes of this section, the term commercial development shall include any development intended to be used or\npotentially used by for-profit enterprises, including manufacturing and industrial developments, except that those uses\nallowed within the town's Public Service District shall not be considered commercial. It is recognized that in certain\ncircumstances it may be appropriate to allow for a larger building footprint for commercial developments. In order for a\ncommercial structure proposed to have a footprint larger than 10,000 square feet to be constructed, a special use permit\nshall be obtained prior to the commencement of the development. See \u00a7\u00a7 154.082 and 154.083 below for details regarding\nthe issuance of a special use permit for large scale commercial developments.\n(C) Residential development. The building footprint of all newly constructed residential developments shall not be larger\nthan 35% of the lot on which the residential development is proposed to be erected.\n(D) Public service development. Development to be used for any land use allowed in the town's Public Service (PS)\nzoning district shall have no limit on the size of the building footprint.\n(Ord., Art. IX, \u00a7 901, passed -)\nCONDITIONAL AND SPECIAL USES\n\u00a7 154.080 CONDITIONAL USE DISTRICTS.\n(A) For each general use district established in 154.060 through 154.064 above, there is also established a\ncorresponding conditional use district as follows:\n(B) It is recognized that certain types of zoning districts would be inappropriate at certain locations in the absence of\nspecial conditions. Where the applicant for rezoning desires property to be rezoned to such a district in those situations, the\nConditional Use District (CUD) is a means by which the special conditions can be imposed in the furtherance of the\npurposes of this chapter. The Conditional Use District classification will be considered for rezoning only upon request of a\nproperty owner. If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these regulations is found to be illegal or invalid or if the\napplicant should fail to accept any condition, it is the intent of this chapter that the authorization of the conditional use permit\nshall be null and void and of no effect, and that proceedings shall be instituted to rezone the property to its previous zoning\nclassification.\n(C) Within a CUD, only those uses authorized as either permitted or conditional uses in the zoning district with which the\nCUD corresponds shall be permitted, and all other requirements of the corresponding district shall be met as minimum\nstandards. In addition, with a CUD no use shall be permitted except pursuant to a conditional use permit authorized by the\nTown Council, which shall specify the use or uses authorized. The permit may further specify the location on the property of\nthe proposed use or uses, the number of dwelling units, the location and extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots,\ndriveway and access streets, the location and extent of buffer areas, and other special purpose areas, the timing of\ndevelopment, the location and extent of right-of-way and other areas to be dedicated for public use, and other such matters\nas the applicant may propose as conditions upon the request, but not to include conditions not generally a part of land\ndevelopment controls. In granting a conditional use permit, the Town Council may impose additional reasonable and\nappropriate safeguards upon the permit as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose and intent of this chapter are\nserved, public welfare secured and substantial justice done.\n(D) In approving a Conditional Use District Rezoning, the Town Council shall make the following (in addition to the\nfindings for conditional use permits in \u00a7 154.081(C) below) affirmative findings:\n(1) That the use(s) requested is among those listed as an eligible use in the Conditional Use District in which the\nsubject property is located or is to be located; and\n(2) That the location and character of the Conditional Use District if developed according to the site specific plan will be\nreasonable and consistent with the surrounding area and with adopted plans of the town.\nCELL (1, 1): \n(1) CU-R-1 Conditional Use R-1 District;\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \n(2) CU-R-2 Conditional Use R-2 District;\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (3, 1): \n(3) CU-CBD Conditional Use CBD District;\nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (4, 1): \n(4) CU-HC Conditional Use HC District;\nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (5, 1): \n(5) CU-IND Conditional Use IND District;\nCELL (5, 2): \nCELL (6, 1): \n(6) CU-PS Conditional Use PS District;\nCELL (6, 2): \nCELL (7, 1): \n(7) CU-MU Conditional Use MU District; and\nCELL (7, 2): \nCELL (8, 1): \n(8) CU-TND Conditional Use TND District.\nCELL (8, 2): \n", "page_number": 23, "page_range": [23, 24, 25], "highlight": ["10): \nCELL (11, 1): \nCentral\nBusiness\nCELL (11, 2): \nNone\nCELL (11, 3): \nFor first\nunit:\n5,000 sq.\n<em>ft</em>", "<em>Neighborhood</em> Districts (<em>TND</em>) are contained in \u00a7\u00a7\n154.066(A) and 154.066(B), respectively.", "(D) General Building <em>Height</em> District.
