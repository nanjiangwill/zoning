WATER USE DISTRICT (W-1)\n152.120 DISTRICT DESCRIPTION\nThe Water Use District (W-1) is established to provide for the safe and orderly use of public trust waters\nwithin the zoning jurisdiction of the Town. The Water Use District (W-1) is intended to provide for a\nwide range of activities and uses while protecting the public rights of access, health and safety.\n152.121 PERMITTED USES\n(a) Private bulkheads and piers which have received a permit under the North Carolina Coastal Area\nManagement Act.\n(a) Traditional water activities, such as bathing, fishing and boating.\n152.122 SPECIAL USES\n(a) Special events, such as boat races, regattas, water ski ishows, boat parades, and historic\nreenactments.\n(b) Commercial marinas only in the Marine Business District as regulated by sections 152.071 TO\n152.072.\n152.123 MOORING OF BOATS\n(a) The unattended mooring of vessels within the zoning jurisdiction of the Town for periods longer\nthan seven days is prohibited subject to those allowed in section 152.123(b). The occupancy of\nvessels within the zoning jurisdiction of the Town for longer than seven days is prohibited.\nThe mooring of boats within public trust waters creates safety hazards for boat traffic and can\ninterfere with public rights access to, and use of, navigable waters and public resources. The\nlong- term occupancy of moored vessels within the public trust waters is a hazard to water\nquality and public health. All temporarily moored boats must be lighted between sunset and\nsunrise.\n(b) Permanent, privately owned moorings are hazardous to navigation, increase congestion of the\npublic trust waters, and create potential water quality degradation. Therefore, no privately\nowned permanent mooring shall be allowed.\nARTICLE XIV. REGULATIONS\n152.130 APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS\nThe regulations set forth in this chapter affect all land, every building or structure and every use of the\nland and/or building within all the areas that are zoned by the Town.\n152.131 NEW USES OR CONSTRUCTION\nAfter the effective date of this chapter, all new construction and use of land shall conform to the use\nand dimensional requirements for the district in which it is to be located.\nAdopted 3/13/2023\n18\n", "page_number": 18, "page_range": [18, 19, 20], "highlight": ["<em>REQUIREMENTS</em>\nARTICLE XII.", "Width per Building <em>Lot</em>\nCELL (2, 1): \nRAW\nCELL (2, 2): \nResidential\nCELL (2, 3): \n20,000 <em>Sq</em>. <em>Ft</em>.", "Width per Building <em>Lot</em>\n<em>Lot</em>\nCELL (1, 4): \nMin.
