It shall reflect the natural mountain character of\nthe town, such as the use of wood and stone for benches, trash receptacles and the like.\n(D) Streets.\n(1) Difficult topography shall be avoided when locating and designing roads. For instance, roads are best placed along the\ncontours of a site if the site is hilly or steep. This minimizes fuel consumption and noise in automobiles and provides a more\ncomfortable access for pedestrians and bicycle riders. Consideration shall also be given to fire protection and emergency vehicles\nin order to facilitate access to any structure in case of any emergency.\n(2) Roadways shall focus attention on interesting views and should not interfere with natural drainage patterns.\n(3) The town uses the state's Department of Transportation Subdivision Roads Minimum Construction Standards to suggest\nparameters for new streets. These standards may need to be adjusted, especially in areas of difficult topography with steep slopes.\n(4) The site plan should incorporate a hierarchy of roadways and walkways that provide for safe, smooth and pleasant\nmovement of people and vehicles. Special attention shall be paid to points at which pedestrian, bicycle and automobile movements\nare in conflict. Clearly marked crosswalks or routing of pedestrian paths away from main automobile traffic areas can reduce\nhazards in these areas.\n(5) Whenever there is a design choice between access from the development to a street of a higher classification and access\nto a street of a lower classification, access should be to the street of lower classification.\n(6) On large streets, landscaped median islands are encouraged and crosswalks shall be included.\n(7) Trees, shrubs and other plants shall be planted along the streets in accordance with $$152.130 through 152.137 and\n152.150 through 152.170 of this chapter.\n(E) Sidewalks.\n(1) Building sites shall accommodate pedestrians and shall be centered around pedestrian traffic rather than vehicular traffic.\n(2) Access must be safe and convenient within a site.

The M-\nE Zoning District has large enough parcels to accommodate this type of system with minimal impact to neighboring properties.\nThese systems require an environmental assessment by a professional engineer, licensed in the state. The environmental\nassessment shall be submitted along with a conditional use permit to the Zoning Administrator for review by the Planning Board\nand the Board of Adjustment.\n(B) All wind energy conversion systems shall be located within a protected \"fall zone\".
