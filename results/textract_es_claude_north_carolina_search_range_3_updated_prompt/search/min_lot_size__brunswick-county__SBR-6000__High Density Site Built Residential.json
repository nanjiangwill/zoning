Residential District Intent Statements\nA. RR: Rural Low Density Residential\nThe Rural Low Density Residential District is intended to accommodate nonresidential agricultural uses and low density residential development,\nas well as limited nonresidential uses that are supportive of the County's traditional agricultural orientation including farming, silviculture\noperations and related activities. Development in this District should rely predominantly on individual wells and septic tank systems for\ndomestic water supply and sewage disposal, respectively, although clustered residential development served by public water and wastewater\nsystems may be allowed.\nB. R-7500, R-6000, and SBR-6000\nThe R-7500, R-6000, and SBR-6000 districts are established to provide for orderly suburban residential development. A limited number of\ncommercial and civic uses are allowed, subject to the restrictions necessary to preserve and protect the residential character of the\nneighborhood. A special permit process for higher intensity development is also allowed, using discretion to balance issues of higher density\nwith improved amenities. Due to the higher intensity developments contained in this district, it is intended to be applied to properties served by\npublic sewer and water systems.\nC. MR-3200\nThis district is established as an area in which the principal use of the land is for high density residential purposes, not to exceed fourteen\ndwelling units per acre. The district also provides for the development of less intensive residential uses, as well as for compatible supporting\nnon-residential uses. Due to the higher intensity developments contained in this district, it is intended to be applied only to properties served by\npublic sewer and water systems.\n4.4.2. Permitted Uses\nOnly uses specifically listed in the use table in Section 5.2 as a permitted (\"P\"), permitted subject to limited use standards (\"L\"), or permitted subject\nto special use permit (\"SUP\") shall be permitted in Residential districts.\n4.4.3.

Residential District Intent Statements\nA. RR: Rural Low Density Residential\nThe Rural Low Density Residential District is intended to accommodate nonresidential agricultural uses and low density residential development,\nas well as limited nonresidential uses that are supportive of the County's traditional agricultural orientation including farming, silviculture\noperations and related activities. Development in this District should rely predominantly on individual wells and septic tank systems for\ndomestic water supply and sewage disposal, respectively, although clustered residential development served by public water and wastewater\nsystems may be allowed.\nB. R-7500, R-6000, and SBR-6000\nThe R-7500, R-6000, and SBR-6000 districts are established to provide for orderly suburban residential development. A limited number of\ncommercial and civic uses are allowed, subject to the restrictions necessary to preserve and protect the residential character of the\nneighborhood. A special permit process for higher intensity development is also allowed, using discretion to balance issues of higher density\nwith improved amenities. Due to the higher intensity developments contained in this district, it is intended to be applied to properties served by\npublic sewer and water systems.\nC. MR-3200\nThis district is established as an area in which the principal use of the land is for high density residential purposes, not to exceed fourteen\ndwelling units per acre. The district also provides for the development of less intensive residential uses, as well as for compatible supporting\nnon-residential uses. Due to the higher intensity developments contained in this district, it is intended to be applied only to properties served by\npublic sewer and water systems.\n4.4.2. Permitted Uses\nOnly uses specifically listed in the use table in Section 5.2 as a permitted (\"P\"), permitted subject to limited use standards (\"L\"), or permitted subject\nto special use permit (\"SUP\") shall be permitted in Residential districts.\n4.4.3. Accessory Structures and Uses\n48 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n\nNEW PAGE 49\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nThe following accessory structures and uses shall be permitted in any residential district.

Accessory dwellings subject to the provisions of Section 5.4.2.\n3. Accessory structures subject to provisions of Section 5.4.1.\n4. Home occupations subject to the provisions of Section 5.4.4.\n5.\nRecycling drop-off collection stations subject to the requirements of Section 6.18.1.\n6. Fences and walls subject to the provisions of Section 6.10.\n4.4.4. Nonresidential Uses in Residential Districts\nA. Dimensional Standards\nUnless specifically modified in Section 5.3, Limited Use Standards, permitted nonresidential uses in a residential district shall meet the following\nstandards:\n1\nAdditional building height above the maximum up to 75 feet is allowed by right and above 75 feet with the Planning Board approval at\nthe rate of one additional foot of height for every one foot of additional yard depth (side, front, and rear) unless located in a Viewshed\nProtection Overlay where two additional feet of yard depth shall be required for each additional foot in height (see Section 4.8.7).\n2 Buildings or facilities exceeding 30 feet or three stories in height shall provide at least three means of fire apparatus access for each\nstructure.

Residential District Intent Statements\nA. RR: Rural Low Density Residential\nThe Rural Low Density Residential District is intended to accommodate nonresidential agricultural uses and low density residential development,\nas well as limited nonresidential uses that are supportive of the County's traditional agricultural orientation including farming, silviculture\noperations and related activities. Development in this District should rely predominantly on individual wells and septic tank systems for\ndomestic water supply and sewage disposal, respectively, although clustered residential development served by public water and wastewater\nsystems may be allowed.\nB. R-7500, R-6000, and SBR-6000\nThe R-7500, R-6000, and SBR-6000 districts are established to provide for orderly suburban residential development. A limited number of\ncommercial and civic uses are allowed, subject to the restrictions necessary to preserve and protect the residential character of the\nneighborhood. A special permit process for higher intensity development is also allowed, using discretion to balance issues of higher density\nwith improved amenities. Due to the higher intensity developments contained in this district, it is intended to be applied to properties served by\npublic sewer and water systems.\nC. MR-3200\nThis district is established as an area in which the principal use of the land is for high density residential purposes, not to exceed fourteen\ndwelling units per acre. The district also provides for the development of less intensive residential uses, as well as for compatible supporting\nnon-residential uses. Due to the higher intensity developments contained in this district, it is intended to be applied only to properties served by\npublic sewer and water systems.\n4.4.2. Permitted Uses\nOnly uses specifically listed in the use table in Section 5.2 as a permitted (\"P\"), permitted subject to limited use standards (\"L\"), or permitted subject\nto special use permit (\"SUP\") shall be permitted in Residential districts.\n4.4.3.

Districts\nA. C-LD: Commercial-Low Density\nThis District is intended primarily to be used in outlying areas, adjacent to major thoroughfares, with yards and other provisions for reducing\nconflicts with adjacent residential uses, and with substantial setbacks to reduce marginal friction on adjacent major thoroughfares. Commercial\nuses in this District will serve the needs of residential neighborhoods for auto-dependent commercial facilities; and serve the needs of highway\noriented tourist business.\nB. N-C: Neighborhood-Commercial\nThe N-C, Neighborhood-Commercial District is primarily intended to accommodate very low intensity office, retail and personal service uses\nwithin and adjoining residential areas. The district is established to provide convenient locations for businesses which serve the needs of\nsurrounding residents, including low intensity office, retail, and personal service uses, without disrupting the character of the neighborhood.\nCompatibility with nearby residences is reflected in design standards for both site layout and buildings. In addition, uses in the N-C District will\nhave minimal infrastructure demands.\nC. C-I: Commercial-Intensive\nThe C-I District is intended for uses which require close access to major highways. Anticipated uses include those which are necessary to service\nmore intensive commercial and industrial districts, such as warehousing, storage, moving, service and repair, distribution, wholesaling,\nmarketing of specialty goods and light manufacturing plants.\n4.5.2. Permitted Uses in Commercial Districts\nOnly uses specifically listed in the use table in Section 5.2 as a permitted (\"P\"), permitted subject to limited use standards (\"L\"), or permitted subject\nto special use permit (\"SUP\") shall be permitted in Commercial districts.\n4.5.3. Development Standards\nA. Applicability\nThe following standards shall apply to all development within a Commercial zoning district. In addition to the standards contained in this\nSection, all other provisions in this Ordinance and all other applicable laws shall apply, except those that are incompatible with the provisions\ncontained herein.\nB.
