This information helps the local\ngovernment respond in the event of a spill or release of the chemical.\n(i.) Emergency Notification and Agriculture\n(i.) EPCRA requires businesses that store threshold amounts of chemicals that\nare subject to OSHA's Hazardous Communication Standard to submit\ninformation -- including facility point of contact and the Material Safety\nData Sheets (or a list of those chemicals) -- to state and local authorities in\norder to facilitate emergency planning and response.

This\nreport, commonly known as Form R, covers releases and transfers of toxic\nchemicals to various facilities and environmental media, and allows EPA\nto compile the national Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) database.\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 10 - Page 51\n", "page_number": 270, "page_range": [270, 271, 272], "highlight": ["Building <em>Height</em> Requirements:\n(a.)", "The <em>maximum</em> <em>building</em> <em>height</em> for a structure adjacent to a residential or\ncommercial zoning district shall", "be no greater than 40 <em>feet</em>\n(b.)", "The <em>maximum</em> <em>building</em> <em>height</em> for a structure adjacent to an industrial zoning\ndistrict - no <em>height</em> restrictions", "<em>410</em>\" Commercial District."], "score": 14.230959, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"NC Highway 410 Commercial\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"C-410\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"C410\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"C-410\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 269\n(4.)
