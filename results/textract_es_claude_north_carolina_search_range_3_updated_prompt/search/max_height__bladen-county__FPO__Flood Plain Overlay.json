Construction and land disturbing activities should\nbe limited in nature and scope and should have a very low impact\non the environment and the surrounding setting.\nTypical Uses and Structures\nENTERING\nBLADEN LAKES\nSTATE FOREST\nState Forests\nJones Lake State Park\nSMP-LAKE\nMap A\nSuggs Mill Pond Gamelands\nSingletary Lake State Park\n172 of 446\n3/9/24, 13:42\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nDIMENSIONAL STANDARDS\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (2, 1): \nRequirements\nCELL (2, 2): \nPublic Water\nAnd Sewer\nCELL (2, 3): \nPublic Water,\nNo Public Sewer\nCELL (2, 4): \nNo Public Water\nNo Public Sewer\nCELL (3, 1): \nMinimum Lot Area in Square Feet\nCELL (3, 2): \n80,000 Sq.

In order to reduce the impact of development on the existing natural\nenvironment, and provide an increased degree of flexibility, the following guidelines apply to\nall activities within a CON district: 1) If development is anticipated to occur, the plan for such\ndevelopment should prioritize the preservation of natural habitat and sensitive environmental\nfeatures such as large stands of trees, wetlands, watercourses, marshes, and tidal areas. 2)\nThe use of Low Impact Design, stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) and other\nalternative construction principles is strongly encouraged. 3) All site clearing and preparation,\nand construction activities should avoid removing existing trees and disturbing existing\nvegetation to the extent possible.\n(c) Minimum lot areas may change for uses in the CON District which are permitted with\nconditions.
