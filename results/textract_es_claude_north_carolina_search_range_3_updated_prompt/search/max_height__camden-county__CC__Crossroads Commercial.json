The district's small scale and limited range of use\ntypes provides convenient access to basic goods and services to\nnearby residents in ways that protect the County's scenic\ncharacter and rural character. The district allows restaurants,\noffices, personal services, indoor recreation, retail, and visitor\nCrossroads\naccommodation uses, as well as agricultural support uses, and\ninstitutional uses. As a means of providing additional housing\noptions, the district allows live/work dwellings and upper story\nresidential. Industrial development, single-family homes, and\nhigher density residential uses are not permitted. The district is\nCommercial\nlimited in size (up to four acres) and must be within 500 linear\nfeet of a significant street intersection. New commercial\ndevelopment is built close to the street and subject to\ncommercial design standards to raise the bar for development\nquality. District regulations discourage uses that are too intense\nor that draw the majority of their patrons from outside the\nimmediate area.\nCamden County\nUnified Development Ordinance\n3-36\nLast Updated:\nAugust 1, 2022\nCELL (1, 1): \nB.\nCELL (1, 2): \nDimensional Requirements\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nREQUIREMENT\nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (3, 1): \n#\nCELL (3, 2): \nSTANDARD TYPE\nCELL (3, 3): \nNONRESIDENTIAL\nDEVELOPMENT\nCELL (3, 4): \nRESIDENTIAL AND MIXED-\nUse DEVELOPMENT\nCELL (4, 1): \nA\nCELL (4, 2): \nMaximum District Size (acres)\nCELL (4, 3): \n4\nCELL (4, 4): \nCELL (5, 1): \nB\nCELL (5, 2): \nMaximum Residential Density (units/acre)\nCELL (5, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (5, 4): \n1.4 [1]\nCELL (6, 1): \nC\nCELL (6, 2): \nMinimum Lot Area (square feet)\nCELL (6, 3): \n40,000\nCELL (6, 4): \n30,000 [2]\nCELL (7, 1): \nD\nCELL (7, 2): \nMinimum Lot Width (feet)\nCELL (7, 3): \n125\nCELL (7, 4): \n100\nCELL (8, 1): \nE\nCELL (8, 2): \nMaximum Lot Coverage (% of lot area)\nCELL (8, 3): \n24 [3]\nCELL (8, 4): \n24 [3]\nCELL (9, 1): \nF\nCELL (9, 2): \nMinimum Open Space (% of development area)\nCELL (9, 3): \n15\nCELL (9, 4): \nCELL (10, 1): \nG\nCELL (10, 2): \nMinimum Front Setback (feet)\nCELL (10, 3): \n20\nCELL (10, 4): \n25\nCELL (11, 1): \nH\nCELL (11, 2): \nMinimum Corner Side Setback (feet)\nCELL (11, 3): \n20\nCELL (11, 4): \n25\nCELL (12, 1): \nI\nCELL (12, 2): \nMinimum Interior Side Setback (feet)\nCELL (12, 3): \n10\nCELL (12, 4): \n10\nCELL (13, 1): \nCELL (13, 2): \nMinimum Rear Setback (feet)\nCELL (13, 3): \n10\nCELL (13, 4): \n10\nCELL (14, 1): \nK\nCELL (14, 2): \nMin.

COMMERCIAL (CC) DISTRICT\nA.\nPurpose Statement\nThe Crossroads Commercial (CC) district is intended for low\nintensity, neighborhood-serving commercial development around\nsignificant roadway intersections in rural and suburban portions\nCC\nof the County. The district's small scale and limited range of use\ntypes provides convenient access to basic goods and services to\nnearby residents in ways that protect the County's scenic\ncharacter and rural character. The district allows restaurants,\noffices, personal services, indoor recreation, retail, and visitor\nCrossroads\naccommodation uses, as well as agricultural support uses, and\ninstitutional uses. As a means of providing additional housing\noptions, the district allows live/work dwellings and upper story\nresidential. Industrial development, single-family homes, and\nhigher density residential uses are not permitted. The district is\nCommercial\nlimited in size (up to four acres) and must be within 500 linear\nfeet of a significant street intersection. New commercial\ndevelopment is built close to the street and subject to\ncommercial design standards to raise the bar for development\nquality. District regulations discourage uses that are too intense\nor that draw the majority of their patrons from outside the\nimmediate area.\nCamden County\nUnified Development Ordinance\n3-36\nLast Updated:\nAugust 1, 2022\nCELL (1, 1): \nB.\nCELL (1, 2): \nDimensional Requirements\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nREQUIREMENT\nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (3, 1): \n#\nCELL (3, 2): \nSTANDARD TYPE\nCELL (3, 3): \nNONRESIDENTIAL\nDEVELOPMENT\nCELL (3, 4): \nRESIDENTIAL AND MIXED-\nUse DEVELOPMENT\nCELL (4, 1): \nA\nCELL (4, 2): \nMaximum District Size (acres)\nCELL (4, 3): \n4\nCELL (4, 4): \nCELL (5, 1): \nB\nCELL (5, 2): \nMaximum Residential Density (units/acre)\nCELL (5, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (5, 4): \n1.4 [1]\nCELL (6, 1): \nC\nCELL (6, 2): \nMinimum Lot Area (square feet)\nCELL (6, 3): \n40,000\nCELL (6, 4): \n30,000 [2]\nCELL (7, 1): \nD\nCELL (7, 2): \nMinimum Lot Width (feet)\nCELL (7, 3): \n125\nCELL (7, 4): \n100\nCELL (8, 1): \nE\nCELL (8, 2): \nMaximum Lot Coverage (% of lot area)\nCELL (8, 3): \n24 [3]\nCELL (8, 4): \n24 [3]\nCELL (9, 1): \nF\nCELL (9, 2): \nMinimum Open Space (% of development area)\nCELL (9, 3): \n15\nCELL (9, 4): \nCELL (10, 1): \nG\nCELL (10, 2): \nMinimum Front Setback (feet)\nCELL (10, 3): \n20\nCELL (10, 4): \n25\nCELL (11, 1): \nH\nCELL (11, 2): \nMinimum Corner Side Setback (feet)\nCELL (11, 3): \n20\nCELL (11, 4): \n25\nCELL (12, 1): \nI\nCELL (12, 2): \nMinimum Interior Side Setback (feet)\nCELL (12, 3): \n10\nCELL (12, 4): \n10\nCELL (13, 1): \nCELL (13, 2): \nMinimum Rear Setback (feet)\nCELL (13, 3): \n10\nCELL (13, 4): \n10\nCELL (14, 1): \nK\nCELL (14, 2): \nMin.
