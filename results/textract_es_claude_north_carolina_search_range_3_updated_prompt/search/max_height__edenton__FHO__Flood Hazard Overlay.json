The Flood Hazard Overlay District (FHO), as established\nin Section 9.4(b), is designed for the purpose of protecting people and property from the\nhazards of flooding in accordance with the authority provided in NCGS 153A-121.\nThe Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143;\nArticle 6 of Chapter 153A; Article 8 of Chapter 160A; and Article 7, 9, and 11 of Chapter 160D\n(Effective July 1, 2021) of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local governmental\nunits the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and\ngeneral welfare. (Amended 9/14/2021)\nTherefore, the Town Council of Edenton, North Carolina, does ordain as follows:\n(b)\nFindings of Fact.\n(1)\nThe flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of Edenton are subject to\nperiodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety\nhazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,\nextraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and\nimpairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,\nsafety, and general welfare.\n(2)\nThese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in\nfloodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the\noccupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other\nhazards.\n(c)\nStatement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section to promote the public\nhealth, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood\nconditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 9/14/2021\n16-1\nCELL (1, 1): \n(1)\nCELL (1, 2): \nRestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and\nproperty due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging\nincreases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;\nCELL (2, 1): \n(2)\nCELL (2, 2): \nRequire that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve\nsuch uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial\nconstruction;\nCELL (3, 1): \n(3)\nCELL (3, 2): \nControl the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural\nprotective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of\nfloodwaters;\n\nNEW PAGE 200\n(4)\nControl filling, grading, dredging and other all development which may\nincrease erosion or flood damage; and (Amended 9/14/2021)\n(5)\nPrevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will\nunnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to\nother lands.\n(d)\nObjectives. The objectives of this Section are to:\n(1)\nProtect human life, safety, and health; (Amended 9/14/2021)\n(2)\nMinimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\n(3)\nMinimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding\nand generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;\n(4)\nMinimize prolonged business losses and interruptions; (Amended\n9/14/2021)\n(5)\nMinimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas\nmains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets and bridges\nlocated in flood prone areas; (Amended 9/14/2021)\n(6)\nMinimize damage to private and public property due to flooding;\n(7)\nMake flood insurance available to the community through the National\nFlood Insurance Program;\n(8)\nMaintain the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains;\n(9)\nHelp maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and\ndevelopment of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood\nblight areas; and\n(10)\nEnsure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a\nSpecial Flood Hazard Area.\nSection 16.2 Definitions.\nUnless specifically defined below, word or phrases used in this Section shall be\ninterpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this\nOrdinance its most reasonable application.\nAccessory Structure (Appurtenant Structure).

The bulletins do not create regulations; rather they provide specific\nguidance for complying with the minimum requirements of existing NFIP regulations.\nIt should be noted that Technical Bulletins and Technical Fact Sheets provide guidance\non the minimum requirements of the NFIP regulations. State or community requirements that\nexceed those of the NFIP take precedence. Design professionals should contact the community\nofficials to determine whether more restrictive State or local regulations apply to the building or\nsite in question. All applicable standards of the State or local building code must also be met for\nany building in a flood hazard area.\nTemperature Controlled.
