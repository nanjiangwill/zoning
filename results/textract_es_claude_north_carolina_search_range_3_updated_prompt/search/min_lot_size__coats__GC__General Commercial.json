Intent. The Mixed-Use Districts (MU-1 and MU-2) are established to provide\nopportunities for both compatible and sustainable re-development where\nunderutilized commercial properties already exist as well as infill sites where site\nspecific land planning of new development creates opportunities for businesses\nand various housing designs sharing community amenities and enhancements.\nExisting auto-oriented street, lot, and building designs can create uncomfortable\npedestrian environments; however, with careful site planning these areas will allow\na greater number of residents to walk or bike to businesses and services with an\ninterconnected network of streets and sidewalks. Allowed building/lot types are\nHighway Commercial, Urban Workplace, Shop-front, Detached House, Attached\nHouse, and Multi-family. Dominant uses in this district are residential, retail and\noffice. The Mixed-Use Districts are expected to serve Coats residents as well as\npersons who travel from surrounding communities. The development pattern in\nthis district acknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access\nprovided to promote safety for the motoring public. Development standards in the\nMixed-Use Districts promote the creation of a pleasant pedestrian-friendly auto-\noriented environment while enabling a compatible transition to uses in adjacent\ndistricts.\n(B.) A Development Agreement, established pursuant to Section 7.15 of this\nOrdinance, shall be required as part of all Mixed Use (MU-1 and MU-2) District\napplications and shall apply to all projects within the MU-1 and MU-2 Districts.\n(C.)

Intent: The Vehicle Service and Repair District (VSR) is established to provide\nlocations for specific uses that, due to their unique characteristics and importance\nto the community, and the traveling public, require different criteria and\nspecifications than typical commercial development. Development standards in\nthe Vehicle Service and Repair District acknowledge that the automobile is the\nprimary mode of transportation in suburban communities and there is a vital need\nfor such businesses to be located in close proximity to one another. Uses within\nthe Vehicle Service and Repair District are buffered from adjacent uses. The\ndominant uses in this district are vehicle oriented and/or dependent and include\nvehicle-based services, vehicle repair shops and disabled vehicle storage areas.\nThe Vehicle Service and Repair District is reserved for uses which require broad\nmaneuvering spaces and avoid pedestrian interaction with potentially hazardous\nconditions. Goals of the Vehicle Service and Repair District include providing a\npleasant environment for motorists, a safe environment for pedestrians along the\nnetwork of streets and pedestrian facilities; promoting the safety of motorists and\npedestrians; and preserving the capacity of Main Street and it's interconnecting\nnetwork of streets outside the core area as shown in the adopted Town Plan. Uses\nin this district include heavy commercial goods and services for motor vehicles,\nand some limited industrial. Allowed building/lot type is Highway Commercial.\n(B.) Listed Uses:\n(1.) Uses listed by right: See Table of Uses (Table 8.1) of this Article\n(2.) Uses listed with additional standards: See Table of Uses (Table 8.1) of this\nArticle and Article 10, Section 10.1\n(3.)
