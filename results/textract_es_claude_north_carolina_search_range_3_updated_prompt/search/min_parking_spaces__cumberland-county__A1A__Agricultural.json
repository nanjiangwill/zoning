GENERAL.\nThe Conditional Zoning districts set forth herein are authorized by N.C. GEN. STAT. $160D-\n703 and are intended to modify the uses to which the parallel zoning district is\nrestricted. Generally, an applicant, by seeking to rezone property to a Conditional\nZoning district, will propose to restrict or eliminate Permitted, Conditional or Special\nUses. Request for Conditional Zoning district rezoning shall be processed\nadministratively in the same manner as for amendments to this ordinance as\nestablished in Article XV.\nConditional Zoning districts are floating districts that parallel general zoning districts.\nConditional Zoning districts are identical to their corresponding general zoning districts\nin all respects except that a permit is required as a prerequisite to any use (Permitted,\nConditional or Special) or development within them.\nParallel Conditional Zoning districts are provided as a voluntary alternative method of\npetitioning the Board of Commissioners for a zoning map or classification change. The\nowner may submit conditions that restrict the uses that would otherwise be allowed in\nthe zoning district and only those uses specifically requested in the application shall be\nconsidered.\n(Amd. 02-19-08; Amd. 04-18-11; Amd. 02-01-21)\nSECTION 502. RESTRICTIONS ON FILING OF APPLICATIONS.\nA request for a Conditional Zoning district rezoning shall be initiated only by an\napplication [petition] signed by all current record owners of the property.\n(Amd. 11-20-06; Amd. 04-18-11)\nSECTION 503. CONTENT OF APPLICATIONS AND CONDITIONS.\nThe Conditional Zoning district application shall provide the minimum information\nrequirements set forth below; however, additional information may be required by the\nPlanning and Inspections Staff, Planning Board or the Board of Commissioners when\nrequested if any of the aforementioned deem it necessary in order to be able to make a\nrecommendation on, or decision regarding, the application. Such requests may include a\n52\nJune 20, 2005 County Zoning Ordinance\nw/ Amendments through January 16, 2024\n\nNEW PAGE 65\nrequirement for a more detailed site plan, or one modified in accordance with\nadditional or modified conditions and other performance criteria.\n(Amd. 02-19-08; Amd. 04-18-11)\nA. Proposed Uses: Proposed uses shall be set forth in detail, including the\ncompatibility with the uses in the neighboring districts. Any limitations or conditions to\nbe placed on the proposed uses to enhance compatibility with and benefit to\nsurrounding areas shall also be set forth.\nB. Dimensional Requirements: The application shall show that the uses comply with\ndimensional requirements for the district requested. If the applicant proposes to vary\nthe dimensional requirements for the district requested, it shall be demonstrated that\nthe public purposes to be accomplished by any such dimensional requirement are met\nto an equal or greater degree.\nC. Sign Requirements: The application shall indicate the location of signs in\naccordance with Article XIII, Sign Regulations. The range of allowable sign types\npermissible in a conditional zoning district shall be the same as those permitted in the\ncorresponding conventional (general) zoning district. If the applicant proposes to vary\nthe sign provisions for the district requested, it shall be demonstrated that the public\npurposes to be accomplished by any such provisions are met to an equal or greater\ndegree. Some conditional zoning districts (e.g., the mixed use conditional or planned\nneighborhood development zoning districts) do not allow deviations from sign\nstandards.\n(Amd. 02-19-08)\nD. Off-Street Parking Requirements: The application shall indicate the location of all\noff-street parking and internal drive areas in accordance with Article XII, Off-Street\nParking provisions. If the applicant proposes to vary the off-street parking provisions of\nthis ordinance for the use requested, it shall be demonstrated that the public purposes\nto be accomplished by any such provisions are met to an equal or greater degree.\n(Amd. 02-19-08)\nE.
