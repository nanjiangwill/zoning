The\nfollowing tables illustrate the required elements for each buffer yard type.\n1. Type A Buffer: The intent of the Type A Buffer is to create a completely opaque buffer,\nhaving no horizontal openings from the ground to a height of 8 feet within 2 years of\nplanting.

Type B Buffer: The intent of the Type B Buffer is to create a semi-opaque buffer,\nhaving only seasonal horizontal openings, not to exceed 10% of the total width, from\nthe ground to a height of 8 feet within 2 years of planting. A Type B Buffer can be\nachieved in 2 ways as specified below.\n3. Type C Buffer: The intent of the Type C Buffer is to create a semi-opaque buffer,\nhaving only seasonal horizontal openings, not to exceed 25% of the total width, from\nthe ground to a height of 6 feet within 2 years of planting. A Type C Buffer can be\nachieved in 2 ways as specified below.\nF. Additions to Buffers and Screening\nWhen it is determined that the conflict of land use is so great that the public safety is not\nserved adequately by the minimum buffer and screening requirements, or where there is a\nneed to prevent a high degree of visual, audio, or physical disorders, then the Administrator\nmay require the installation of fencing or earthen berms in addition to the minimum required\nbuffers and screening, according to the standards below.\n1. Fencing or Walls. Where required as part of a buffer yard, fencing or walls must\nadhere to the provisions below. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the owner of a\nsingle family dwelling from constructing a separate fence along the borders of such\nproperty, provided that all required buffer plantings are maintained.\na. In all cases, the finished side of the fence must face the use with the lower intensity.\nb.\nPermitted fence or wall materials include: masonry, stone, architectural block,\nstucco on masonry, wood or other similar of solid appearance.\nC. The design of fencing or walls shall be sufficient to meet the extent of physical\nscreening required by the Administrator.\nd. The height of the fence shall be determined by the Administrator based on the\nfollowing variables: site conditions; topography; use; and/or building height. The\nminimum height of a fence or wall required by this section shall be 6 feet.\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-33\nADOPTION DATE: JANUARY 13, 2020\nCELL (1, 1): \nType B Buffer Yard Options\nCELL (1, 2): \nMin.

Earthen berms may be required in combination with plant material and fencing\nfor the purposes of screening. Berms shall be tapered appropriately to allow for\npractical maintenance.\na. The slope of all berms shall not exceed a 2:1 ratio (horizontal to vertical), shall have\na top width at least one-half the berm height, and a maximum height of 6 feet above\nthe toe of the berm.\nb. All berms regardless of size, shall be stabilized with a grass or other approved\nvegetative ground cover.. Topsoils brought in for mounds are to be mixed with\nnative soil to avoid interfacing problems.\nC. Berms shall be constructed as to provide adequate sight distances at intersections\nand along all roads.\nd. Berms proposed to satisfy the screening requirements of this section shall be\nvegetated as required by this section. All plantings shall be located either on top of\nthe berm or between the berm and the public right-of-way.\nd. Use of berms as a substitute for existing healthy vegetation is strongly discouraged.\nG. Vehicular Use Area Screening & Landscaping\n1. All off-street parking, loading areas, and service areas adjacent to and/or visible from a\npublic right-of-way and adjacent properties shall be screened from view by use of one\nor more of the following:\nA building or buildings;\nA change in topography;\nA planting area a minimum of 8 feet wide planted with evergreen shrubbery placed\na maximum of 5 feet on center. All shrubs shall achieve a height of 4 feet within 3\nyears.\nFencing, walls, or berms.\n2. In addition to screening requirements, canopy trees shall be installed in planting areas\nwithin parking lots to provide shade coverage for all parking spaces within vehicle\nservice areas. Such planting areas shall meet the following requirements:\na. Planting Area Size: The minimum size of a planting area is dependent upon the\nnumber of canopy trees planted within it, as described below\nb. Planting Area Width: A minimum horizontal dimension of 9 feet measured from back\nof curb, pavement, sidewalk or other separating structure is required for all planting\nareas.\nC.\nPlanting Strip Location: A continuous linear planting strip shall be provided between\neach 2 parking bays.\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-34\nADOPTION DATE: APRIL 12, 2021\nCELL (1, 1): \nNumber of Canopy Trees in Planting Area\nCELL (1, 2): \nMinimum Size of Planting Area\nCELL (2, 1): \n1\nCELL (2, 2): \n400 square feet\nCELL (3, 1): \n2\nCELL (3, 2): \n700 square feet\nCELL (4, 1): \n3 or more\nCELL (4, 2): \n300 square feet per tree\n", "page_number": 87, "page_range": [87, 88, 89], "highlight": ["R-6SF\nCELL (2, 3): \nRMX, MF\nCELL (2, 4): \nMH, NMX\nCELL (2, 5): \nB-1\nCELL (2, 6): \nB-2\nCELL (2, 7): \n<em>LI</em>", "CELL (7, 3): \nA\nCELL (7, 4): \nB\nCELL (7, 5): \nC\nCELL (7, 6): \nNone\nCELL (7, 7): \nNone\nCELL (8, 1): \n<em>LI</em>", "The slope of all berms shall not exceed a 2:1 <em>ratio</em> (horizontal to vertical), shall have\na top width", "requirements, canopy trees shall be installed in planting areas\nwithin parking lots to provide shade <em>coverage</em>"], "score": 14.402039, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Light Industrial District\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"LI\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"LI\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"LI\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building area as % of lot\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"pervious surface\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"percent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"%\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per cent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ratio\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [87, 88, 89]}
