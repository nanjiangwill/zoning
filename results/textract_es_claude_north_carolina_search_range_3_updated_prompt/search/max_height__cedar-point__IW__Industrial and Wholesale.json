This section does not apply to public street lighting.\nC. LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS\nAll exterior light fixtures must be Dark Skies compliant (unless exempted by this\nordinance). Lighting plans are required for all developments except for single-family\nresidences. Lighting plans shall include a layout of proposed fixture locations\n(including wall mounted lights, ground mounted lights, and illuminated signs), foot\ncandle data that demonstrate conforming intensities and uniformities; and\na\ndescription of the equipment (catalog cuts), glare control devices, lamps, mounting\nheights and means, hours of operation, and maintenance methods proposed.\nIllumination intensities (lighting contours) may be shown on an independent plan or\nintegrated with other required plans.\nD. MINIMUM LIGHT LEVELS\n1. Parking areas, whether surface or in a structure, shall have a minimum light\nintensity of 1.0 foot-candles.\n2. Interior sidewalks, those sidewalks that connect buildings to parking areas,\ncommon areas, of facilities within a development that are likely to be used at night,\nshall have a minimum light intensity of 0.5 foot-candles.\n3. Minimum lighting levels in this subsection do not apply to nonresidential uses\nduring non- business hours.\nE. MAXIMUM LIGHT LEVELS\n1. All outdoor lighting shall be designed and located such that the maximum\nillumination measured in foot candles at the light source's property line shall not\nexceed two tenths (0.2) foot candle measured at ground level.\n2. Light intensities shall not exceed three (3) foot-candles (sports and athletic fields\nthirty (30) foot-candles) at any location on the site to limit glare and blinding\ncaused by significant light variations across a site. The Town Manager may\nconsider an applicant's unique situations and use requirements during the\ndevelopment review and may allow greater intensities within the site.\nF. INSTALLATION\n1. Lighting fixtures height shall not exceed the lesser of thirty (30) feet, or the\nmaximum height of the main portion of the primary building on the site (excluding\nspires, towers, parapet walls and the like). For sites where no building is proposed,\nmounting height for fixtures shall not exceed twenty-five (25) feet. Sports and\nathletic field and outdoor performance area lighting shall not exceed eighty (80)\nfeet in height, provided the other applicable requirements of this section are met.\n2. Electrical feeds to lighting standards shall be run underground, not overhead.\n3. Lighting poles/fixtures in parking areas shall be protected from vehicle impact\nwith protective barriers or by location. Poles/fixtures should not be placed SO as\nto obstruct pedestrian movement along sidewalks or medians.\n4. Directional lighting fixtures used for sign lighting shall be top-mounted SO\nlighting is aimed down. Ground mounted signs with a height of five (5) feet or\nless may be ground lit, provided that the lights are shielded SO as to illuminate the\nsign only, and the light shall not exceed 10 foot-candles at the sign surface.\n5. Fixtures shall be of the sharp cut-off type and Dark Skies compliant. No portion\nPage I 169\n\nNEW PAGE 170\nof the fixture bulb may extend below the fixture housing.\n6. Unshielded wall fixtures shall not be used.\n7. Landscape plantings shall be located and maintained SO that they do not block\nlight from reaching the intended surfaces.\n8. The placement of light fixtures should indicate the desired traffic flow and aid\npedestrian safety, especially in areas with potential conflict between pedestrians\nand vehicles.\nFigure 7-5: EXTERIOR LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS\nG. CONTROL OF NUISANCE AND DISABLING GLARE\n1. All outdoor lighting, shall be designed, installed, and maintained in a manner that\ndoes not present a disabling glare hazard to drivers or pedestrians; and all\nreasonable means shall be taken to prevent projection of nuisance glare onto\nneighboring properties or into the night sky.\n2. Lighting for sports and athletic fields must include glare control features and must\nbe designed SO that primary illumination is directed onto the play area and ancillary\nareas such as bleachers, stands, and similar areas. All lighting fixtures for sports\nfields must be equipped with a glare control package including louvers, shields, or\nsimilar devices. The fixtures must be aimed SO that their beams are directed and\nfall within the primary playing area.\n3.\nNon-security lighting shall be extinguished when the operation is closed or not in\nuse. In reviewing lighting plans, the Town Manager may consider the impact of\nlighting on neighboring properties based on stated hours of operation,\ntopographical differences across sites, and other considerations.\n4. Glare control shall be accomplished primarily through the proper selection and\napplication of lighting equipment and shielding. Only after those means have been\nexhausted shall vegetation, fences, or similar buffer methods be considered for\nreducing glare.\n5.
