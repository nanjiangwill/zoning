The factors that the Planning\nDirector or designee might consider in approving or denying a request for shared parking include, but are not limited to, number of spaces, cross-access easements,\naccess/egress points, driving aisles, islands, striping, signage, and landscaping.\n(Amend. of 10-15-07(3))\n3004.
