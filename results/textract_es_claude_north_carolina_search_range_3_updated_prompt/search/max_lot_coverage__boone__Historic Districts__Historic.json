Design Standards for New Construction and Additions\n1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide standards for the design of new\nbuilding construction in the B1 districts in order to retain the historic context of the\narea while providing new opportunities for design. New building design must be\nsympathetic to existing buildings in the B1 Downtown Core, and respect the\ntraditional qualities that make downtown unique, such as use of storefront\ndetailing and choice of materials. Applicants shall use the design elements that pay\ntribute to what was historically present in Boone's architecture. Compatible\ncontemporary designs rather than historic duplications or replications are\nacceptable when new construction is considered.\n2. Architectural Features.\na. Inclusion of the following architectural features supports the determination\nthat a design is sympathetic or compatible with the area:\nGraphic 14.19.06-11 Architectural Features\nBrick banding/cornice\nWindow caps\nVertical window\npatterns\nSills\nSign band\nTransom windows\nRecessed entrance\nPilasters\nKickplates\ni.\nFirst floor display windows.\nii.\nRecessed entrance doors where the door will not extend past the front\nof the building.\niii.\nTransoms or clerestory windows above doors and windows.\niv.\nCornices\nV.\nDecorative Masonry Elements:\nA.
