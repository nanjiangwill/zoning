STREETSCAPE BUFFERS\n1. Purpose and Intent\nStreetscape buffers are proposed to soften the view of development from the City's street rights-of-\nway, and are intended to:\na. Enhance pedestrian orientation and encourage pedestrian travel;\nb. Address urban heat islands by providing shade for streets and sidewalks;\nC. Provide shade on sidewalks;\nd. Promote the City's \"sense of place\";\ne. Support property values by enhancing the aesthetic character of the City's streets; and\nf. Provide habitat for flora and fauna.\n2. Applicability\n(AMENDED 1.4.22 UDOTA-1-22)\na. The standards in this section shall apply to all lot lines bounded by the following features, whether\nexisting or identified in the City's adopted policy guidance.\ni. Local streets;\nii. Collector streets; and\niii. Arterial streets.\nb. In cases where a future street is planned but its approximate location is not indicated on an\nadopted or approved City map or plan, streetscape buffering shall not be required on lots abutting\nthe future street alignment.\nC.\nIn cases where the rear yard of a lot abuts a City street right-of-way, the rear yard shall include\na streetscape buffer configured in accordance with these standards.\n3. Exemption\na. Streetscape buffers are not required along lot lines abutting the following features:\ni.\nDriveways, private drives, or alleys;\nii.\nLot lines abutting platted street rights-of-way that are or have remained unopened for at least\n15 years; or\niii. Lot frontages where the entirety of the lot frontage is within a required sight distance triangle.\nb. Development subject to the standards in Section 5.3.L, Street Trees, is not required to provide\nstreetscape buffers.\n4. Required Plant Material\na. Generally\nStreetscape buffers shall be configured in one of the following three ways (see Figure 5.3.K:\nStreetscape Buffer Configuration):\ni.\nThree canopy trees for every 100 linear feet of lot frontage; or\nii. Two canopy trees and two understory trees for every 100 linear feet of lot frontage; or\niii. Four understory trees for every 100 linear feet, where overhead utilities are present.\nb. Rear Yard Streetscape Buffers\n(AMENDED 1.4.22 UDOTA-1-22)\nIn cases when a lot's rear yard abuts a City street right-of-way, the rear yard shall be configured\nwith a streetscape buffer meeting the requirements for a type C perimeter buffer (see Section\n5.3.J, Perimeter Buffers). In cases where a streetscape buffer is configured in accordance with a\ntype C perimeter buffer, trees shall maintain a uniform on-center spacing across the width of the\nbuffer and the distance from the right of way shall be in accordance with the perimeter buffering\nstandards instead of the placement standards in this section.\nCity of Burlington\n5-45\nUnified Development Ordinance\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\nNEW PAGE 338\nCHAPTER 5 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nSection 5.3 Landscaping\nFIGURE 5.3.K: STREETSCAPE BUFFER CONFIGURATION\n(AMENDED 3.17.20 UDOTA-02-20) (AMENDED 12.3.19 UDOTA-01-20)\n5. Placement\na. Vegetation required as part of a streetscape buffer shall be located outside the street right-of-\nway.\nb. Canopy trees shall be located within ten feet of the right-of-way edge.\nC. Understory trees shall be located within five feet of the right-of-way edge.\nd. An alternative location may be approved by the Planning Director in cases where underground\nutilities, drainage easements, topography, or other obstructions make placement of streetscape\nbuffer vegetation in accordance with these standards impractical.\n6. Prohibited Features\nOff-street parking, off-street loading, merchandise display, outdoor storage, or use of gravel,\ndecorative gravel, or cinders as a ground cover shall not take place within a required streetscape\nbuffer.\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\nL.
