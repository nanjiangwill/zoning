The R-8 residential district is established as a district in\nwhich the principal use of land is for single-family, two-family, and multi-family\nresidences. The regulations of this district are intended to provide areas of the\ncommunity for those persons desiring residence and multi-family structures in\nmedium density neighborhoods. The regulations are intended to discourage any\nuse which because of its character would interfere with the residential nature of\nthis district.\nCELL (3, 1): \n(C)\nCELL (3, 2): \nR-6: Residential District.
