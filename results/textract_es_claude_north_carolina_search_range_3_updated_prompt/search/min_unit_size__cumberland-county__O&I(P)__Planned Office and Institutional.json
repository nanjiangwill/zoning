INONCONFORMING USES.\nA. General Provisions. No structure or land containing a nonconforming use shall\nhereafter be increased, nor shall its total value be enhanced, except as provided in this\nsection.\nB. Discontinuance/Buffering of Open-Air Outside Uses. All nonconforming uses not\ncarried on within a structure, except those which are incidental and necessary to\nactivities within a structure, shall be discontinued within three calendar years from the\neffective date of this ordinance unless they can be adequately buffered so that the\nnonconforming use is not visible to the surrounding properties and these such uses shall\nbe buffered in accordance with Section 1102.G within two calendar years from the\neffective date of this ordinance. Uses to be discontinued or buffered under this Section\nshall include outdoor sales areas, motor vehicle parking lots not immediately adjacent\nto and used in conjunction with a structure that the parking lot serves, storage yards,\nsigns, billboards and similar uses. Where nonconforming use status applies to\nstructure(s) and premises in combination, if the structure(s) are removed or destroyed,\nthe nonconforming use of the land shall cease and any subsequent use of the land and\nbuildings placed thereon shall conform to the provisions of this ordinance.\nC. Continuance of Nonconforming Uses. No nonconforming use may be changed,\nexpanded or resumed to any other nonconforming use, unless the Board of Adjustment\nfinds that such use is no more detrimental to the neighborhood than the initial\nnonconforming use of the property in question. No change of title or possession or right\nto possession of property with a nonconforming use shall be construed to prevent the\ncontinuance of such nonconforming use.\nD. Continuance of Nonconforming Structures. A structure that is nonconforming due\nto noncompliance with dimensional requirements, and which is a permitted use in the\ndistrict, may continue, provided that its nonconformity is not increased. Structural\nchanges which decrease or do not affect the degree of nonconformity, regardless of\ncost and/or increase in value, shall be permitted. Routine repairs, maintenance,\nrehabilitation and renovations, regardless of value, shall be permitted.\nE. Reconstruction Prohibited. Any nonconforming structure or any structure\ncontaining a nonconforming use, which has been damaged by fire or other causes, may\nbe reconstructed and its use resumed if that occurs within one year of such damage,\nunless such structures have been determined by the Coordinator to have been damaged\nto an extent exceeding 50 percent of its then reproducible value or its bulk, exclusive of\nfoundations, in which case any repair, reconstruction or use shall conform with the\nprovisions of this Ordinance.\n120\nJune 20, 2005 County Zoning Ordinance\nw/ Amendments through January 16,
