Additional driveways may be permitted when\nreviewed by the Administrator and deemed that they are necessary to improve traffic movement, increase sight distances or for\nother safety reasons.\n(2) Developments shall share driveways with adjoining developments where possible. In addition, adjoining uses shall provide\nsafe and efficient access to neighboring parking areas so vehicular traffic and pedestrians can move directly to the adjoining use\nwithout first returning to the public right-of-way or street. Driveways as a means of the only ingress and egress shall be allowed in\nthe setback areas as determined in \u00a7 152.028 of this chapter.\n(I) Visibility at intersections. On a corner lot in any zoning district, no planting, structures, sign, fence, wall or obstruction to\nvision more than two and one-half feet in height measured from the centerline of the street shall be placed or maintained within the\ntriangular area formed by the intersecting street right-of-way lines and a straight line connecting points on said street right-of-way.\nThe sight triangle, as required by the state's Department of Transportation, is illustrated below; however, this sight triangle may be\nvaried by the Administrator on town and private streets as deemed necessary:\n(J) Parking of tractor trailers or semi-trailers for storage.

These standards shall apply to all new construction, expansions and/or additions of 50% of\nthe gross floor area of existing buildings or changes to exterior building facades for multifamily and non-residential development.\nSingle-family detached residential uses and individual duplexes are exempt from \u00a7\u00a7 152.085 through 152.090 of this chapter\n(unless \u00a7 152.089 of this chapter applies), as are changes considered maintenance and repairs to existing non-residential\nbuildings; maintenance and repair is defined as those changes that are considered upkeep and do not change the architectural\nappearance of the building. The architectural review standards shall hereby be incorporated as a reference to \u00a7\u00a7 152.085 through\n152.090 of this chapter, specifically with regard to illustrations.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 7-13-2015; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 500)\n\u00a7 152.086 SITE ASPECTS.\n(A) Relationship of a building to its site.\n(1) Building design shall be fitted to the natural contours of the site. Natural features of the site, such as rock outcroppings or\nnatural drainage ways shall be preserved.\n(2) On wooded sites, buildings shall be carefully situated to take advantage of the shade and energy conservation provided by\nthe trees.\n(3) The impression of buildings tucked into, rather than superimposed on, the natural landscape shall be created.\n(4) The view of the building from the street and surrounding areas shall be as important as the view available to the buildings\noccupants.\n(5) Buildings shall be located according to the natural characteristics of the site. In hilly terrain, clustering of buildings is\nencouraged as a strategy to avoid destroying sensitive natural areas.\n(6) Buildings shall be designed to harmonize with the existing topography, thereby minimizing land disruption.\n(7) Grading shall be held to a minimum and should complement natural land forms (such as smooth gradations or terracing).\n(8) Use of retaining walls over eight feet in height require design and certification by a state- registered engineer.\n(B) Relationships of the project to adjoining area.\n(1) Building projects shall not be designed as isolated units, but instead shall reflect the context of the adjoining properties.\n(2) Grading shall blend gently with contours of adjacent properties.\n(3) Buildings at the ends of streets, or at street corners, shall serve as visual \"terminals\". Serving to both unify and conclude\nthe architectural statement made on the street.\n(4) Proposed recreation areas or uses shall complement nearby existing uses. The extension of existing parks or recreation\nareas into a proposed development is a highly desirable design feature.\n(5) Buildings or projects located near or adjacent to a greenway shall provide safe and efficient pedestrian connection to that\ngreenway, and also to adjacent properties that might include pedestrian systems in the future.\n(6) Buffer zones shall separate and protect the greenway, while at the same time connect it to the building site.\n(7) Natural drainage patterns shall be preserved where possible. Changing the natural drainage areas will affect the drainage\nonto adjoining areas.\n(8) Innovative building and site design can capitalize on natural drainage ways and transform steep slopes into major site\namenities.\n(9) Design shall ensure that drainage occurs only in areas designed to serve a drainage function.

These standards shall apply to all new construction, expansions and/or additions of 50% of\nthe gross floor area of existing buildings or changes to exterior building facades for multifamily and non-residential development.\nSingle-family detached residential uses and individual duplexes are exempt from \u00a7\u00a7 152.085 through 152.090 of this chapter\n(unless \u00a7 152.089 of this chapter applies), as are changes considered maintenance and repairs to existing non-residential\nbuildings; maintenance and repair is defined as those changes that are considered upkeep and do not change the architectural\nappearance of the building. The architectural review standards shall hereby be incorporated as a reference to \u00a7\u00a7 152.085 through\n152.090 of this chapter, specifically with regard to illustrations.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 7-13-2015; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 500)\n\u00a7 152.086 SITE ASPECTS.\n(A) Relationship of a building to its site.\n(1) Building design shall be fitted to the natural contours of the site. Natural features of the site, such as rock outcroppings or\nnatural drainage ways shall be preserved.\n(2) On wooded sites, buildings shall be carefully situated to take advantage of the shade and energy conservation provided by\nthe trees.\n(3) The impression of buildings tucked into, rather than superimposed on, the natural landscape shall be created.\n(4) The view of the building from the street and surrounding areas shall be as important as the view available to the buildings\noccupants.\n(5) Buildings shall be located according to the natural characteristics of the site. In hilly terrain, clustering of buildings is\nencouraged as a strategy to avoid destroying sensitive natural areas.\n(6) Buildings shall be designed to harmonize with the existing topography, thereby minimizing land disruption.\n(7) Grading shall be held to a minimum and should complement natural land forms (such as smooth gradations or terracing).\n(8) Use of retaining walls over eight feet in height require design and certification by a state- registered engineer.\n(B) Relationships of the project to adjoining area.\n(1) Building projects shall not be designed as isolated units, but instead shall reflect the context of the adjoining properties.\n(2) Grading shall blend gently with contours of adjacent properties.\n(3) Buildings at the ends of streets, or at street corners, shall serve as visual \"terminals\". Serving to both unify and conclude\nthe architectural statement made on the street.\n(4) Proposed recreation areas or uses shall complement nearby existing uses. The extension of existing parks or recreation\nareas into a proposed development is a highly desirable design feature.\n(5) Buildings or projects located near or adjacent to a greenway shall provide safe and efficient pedestrian connection to that\ngreenway, and also to adjacent properties that might include pedestrian systems in the future.\n(6) Buffer zones shall separate and protect the greenway, while at the same time connect it to the building site.\n(7) Natural drainage patterns shall be preserved where possible. Changing the natural drainage areas will affect the drainage\nonto adjoining areas.\n(8) Innovative building and site design can capitalize on natural drainage ways and transform steep slopes into major site\namenities.\n(9) Design shall ensure that drainage occurs only in areas designed to serve a drainage function. Storm water should not flow\nover sidewalks, paths or streets.\nCELL (1, 1): \nRetail, service or trade business\nCELL (1, 2): \n1 space for each 5,000 sq. ft. of gross floor area\nCELL (2, 1): \nTruck terminals\nCELL (2, 2): \nSufficient space to accommodate the maximum number of\ntrucks to be stored or to be loaded or unloaded at the\nterminal at any one time\nCELL (3, 1): \nWholesale and industrial uses\nCELL (3, 2): \n1 space for each 10,000 sq. ft. of gross floor area\n\nNEW PAGE 60\n(C) Streetscape.\n(1) Scale is a major factor in creating a sense of community and a sense of place.\n(2) The ratio between the width of the street corridor (as measured between opposing building facades) and the height of the\n\"walls\" of that corridor (the foundation-to-eaves dimension) plays an important role in creating a human scale in the streetscape.\nThe most satisfactory ratio is generally a width that is two or three times the height of the defining walls or edges. If the width\nexceeds the height more than four times the sense of enclosure is diminished.\n(3) The town shall be focused on people rather than on vehicles. Streets shall be connections not separations.\n(4) Reference \"zones\" of \u00a7 6.3.1 of the Architectural Review Guidelines for explanation of zones and transition areas that shall\nbe addressed in the design of new streets.\nSubdivision in zones to experience transitions\n(5) Especially in the downtown area, and Heritage District Overlay, building faces shall have adequate setback from the street\nedge to allow for sidewalks where people may walk leisurely around meeting places. Public spaces between buildings (including\nroom for planting and street furniture) provide places for the pedestrian to rest and relax.\n(6) Between sidewalk and street, there shall be enough room to accommodate the planting of trees and shrubs (see \u00a7\u00a7\n152.130 through 152.137 and 152.150 through 152.170 of this chapter). The street will be enclosed, pedestrians will be separated\nfrom the cars and the view will be framed.\n(7) Street furniture should complement the overall site and landscape design. It shall reflect the natural mountain character of\nthe town, such as the use of wood and stone for benches, trash receptacles and the like.\n(D) Streets.\n(1) Difficult topography shall be avoided when locating and designing roads. For instance, roads are best placed along the\ncontours of a site if the site is hilly or steep. This minimizes fuel consumption and noise in automobiles and provides a more\ncomfortable access for pedestrians and bicycle riders. Consideration shall also be given to fire protection and emergency vehicles\nin order to facilitate access to any structure in case of any emergency.\n(2) Roadways shall focus attention on interesting views and should not interfere with natural drainage patterns.\n(3) The town uses the state's Department of Transportation Subdivision Roads Minimum Construction Standards to suggest\nparameters for new streets. These standards may need to be adjusted, especially in areas of difficult topography with steep slopes.\n(4) The site plan should incorporate a hierarchy of roadways and walkways that provide for safe, smooth and pleasant\nmovement of people and vehicles. Special attention shall be paid to points at which pedestrian, bicycle and automobile movements\nare in conflict. Clearly marked crosswalks or routing of pedestrian paths away from main automobile traffic areas can reduce\nhazards in these areas.\n(5) Whenever there is a design choice between access from the development to a street of a higher classification and access\nto a street of a lower classification, access should be to the street of lower classification.\n(6) On large streets, landscaped median islands are encouraged and crosswalks shall be included.\n(7) Trees, shrubs and other plants shall be planted along the streets in accordance with $$152.130 through 152.137 and\n152.150 through 152.170 of this chapter.\n(E) Sidewalks.\n(1) Building sites shall accommodate pedestrians and shall be centered around pedestrian traffic rather than vehicular traffic.\n(2) Access must be safe and convenient within a site. Sidewalks must be clearly separated from driving areas and must\nconnect buildings to each other, to parking areas and to adjacent pedestrian paths.\n(3) Handicapped accessibility along walkways at street/driveway intersections shall be provided whenever possible, per State\nBuilding Code specifications.\n(4) Sidewalk construction standards (including curb and gutter) shall follow the state'sDepartment of Transportation\nSubdivision Roads Minimum Construction Standards.\n(5) Walkways or sidewalks shall be provided along all public streets for commercial developments.

All parking spaces required in this chapter shall be setback at least five feet from any adjacent street\nright-of-way, and at least eight feet from the edge of the street when no right-of-way exists beyond the street. In no case shall the\nlocation of parking spaces obstruct the visibility of a sight triangle, nor shall they be allowed within any setback area unless granted\na variance by the Board of Adjustment.\n(2) Parking location in the Heritage District Overlay. Parking spaces shall be located to the side and/or rear of the associated\nbuildings they serve. Parking lots that serve as the principal use of a lot shall be exempt from this requirement; however, parking\nspaces should be setback a minimum of 15 feet so as not to be a dominant feature of the streetscape.\n(E) Designation of parking spaces.

Additional driveways may be permitted when\nreviewed by the Administrator and deemed that they are necessary to improve traffic movement, increase sight distances or for\nother safety reasons.\n(2) Developments shall share driveways with adjoining developments where possible. In addition, adjoining uses shall provide\nsafe and efficient access to neighboring parking areas so vehicular traffic and pedestrians can move directly to the adjoining use\nwithout first returning to the public right-of-way or street. Driveways as a means of the only ingress and egress shall be allowed in\nthe setback areas as determined in \u00a7 152.028 of this chapter.\n(I) Visibility at intersections. On a corner lot in any zoning district, no planting, structures, sign, fence, wall or obstruction to\nvision more than two and one-half feet in height measured from the centerline of the street shall be placed or maintained within the\ntriangular area formed by the intersecting street right-of-way lines and a straight line connecting points on said street right-of-way.\nThe sight triangle, as required by the state's Department of Transportation, is illustrated below; however, this sight triangle may be\nvaried by the Administrator on town and private streets as deemed necessary:\n(J) Parking of tractor trailers or semi-trailers for storage.
