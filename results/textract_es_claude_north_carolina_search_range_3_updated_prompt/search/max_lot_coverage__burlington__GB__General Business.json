GENERAL BUSINESS (GB) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe General Business (GB) district is the primary district intended to serve\nretail, business, and service uses in the City and is found along major\narterial streets, interstate interchanges, and on blocks surrounding the\ncentral business district. Development in the GB district tends to be\nautomobile oriented and comprised of a mix of individual buildings on\nindividual sites and multi-tenant or multi-building developments located\nnear major roadway intersections. In addition to commercial uses, the\ndistrict also accommodates wholesale sales, warehousing uses, and a very\nwide range of institutional uses. Limited forms of residential use are\nallowed, such as upper-story residential and multi-family development.\nUses in the district are subject to standards intended to ensure development\nis compatible with adjacent residential neighborhoods, ensure that the\ntraffic carrying capacity along the City's major roadways is not impaired due\nto unsafe turning movements, and that development is well landscaped and\naesthetically pleasing. In order to maintain compatibility with surrounding\nuses and ensure a high quality of development, all activities, including\nstorage shall be indoors or be fully screened from view from the street or\nfrom lands in lower-intensity zoning districts.\nB.

GENERAL BUSINESS (GB) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe General Business (GB) district is the primary district intended to serve\nretail, business, and service uses in the City and is found along major\narterial streets, interstate interchanges, and on blocks surrounding the\ncentral business district. Development in the GB district tends to be\nautomobile oriented and comprised of a mix of individual buildings on\nindividual sites and multi-tenant or multi-building developments located\nnear major roadway intersections. In addition to commercial uses, the\ndistrict also accommodates wholesale sales, warehousing uses, and a very\nwide range of institutional uses. Limited forms of residential use are\nallowed, such as upper-story residential and multi-family development.\nUses in the district are subject to standards intended to ensure development\nis compatible with adjacent residential neighborhoods, ensure that the\ntraffic carrying capacity along the City's major roadways is not impaired due\nto unsafe turning movements, and that development is well landscaped and\naesthetically pleasing. In order to maintain compatibility with surrounding\nuses and ensure a high quality of development, all activities, including\nstorage shall be indoors or be fully screened from view from the street or\nfrom lands in lower-intensity zoning districts.\nB. DISTRICT DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS\nNOTES:\n[1] Includes duplex, triplex, and quadriplex dwellings.\n[2] Development in the WPO is subject to the built-upon limits in Section 3.20.F, Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay\n(WPO) District.\n[3] Open space set-aside shall be configured with at least 50 percent devoted to active recreation features in accordance\nwith Section 7.1, Open Space Set-Aside.\n[4] In cases where development is in a subdivision established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, no setback shall\nbe required to be greater than the average setback of existing residential structures on the same side of the block or within\na distance of 500 feet horizontally on either side when blocks are not present.\n[5] On corner lots of record, the street setback may be reduced by 50 percent on the long side of the lot.\n[6] When the lot abuts a residential district, the OI zoning district, or an alley, the setback shall be at least 15 feet; when the\nbuilding wall abutting the lot line includes an opening (such as for a door or window), the setback shall be at least 5 feet.\n[7] Applied in lieu of side or rear setbacks in multi-building developments.\n[8] Development in the AHO is subject to the maximum building heights in Section 3.20.B, Airport Height Overlay (AHO)\nDistrict.\nCity of Burlington\n3-13\nUnified Development Ordinance\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (1, 6): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nREQUIREMENT\nCELL (2, 5): \nCELL (2, 6): \nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nSTANDARD\nCELL (3, 3): \nSingle-Family\nDetached and\nAttached [1]\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-\n20)\nCELL (3, 4): \nMulti-Family\nCELL (3, 5): \nMixed Use\nCELL (3, 6): \nNon-\nresidential\nCELL (4, 1): \nA\nCELL (4, 2): \nMaximum Residential Density (units/acre)\n(AMENDED 06.21.22 UDOTA-03-22)\nCELL (4, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (4, 4): \n24\nCELL (4, 5): \n26\nCELL (4, 6): \nN/A\nCELL (5, 1): \nB\nCELL (5, 2): \nMinimum Lot Area (square feet)\nCELL (5, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (5, 4): \n6,000 + 1,600 per\ndwelling unit\nCELL (5, 5): \nCELL (5, 6): \nNone\nCELL (6, 1): \nC\nCELL (6, 2): \nMaximum Lot Coverage (% of lot area) [2]\nCELL (6, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (6, 4): \nCELL (6, 5): \nNone\nCELL (6, 6): \nCELL (7, 1): \nD\nCELL (7, 2): \nMinimum Lot Width (linear feet)\nCELL (7, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (7, 4): \nCELL (7, 5): \nN/A\nCELL (7, 6): \nCELL (8, 1): \nE\nCELL (8, 2): \nMinimum Open Space Set Aside (% of lot\narea)\nCELL (8, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (8, 4): \n10 [3]\nCELL (8, 5): \n5 [3]\nCELL (8, 6): \n8\nCELL (9, 1): \nF\nCELL (9, 2): \nMin.

The district accommodates large-scale\nindustrial uses including outdoor operations or storage with\nextensive movement of vehicles, materials, and goods, truck\ntraffic and greater potential for adverse environmental and\nvisual impacts on neighboring lands. The district also allows\nlimited forms of heavier commercial use types but residential\ndevelopment is prohibited (except for caretaker quarters as an\naccessory use). District standards are intended to prevent the\nestablishment of any use types that would interrupt industrial\noperations. District standards require that no land or structure\nbe used for any purpose that causes noxious or offensive\nodors, gas fumes, smoke, dust, vibration, or noise that\nsubstantially interferes with other nearby uses.\nB.
