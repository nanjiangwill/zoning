Design Flexibility\nFlexibility is provided in this Ordinance to promote quality development through the use of exceptional design principles and best management\npractices. The intent is to promote the use of exceptional design methods to achieve quality development without imposing financial or regulatory\nburdens on projects.\nLow Impact Development (LID) and other best management practices improve the environmental quality and sustainability of development. Many\nare very cost effective and can result in short and/or long-term cost savings. Use of these practices is strongly encouraged in the planning and\ndesign of projects.\nCredit toward meeting the buffer, recreation, open space, stormwater and other requirements of this Ordinance for residential and non-residential\nprojects may be obtained by utilizing best management practices, exceptional site and structure design, tree resource management, historic\nresource protection and other similar design practices. Examples of these techniques include the following:\nA. Site and/or structure design that reflects exceptional aesthetic elements and is consistent with the character and context of the community;\nB. Naturally shaped landscaped stormwater ponds with recreational features such as trails, bridges, gazebos, etc.;\nC. Tree resource management such as protecting large contiguous areas of heritage trees;\nD. Stormwater management utilizing LID methods such as bioretention;\nE. Connecting recreational elements with established greenways, trails, parks, etc.; and\nF. Green Growth techniques to conserve and connect highly sensitive areas.\nCommentary: Information and references regarding selected best management practices is provided in Appendix E.\n159 of

In order to provide flexibility, side yard requirements are sometimes presented as \"One Yard\" and \"Total Side Yard\".\nThis approach allows the owner or developer to move the house a little to one side of the lot or the other to preserve trees, add driveways,\nor other things.

Residential District Intent Statements\nA. RR: Rural Low Density Residential\nThe Rural Low Density Residential District is intended to accommodate nonresidential agricultural uses and low density residential development,\nas well as limited nonresidential uses that are supportive of the County's traditional agricultural orientation including farming, silviculture\noperations and related activities. Development in this District should rely predominantly on individual wells and septic tank systems for\ndomestic water supply and sewage disposal, respectively, although clustered residential development served by public water and wastewater\nsystems may be allowed.\nB. R-7500, R-6000, and SBR-6000\nThe R-7500, R-6000, and SBR-6000 districts are established to provide for orderly suburban residential development. A limited number of\ncommercial and civic uses are allowed, subject to the restrictions necessary to preserve and protect the residential character of the\nneighborhood. A special permit process for higher intensity development is also allowed, using discretion to balance issues of higher density\nwith improved amenities. Due to the higher intensity developments contained in this district, it is intended to be applied to properties served by\npublic sewer and water systems.\nC. MR-3200\nThis district is established as an area in which the principal use of the land is for high density residential purposes, not to exceed fourteen\ndwelling units per acre. The district also provides for the development of less intensive residential uses, as well as for compatible supporting\nnon-residential uses. Due to the higher intensity developments contained in this district, it is intended to be applied only to properties served by\npublic sewer and water systems.\n4.4.2. Permitted Uses\nOnly uses specifically listed in the use table in Section 5.2 as a permitted (\"P\"), permitted subject to limited use standards (\"L\"), or permitted subject\nto special use permit (\"SUP\") shall be permitted in Residential districts.\n4.4.3.
