Setback and height requirements are established for\nfreestanding signs and detailed design requirements are provided for monument and\npole signs.\n(A.) Only one general attached sign (blade, V-type, or flat) is allowed per street or\nparking frontage.\n(B.) Only one monument or pole freestanding sign is allowed per street frontage.\n(C.) Height of freestanding signs shall be measured from the elevation of the ground at\nthe point of contact with the sign provided that the grade of the site is not artificially\naltered to increase the allowable height of the sign. For sloping sites, the applicable\npoint of contact shall be the point having the highest elevation.\n(D.) One sign per approved Home Occupation within the Single Family Residential\n(SFR), Residential Main Street Transition (RMST), Mixed Use (MU), and Main\nStreet (MS) districts, not to exceed four (4) square feet in area.\n(E.)

The minimum buffer width for all buffer yards except the Type D yard may be\nreduced by 30% with the use of an opaque wall or fence constructed of masonry,\nstone or pressure treated lumber providing such reductions do not disturb the\nCritical Root Zone (CRZ) of existing trees. The wall or fence should be a\nminimum of five (5) feet in height. The wall or fence shall be set back from the\nproperty line a minimum of five (5) feet and shall be planted with half the\nrequired plantings, including all types of shrubs and trees required, on the outside\nof the wall or fence (facing the adjacent property).\n(2.) Understory trees shall be substituted for canopy trees at the rate of two (2)\nunderstory trees for every canopy tree to be planted within fifteen (15) feet of an\noverhead utility line.\n(3.)

If\noverhead utilities are present, planting of one small maturing tree for every 40 linear\nfeet of property abutting a street is required.\n(B.) Where the street abuts a parking lot over 3000 square feet in area and located within\n50 feet of the edge of the pavement, shrubs shall be planted at the rate of one\ndeciduous or evergreen shrub for every 5 linear feet of vehicular use area abutting the\nstreet in addition to the required street trees. The shrubs must achieve a minimum\nheight of three feet at maturity.\n(C.)
