On corner lots, the front yard shall be measured perpendicular\nfrom the street lot line having the shortest linear footage. If both street lot lines have equal linear footage,\nthe property owner shall determine the location of the front yard where no principal structure is located. If\na\nprincipal structure is located on such a lot, the front yard shall be based on the architectural orientation of\nthe house. In instances where the street right-of-way line goes to the centerline of the street, the front\nsetback shall be measured at a point 30 feet from the centerline.\nRear yard.

The base flood elevation (BFE) plus the freeboard establishes the regulatory flood protection elevation.\nFunctionally dependent facility. A facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located in\nclose proximity to water, limited to a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or\npassengers, shipbuilding, or ship repair. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or\nservice facilities.\nHazardous waste management facility. As defined in N.C.G.S. 130A, Article 9, a facility for the collection,\nstorage, processing, treatment, recycling, recovery, or disposal of hazardous waste.\nHighest adjacent grade (HAG). The highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction,\nimmediately next to the proposed walls of the structure.\nCreated: 2023-08-11 10:27:37 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 11, Update 1)\nPage 216 of 221\n\nNEW PAGE 217\nHistoric structure. Any structure that is:\nLowest adjacent grade (LAG). The elevation of the ground, sidewalk or patio slab immediately next to the\nbuilding, or deck support, after completion of the building.\nLowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood\nresistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage in an area other than a\nbasement area is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such an enclosure is not built so as to\nrender the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of the FDP-O.\nManufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent\nchassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.\nThe term \"manufactured home\" does not include a \"recreational vehicle\".\nManufactured home park or subdivision. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more\nmanufactured home lots for rent or sale.\nMarket value. The building value, not including the land value and that of any accessory structures or other\nimprovements on the lot. Market value may be established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost\ndepreciated for age of building and quality of construction (Actual Cash Value); or adjusted tax assessed values.\nMean sea level. For purposes of the FDP-O the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in\n1929, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) as corrected in 1988, or other vertical control datum used as a\nreference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain, to which base flood elevations (BFEs) shown on\na FIRM are referenced. Refer to each FIRM panel to determine datum used.\nNew construction. Structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of\nthe initial floodplain management regulations and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.\nNonencroachment area. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must\nbe reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more\nthan one foot as designated in the flood insurance study report.\nPost-FIRM. Construction or other development for which the start of construction occurred on or after the\neffective date of the initial flood insurance rate map.\nPre-FIRM. Construction or other development for which the start of construction occurred before the\neffective date of the initial flood insurance rate map.\nPrincipally above ground. At least 51 percent of the actual cash value of the structure is above ground.\nCreated: 2023-08-11 10:27:37 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 11, Update 1)\nPage 217 of 221\nCELL (1, 1): \nA.\nCELL (1, 2): \nListed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S.\nDepartment of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of Interior as meeting the\nrequirements for individual listing on the National Register;\nCELL (2, 1): \nB.\nCELL (2, 2): \nCertified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of Interior as contributing to the historical\nsignificance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to\nqualify as a registered historic district;\nCELL (3, 1): \nC.\nCELL (3, 2): \nIndividually listed on a local inventory of historic landmarks in communities with a \"Certified Local\nGovernment (CLG) Program\"; or\nCELL (4, 1): \nD.\nCELL (4, 2): \nCertified as contributing to the historical significance of a historic district designated by a community\nwith a \"Certified Local Government (CLG) Program\".
