Required yards and setback distances\nshall be measured from the property line or street right-of-way line to the nearest portion of\nany building or structure foundation/footprint, excluding:\n(1)\nFor side yard the outermost four feet of any leave, gutter, canopy, or similar fixture.\n(2)\nA deck or patio if no portion of the same extends more than 2 inches above grade, not\nto extend within five (5) feet of any lot line.\n(3)\nAny structure that is a mere appendage to a building, such as a flagpole or fountain.\n(4)\nFences.\nSection 5.6.2. Through Lots (Double Frontage) and Corner Lots\n(A)\nIn the case of \"through lots\" (also referred to as \"double frontage lots\"), the lot shall be considered\nto have two front lot lines on each street frontage.\n(B)\nFor corner lots, the side having the shortest street frontage is considered the front for setback\npurposes.
