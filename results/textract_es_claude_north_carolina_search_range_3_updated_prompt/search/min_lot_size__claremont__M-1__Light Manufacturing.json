The Zoning Enforcement Officer and the Board of Adjustment, in interpreting the\nzoning map or deciding any appeal, shall apply the following standards:\n1. Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets or highways, street lines,\nor railroad right-of-way lines or such lines extended, such centerlines, street lines or railroad right-of-way lines shall be\nconstrued to be such boundaries.\n2. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to\nbe said boundaries.\n3. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets, highways,\nor railroads, or rights-of-way of same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such\ndistance there from as indicated on the zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use\nof the scale shown on said zoning map.\n4. Where a district boundary line divides a lot in single ownership, the district requirements for the least restricted portion\nof such lot shall be deemed to apply to the whole thereof, provided that such extensions shall not include any part of such a\nlot more than thirty-five (35) feet beyond the district boundary line.

To minimize the distractions and obstruction of view that contribute to traffic hazards and endanger public safety;\n3. To protect existing development and promote high standards of quality in new development by encouraging\nappropriately designed, placed, and sized signage;\n4. To provide an effective guide for communicating identification through signage while preventing signs from dominating\nthe visual appearance of the areas in which they are located.

In addition, a certificate of\noccupancy for the change in the use of property shall require compliance with Article I.

Wall mounted signs.\na. One or a combination of the wall sign types below may be used on a building. Wall sign area is the total of the square\nfootage of all wall signs associated with a business or structure.\nb. A flush wall sign is mounted or applied directly to the building wall, generally on the fascia. It may in no instance\nextend above the parapet; in the residential and mixed use districts, it must be located below the parapet.\nC. A hanging sign is also a wall sign. A hanging sign is suspended from a simple bracket attached to a building wall and\nrequires eight (8) or more feet of vertical clearance from the ground. It is most appropriately used along pedestrian-oriented\nstreets to identify attached or closely spaced shops, restaurants, and service businesses. Only one (1) hanging sign is\npermitted per building or business bay (in a multi-tenant building). The sign face area does not include the area of the\nbracket. A hanging sign may project no more than four (4) feet from the building wall. It may project up to three (3) feet over\na sidewalk in a city maintained right-of-way (or state ROW if permitted). However, in any case the sign shall no be closer\nthan three (3) feet to a power or other utility line or the outside edge of street pavement.\nd. A canopy or lawning sign is sign copy applied directly onto a canopy or lawning.\n2. Ground mounted signs (defined as follows):\na. A monument sign is mounted generally flush with the ground plane. It may not be mounted on a pole or pylon, nor\nraised by mounting on a man-made berm, wall, or similar structure. Supporting elements may not exceed three (3) feet in\nheight and are included in measurement of sign height.\nb. A raised sign may hang from a pole and beam frame as illustrated below, or be placed within a frame mounted on up\nto two (2) supporting poles.\n(Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02)\nSec. 9-3-166 Sign measurement.\n1. Sign face area. The area within a single, continuous perimeter enclosing the characters, lettering, logos, illustrations,\nand ornamentation, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate the sign\nfrom the background against which it is placed.\n2. Sign height. The distance from the ground plane beneath the sign to the highest point of the sign's frame.\nOrnamentation atop signs, such as small caps and spires, are not included in the height measurement.
