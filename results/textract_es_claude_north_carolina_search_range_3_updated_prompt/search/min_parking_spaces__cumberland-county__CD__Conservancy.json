In such cases, the depth of the front yard on such lot shall not be less than the\naverage front yard depth on such developed lots. This provision shall not require a\nstructure to be set back from the street or road a greater distance than the distance set\nforth in this ordinance or the setback line observed by the closer of the two existing\nprincipal structures on immediately adjoining lots. In no case, however, shall any\nresidential structure be placed closer than 50 feet from the centerline of a street on\nwhich it faces or within 40 feet from the centerline of a side street. The location of a\nresidential structure with respect to the street line in any commercial or industrial\ndistrict shall not be used as a factor in determining the required setback from the street\nline for any new structure to be erected in such districts.\n((Amd. 01-19-10)\nC. Fences and Walls. The setback requirements of this ordinance shall not apply to\nany retaining wall. Open fences and walls may be erected to any height. Solid fences and\nwalls shall be limited to three feet in height when projecting into or enclosing a\nminimum front yard and shall be limited to seven feet in height when projecting into or\nenclosing a minimum side and/or rear yard. When a corner lot follows two front yard\nsetbacks, as determined by the Coordinator, a solid fence or wall greater than three feet\nin height, but not exceeding seven feet in height, may not be erected within 20 feet of\nthe right-of-way on the street deemed the secondary front yard by the Coordinator. The\nstreet on which the house is addressed is usually considered the primary street on\nwhich the house must follow the full front yard setback unless otherwise determined by\nthe Coordinator. Exceptions to location criteria are as follows:\n1. Fences or walls that are within or enclose the minimum side and/or rear yard\nof a subdivision lot which is situated on a peripheral boundary of a subdivision in which\nit is a part;\n2. Rear yards on through lots may have a privacy fence erected up to the rear\nproperty line, as determined by a platted \"no access easement\" or up to 20 feet from\nthat line in the absence of a \"no access easement\";\n127\nJune 20, 2005 County Zoning Ordinance\nw/ Amendments through January 16, 2024\n\nNEW PAGE 140\n3. Fences erected in conjunction with a buffer, as required by sub-section G,\n\"Buffer Requirements\" below, shall be set back a sufficient width from the property line\nto allow for the proper maintenance and upkeep of the vegetative buffer; and\n4. When a principal structure is permitted closer than 25 feet to a public right-of-\nway line, the fence or wall will be permitted no closer to the road right-of-way than the\npermitted location of the principal structure.\n(Amd. 11-20-06; Amd. 02-19-08; Amd. 01-19-10)\nD. Corner Visibility. In all districts, no fence, wall, shrubbery, sign or other\nobstruction to vision between the heights of three and 15 feet shall be permitted within\n20 feet of the intersection of two streets.\nE.

The depth of rear yards on through lots shall be at\nleast equal to the minimum required front yards for the district in which it is located,\nand no accessory buildings shall be located in the rear yard on through lots.\nF. No Other Building in Required Yard Space. No part of a yard or other open space\nrequired about any structure for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this\nordinance shall be included as part of a yard or other open space required under this\nordinance for another structure. When two or more uses occupy the same building,\nsufficient off-street parking areas, yard widths, lot area, open space, etc., must be\nprovided so that the dimensional requirements pertaining to each of the uses will be\nmet in full.\nG. Screening Buffer Requirements.\n1. A solid buffer shall be installed:\na. When a non-residential use abuts a residentially zoned property along the side\nand/or rear property lines;\nb. When any commercial off-street parking or loading space abuts a residential\ndistrict along the side or rear property lines;\nC.
