The planted buffer shall be\ncomposed of one (1) row of plants no more than ten (10) feet apart in the row. One (1) of the plant types listed in subsection\n4. below shall be used, and the plants shall be located no further apart than the distance indicated for each plant type. The\nplanted buffer area shall be at least ten (10) feet wide.\n3. Buffer topographic considerations and other exceptions.\na. The required height of the planted buffer shall be measured in relation to the elevation of the edge of the adjacent area\nto be screened. In such cases as the ground elevation of the location at which the screen is to be planted is less than the\nelevation of the proposed building site, the required height of the screen shall be increased in an amount equal to said\ndifference in elevation.\nb.\nIn lieu of compliance with the above buffer and screening requirement, an applicant may submit to the Planning\nDirector for his or her review and approval a detailed plan and specifications for landscaping and screening.\nC. In situations where the topography would render most practical required screening noneffective, the Planning Director\nmay allow the screening to be located outside of the required buffer and placed in a location that will enable the screening to\nbe effective in meeting the intent of this section.\n4. Plant types and spacing. Below are listed the types of plants that shall be used in planted buffers and the maximum\ndistance each plant type shall be planted apart. Substitution for another plant type not listed is to be made in writing to the\nZoning Administrator and is subject to verification that the proposed plant will thrive and provide adequate screening. No\nmore than thirty percent (30%) of the total plantings in a buffer shall be deciduous plants.\nCELL (1, 1): \nPlant\nCELL (1, 2): \nDistance Apart\n(in feet)\nCELL (2, 1): \nArbor Vitae\nCELL (2, 2): \n4\nCELL (3, 1): \nLigustrum Japonicum and varieties\nCELL (3, 2): \n5\nCELL (4, 1): \nPhotinia\nCELL (4, 2): \n5\n\nNEW PAGE 87\n(Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02; Ord. of 6-6-16, No. 22-15)\nSec. 9-3-193 Additional planting specifications.\n1. The specifications for planted buffers in Article K shall be required in all industrial and commercial zones when these\nareas abut residential zones and for all nonresidential uses in residential zones.\n2. All plant types required in this article shall consist of plants at least three (3) feet in height when planted.\n3. When two (2) rows of plantings are required, plants shall be staggered in a triangular pattern so that there is a plant\nspaced the required distance apart as specified in Section 9-3-192.4.\n4. When the existing natural buffer provides adequate screening, the existing buffer should remain. The Zoning\nEnforcement Officer shall determine if sufficient buffer does exist.\n5. When industrial and commercial property is developed adjacent to vacant property zoned residential, a buffer shall be\nrequired.\n6. The buffer shall be shown in detail on the site plan approved by the City of Claremont.\n7. The buffer shall be installed and approved before a certificate of occupancy will be granted except when seasonal\nweather conditions are not conducive. In this situation a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued for up to sixty\n(60) days.\n8. The buffer shall be maintained, and dead and diseased plants replaced by the owner or occupant of the premises. The\noutside storage of materials shall be prohibited in the area between the planted buffer and the residential district. The owner\nor occupant of the premises shall properly and continuously maintain this area.\n9. If a fence is erected on the residential district side of the planted buffer by the party establishing the buffer, the fence\nshall be one of the following types:\na. A six (6) foot high wood, basket weave type fence;\nb. A six (6) foot high picket type fence;\nC. A six (6) foot high chain link type fence;\nd. A six (6) foot high open type fence;\ne. A six (6) foot-high solid masonry wall.\n10.
