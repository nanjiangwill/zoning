The Blue Hill Form District, previously known as the Ephesus/Fordham Form District, established in Section 3.11 is intended for the specific area of the town designated as a focus\narea in the Comprehensive Plan 2020. This Form District fosters a residential, mixed use and pedestrian-friendly area. The Form District is also intended to support the Town's Goals for creating a\nplace for everyone and nurturing our community, by promoting diverse and affordable housing options serving a range of income levels as well as improved stormwater treatment for water\nquality. Unlike conventional zoning, this Form District fosters more predictable results and a high-quality public realm. This is achieved by prescribing the physical form of buildings and other\nelements, by addressing the relationship between building fa\u00e7ades and the public realm, and by specifying the form and mass of buildings and the scale and types of streets and blocks. This Form\nDistrict is considered a Special Appearance District, in accordance with Town Charter Chapter 5, Article 5, Appearance of Structures.\n3.11.1.2 Overall Site Design.\nA.\nPurpose. The purpose of this section is to provide general and specific design and development standards by addressing details of site planning and project design. These standards are intended\nto ensure that proposed development is compatible with existing and future development on neighboring properties, and produces an environment of stable and desirable character, consistent\nwith the Blue Hill Form District. These standards are implemented to ensure that development within this Form District will be designed, arranged, phased and constructed in a safe, orderly,\nenergy-efficient, and visually harmonious manner and will incorporate environmental stewardship. Energy-efficient design of buildings is encouraged so that they may be constructed, operated\nand maintained in a manner that minimizes the use of energy without constraining the building function or the comfort or productivity of the occupants.\nB. Applicability. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this code, no land or structure in the Blue Hill Form District may be used or occupied, and no excavation, removal of soil, clearing of a site,\nor placing of fill may take place on land contemplated for development, and no structure, or part of a structure, may be constructed, erected, altered, renovated, or moved except in compliance\nwith the general and specific design and development standards specified here and the standards contained in the Design Manual.\nC.\nApplication of Land Use Management Ordinance Requirements.

District Character.\n3.11.2.1. Districts and Frontages.\nA. District summary. The Blue Hill District is a vital node of living, shopping and working, centrally located between downtown Chapel Hill and Durham. The Form District ensures that this essential\nhub is able to reach its full potential as both a destination and a community. The regulations support residential and mixed uses at varying levels of intensity, all of which will combine to foster a\nlively and engaging street environment easily accessible to pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders and automobile users.\nB. District intent. This Form District is intended to implement the Ephesus Church Road/Fordham Boulevard Small Area Plan. Specifically, the Blue Hill District provides the implementation\nmechanism for the citizen-endorsed vision for the project area, which is a more dense, walkable urban environment with balanced access for all modes of travel.\nC. Subdistricts established. In order to implement the vision of the Ephesus Church Road/Fordham Boulevard Focus Area Plan, the following subdistricts have been established and are depicted on\nthe Regulating Plan in section 3.11.2.2.\n1. Walkable Residential (WR-). The Walkable Residential Subdistrict is intended to create residential neighborhoods with a mix of housing types, together with civic buildings and open space\nessential to creating neighborhoods. The Walkable Residential Subdistricts are differentiated by the maximum building height permitted.\na. WR-3: maximum height limit of three (3) stories (forty-five (45) feet).\nb. WR-7: maximum height limit of seven (7) stories (ninety (90) feet).\nD.\nFrontages established. Frontages are established in this code to apply certain standards for development along all thoroughfares in the district, both existing and proposed. All public\nthoroughfare frontages shall be assigned one of the frontage types defined in this code.\n1. Type A Frontage. The Type A Frontage is intended for areas where the highest level of walkability is desired. The Frontage creates a \"main street\" environment with buildings pulled up to the\nstreet edge. Type A frontage is differentiated into Type A-1, Type A-2, and Type A-3 to provide three different levels of build-to-zone coverage, sidewalk width, and setback criteria. Type A\nfrontages are generally appropriate for Collector Streets, Local Streets, and District Streets.\n2. Type B Frontage. The Type B Frontage is intended for areas adjacent to major streets where pushing buildings back creates a quiet pedestrian setting at the building. While buildings are\nallowed to be pulled up to the street edge, they may also be set back behind one or two rows of head-in or angle parking served by a single drive aisle.\n3. Type C Frontage. Streets with significant traffic volumes that are not conducive to sustained pedestrian activity have been designated with a Type C Frontage.\n52 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 53\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n4. Type D Frontage. The Type D Frontage is appropriate for Alleys that are shared between sites and provide residents and businesses access to garages, parking decks, loading docks and service\nareas. An alley used to satisfy the maximum block length requirement shall meet the assigned frontage requirement.\n5. Type E Frontage. The Type E Frontage is intended for non-vehicular thoroughfares where development fronts on a multiuse path corridor and/or a significant natural feature.\n6. The Regulating Plan shows assigned frontages for existing streets and some proposed streets in the district. Frontages along all new thoroughfares west of Fordham Boulevard not otherwise\nshown in the Regulating Plan are assigned as Type A-1. Frontages along all new thoroughfares south of Europa Drive, least of 15-501, and north of Ephesus Church Road not otherwise shown\nin the Regulating Plan are assigned as Type A-1. Frontages along all new thoroughfares south of Ephesus Church Road and east of Fordham Boulevard not otherwise identified in the\nRegulating Plan are assigned as Type A-2. Frontages along any new thoroughfares north of Europa Drive not otherwise identified in the Regulating Plan are assigned as Type A-2.\nFor new thoroughfares not shown on the Regulating Plan, the town manager may assign a different frontage other than what is described in the preceding paragraph where one of the\nfollowing applies:\na. Because there are Type A-1 and/or Type A-2 Frontages on other sides of the development parcel;\nb. To protect sensitive natural areas or save healthy existing trees;\nC. To protect natural conditions, such as watercourses, riparian buffers, natural rock formations or topography;\nd. Due to the presence of existing utilities or other easements;\ne. For traffic safety, site distance considerations, intersection spacing, or intersection alignment and/or adequate site distance;\nf. Because there are no other options for ingress and egress;\ng. To provide greater consistency with pedestrian infrastructure, building placement and/or streetscape on adjoining lots and/or the opposite side of the street; or\nh. Because an alternative designation of frontage would promote greater consistency with the overall objectives of the district.\n7. Corner lot application of frontage.\na. Where a corner lot has two different assigned frontages, the more restrictive frontage requirement shall apply to the assigned frontage, and must be continued for a minimum of seventy-\nfive (75) feet around the corner, measured from the intersection of the two (2) right-of-way lines.\nb. Where a corner lot has the same assigned frontage on two (2) or more sides, the town manager shall designate one (1) side of the lot as the primary frontage where one (1) of the following\napplies:\ni. To provide greater consistency with pedestrian infrastructure, building placement and/or streetscape on adjoining lots and/or the opposite side of the street.\nii. Because of a condition where a longer frontage on a development parcel promotes consistent pedestrian character; or\niii. Because the frontage designation would promote greater walkability and support the overall objectives of the district as described in section 3.11.1.\nThe assigned frontage requirements shall apply to that primary frontage, and must be continued along all other frontages for a minimum of seventy-five (75) feet around the corner,\nmeasured from the intersection of the two (2) right-of-way lines.\nC. Any frontages not designated as the primary frontage shall be deemed secondary lot frontages, and shall meet at least one half (1/2) of the minimum Build-to-zone percentage requirement\nof the underlying frontages unless a design alternative is approved by the community design commission.\n3.11.2.2. Regulating Plan.\nThe Walkable Residential (WR-), Walkable Mixed Use (WX-) subdistricts are identified and located on the Town of Chapel Hill Official Zoning Map. The Regulating Plan is intended to show the general areas\nof\neach subdistrict and associated road frontage(s). Additional street right-of-way or public easement may be required at the time of development, in accordance with the Ephesus Church/Fordham\nBoulevard Small Area Plan, the Ephesus Fordham District Illustrative Block Studies, the Ephesus Fordham sections of the Mobility and Connectivity Plan and this section 3.11.\n-\nFrontage\n[The image of the map above is revised to show a Type A-2 frontage in (purple) along the north side of Franklin Street, the south side of Legion Road extension, the north side of Legion Road, both\nsides of Europa Drive and both sides of the new/proposed street that crosses Elliott Road extending from Franklin Street eastward to the new/proposed street that parallels the Booker Creek\ngreenway.

The Form District is also intended to support the Town's Goals for creating a\nplace for everyone and nurturing our community, by promoting diverse and affordable housing options serving a range of income levels as well as improved stormwater treatment for water\nquality. Unlike conventional zoning, this Form District fosters more predictable results and a high-quality public realm. This is achieved by prescribing the physical form of buildings and other\nelements, by addressing the relationship between building fa\u00e7ades and the public realm, and by specifying the form and mass of buildings and the scale and types of streets and blocks. This Form\nDistrict is considered a Special Appearance District, in accordance with Town Charter Chapter 5, Article 5, Appearance of Structures.\n3.11.1.2 Overall Site Design.\nA.\nPurpose. The purpose of this section is to provide general and specific design and development standards by addressing details of site planning and project design. These standards are intended\nto ensure that proposed development is compatible with existing and future development on neighboring properties, and produces an environment of stable and desirable character, consistent\nwith the Blue Hill Form District. These standards are implemented to ensure that development within this Form District will be designed, arranged, phased and constructed in a safe, orderly,\nenergy-efficient, and visually harmonious manner and will incorporate environmental stewardship. Energy-efficient design of buildings is encouraged so that they may be constructed, operated\nand maintained in a manner that minimizes the use of energy without constraining the building function or the comfort or productivity of the occupants.\nB. Applicability. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this code, no land or structure in the Blue Hill Form District may be used or occupied, and no excavation, removal of soil, clearing of a site,\nor placing of fill may take place on land contemplated for development, and no structure, or part of a structure, may be constructed, erected, altered, renovated, or moved except in compliance\nwith the general and specific design and development standards specified here and the standards contained in the Design Manual.\nC.\nApplication of Land Use Management Ordinance Requirements.

District Character.\n3.11.2.1. Districts and Frontages.\nA. District summary. The Blue Hill District is a vital node of living, shopping and working, centrally located between downtown Chapel Hill and Durham. The Form District ensures that this essential\nhub is able to reach its full potential as both a destination and a community. The regulations support residential and mixed uses at varying levels of intensity, all of which will combine to foster a\nlively and engaging street environment easily accessible to pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders and automobile users.\nB. District intent. This Form District is intended to implement the Ephesus Church Road/Fordham Boulevard Small Area Plan. Specifically, the Blue Hill District provides the implementation\nmechanism for the citizen-endorsed vision for the project area, which is a more dense, walkable urban environment with balanced access for all modes of travel.\nC. Subdistricts established. In order to implement the vision of the Ephesus Church Road/Fordham Boulevard Focus Area Plan, the following subdistricts have been established and are depicted on\nthe Regulating Plan in section 3.11.2.2.\n1. Walkable Residential (WR-). The Walkable Residential Subdistrict is intended to create residential neighborhoods with a mix of housing types, together with civic buildings and open space\nessential to creating neighborhoods. The Walkable Residential Subdistricts are differentiated by the maximum building height permitted.\na. WR-3: maximum height limit of three (3) stories (forty-five (45) feet).\nb. WR-7: maximum height limit of seven (7) stories (ninety (90) feet).\nD.\nFrontages established. Frontages are established in this code to apply certain standards for development along all thoroughfares in the district, both existing and proposed. All public\nthoroughfare frontages shall be assigned one of the frontage types defined in this code.\n1. Type A Frontage. The Type A Frontage is intended for areas where the highest level of walkability is desired. The Frontage creates a \"main street\" environment with buildings pulled up to the\nstreet edge. Type A frontage is differentiated into Type A-1, Type A-2, and Type A-3 to provide three different levels of build-to-zone coverage, sidewalk width, and setback criteria.
