No structure or land containing a nonconforming use shall\nhereafter be increased, nor shall its total value be enhanced, except as provided in this\nsection.\nB. Discontinuance/Buffering of Open-Air Outside Uses. All nonconforming uses not\ncarried on within a structure, except those which are incidental and necessary to\nactivities within a structure, shall be discontinued within three calendar years from the\neffective date of this ordinance unless they can be adequately buffered so that the\nnonconforming use is not visible to the surrounding properties and these such uses shall\nbe buffered in accordance with Section 1102.G within two calendar years from the\neffective date of this ordinance. Uses to be discontinued or buffered under this Section\nshall include outdoor sales areas, motor vehicle parking lots not immediately adjacent\nto and used in conjunction with a structure that the parking lot serves, storage yards,\nsigns, billboards and similar uses.
