The\nreview process established in this Article provides for a specific review process subject to specific conditions\nwhich mitigate concerns with the proposed development and ensure compatibility of the use with the\nsurrounding community.\n8.2 - General Requirements.\nProperty may be placed in a conditional district only in response to a petition by the owners of all the\nproperty to be included. Specific conditions applicable to these districts may be proposed by the petitioner\nor the Town, but only those conditions mutually approved by the Town and the petitioner may be\nincorporated into approval and permit requirements.

A statement analyzing the reasonableness of\nthe proposed rezoning shall be prepared for each petition to a conditional district. If the petitioner believes\nthat development of their property in a specific manner will lessen the adverse effects upon surrounding\nproperties or otherwise make the rezoning more in accordance with development principles found in the\nTown's Land Use Plan, they may apply for a rezoning to the appropriate conditional zoning district, as found\nin Section 7.1. Conditional zoning districts do not have any inherent permitted or conditional uses;\ndevelopment activities are only allowed through specific conditions approved by the Town Board. Those\nuses permitted and conditions approved by the Town Board shall be reflected on the Conditional Zoning\nDistrict Supplement issued by the Zoning Administrator. Proposed development activities shall be consistent\nwith the established permitted and conditional uses of the corresponding general use zoning district. The\npetitioner shall meet all of the requirements of the corresponding general use zoning district. If the\npetitioner elects to petition for conditional district zoning, the petition must specify the following:\n(1) The actual use or uses intended for the entire tract or any part or parts thereof, for the parcel\nor parcels specified in the petition;\n(2) Actual use or uses shall be specified permitted or conditional uses in the corresponding\ngeneral use zoning district, found in Article 7, \"Table of Permitted Uses\", of this Ordinance;\nand\n(3) If the petitioner petitions for two (2) or more conditional zoning districts, the petitioner shall\nsubmit a separate petition for each district.\nIn addition, the petition shall be accompanied by a site specific development plan as required by Section\n8.6 of this Article. In the event of an approval, the site plan shall be binding as to the location and extent of\nall proposed development activities on the parcel.\n8.3 - Compliance With General Use District Provisions.\nAny petition to amend district boundaries to create a conditional zoning district shall comply with\nprocedures and provisions for general use district amendments set out in this Ordinance, especially Article 4\nof this Ordinance.\n8.4 - Conditions on Development Activities.\nA landowner petitioning to rezone land to a conditional zoning district may propose conditions to be\nplaced on the property should a rezoning to a conditional zoning district be approved by the Town Board.\nThe petition shall specify any proposed conditions on the petition and the site specific development plan as\nrequired. These conditions shall be in addition to the limitation on uses as provided in Section 8.2 above.\nabout:blank\n55/167\n\nNEW PAGE 56\n6/3/24, 7:55 PM\nDobson, NC Code of Ordinances\nAny proposed conditions shall impose requirements that are more restrictive than those generally\napplicable in the corresponding general use district. For example, conditions might propose to limit the\nnumber of permitted uses to one (1) or more specified uses. They might also propose to limit the number,\nsize, and location of structures, the location and extent of supporting facilities, the location and extent of\nspecial purpose areas, the location and extent of parking areas and ingress/egress points, location and\nextent of buffer areas, the hours of business operation, or the timing of development.\nThe Town Board may require conditions, in addition to those self-imposed by the petitioner, if the\nconditions directly relate to the protection of the health, safety, and general welfare of the surrounding\ncommunity and the general public.\nNo condition, however, may restrict the race, religion, ownership status, or character of District\noccupants, or contain any other exclusionary restrictions. Nor may any condition purport to abridge or\naffect any other applicable federal, state, or local law.\n8.5 - Review of the Petition.\nConditional zoning district decisions are a legislative process subject to the same procedures and\nstandards of review as apply to general use district zoning decisions. In considering any petition for a\nconditional zoning district, the Planning Board and the Town Board shall act in accordance with the\nprovisions of Section 4, \"Changes and Amendments\". In addition to the provisions of Section 4, the Planning\nBoard and the Town Board shall act in a manner consistent with Sections 8.5(A) and 8.5(B), found below.\n(A) Planning Board Action. Following the review of the petition during a public meeting, the\nPlanning Board shall take one of the following actions:\n(1) Recommend Approval. Recommend approval of the petition to the Town Board as\nsubmitted; or\n(2) Recommend Approval with Conditions. Recommend approval of the petition to the Town\nBoard with the petitioner's proposed conditions and additional reasonable conditions\nagreed upon by the Board that promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the\nsurrounding community and the general public. The Planning Board may consider the\nfollowing types of conditions:\n(a) Reduction or limitation in the uses requested;\n(b) Location and extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways, and access\nstreets;\n(c) Preservation of unique natural or constructed features, including retention of existing\nvegetation; and\n(d) Other reasonable requirements to insure public health, safety, and general welfare; or\n(3)\nabout:blank\n56/167\n", "page_number": 54, "page_range": [54, 55, 56], "highlight": ["NEW PAGE 54\n6/3/24, 7:55 PM\nDobson, NC Code of Ordinances\n(a) 15 <em>feet</em> from edge of right-of-way where", "abutting a street or 45 <em>feet</em> from the center of the\nstreet (assuming a 60-foot right-of-way).", "(b) Additional <em>height</em> above the specified limits for every foot or fraction thereof of building\n<em>height</em>", "CELL (1, 1): \nH-I\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (1, 6): \nCELL (2, 1): \n<em>Heavy</em>", "<em>Industrial</em>\nCELL (2, 2): \n80,000\nCELL (2, 3): \n50\nCELL (2, 4): \n20\nCELL (2, 5): \n25\nCELL (2, 6): \n75"], "score": 4.8784947, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Heavy Industrial\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"H-1\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"H1\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"H-1\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [52, 53, 54, 55, 56]}
