Requirements\ninclude copy area, number, type of illumination, and letter height for both attached\nand freestanding signs. Setback and height requirements are established for\nfreestanding signs and detailed design requirements are provided for monument and\npole signs.\n(A.) Only one general attached sign (blade, V-type, or flat) is allowed per street or\nparking frontage.\n(B.) Only one monument or pole freestanding sign is allowed per street frontage.\n(C.) Height of freestanding signs shall be measured from the elevation of the ground at\nthe point of contact with the sign provided that the grade of the site is not artificially\naltered to increase the allowable height of the sign. For sloping sites, the applicable\npoint of contact shall be the point having the highest elevation.\n(D.) One sign per approved Home Occupation within the Single Family Residential\n(SFR), Residential Main Street Transition (RMST), Mixed Use (MU), and Main\nStreet (MS) districts, not to exceed four (4) square feet in area.\n(E.) The following permanent special purpose signs are in addition to general attached\nand freestanding signs under the limitations provided in the following tables and\nelsewhere in this Article.\n(1.) Window.\n(2.) Directional.\n(3.) Directory.\n(4.) Community identification.\n(F.)

Buffer Yard Alternative Standards and Conditions.\n(1.) The minimum buffer width for all buffer yards except the Type D yard may be\nreduced by 30% with the use of an opaque wall or fence constructed of masonry,\nstone or pressure treated lumber providing such reductions do not disturb the\nCritical Root Zone (CRZ) of existing trees. The wall or fence should be a\nminimum of five (5) feet in height. The wall or fence shall be set back from the\nproperty line a minimum of five (5) feet and shall be planted with half the\nrequired plantings, including all types of shrubs and trees required, on the outside\nof the wall or fence (facing the adjacent property).\n(2.) Understory trees shall be substituted for canopy trees at the rate of two (2)\nunderstory trees for every canopy tree to be planted within fifteen (15) feet of an\noverhead utility line.\n(3.) Canopy trees may be substituted for shrubs at the rate of one (1) canopy tree for\neight (8) shrubs and understory trees may be substituted for shrubs at the rate of\none (1) understory tree for five (5) shrubs if approved by the Planning, Zoning &\nSubdivision Administrator.\n(B.) Location of Buffer Yard. Required trees and shrubs shall not be installed in street\nrights-of-way. Required trees and shrubs may be placed in water quality conservation\neasements, electric utility easements below overhead lines, and in drainage\nmaintenance and utility easements upon approval by the Planning, Zoning &\nSubdivision Administrator.\n(C.) Setback Less Than Buffer Yard. If the required building setback is less than the\nrequired buffer yard width, the building setback shall reduce the required planting\nyard width only alongside the building. The planting rate of the required planting\nyard shall still apply.\n(D.) Encroachments Permitted in Required Planting Yards. The following are permitted\nin required planting yards provided the landscaping requirements are met and there is\nno interference with any sight area: Cornices, steps, canopies, overhanging leaves and\ngutters, windowsills, bay windows or similar architectural features, at-grade patios,\nchimneys and fireplaces, fire escapes, fire balconies, and fire towers may project not\nmore than two and one-half (2 1/2) feet into any required planting yard, but in no case\nshall be closer than three (3) feet to any property line or handicap ramps except for\nporches and landings.\n(E.) Obstructions. Landscaping shall not be placed in the sight visibility triangle which\nwould obstruct the view of motorists using any street, driveway, or parking aisle.\n11.6-2 Screening of Dumpsters, Outdoor Storage, and Utility Structures. All dumpsters,\nloading docks, outdoor storage areas over 40 square feet, and utility structures must\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 11 - Page 7\n\nNEW PAGE 266\nbe screened if they are visible to adjacent public or private streets or any adjacent\nproperties. Screening of a dumpster shall not be required in the Industrial District,\nunless the dumpster is located within one hundred (100) feet of an existing non-\nindustrial land use. Screening options include:\n(A.) A single opaque material wall or fence with a minimum height of 6 feet.\n(B.) A combination of opaque materials, berming, and/or evergreen landscaping spaced\nat 8 feet on center that provides the required screening effect. The combination of\nopaque materials, berming, and/or evergreen landscaping shall have a minimum\nheight of 6 feet within three (3) years of planting.\n(C.) The wall(s) of a principal or accessory structure may also count for screening.\n(D.) Chain-link fencing with woven slats of opaque material is not acceptable.\n11.6-3 Street Trees. Street trees are required along all street frontages for all new\ndevelopments described in Sections 11.3-1 and 11.3-2, unless excepted in Section\n11.4. Trees are required at the following rate:\n(A.) One large maturing tree required for every 80 linear feet of street frontage. If\noverhead utilities are present, planting of one small maturing tree for every 40 linear\nfeet of property abutting a street is required.\n(B.) Where the street abuts a parking lot over 3000 square feet in area and located within\n50 feet of the edge of the pavement, shrubs shall be planted at the rate of one\ndeciduous or evergreen shrub for every 5 linear feet of vehicular use area abutting the\nstreet in addition to the required street trees. The shrubs must achieve a minimum\nheight of three feet at maturity.\n(C.) Street trees may be evenly spaced or spaced to accommodate existing site features.\nStreet trees shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) feet apart and a maximum of ninety\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 11 - Page 8\n", "page_number": 264, "page_range": [264, 265, 266], "highlight": ["\",\n\"TNDO\"\nCELL (4, 3): \nType B\nCELL (5, 1): \n\"MS\", \"<em>CIV</em>\"\nCELL (5, 2): \n\"SFR\", \"RMST\"\nCELL (5, 3): \nType", "CELL (2, 3): \nMinimum/\nMaximum\nWidth (<em>ft</em>.)", "The wall or fence should be a\nminimum of five (5) <em>feet</em> in <em>height</em>.", "A single opaque material wall or fence with a minimum <em>height</em> of 6 <em>feet</em>.\n(B.)", "The shrubs must achieve a minimum\n<em>height</em> of three <em>feet</em> at maturity.\n(C.)"], "score": 18.899693, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Civic\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"CIV\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"CIV\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"CIV\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 184\n(3.)
