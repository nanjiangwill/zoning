The standards\nand specifications set forth below are established to ensure that new development and\nconstruction is enduring and compatible with the character of the Town of Coats, that it\naccomplishes the purposes of this Ordinance, and that it achieves the goals identified in\n\"the Plan\" referenced in Article 1 of this Ordinance and other adopted and or approved\nplans.\n9.2\nDetached House Lot and Building Type\n9.2-1 Description. The detached house is the most prevalent building type in Coats. The\ndetached house building type is generally found in residential neighborhoods,\nalthough it may coexist with other, similarly scaled buildings in commercial or\nmixed-use areas. Where possible, structures should be designed to maintain a\nharmonious image of the neighborhood when viewed from a distance. Where\nappropriate and possible, structures shall be designed to terminate vistas. For\ndetached homes on large lots accessed by a private drive, building placement and site\nplanning shall be dictated by landscape features and landscape preservation. Within\nthe limits described below and unless the zoning district standards require greater\nmeasures, these regulations shall apply to all houses built in the Town of Coats.\nThe photographs of detached single-family houses in the Carolinas below are\nexamples for illustration purposes only and not intended to regulate lot/building\nstyles, patterns, or forms.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 1\n\nNEW PAGE 171\n9.2-2 Detached House Lot Type.\n(A.)

Accessory structures, including detached garages, shall be located at least 5'\nbehind the primary structure.\n(5.) Only in the most exceptional circumstances having to do with extreme\ntopography or very special design composition may the rules of residential\nbuilding placement be varied.\n(6.) Grading shall provide for smooth grade transitions to avoid abrupt \"V\" ditches,\nswales and other disruptions to the landscape, particularly between buildings\nwhere open space enhancements for use by persons actively utilizing the\nlandscape and/or yard area. The use of either crawlspace and/or stem-wall\nconstruction techniques in detached residential structures, or professional\nlandscape design is required to meet this characteristic of site development.\n(7.) The maximum building coverage for the primary structure shall be 30% of the lot\narea.\n(8.) Driveways to individual lots shall be separated a minimum of 47 linear feet,\nmeasured at the right-of-way along streets, within the TNDO.\n(B.) Encroachment, Pedestrian Access, and Commercial Use Standards & Specifications.\n(1.) Primary pedestrian access into the building shall be from the street frontage line\nwith a concrete walkway connecting the edge of street or back of curb to base of\nstep for emergency response to primary residence. Walkways shall be built to\nsidewalk standard. Secondary access may be from parking areas.\n(2.)

To perpetuate the unique building character of the Town and its environs, and\nto re-establish its local identity, development shall generally employ building\nstyles that are compatible with the architectural vocabulary of the area in their\nexternal treatment. Manufactured homes shall not be permitted as part of\nany development.\n(b.) The front elevations facing the street and the overall massing must\ncommunicate an emphasis on the human scale and the pedestrian\nenvironment. The intention of buildings in all locations must be to relate the\nprincipal facade to the sidewalk and public space of the street to maintain\ncompatibility with the character of structures within the Town.\n(c.) Each building shall be designed to form part of a larger composition of the\narea in which it is situated. Adjacent buildings should thus be of similar scale,\nheight, and configuration to maintain compatibility with the character of\nstructures within the Town.\n(d.) Building silhouettes should be generally consistent. The scale and pitch of\nroof lines should thus be similar across groups of buildings to maintain\ncompatibility with the character of structures within the Town.\n(2.) Configurations & Techniques:\n(a.) Main roofs on residential buildings should be symmetrical gables or hips with\na pitch of between 4:12 and 12:12. Mono-pitch (shed) roofs should be\nattached to the wall of the main building. No mono-pitch roof should be less\nthan 4:12. Grandiose roof pitches with multiple changes of outline are\nacceptable. It is recommended that accessory buildings have roof pitches that\nconform to those of the main building to maintain compatibility with the\ncharacter of structures within the Town.\n(b.) Front Porches extending across a minimum of 40% of the fa\u00e7ade width,\nexcluding front-loading garages, shall average 6'-0\" in depth from fa\u00e7ade to\nfront edge and be included on all Detached Single-family and Duplex (Two-\nfamily) houses.\n(c.) Balconies should generally be simply supported by posts and beams. The\nsupport of cantilevered balconies should be assisted by visible brackets to\nmaintain compatibility with the character of structures within the Town.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article Page 4\n", "page_number": 171, "page_range": [171, 172, 173], "highlight": ["Driveways to individual lots shall be separated a minimum of 47 linear <em>feet</em>,\nmeasured at the right-of-way", "Mechanical equipment exceeding 16 square <em>feet</em> shall not encroach into any\nrequired setback.", "Commercial Use in a Detached House in the Main Street (\"MS\"), <em>Main</em> <em>Street</em>\n<em>Periphery</em> (<em>MSP</em>), Mixed Use", "A garden wall, hedge\nor knee wall, a minimum 2.5' in <em>height</em>, maximum 3.5' in <em>height</em>, shall be\ninstalled", "Permitted <em>Height</em>, Uses, Encroachments, and Resiliency Standards.\n(3.)"], "score": 16.421137, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Main Street Periphery\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MSP\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MSP\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MSP\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 172\n(4.)

Mechanical equipment at ground level shall be placed on the parking lot side\nof the building away from buildings on adjacent sites and shall be screened\nfrom view by an opaque screen.\n(e.) Hedges, garden walls, or knee walls may be built immediately adjacent to\nproperty lines or as the continuation of building walls. A garden wall, hedge\nor knee wall, a minimum 2.5' in height, maximum 3.5' in height, shall be\ninstalled along any street frontage adjacent to parking areas. Knee walls shall\neither be built of brick, stone or other decorative masonry material, or shall be\nbuilt of wrought iron or other decorative metal, and shall generally match the\narchitectural style of Coats.\n9.2-3 Detached House Building Type.\n(A.)

Architectural Standards in approved \"TNDO\" Districts requested by the developer.\n(1.) Principles for maintaining the character of the Town:\n(a.) To perpetuate the unique building character of the Town and its environs, and\nto re-establish its local identity, development shall generally employ building\nstyles that are compatible with the architectural vocabulary of the area in their\nexternal treatment. Manufactured homes shall not be permitted as part of\nany development.\n(b.) The front elevations facing the street and the overall massing must\ncommunicate an emphasis on the human scale and the pedestrian\nenvironment. The intention of buildings in all locations must be to relate the\nprincipal facade to the sidewalk and public space of the street to maintain\ncompatibility with the character of structures within the Town.\n(c.) Each building shall be designed to form part of a larger composition of the\narea in which it is situated. Adjacent buildings should thus be of similar scale,\nheight, and configuration to maintain compatibility with the character of\nstructures within the Town.\n(d.) Building silhouettes should be generally consistent. The scale and pitch of\nroof lines should thus be similar across groups of buildings to maintain\ncompatibility with the character of structures within the Town.\n(2.) Configurations & Techniques:\n(a.) Main roofs on residential buildings should be symmetrical gables or hips with\na pitch of between 4:12 and 12:12. Mono-pitch (shed) roofs should be\nattached to the wall of the main building. No mono-pitch roof should be less\nthan 4:12. Grandiose roof pitches with multiple changes of outline are\nacceptable. It is recommended that accessory buildings have roof pitches that\nconform to those of the main building to maintain compatibility with the\ncharacter of structures within the Town.\n(b.) Front Porches extending across a minimum of 40% of the fa\u00e7ade width,\nexcluding front-loading garages, shall average 6'-0\" in depth from fa\u00e7ade to\nfront edge and be included on all Detached Single-family and Duplex (Two-\nfamily) houses.\n(c.) Balconies should generally be simply supported by posts and beams. The\nsupport of cantilevered balconies should be assisted by visible brackets to\nmaintain compatibility with the character of structures within the Town.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article Page 4\n\nNEW PAGE 174\n(d.) Two wall materials may be combined horizontally on one facade. The\n\"heavier\" material should be below to maintain compatibility with the\ncharacter of structures within the Town.\n(e.) Exterior chimneys should be finished in brick or stone to maintain\ncompatibility with the character of structures within the Town.\n(f.) Overhanging leaves may expose rafters to maintain compatibility with the\ncharacter of structures within the Town.\n9.3\nAttached House Lot Type and Building Type Standards\n9.3-1\nDescription. The attached house is also known as row-house or Town house.\nTraditional southern homes in Savannah and Charleston provide a model. The\nSouthside neighborhood in Greensboro provides a good contemporary example.\nGenerally, building plans will have narrow frontages with the plan depth being\ngreater than its width. Groups of attached house buildings that are not integrated into\na pedestrian oriented mixed-use urban pattern shall not be permitted within Coats.\nAttached house structures should complement the neighborhood through their design,\nlocation on the site, and building materials. Within the limits described below and\nunless the zoning district standards require greater measures, these regulations shall\napply to all attached houses built on public streets.\nThe photograph (left) is\nof a four-unit single-\nfamily attached town-\nhouse property in\nKannapolis, North\nCarolina is an example\nfor illustration purposes\nonly and is not intended\nto regulate lot/building\nstyles, patterns, or\nforms.\nThe photograph (right) of a six-unit\nsingle-family attached town-house\nproperty in Concord, North\nCarolina is an example for\nillustration purposes only and is not\nintended to regulate lot/building\nstyles, patterns, or forms.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 5\n", "page_number": 172, "page_range": [172, 173, 174], "highlight": ["Commercial Use in a Detached House in the Main Street (\"MS\"), <em>Main</em> <em>Street</em>\n<em>Periphery</em> (<em>MSP</em>), Mixed Use", "A garden wall, hedge\nor knee wall, a minimum 2.5' in <em>height</em>, maximum 3.5' in <em>height</em>, shall be\ninstalled", "Permitted <em>Height</em>, Uses, Encroachments, and Resiliency Standards.\n(3.)", "landscape plans\nrestrict the use of pine needles or other combustible bedding material within eight\n(8) <em>feet</em>", "Adjacent buildings should thus be of similar scale,\n<em>height</em>, and configuration to maintain compatibility"], "score": 16.14543, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Main Street Periphery\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MSP\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MSP\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MSP\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 304\nARTICLE 13\nSTREETS\n13.1\nGeneral\nStreets shall be designed to suit their functions.
