Replacement of Disturbed, Removed or Damaged Vegetation (Post-Warranty):\nAny landscape areas and vegetation preserved or planted as part of an approved\nlandscape plan or permit shall be continually maintained in good condition by the\nproperty owner. Failure to adequately maintain approved vegetation, including trees,\nor to comply with the replacement provisions of this ordinance may result in a civil\npenalty. Replacement requirements, processes, and civil penalties are listed in Section\n15.3 Landscaping Violations.\n9.3 TREE COVERAGE & PRESERVATION\n9.3.1 TREE COVERAGE\nA. Minimum Tree Coverage: All Conditional Planning Area, Master Plan, or Individual\nBuilding projects shall maintain or establish a minimum tree coverage according to\ntheir planning area classification as listed in Table 9-1. The minimum project canopy\ncoverage can be met through a combination of preserved areas, required plantings\n(e.g., street trees, etc.), and other plantings. For the purposes of this requirement,\nproject area refers to the entire area within the project scope that is not encumbered by\neasements, uses, or other features that prohibit tree plantings.\nB. Requirements:\n1. Applicability: The tree coverage standards listed in Table 9-1 apply to all\nConditional Planning Area, Master Plan, and Individual Building development\nproposals. The following are exempt from the tree coverage standards: Permitted\nwork related to single-family detached and duplex houses outside of the\naforementioned processes; Recreation Facility - Outdoor; Stable/Riding Academy,\nHorse Farm, Agriculture, Farm and substantially similar uses as determined by the\nPlanning Director For these uses, the tree coverage standards shall serve as a guide\nfor each Planning Area.\n2. Measurement: The table assumes an average canopy area of: 1,000 square feet for\nlarge maturing trees; 800 square feet for medium maturing trees; and, 200 square\nfeet for small maturing trees. Proposals must utilize these values unless the Arborist\napproves alternative values. For a description of each tree type, see 16.3 Definitions\nunder Tree.\nTown of Davidson, NC\nDAVIDSON PLANNING ORDINANCE\n9-5\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nTABLE 9-1: TREE COVERAGE REQUIREMENT\nCELL (2, 1): \nPLANNING AREA\nCELL (2, 2): \nMINIMUM PROJECT CANOPY COVERAGE\nCELL (3, 1): \nRPA\nCELL (3, 2): \n60%\nCELL (4, 1): \nNE\nCELL (4, 2): \n50%\nCELL (5, 1): \nEC1/EC2/CC\nCELL (5, 2): \n40%\nCELL (6, 1): \nNG\nCELL (6, 2): \n30%\nCELL (7, 1): \nVI\nCELL (7, 2): \n20%\nCELL (8, 1): \nK/VC/VE/VCOM/NC1/NC2/CBD/NS\nCELL (8, 2): \n15%\n\nNEW PAGE 216\nTree Canopy Landscaping & Screening\n9.3 Tree Coverage & Preservation\n3.

General/Purpose: No tree larger than twelve inches in diameter at breast height\n(DBH) may be removed without a permit from the town. A removal permit shall be\nissued by the Planning Director only after an applicant has met with the Arborist\nand received site-specific information on tree protection, care, and removal.\n2. Local Historic District: Removal of a mature tree(s) within in a locally designated\nhistoric district requires a tree permit in accordance with this ordinance.\nAdditionally, a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be required for removal of a\nmature tree within a locally designated historic district wherein the subject tree is\nspecifically identified as significant in a historic district report or in the landmark\ndesignation ordinance (see Section 22). Mature trees shall be replaced by a tree of\nsimilar species, type, and must meet the requirements of Section 9.8.\nB. Approval Process:\n1. Permit Required: An approved permit, including fee payment (if applicable), shall\nbe required for the removal or destruction of a tree(s) larger than twelve inches on\nany property, whether publicly or privately owned, as described above.\n2. Fee: Development and permitting fees are as set forth in the Town of Davidson\nFee Schedule Note: A fee is not required for a tree removal permit unrelated to any\nother building activity on a site.\n3. Site Information: The permit shall include a site plan illustrating the lot area,\nbuilding and development footprints, and subject tree(s) intended for removal\nor that may be impacted by work. Work impacting the critical root zone (CRZ) of\nany tree over twelve inches must be described and/or shown on the plan. Based\non site conditions the Arborist may require dimensions/measurements, an official\nsurvey, and/or other relevant information such as existing conditions, topography,\neasement location, etcetera.\n4. Site Visit: The permit approval may require an on-site consultation between the\napplicant and Arborist in order to identify existing conditions and exploration of\nbest practices for preservation and/or removal. The site visit should occur within 14\ndays of the receipt of a complete application (including fee, if applicable).\n5.
