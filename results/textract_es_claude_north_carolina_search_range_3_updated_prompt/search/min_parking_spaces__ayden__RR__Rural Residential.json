If the appraisals differ by more than 15%, the value will be based on the\naverage of the two appraisals.\n3. Where a combination of land dedication and payments in lieu are approved, the\nsubdivider shall be given a credit equivalent to the appraised value per acre of land\ndedicated for recreation purposes. The credit amount shall be determined by\nmultiplying the number of acres to be dedicated by the appraised value per acre. If\nthe total payment in lieu as determined above is larger than the credit amount, the\nsubdivider shall pay the difference between the two amounts. If the credit amount\nis larger than the total payment in lieu as determined above, no additional payment\nin lieu is required. However, the subdivider may not transfer the excess credit from\none subdivision to another.\n4. Upon approval by the Board of Commissioners, payment in lieu of dedication shall\nbe made at the time of final subdivision plat approval. All monies received by the\nTown of Ayden pursuant to these requirements shall be used only for the acquisition\nand development of recreation, park, and open space sites to serve the residents of\nthe development and the residents of the immediate neighborhood within which the\ndevelopment is located. The Board of Commissioners shall also have the authority to\nsell land dedicated pursuant to these provisions with the proceeds of any such sale\nused solely for the acquisition of other recreation, park, or open space sites within the\nimmediate neighborhood within which the development is located.\nM. Ownership & Maintenance\nThe designated common open space and common facilities are outlined in Article 7 -\nSubdivisions and Infrastructure of this ordinance.\n510.080 Landscaping and Buffering\nA. Findings and Purpose\nThe standards established in this ordinance are intended to preserve, protect, restore and\nenhance the aesthetic appeal and scenic beauty of this town; provide adequate buffering\nbetween land uses; reduce noise and air pollution; reduce stormwater run-off; filter and reduce\nglare from artificial light sources; provide shaded areas along streets, sidewalks and in parking\nlots; provide a continuity of vegetation throughout the town; encourage the preservation of\nexisting trees and vegetation; safeguard and enhance property values; and protect the public\nhealth, safety and general welfare.\nB. Applicability\nThe landscaping and buffering standards of this section shall apply to the following:\n1. All new developments (except for infill single-family detached) shall be designed in\naccordance with the requirements of this Article.\n2. Pre-existing development\na. Non-conforming preexisting development is subject to these standards as follows:\n(1) A change in type of occupancy, as set forth in the North Carolina Building Code;\n(2) A change in land use which requires an increase in the number of off-street parking\nspaces or the provision of a buffer yard;\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-30\nADOPTION DATE: APRIL 12, 2021\n\nNEW PAGE 86\nARTICLE 5\n(3) Additions or expansions which singularly or collectively exceed 25% of the land area\nor gross building floor area existing at the effective date of this ordinance.\nb. The Town of Ayden recognizes that designing preexisting development to meet new\nregulations is more difficult and expensive than applying these standards to\nundeveloped properties. Therefore, greater flexibility will be afforded preexisting\ndevelopment in meeting the requirements of this section, in that:\n(1) A modification of up to 25% percent may be granted by the Administrator for planting\narea and dimension requirements where compliance presents hardships due to\nbuilding location, lot size, or vehicular area configuration;\n(2) A credit for reducing required off-street parking by 1 space shall be given for the\nconstruction of each landscape island.\nC. Street Trees\n1. Street trees are an essential part of the town streetscape. The Town seeks to maintain\nexisting trees where possible and to encourage the planting and continuance of the\nestablished street tree patterns.\n2. To accomplish this objective, the following shall apply:\na.\nAll subdivisions and developments subject to site plan approval shall provide street\ntrees along their frontage with adjacent public streets.\nb.\nStreet trees shall be selected from the list of large trees, or, where power lines are\nlocated, small trees included in Appendix A - Official Planting List.\nC. Planting strips shall be a minimum of six (6) feet wide.\nd. Planting location shall take into consideration planned roadway widening, public safety,\nstandard drainage requirements and maintenance of sight distances for traffic safety.\nStreet trees may be planted within the right-of-way, within planting strip abutting the\nright-of-way or other location approved by the Administrator.\n3. Street trees, unless subject to overhead power lines, shall be planted at the rate of one (1)\ntwo-inch caliper tree per thirty (30) feet of property line abutting a public street, excluding\ndriveways and traffic visibility zones. This rate may be varied based upon existing trees and\nthe crowns of planted trees.\n4. Trees used to meet buffer and vehicle use area requirements, may be used to meet the\nstreet requirements to the extent that the trees are located within twenty-five (25) feet of a\nstreet.\nD. Buffer Yard Requirements\nBuffers provide compatible transitions between differing land uses, reduce the visual impacts of\ndevelopment and retain existing plant materials.\n1. Buffers are required along the common property lines between developments in different\nzoning districts or between developments of different uses as established in this Section.\n2. Buffer requirements shall not apply when a public street or railroad right-of-way separates\napplicable zoning districts or uses accept where new lots created by a Major Subdivision\nPreliminary Plat abuts but has no access to Major or Minor Thoroughfare. When this\noccurs, a streetyard buffer meeting the Type A Buffer criteria standards shall be provided\nadjacent to the thoroughfare right-of-way. The preservation of existing healthy vegetation\nin the streetyard buffer is strongly encouraged.\n3.

A Type C Buffer can be\nachieved in 2 ways as specified below.\nF. Additions to Buffers and Screening\nWhen it is determined that the conflict of land use is so great that the public safety is not\nserved adequately by the minimum buffer and screening requirements, or where there is a\nneed to prevent a high degree of visual, audio, or physical disorders, then the Administrator\nmay require the installation of fencing or earthen berms in addition to the minimum required\nbuffers and screening, according to the standards below.\n1. Fencing or Walls. Where required as part of a buffer yard, fencing or walls must\nadhere to the provisions below. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the owner of a\nsingle family dwelling from constructing a separate fence along the borders of such\nproperty, provided that all required buffer plantings are maintained.\na. In all cases, the finished side of the fence must face the use with the lower intensity.\nb.\nPermitted fence or wall materials include: masonry, stone, architectural block,\nstucco on masonry, wood or other similar of solid appearance.\nC. The design of fencing or walls shall be sufficient to meet the extent of physical\nscreening required by the Administrator.\nd. The height of the fence shall be determined by the Administrator based on the\nfollowing variables: site conditions; topography; use; and/or building height. The\nminimum height of a fence or wall required by this section shall be 6 feet.\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-33\nADOPTION DATE: JANUARY 13, 2020\nCELL (1, 1): \nType B Buffer Yard Options\nCELL (1, 2): \nMin.

Earthen berms may be required in combination with plant material and fencing\nfor the purposes of screening. Berms shall be tapered appropriately to allow for\npractical maintenance.\na. The slope of all berms shall not exceed a 2:1 ratio (horizontal to vertical), shall have\na top width at least one-half the berm height, and a maximum height of 6 feet above\nthe toe of the berm.\nb. All berms regardless of size, shall be stabilized with a grass or other approved\nvegetative ground cover.. Topsoils brought in for mounds are to be mixed with\nnative soil to avoid interfacing problems.\nC. Berms shall be constructed as to provide adequate sight distances at intersections\nand along all roads.\nd. Berms proposed to satisfy the screening requirements of this section shall be\nvegetated as required by this section. All plantings shall be located either on top of\nthe berm or between the berm and the public right-of-way.\nd. Use of berms as a substitute for existing healthy vegetation is strongly discouraged.\nG. Vehicular Use Area Screening & Landscaping\n1. All off-street parking, loading areas, and service areas adjacent to and/or visible from a\npublic right-of-way and adjacent properties shall be screened from view by use of one\nor more of the following:\nA building or buildings;\nA change in topography;\nA planting area a minimum of 8 feet wide planted with evergreen shrubbery placed\na maximum of 5 feet on center. All shrubs shall achieve a height of 4 feet within 3\nyears.\nFencing, walls, or berms.\n2. In addition to screening requirements, canopy trees shall be installed in planting areas\nwithin parking lots to provide shade coverage for all parking spaces within vehicle\nservice areas. Such planting areas shall meet the following requirements:\na. Planting Area Size: The minimum size of a planting area is dependent upon the\nnumber of canopy trees planted within it, as described below\nb. Planting Area Width: A minimum horizontal dimension of 9 feet measured from back\nof curb, pavement, sidewalk or other separating structure is required for all planting\nareas.\nC.\nPlanting Strip Location: A continuous linear planting strip shall be provided between\neach 2 parking bays.\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-34\nADOPTION DATE: APRIL 12, 2021\nCELL (1, 1): \nNumber of Canopy Trees in Planting Area\nCELL (1, 2): \nMinimum Size of Planting Area\nCELL (2, 1): \n1\nCELL (2, 2): \n400 square feet\nCELL (3, 1): \n2\nCELL (3, 2): \n700 square feet\nCELL (4, 1): \n3 or more\nCELL (4, 2): \n300 square feet per tree\n", "page_number": 87, "page_range": [87, 88, 89], "highlight": ["A non-residential or multi-family residential use with 10 or more units adjacent to a <em>RR</em>, RA-20,\nR-12", "Zoning District\nCELL (1, 6): \nCELL (1, 7): \nCELL (2, 1): \nDistrict of\nProposed\nDevelopment\nCELL (2, 2): \n<em>RR</em>", "RMX, MF\nCELL (2, 4): \nMH, NMX\nCELL (2, 5): \nB-1\nCELL (2, 6): \nB-2\nCELL (2, 7): \nLI, HI\nCELL (3, 1): \n<em>RR</em>", "All <em>off</em>-<em>street</em> <em>parking</em>, loading areas, and service areas adjacent to and/or visible from a\npublic right-of-way"], "score": 12.077272, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Rural Residential\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RR\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RR\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RR\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking space for each\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [85, 86, 87, 88, 89]}
