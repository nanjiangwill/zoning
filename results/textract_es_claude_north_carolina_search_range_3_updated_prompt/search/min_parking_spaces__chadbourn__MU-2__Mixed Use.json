By way of illustration and not limitation, conditions may specify location on\nthe property of the proposed structure(s), the number of dwelling units, the location\nand extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways, and access streets,\nthe location and extent of buffer areas and other special purpose areas, the timing of\ndevelopment, the height of structures, the location and extent of rights-of-way and\nother areas to be dedicated for public purposes, and other such matters as may be\nidentified as appropriate for the proposed development.\n(F) Minor modifications to the approved Conditional Zoning ordinance may be\napproved by the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator per authorization\nunder G.S. 160D-703(b). The minor modifications authorized herein are intended to\nprovide relief where conditions established by the Conditional Zoning ordinance\ncreate a hardship based upon a unique physical attribute of the property itself or some\nother factor unique to the property which was not known at the time of ordinance\nadoption and which has subsequently rendered the property difficult or impossible to\nuse due to the condition(s) imposed by the zoning. The permit holder shall bear the\nburden of proof to secure the modification(s). Such modifications shall be limited to\nthe following:\n1. A deviation of up to ten percent or 24 inches, whichever is greater, from the\napproved setback, provided that the conditions for approving a deviation from\nthe required setback established by Article 14 (Flexible Development\nStandards) of this Ordinance are met.\n2. A reduction of up to 25 percent in the number of parking spaces required for\nthe use provided that the proposed development is located within 1/2 mile of\neither the Main Street (MS) and Mixed Use (MU-1 or MU-2) districts and on-\nstreet parking is available.\n3. Any other minor modification in accordance with the limitations and\nprocedures prescribed in this Ordinance, unless restricted by G.S. 160D-\n703(b), or the Conditional Zoning ordinance adopted pursuant to this section\nspecifies otherwise.\nAny other modifications must be approved by the Town Council as an amendment to\nthe Conditional Zoning ordinance and may be referred to the Planning Board or\nPlanning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator as appropriate.
