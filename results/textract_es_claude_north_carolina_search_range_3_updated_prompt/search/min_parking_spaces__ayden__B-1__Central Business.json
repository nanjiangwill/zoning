Infill Development Standards\nInfill development is any new development on land that has been previously developed or vacant\nland where development has occurred around the vacant land.\n1.\nStreet Frontages. New structures should orient windows, main entrances, and other\nprimary building fa\u00e7ade elements toward the street. Care should be taken to avoid the\nappearance of buildings turning their backs or sides toward the street.\n2.\nFront Setback Pattern. The minimum front setback required may be reduced by the\nAdministrator for any lot where the average established front yard setback on developed lots\nlocated within 300 feet on each side of such lot, and fronting on the same street as such lot,\nis less than the minimum required yard setback. In such cases, the minimum front or street\nyard setback may be less than that required but not less than the average of the existing\nfront yard setbacks on the developed lots within 300 feet of each side. In addition, for new\nlots created from existing larger lots, the lot width at the frontage line and the side yard\nsetbacks shall be consistent with the immediately adjacent neighboring parcels on the same\nside of the street.\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-3\nADOPTION DATE: JANUARY 13, 2020\n\nNEW PAGE 59\nGENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\n3.\nDriveways. On lots less than 50 feet in width, only one driveway of no more than 12 feet in\nwidth may be used to provide access to garages or off-street parking areas.\n4. Rhythm of Development. Garages or off-street parking areas shall be located in the side or\nrear setback area only.\nF. Irregular Lot Setbacks\nThe location of required front, side and rear yard setbacks on irregularly shaped lots shall be\ndetermined by the Administrator. The determination will be based on the intent and purpose of\nthis ordinance to achieve an appropriate spacing and location of buildings and buildings on\nindividual lots. Where questions arise as to appropriateness, the subdivider may be requested to\nprovide additional design information.\n510.030 Fences & Walls\nAll fences and walls shall comply with the requirements of this Section unless specifically approved\nas part of a Conditional District, Special Use Permit or Variance.\nA. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, fences that are no taller than six (6) feet may be\nbuilt along interior side and rear property lines.\nB. Exterior side yard fences that are no taller than six (6) feet shall be at least five (5) from the right-\nof-way.\nC. Fences in front yards are discouraged, but must be:\n1. Located least two (2) feet from the right-of-way and no closer than two (2) feet from the\ninside edge of the sidewalk;\n2. Less than sixty (60) percent opaque; and\n3. Not exceed four (4) feet in height, except that wrought iron and split rail style fences may be\nup to five (5) feet tall.\nD. No fence shall obstruct any traffic safety visibility zone.\nE. Barbed wire, razor wire or other fence materials designed to cut or puncture are prohibited in all\ndistricts, except in the B-2, LI, HI and CON districts.\nF. Deer fences may be erected around gardens provided that the fences are located at least ten\n(10) feet from the nearest property line.\n510.040 Parking and Loading\nA. Purpose and Intent\nThis Section establishes the minimum requirements for the number of spaces and the design of\nparking areas in the Town of Ayden. This Section provides administrative flexibility for the\nAdministrator to adjust the number of required spaces and the design of spaces to provide for\nadequate parking, accommodate unique site conditions and capitalize on the benefits of parking\nopportunities on-street or in shared parking areas.\nB. Applicability\nThe requirements of this Section shall be applicable to all new development and changes of use\nthat create the need for parking or increase existing parking demands.\nC. Parking Space Requirements\nPermanent off-street parking (including on-street parking in accordance with the requirements\nbelow) is required subject to the table below. If required, parking shall be provided at the time of\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-4\nADOPTION DATE: APRIL 12, 2021\n\nNEW PAGE 60\nARTICLE 5\nerection, alteration, enlargement, establishment or change of use of any building or open use of\nland which require additional off-street parking.\nD. Exemptions and Adjustments\n1. Exemptions. Uses in the B-1 District are exempt from the minimum parking requirements of\nthis Section.\n2. Tree Preservation. The minimum number of parking spaces required may be adjusted by\nthe Administrator when it has been determined that the reductions are necessary to preserve\na healthy tree or trees (with a 12 inch or greater diameter at breast height) from being\ndamaged or removed, and where the site plan provides for the retention of said tree or trees.\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-5\nADOPTION DATE: JANUARY 13, 2020\nCELL (1, 1): \nLAND USE TYPE\nCELL (1, 2): \nMINIMUM REQUIRED AUTO\nSPACES\nCELL (1, 3): \nMINIMUM REQUIRED\nBICYCLE PARKING\nSPACES\nCELL (2, 1): \nRESIDENTIAL:\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (3, 1): \nDwelling -
