RULES OF MEASUREMENT\n10.2.1. PURPOSE\nThe purpose of this section is to clarify the rules of measurement and exemptions that apply to all principal and accessory\nuses allowed in this Ordinance. These standards may be modified by other applicable sections of this Ordinance.\n10.2.2.\nMEASUREMENTS, GENERALLY\nA.\nStraight Lines\nUnless otherwise stated in this Ordinance, distances specified in this Ordinance are to be measured as the length of\nan imaginary straight line joining two points.\nB.\nRounding\nAll calculations that result in a fractional unit or part of a whole number, the number shall be rounded up to the next\nhighest whole number, unless otherwise provided in this section or elsewhere in this Ordinance.\nC.\nIrregular Shapes\nIn cases where an irregular shape complicates the application of these standards, the UDO Administrator shall\ndetermine the applicable dimensional, setback, or bulk standards.\nD.\nSeparation\n1.\nLot to Lot\nWhen the provisions of this Ordinance require separation between two or more lots, or a lot and another\nfeature, separation shall be measured by drawing straight lines from the nearest point of one lot line to the\nnearest point of the lot line subject to the separation requirement (see Figure 10.2.2.D: Separation).\n2.\nUse Type to Use Type\nWhen the provisions of this Ordinance require one use type to be separated from another use type,\nseparation shall be measured by drawing straight lines from the nearest point of the wall of the existing or\nproposed principal structure to the nearest point of the wall of the existing or proposed structure subject to\nthe separation requirement.\nFIGURE 10.2.2.D: SEPARATION\nA\nLEGEND\nA\nLot-to-Lot Separation\nB Use Type-to-Use\nType Separation\nB\nLot Line\nCELL (1, 1): \nCamden County\nCELL (1, 2): \n10-5\nCELL (1, 3): \nLast Updated\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nFebruary 4, 2019\n", "page_number": 389, "page_range": [389, 390, 391], "highlight": ["CRC\nCELL (18, 2): \nCoastal Resources Commission\nCELL (19, 1): \nDBH\nCELL (19, 2): \nDiameter at Breast <em>Height</em>", "2): \nRight-of-Way\nCELL (15, 1): \nRR\nCELL (15, 2): \nRural Residential\nCELL (16, 1): \nSF or sf or\nsq. <em>ft</em>", "CELL (16, 2): \nSquare <em>Feet</em>\nCELL (17, 1): \nSFHA\nCELL (17, 2): \nSpecial Flood Hazard Area Overlay District", "VR\nCELL (25, 2): \nVillage Residential\nCELL (26, 1): \nWL\nCELL (26, 2): \nWorking Lands\nCELL (27, 1): \n<em>WPO</em>", "CELL (27, 2): \n<em>Watershed</em> <em>Protection</em> <em>Overlay</em> District\n\nNEW PAGE 391\nARTICLE 151.10 Definitions & Measurement"], "score": 24.63418, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Watershed Protection Overlay\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"WPO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"WPO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"WPO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 93\nCamden County\nUnified Development Ordinance\n3-3\nLast Updated:\nFebruary 4, 2019\nCELL (1, 1): \n3.8.2.\nCELL (1, 2): \nCommercial Fishing Overlay (CFO)\n3-65\nCELL (2, 1): \n3.8.3.\nCELL (2, 2): \nSpecial Flood Hazard Area Overlay (SFHA)\n3-66\nCELL (3, 1): \n3.8.4.\nCELL (3, 2): \nLocal Historic Overlay (LHO)\n3-77\nCELL (4, 1): \n3.8.5.\nCELL (4, 2): \nWatershed Protection Overlay (WPO)\n3-78\n\nNEW PAGE 94\n3.1.

intent of supplementing generally applicable development regulations with additional development\nregulations that address special area-specific conditions, features, or plans while maintaining the character and\npurposes of the underlying zoning district.\nB.\nEstablishment of Overlay Zoning Districts\nTable 3.8.1: Overlay Zoning Districts Established, sets out the overlay districts in this

underlying general zoning district, unless otherwise expressly stated.\n2.\nIf the standards governing an overlay zoning district expressly conflict with those governing an underlying\ngeneral zoning district, the standards governing the overlay district shall control, unless otherwise stated.\n3.\nWhere land is classified into multiple overlay zoning districts and the standards governing one overlay zoning\ndistrict expressly conflict with those governing another overlay district, the more restrictive standard shall\napply.\n3.8.2.\nCOMMERCIAL FISHING OVERLAY (CFO)\nA.\nPurpose and Intent\nThe intent of the Commercial Fishing Overlay (CFO) district is to allow certain commercial fishing uses in the County\nin limited locations and under restrictive circumstances, to ensure that

purpose of home-based commercial fishing are hereby repealed and any lot\nlocated within a commercial fishing overlay district for which a permit was issued shall be considered to have\na\nzoning compliance permit allowing commercial fishing in accordance with this Ordinance.\n3.\nAll lawfully-established home-based commercial fishing uses in operation after February 4, 2019 located on\na lot outside a CFO shall be considered a nonconforming use subject to the standards in Section 8.2.\nNonconforming Uses.\nC.\nMinimum District Size\n1.\nA new CFO district shall consist of an area not less than ten contiguous acres.\n2.\nAdditions to an existing CFO district shall be made in increments of not less than one acre.\nD.\nBuilding Standards\n1.\nWithin one year of the issuance of a zoning
