O&I OFFICE AND INSTITUTION is primarily intended to accommodate the office and\ninstitutional use of land developed in various densities. The principal structure of the\nO&I district is the office and institutional building, including the adaptive reuse of\nformer residential, commercial, and industrial buildings previously existing within\nthe community.\n2. GENERAL BUSINESS DISTRICT is primarily intended to accommodate a wide\nrange of retail, service, and office uses in various density patterns. The district is\ntypically located along through fares in areas which have developed with minimal front\nset back.\n3. THE HIGHWAY BUSINESS DISTRICT is primarily intended to accommodate retail\nservice and distributive uses which are typically located along thoroughfares in\nvarious density patterns. The district is established to provide location for\nestablishments which require high visibility and good road access, or which cater\nprimarily to passing motorists. Development in this district generally has substantial\nfront setbacks.\n4. 1-2 HEAVY INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT is primarily intended to accommodate a wide\nrange of assembling, fabricating and manufacturing activities in a moderate low-\ndensity pattern. The district is established for the purpose of providing appropriate\nlocations of development regulation for uses which may have significant\nenvironmental impacts or require special measures to ensure compatibility with\nadjoining properties.\n5. C-1 COMMERCIAL DISTRICT, the neighborhood business district provides for the\ncommercial use of land in harmony with surrounding residential zoning districts.\nCommercial development should be environmentally and aesthetically compatible\nwith surround residential uses. The requirements for the C-1 zoning district should\nensure harmony with residential uses and not impair existing and/or future residential\n20\n\nNEW PAGE 21\nTown of East Spencer Zoning/Development Ordinance\nEast Spencer - Land Usage\ndevelopment. All establishments developed under the C-1 classification should be\nscaled to meet shopping needs of the immediate area and should not be scaled to\ndetract from high commercial zoning districts.\n6. ED-85 DISTRICT is established to preserve, encourage and enhance the economic\ndevelopment opportunities in areas adjacent and near 1-85 in accordance to the plans\nadopted by the Town of East Spencer. It is recognized that/-85 is uniquely important to the\nfuture of the Town because of the great potential for development of all types that exist\nalong this corridor. Development within this district; shall be of types which maximize the\neconomic benefits to the Town while minimizing the potential impacts.\nThe district is designed to accommodate, as appropriate, uses such as\nmanufacturing, distribution, retail, service industries, corporate parks in a moderate-\nto-moderate high density pattern. Certain individual uses may be allowed as uses by\nright in the districts, while other more intensive uses may require a higher level of\nreview and approval by the Town. The district encourages and allows more creative\ndesign of land development than may be provided on other general zoning district.\nThe \"85\" represents the relationship to 1-85 and \"ED\" represents the economic\ndevelopment designation.\n(B)\nMULTI-FAMILY DISTRICTS\n1. RM-10 RESIDENTIAL MULTI-FAMILY DISTRICT is a moderate district and is\nprimarily intended to accommodate multi-family uses at a maximum overall density of\nten (10) units per acre.\n2. RM-18 RESIDENTIAL MULTI-FAMILY DISTRICT is a moderate district.\nand is primarily intended to accommodate multi-family uses at a maximum overall\ndensity of eighteen (18) units per acre.\n(C)\nSINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS\n1.\nR-1 SINGLE-FAMILY DISTRICT provides for residential use of land in the\nlow-density pattern at four (4) units per acre. The principal structure in the R-1\nzoning district is the single-family detached dwelling.\n2. R-3 SINGLE FAMILY DISTRICT provides for residential use of land in the Medium\nto high density pattern in which the principal use of land is the single-family detached\ndwelling.\n21\n",
