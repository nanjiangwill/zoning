Accessory wind energy conversion systems, small scale, shall be conditional as an accessory use in the residential\nzoning districts (R-1, R-1-U and R-2) as a single system whose main purpose is to supply electricity for on-site consumption. It is\nessential that a site plan must first be submitted in order to determine if a property is eligible for a wind energy conversion system.\nRoof- mounted systems to existing structures or facilities are easier to regulate provided they comply with minimum design\nstandards outlined below. Compliance with applicable standards shall be documented and shown on a site plan and submitted to\nthe Zoning Administrator along with a conditional use permit application for review and approval by the Planning Board and the\nBoard of Adjustment.\n(B) Residential wind energy conversion systems. A conditional use permit application, as well as a site plan, denoting the\ndimensions of the subject property for a proposed small scale wind energy conversion system located at a residence must meet the\nfollowing standards as an accessory use: roof-mounted wind energy conversion systems shall meet the following location\nstandards.\n(1) Roof-mounted accessory wind energy conversion systems shall not extend above the ridge-cap of the roof or exceed the\n35 feet height restrictions of this chapter.\n(2) The wind energy conversion system and mounting devices for roof-mounted systems shall not extend beyond the exterior\nperimeter of the roof of the building on which the system is mounted or built.\n(3) Roof-mounted systems shall be located so as not to impede the ability of emergency personnel to access the roof for\nfirefighting purposes.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 315)\n\u00a7 152.056 ACCESSORY WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEMS, UTILITY SCALE.\n(A) Accessory wind energy conversion systems, utility scale, shall be conditional as an accessory use in the Medical\nEducational Zoning District (M-E) for the purpose of on-site consumption in addition to the resale of energy back to the grid. The M-\nE Zoning District has large enough parcels to accommodate this type of system with minimal impact to neighboring properties.\nThese systems require an environmental assessment by a professional engineer, licensed in the state. The environmental\nassessment shall be submitted along with a conditional use permit to the Zoning Administrator for review by the Planning Board\nand the Board of Adjustment.\n(B) All wind energy conversion systems shall be located within a protected \"fall zone\". The fall zone shall not have any other\nstructures located within the clearly defined area and the system shall be indicated on the site plan, with distances from the\nproposed site improvements to all property lines. The setbacks in this chapter are in addition to the fall zone calculation.\n(C) Acceptable decibels (at the property line) should be no greater than 40dB.\n(D) Clear cutting of property in order to install an accessory wind energy conversion system shall not be allowed without special\npermission from the town's Planning Board and Board of Adjustment.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 315)\n\u00a7 152.057 COMPLETION AND DECOMMISSIONING\nEach accessory wind energy conversion system project must be completed within 18 months. Should delays occur, the Zoning\nAdministrator must approve an extension at six-month intervals. Should a project cease operation as an ongoing business entity,\nthe site must be restored to the original agricultural natural state. A plan must be filed with the Zoning Administrator within 180 days\nafter cessation, outlining how the structure will be removed, the timeframe in which the work will be done and the plan to return the\nproperty to its pre-existing state. A date for final removal must be given and approved by the Zoning Administrator in the plan.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 315)\nPARKING AND LOADING REGULATIONS\n\u00a7 152.070 PARKING AND LOADING REGULATIONS.\nIt is the intent of these regulations that adequate parking and loading facilities shall be provided on private property in order to\npromote the public safety, to lessen congestion in the public streets, and to help make possible the full use of existing streets for\ntraffic movement. Parking lots shall not be focal points for development. Parking and site circulation should be created behind\nbuildings. To achieve these purposes, it is further intended that upon the erection of any building or the use of any lot, there shall\nbe provided on the lot not less than the minimum space required herein. Compliance with these requirements shall be a continuing\nresponsibility.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 400)\n\u00a7 152.071 OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIRED.\n\nNEW PAGE 56\nOff-street automobile storage or parking space shall be provided on every lot on which any of the following uses are hereinafter\nestablished; exception may be made within the C-1 Central Business District when evidence is provided by the applicant that\nadequate on-street or public parking is available.

All parking spaces required in this chapter shall be setback at least five feet from any adjacent street\nright-of-way, and at least eight feet from the edge of the street when no right-of-way exists beyond the street. In no case shall the\nlocation of parking spaces obstruct the visibility of a sight triangle, nor shall they be allowed within any setback area unless granted\na variance by the Board of Adjustment.\n(2) Parking location in the Heritage District Overlay. Parking spaces shall be located to the side and/or rear of the associated\nbuildings they serve. Parking lots that serve as the principal use of a lot shall be exempt from this requirement; however, parking\nspaces should be setback a minimum of 15 feet so as not to be a dominant feature of the streetscape.\n(E) Designation of parking spaces. All parking spaces required in this chapter shall be marked or designated by painted lines or\nan equivalent in a paved parking lot, and by some permanent, fixed markers in unpaved lots.\n(F) Shared parking.\n(1) The owner or agent of a land use which requires off-street parking spaces in accordance with this section may be\npermitted to provide a portion of the required parking at an off-premises location (shared parking); provided, the owner or agent\ncan meet the following requirements.\n(a) In the C-2, C-1P and M-U Zoning Districts and where a mix of uses are incorporated into a minimum five-acre site, the\nrequired parking may be reduced by a maximum of 25% in recognition of shared parking that occurs in mixed use developments\nand then only on the approval of a conditional use permit.\n(b) All shared parking spaces shall be located within 400 feet of a public entrance of the principal structure incorporating the\nuse associated with the required parking, or within 400 feet of the lot on which the use associated with such parking is located if the\nuse is not within a principal building.\n(c) The shared area shall be located in a commercial zoning district.\n(d) The owner or agent requesting use of the shared parking provision shall provide written evidence that permission was\ngranted by the owner of the land to be used for shared parking. The written evidence shall specify the number of spaces provided\nin the shared parking area, and that the parking area meets the provisions of this chapter.\n(e) The owner or agent requesting the use of shared parking shall sign a statement accompanying the certificate of\ncompliance that the validity of the certificate is contingent upon the provision of the requisite number of parking spaces. Reduction\nof the number of required parking spaces or other violations of this section shall result in the revocation of the certificate of\ncompliance.\n(f) The shared parking area shall be identified with one sign that shall not exceed four square feet in area and four feet in\nheight.\n(2) In the C-2, C-1P and M-1 Zoning Districts and where a mix of uses are incorporated into a minimum of five feet from\nadjacent street right-of-way, and at least eight feet from the edge of the street when no right-of-way exists beyond the street. In no\ncase shall the location of parking spaces obstruct the visibility of a sight triangle.\n(G) Handicapped parking requirements. For all new and expanding developments which require new parking facilities,\nhandicapped parking shall be provided in accordance with requirements of the state's Building Code Volume I-C, as revised.\n(H) Driveways.\n(1) Driveways serving multi-family, commercial or industrial development shall be permitted in accordance with the standards\nof the state's Department of Transportation; provided, however, a commercial or industrial development shall be limited to no more\nthan two driveways on any one road and no more than three driveways total. Additional driveways may be permitted when\nreviewed by the Administrator and deemed that they are necessary to improve traffic movement, increase sight distances or for\nother safety reasons.\n(2) Developments shall share driveways with adjoining developments where possible. In addition, adjoining uses shall provide\nsafe and efficient access to neighboring parking areas so vehicular traffic and pedestrians can move directly to the adjoining use\nwithout first returning to the public right-of-way or street. Driveways as a means of the only ingress and egress shall be allowed in\nthe setback areas as determined in \u00a7 152.028 of this chapter.\n(I) Visibility at intersections. On a corner lot in any zoning district, no planting, structures, sign, fence, wall or obstruction to\nvision more than two and one-half feet in height measured from the centerline of the street shall be placed or maintained within the\ntriangular area formed by the intersecting street right-of-way lines and a straight line connecting points on said street right-of-way.\nThe sight triangle, as required by the state's Department of Transportation, is illustrated below; however, this sight triangle may be\nvaried by the Administrator on town and private streets as deemed necessary:\n(J) Parking of tractor trailers or semi-trailers for storage.

For the purpose of this chapter, the town and its extraterritorial jurisdiction is hereby divided into the following\ndesignated districts:\n(1) R-1, Low-Density Residential District;\n(2) R-1-U, Single-Family Residential District;\n(3) R-2, General Residential District;\n(4) C-1, Central Business District;\n(5) C-1P, Central Business District with Parking;\n(6) HDO, Heritage District Overlay;\n(7) C-2, General Business District;\n(8) RC, Resort Commercial District;\n(9) G-O, Governmental-Office District;\n(10) M-E, Medical Educational District;\n(11) M-1, Industrial District;\n(12) M-U, Mixed Use District;\n(13) CUD, Conditional Use District; and\n(14) CZD, Civic Zoning District.\n(B) District boundaries. The boundaries of the district enumerated in $152.026 of this chapter are hereby established as shown\non the map entitled \"Official Zoning Map, Town of Banner Elk, North Carolina, and the Area Comprising Its Extraterritorial\nJurisdiction\" adopted by the Town Council and certified by the Town Clerk. Said map and all explanatory matter thereon\naccompanies and is hereby, made a part of this chapter as if fully written herein. Said map shall be retained in the office of the\nTown Clerk and also shall be recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds of the county.\n(C) Interpretation of district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts\nas shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply.\n(1) Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways, streams or rivers,\nstreet right-of-way lines or such lines extended, such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.\n(2) Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be\nsaid boundaries.\n(3) Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets or highways, or\nrights-of-ways of same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance there from as\nindicated on the zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on said\nzoning map.\n(4) Where a district boundary line divides a lot of single ownership, the district requirements for the least restricted portion of\nsuch lot shall be deemed to apply to the whole thereof; provided that, such extensions shall not include any part of such a lot more\nthan 35 feet beyond the district boundary line.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 306)\n\u00a7 152.027 INTENT.\n(A) General. It is the intent of this subchapter that if any use or class of use is not specifically permitted in a district as set forth in\nthe sections below, it shall be prohibited in that district unless similar uses are described in the ordinance. Should an applicant\npetition the town for approval of a use not covered specifically in this chapter, the application may be considered as a conditional\nuse. Factors to be considered to determine if the use is in harmony with the keeping of the public health, safety and welfare of the\ncitizens of the town are the impacts of anticipated amounts of traffic, noise, light, density, vibration, odor and the bearing these may\nhave on adjoining neighbors and the community. The Town Council specifically finds that industrial uses of property, such as\nmanufacturing and other heavy industry, are incompatible with the quiet and peaceful mountain resort and retirement community\nenjoyed by the citizens. The Town Council further finds that high impact uses of property, including, but not limited to, racetracks,\nshooting ranges and other noise emitting activities, are incompatible with the quiet and peaceful community expected and enjoyed\nby the citizens of the town.\n(B) R-1, Low-Density Residential District. The R-1 Low-Density Residential District is established as a district in which the\nprincipal use of land is for single-family dwellings on large parcels of land. It is the intention of these regulations to provide for\nlimited residential development in areas where police and fire protection, protection against flooding by storm water and dangers\nfrom excessive erosion are not possible without excessive costs to the community. It is also the intent to maintain and preserve a\n\nNEW PAGE 18\ntranquil residential community with the flexibility to accommodate conditional uses compatible with residential use.\n(C) R-1-U, Single-Family Residential District. The R-1-U District is established for developments where the existing pattern of\ndevelopment has been established by a subdivision intended and used principally for single-family dwellings on traditional lots. The\nmore defined urban pattern offers limited use for optional non-residential development and provides justification for a more\nrestrictive residential zone.\n(D) R-2, General Residential District. The R-2 General Residential District is established as a district in which the principal use of\nland is for residential purposes.\n(E) C-1, Central Business District. In order to protect and improve the main shopping area in the town and to discourage uses\nwhich do not require a central location which are not compatible with the function of the area as the primary shopping and office\narea, a Central Business District is hereby established.\n(F) C-2, General Business District. The purpose of this district is to provide for general and commercial activity along major\nthoroughfares and at other convenient points in the area. Regulations are designed to preserve the traffic carrying capacity of the\nstreets and to provide for off-street parking. It is not the intent of this district to encourage extensive strip commercial development,\nrather to provide concentrations of general commercial activities.\n(G) M-E, Medical Educational District. The district is established to provide for the specific circumstances and needs of the\nmedical and educational institutions within the town's jurisdiction. The uses permitted within this district shall be limited to those of a\nmedical and educational nature, and closely related uses supportive of medical and educational institutions.\n(H) C-1P, Central Business District with Parking. The Central Business District with Parking is created to provide an expanded\ncentral commercial area that will maintain the character of the existing C-1 District, but will require that all uses in the district\nconform to the off-street parking requirements of this chapter.\n(I) RC, Resort Commercial District. The Resort Commercial District is established to provide specific areas within the town\njurisdiction where specific and limited resort activities can be developed in a more rural setting. The district will have conditions and\nstandards for uses in the district that will provide protection for any adjacent residential areas while providing a more rural, rustic\nsetting for resort commercial activities.\n(J) M-1, Industrial District. This district is established to provide areas for manufacturing, warehousing and similar uses.\n(K) G-O, Governmental-Office District. The Governmental-Office District includes property owned by governmental entities, such\nas, but not limited to, the town and county and their respective subdivisions. It includes the Town Maintenance Facility; the Tate-\nEvans Park; the Banner Elk Daycare Facility; the Wastewater Treatment Plant; Town Hall; the Police Department; the Banner Elk\nVolunteer Fire Department; professional offices; and any other such properties which may heretofore be designated for similar\nuses.\n(L) Heritage District Overlay. (Boundary descriptions established on 2-7-2005.) The purpose of the Heritage District Overlay is to\nprotect, preserve and encourage the architectural, cultural, village atmosphere and historical significance of the downtown core of\nthe town. Its boundaries shall be defined as established on the official zoning map of the town. As an overlay district, the permitted\nand special uses, as well as dimensional requirements, shall conform to those of the underlying, except where additional\nrequirements are noted herein.\n(M) Mixed Use District. This district is designed to encourage integration of mixed land uses (residential and commercial) to\npromote high density, low impact development of communities with alternatives modes of transportation, such as walking and\nbiking. The commercial and residential uses should compliment each other. The district is intended to promote nodal development\nas opposed to strip development and can be located away from main thoroughfares, if the Town Council agrees that the location is\nconsistent with the vision for the town.\n(N) CUD, Conditional Use District. This district is designed to allow a zoning district with no permitted uses at all; all\ndevelopment is subject to acquiring a special use permit. This can only be established at the property owner's request. The\nlegislative rezoning to apply the CUD is generally done concurrently with the quasi-judicial issuance of a SUP by the Board of\nAdjustment.\n(O) Civic Zoning District. The Civic Zoning District is established to enable property owned by governmental entities, including\nthe town, to operate in a way that is beneficial to the residents of the town and protects the historical integrity of the property while\nsupporting the maintenance of the property. This district is to focus on permissible uses that are compatible with the community\nwith some that are within the broad definition of \"civic use\".

For the purpose of this chapter, the town and its extraterritorial jurisdiction is hereby divided into the following\ndesignated districts:\n(1) R-1, Low-Density Residential District;\n(2) R-1-U, Single-Family Residential District;\n(3) R-2, General Residential District;\n(4) C-1, Central Business District;\n(5) C-1P, Central Business District with Parking;\n(6) HDO, Heritage District Overlay;\n(7) C-2, General Business District;\n(8) RC, Resort Commercial District;\n(9) G-O, Governmental-Office District;\n(10) M-E, Medical Educational District;\n(11) M-1, Industrial District;\n(12) M-U, Mixed Use District;\n(13) CUD, Conditional Use District; and\n(14) CZD, Civic Zoning District.\n(B) District boundaries. The boundaries of the district enumerated in $152.026 of this chapter are hereby established as shown\non the map entitled \"Official Zoning Map, Town of Banner Elk, North Carolina, and the Area Comprising Its Extraterritorial\nJurisdiction\" adopted by the Town Council and certified by the Town Clerk. Said map and all explanatory matter thereon\naccompanies and is hereby, made a part of this chapter as if fully written herein. Said map shall be retained in the office of the\nTown Clerk and also shall be recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds of the county.\n(C) Interpretation of district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts\nas shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply.\n(1) Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways, streams or rivers,\nstreet right-of-way lines or such lines extended, such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.\n(2) Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be\nsaid boundaries.\n(3) Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets or highways, or\nrights-of-ways of same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance there from as\nindicated on the zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on said\nzoning map.\n(4) Where a district boundary line divides a lot of single ownership, the district requirements for the least restricted portion of\nsuch lot shall be deemed to apply to the whole thereof; provided that, such extensions shall not include any part of such a lot more\nthan 35 feet beyond the district boundary line.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 306)\n\u00a7 152.027 INTENT.\n(A) General. It is the intent of this subchapter that if any use or class of use is not specifically permitted in a district as set forth in\nthe sections below, it shall be prohibited in that district unless similar uses are described in the ordinance. Should an applicant\npetition the town for approval of a use not covered specifically in this chapter, the application may be considered as a conditional\nuse. Factors to be considered to determine if the use is in harmony with the keeping of the public health, safety and welfare of the\ncitizens of the town are the impacts of anticipated amounts of traffic, noise, light, density, vibration, odor and the bearing these may\nhave on adjoining neighbors and the community. The Town Council specifically finds that industrial uses of property, such as\nmanufacturing and other heavy industry, are incompatible with the quiet and peaceful mountain resort and retirement community\nenjoyed by the citizens. The Town Council further finds that high impact uses of property, including, but not limited to, racetracks,\nshooting ranges and other noise emitting activities, are incompatible with the quiet and peaceful community expected and enjoyed\nby the citizens of the town.\n(B) R-1, Low-Density Residential District. The R-1 Low-Density Residential District is established as a district in which the\nprincipal use of land is for single-family dwellings on large parcels of land. It is the intention of these regulations to provide for\nlimited residential development in areas where police and fire protection, protection against flooding by storm water and dangers\nfrom excessive erosion are not possible without excessive costs to the community. It is also the intent to maintain and preserve a\n\nNEW PAGE 18\ntranquil residential community with the flexibility to accommodate conditional uses compatible with residential use.\n(C) R-1-U, Single-Family Residential District. The R-1-U District is established for developments where the existing pattern of\ndevelopment has been established by a subdivision intended and used principally for single-family dwellings on traditional lots. The\nmore defined urban pattern offers limited use for optional non-residential development and provides justification for a more\nrestrictive residential zone.\n(D) R-2, General Residential District. The R-2 General Residential District is established as a district in which the principal use of\nland is for residential purposes.\n(E) C-1, Central Business District. In order to protect and improve the main shopping area in the town and to discourage uses\nwhich do not require a central location which are not compatible with the function of the area as the primary shopping and office\narea, a Central Business District is hereby established.\n(F) C-2, General Business District. The purpose of this district is to provide for general and commercial activity along major\nthoroughfares and at other convenient points in the area. Regulations are designed to preserve the traffic carrying capacity of the\nstreets and to provide for off-street parking. It is not the intent of this district to encourage extensive strip commercial development,\nrather to provide concentrations of general commercial activities.\n(G) M-E, Medical Educational District. The district is established to provide for the specific circumstances and needs of the\nmedical and educational institutions within the town's jurisdiction. The uses permitted within this district shall be limited to those of a\nmedical and educational nature, and closely related uses supportive of medical and educational institutions.\n(H) C-1P, Central Business District with Parking. The Central Business District with Parking is created to provide an expanded\ncentral commercial area that will maintain the character of the existing C-1 District, but will require that all uses in the district\nconform to the off-street parking requirements of this chapter.\n(I) RC, Resort Commercial District. The Resort Commercial District is established to provide specific areas within the town\njurisdiction where specific and limited resort activities can be developed in a more rural setting. The district will have conditions and\nstandards for uses in the district that will provide protection for any adjacent residential areas while providing a more rural, rustic\nsetting for resort commercial activities.\n(J) M-1, Industrial District. This district is established to provide areas for manufacturing, warehousing and similar uses.\n(K) G-O, Governmental-Office District. The Governmental-Office District includes property owned by governmental entities, such\nas, but not limited to, the town and county and their respective subdivisions. It includes the Town Maintenance Facility; the Tate-\nEvans Park; the Banner Elk Daycare Facility; the Wastewater Treatment Plant; Town Hall; the Police Department; the Banner Elk\nVolunteer Fire Department; professional offices; and any other such properties which may heretofore be designated for similar\nuses.\n(L) Heritage District Overlay. (Boundary descriptions established on 2-7-2005.) The purpose of the Heritage District Overlay is to\nprotect, preserve and encourage the architectural, cultural, village atmosphere and historical significance of the downtown core of\nthe town. Its boundaries shall be defined as established on the official zoning map of the town. As an overlay district, the permitted\nand special uses, as well as dimensional requirements, shall conform to those of the underlying, except where additional\nrequirements are noted herein.\n(M) Mixed Use District. This district is designed to encourage integration of mixed land uses (residential and commercial) to\npromote high density, low impact development of communities with alternatives modes of transportation, such as walking and\nbiking. The commercial and residential uses should compliment each other. The district is intended to promote nodal development\nas opposed to strip development and can be located away from main thoroughfares, if the Town Council agrees that the location is\nconsistent with the vision for the town.\n(N) CUD, Conditional Use District. This district is designed to allow a zoning district with no permitted uses at all; all\ndevelopment is subject to acquiring a special use permit. This can only be established at the property owner's request. The\nlegislative rezoning to apply the CUD is generally done concurrently with the quasi-judicial issuance of a SUP by the Board of\nAdjustment.\n(O) Civic Zoning District. The Civic Zoning District is established to enable property owned by governmental entities, including\nthe town, to operate in a way that is beneficial to the residents of the town and protects the historical integrity of the property while\nsupporting the maintenance of the property. This district is to focus on permissible uses that are compatible with the community\nwith some that are within the broad definition of \"civic use\". This district encourages the consolidation of civic and other public and\ninstitutional uses into a single centralized area convenient to town employees, residents and visitors. Educational, cultural, museum\nand fine arts and low impact business uses are predominate.\n(P) Wellhead Protection Overlay District.
