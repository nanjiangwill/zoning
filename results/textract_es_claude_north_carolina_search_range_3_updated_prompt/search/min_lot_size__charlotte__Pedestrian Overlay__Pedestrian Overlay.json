The first floor of all buildings must be designed to encourage\nand complement pedestrian-scale interest and activity.\n(b)\n10 - 92\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \n(1)\nThe first floor of all buildings fronting a public street must be\ndesigned and/or used for active uses. These uses must include\ntransparent windows and doors arranged SO that the uses are visible\nfrom and/or accessible to the street on at least 50% of the length of\nthe first floor building elevation along the first floor street\nfrontage.\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \n(2)\nExpanses of blank walls may not exceed 20 feet in length. A blank\nwall is a facade that does not add to the character of the streetscape\nand does not contain transparent windows or doors or sufficient\nornamentation, decoration or articulation.\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nWhen this approach is not feasible architectural elements must be\nused on the building facade at street level. Elements may include,\nbut are not limited to: molding; string courses; belt courses;\nchanges in material or color; architectural lighting; works of art;\ndisplay areas, porches, or stoops.\nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \n(3)\nVentilation grates or emergency exit doors located at the first floor\nlevel in the building facade oriented to any public street must be\ndecorative.\nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nStreet walls across from or next to single family. For buildings across\nfrom single family zoning or abutting single family zoning on the same\nside of the street the following standards shall be met:\nCELL (6, 1): \nCELL (6, 2): \n(1)\nRoof line variation every 30 feet is required. This can be\naccomplished by using vertical offset in ridge lines, gables,\ncornices, dormers, roof top patios, material changes, and/or other\narchitectural features such as trellises, portals or porches.\n\nNEW PAGE 456\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 8: PEDESTRIAN OVERLAY DISTRICT\n(2)\nPorches, if provided, shall be at least 6 feet in depth. A porch is\ndefined as a covered platform, usually having a separate roof, at an\nentrance to a building.\n(3)\nEntrances that face the street for ground floor units shall be\nprovided. No more than four ground floor units shall be allowed to\nutilize the same entrance.\n(4)\nFa\u00e7ade variations shall be provided that visually separate\nindividual units. This can be accomplished through measures such\nas window arrangement and size variation, unit entrance design,\nroof variation, material changes, and/or offset wall planes.\n(c)\nStructured Parking Facilities. Structured parking facilities must be\ndesigned to encourage and complement pedestrian scale interest and\nactivity.\n(1)\nThe first floor of structured parking facilities fronting a public\nstreet Class III (major arterial), Class III-C (commercial arterial),\nClass IV (minor arterial), and a non-residential Class V (collector\nstreet) must be designed and/or used for active uses. These uses\nmust include transparent windows and doors arranged SO that the\nuses are visible from and/or accessible to the street on at least 50%\nof the length of the first floor building elevation along the first\nfloor street frontage.\n(2)\nStructured parking facilities must be designed SO that the only\nopenings at the street level are those to accommodate vehicular\nentrances and pedestrian access to the structure. In the event that\nany openings for ventilation, service, or emergency access are\nlocated at the first floor level in the building fa\u00e7ade, they must be\ndecorative and must be an integral part of the overall building\ndesign. These openings, as well as pedestrian and vehicular\nentrances, must be designed SO that cars parked inside are not\nvisible from the street.\n(3)\nThe first floor of structured parking facilities fronting a Class VI\n(local street), or residential Class V (collector street) must either be\navailable for commercial or residential space or have an\narchitecturally articulated fa\u00e7ade designed to screen the parking\nareas of the structure and to encourage pedestrian scale activity.\n(Petition No. 2012-054, \u00a7 10.813(c)(1), (2), (3), 07/16/2012)\n(4)\nCars on all levels of a
