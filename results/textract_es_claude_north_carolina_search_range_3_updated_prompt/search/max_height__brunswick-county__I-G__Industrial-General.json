RU-I: Industrial-Rural\n1. This District is intended to accommodate uses on lands which have not been in productive agricultural or farm use in the previous five year\nperiod. Also, this District is intended to be applied only on lands not anticipated to become urban or suburban by the Land Use Plan, and\nwhich are not wetlands or environmentally sensitive lands. This District is intended to provide areas for uses of open air or extensive rather\nthan intensive character such as:\ni. Agricultural industry;\nii.\nRepositories for waste products whose composition and features require they be removed from other Zoning Districts;\niii.\nChemical extraction or energy generation from crops or woods or the wastes of same, or conversion of crops, woods, and animals to\nvarious products of use to society; and\niv. Animal slaughtering and processing operations and even incineration of animal remains.\n2. This District is intended to be used in an extremely limited manner sufficient only to meet proven needs for such generally adverse uses.\n3. Such land uses require restriction of other uses such as residential, institutional, commercial, and manufacturing where there are\nconcentrations of persons likely at any given time.\nCommentary: The Sunny Point Military Ocean Terminal's buffer zone is an illustration of how man would be expected to be limited in\naccessibility or closeness to uses in this District.\nB.

CP - Conservation and Protection\nA. Intent\nThe Conservation and Protection District (CP) is intended to be used for the permanent protection and preservation of environmentally sensitive\nlands, and historical, cultural, and archeological areas of Brunswick County. Generally, activities within a CP district are limited to very low\nintensity uses, agricultural and silvicultural activities, parks, open space and natural habitat preservation, and very limited residential uses.\nConstruction and land disturbing activities should be limited in nature and scope and should have a very low impact on the environment and the\nsurrounding setting. Public or community water or wastewater facilities are generally discouraged in order to deter development pressure.\nB. Permitted Uses\nOnly uses specifically listed in the use table in Section 5.2 as a permitted use (\"P\"), permitted subject to limited use standards (\"L\"), or permitted\nsubject to special use permit (\"SUP\") shall be allowed in a CP District.\nC. Standards\n1. Applicability\ni. The following standards shall apply to all development within a CP district with the exception of bona fide farms. However, bona fide\nfarms are encouraged to comply with these requirements to the extent possible to ensure that impacts on the land and the surrounding\nenvironment are minimal.\nii. In addition to the standards contained in this Section. All other provisions in this Ordinance and all other applicable laws shall apply,\nexcept those that are incompatible with the provisions contained herein.\n2. Dimensional Standards\nProjects shall meet the following standards.\nNotes:\n1\nAdditional Building Height above 40 feet up to a maximum height of 75 feet is allowed at the following rates:\nNon-Viewshed Protection Overlay areas at a rate of one additional foot of height for every one foot of additional yard depth (front, rear,\nand sides);\nViewshed Protection Overlay (see Section 4.12.6.) areas at a rate of one additional foot of height for every two feet of additional yard\ndepth (front, rear, and sides).\nNorth Carolina Building Codes apply.\n3. Development Standards\nIn order to reduce the impact of development on the existing natural environment, the following standards apply to all land disturbing\nactivities within a CP district:\ni. With the exception of a pedestrian trail or a fence, no land disturbing activities may occur within a required yard or within 100 feet of:\n(a) All lands located within a 100-year floodway;\n(b) All site area under the jurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) or the North Carolina Department of Natural\nResources, Division of Water Quality (DWQ);\n(c) All lands located within a CAMA shoreline buffer;\n55 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\nCELL (1, 1): \nMinimum Lot\nArea\nCELL (1, 2): \nMinimum Lot\nWidth\nCELL (1, 3): \nMinimum\nFront Yard\nCELL (1, 4): \nMinimum\nSide Yard\nCELL (1, 5): \nMinimum\nRear Yard\nCELL (1, 6): \nMaximum\nHeight\nCELL (2, 1): \n5 Acres\nCELL (2, 2): \n300 feet\nCELL (2, 3): \n50 feet\nCELL (2, 4): \n100 feet\nCELL (2, 5): \n50 feet\nCELL (2, 6): \n40\n\nNEW PAGE 56\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(d) All lands located below the high water line of an existing pond, lake, or stream; and\n(e) All lands with slopes steeper than 25%.\nii. The requirement for mandatory connection to public water and sewer facilities (see Brunswick County Water and Sewer Use Policy) shall\nbe waived.\n4. Development Guidelines\nIn order to reduce the impact of development on the existing natural environment, the following guidelines apply to all activities within a CP\ndistrict. As guidelines, they provide an increased degree of flexibility.\ni. If development is anticipated to occur, the plan for such development should prioritize the preservation of natural habitat and sensitive\nenvironmental features such as large stands of trees, wetlands, Carolina Bays, pocosins, watercourses, marshes, and tidal areas.\nii. The use of Low Impact Design, stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) and other alternative construction principles is strongly\nencouraged.\niii. All site clearing and preparation, and construction activities should avoid removing existing trees and disturbing existing vegetation to\nthe extent possible.\niv. Although fencing is allowed, such fencing should be designed to allow for easy movement of wildlife. If more impervious fencing is\ndesired, it is recommended that such fencing be limited to the areas around inhabited or occupied structures so that remaining portions\nof the property allow easy movement of wildlife.\n(Ord. No. UDO-19-02, \u00a7 11, 9-19-19)\n4.7.2. MI - Military Installation\nA. Intent\n1. The purpose of the Military Installation District (MI) is to recognize the location of major single use and multiple use military facilities in\nBrunswick County.\n2. While federal government areas are not subject to local zoning and other codes, they occupy large land areas in the County. These areas\ntherefore are identified on the zoning map as a Special Purpose District to differentiate them from other areas that are covered by the\nregulations in this Ordinance.\n3. The main objective of this District is to identify specific resources not otherwise identified where protection can be considered in the public's\ninterest; identify interests relating to land use planning that impact County policy on industry, the environment and residential land uses in\ngeneral; minimize substantial development impacts of these facilities; and develop a coordinated, planning/zoning process to include all\nfederal entities.\nB. Permitted Principal Uses and Structures\nThe uses specified as permitted uses include any uses authorized by, and located in, official Military Installations of the U.S. Government.\nC. Development Coordination Required/Encouraged\n1. Notification Required\nWhen an ordinance amendment or modification would result in a rezoning or change or affect the list of permitted uses within five miles of a\nmilitary base, comments and analysis of the base commander shall be included in the consideration before making a final determination\n(N.C.G.S. 160D-601). Mailed notification shall be provided prior to any such action as specified in Section 9.1.B.3.iv.\n2. Coordination Encouraged\nIn areas of MI Districts not affected by military security in areas where commercial, residential, or mixed use developments are proposed,\nand in areas where joint public/private development may be explored, the federal government and Brunswick County is encouraged to\nestablish a coordinated planning process to achieve both federal and local benefits, to minimize development impacts, and to help meet the\nobjectives and policies of the Land Use Plan of Brunswick County\nOrd.

Overlays are zoning districts which are applied only in conjunction with a Base Zoning District, and may grant additional use and development\nrequirements upon the underlying Base Zoning Districts. The effect is to have both the Overlay and the underlying Base Zoning District\nstandards control the use and development of land placed into any Overlay.\nCommentary: Some overlays provide additional restrictions on top of the underlying base district standards, while others may provide relief\n56 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n", "page_number": 54, "page_range": [54, 55, 56], "highlight": ["2\nStructures exceeding 30 <em>feet</em> or three <em>stories</em> in <em>height</em> shall provide at least three means of fire", "Structures above 75 <em>feet</em> subject to Fire Marshal approval.\n3\nAdditional Building <em>Height</em> above the maximum", "In the <em>I</em>-<em>G</em> District\nIf the Zoning Administrator finds that the CAMA Land Use Plan identifies hazardous", "Notes:\n1\nAdditional Building <em>Height</em> above 40 <em>feet</em> up to a <em>maximum</em> <em>height</em> of 75 <em>feet</em> is allowed at the", "<em>Height</em>\nCELL (2, 1): \n5 Acres\nCELL (2, 2): \n300 <em>feet</em>\nCELL (2, 3): \n50 <em>feet</em>\nCELL (2, 4): \n100 <em>feet</em>\nCELL"], "score": 17.220785, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Industrial-General\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"I-G\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"IG\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"I-G\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 51\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nNotes:\n1\nIn cases where a Street Side Yard is required, the minimum interior side yard is equal to the One Yard dimension.\n2 Structures exceeding 30 feet or three stories in height shall provide at least three means of fire apparatus access.

RU-I: Industrial-Rural\n1. This District is intended to accommodate uses on lands which have not been in productive agricultural or farm use in the previous five year\nperiod. Also, this District is intended to be applied only on lands not anticipated to become urban or suburban by the Land Use Plan, and\nwhich are not wetlands or environmentally sensitive lands. This District is intended to provide areas for uses of open air or extensive rather\nthan intensive character such as:\ni. Agricultural industry;\nii.\nRepositories for waste products whose composition and features require they be removed from other Zoning Districts;\niii.\nChemical extraction or energy generation from crops or woods or the wastes of same, or conversion of crops, woods, and animals to\nvarious products of use to society; and\niv. Animal slaughtering and processing operations and even incineration of animal remains.\n2. This District is intended to be used in an extremely limited manner sufficient only to meet proven needs for such generally adverse uses.\n3. Such land uses require restriction of other uses such as residential, institutional, commercial, and manufacturing where there are\nconcentrations of persons likely at any given time.\nCommentary: The Sunny Point Military Ocean Terminal's buffer zone is an illustration of how man would be expected to be limited in\naccessibility or closeness to uses in this District.\nB. I-G: Industrial-General\nThe I-G District is intended to provide locations for enterprises engaged in a broad range of manufacturing, processing, creating, repairing,\nrenovating, painting, cleaning, or assembly of goods, merchandise or equipment. Lands in this District are to be located on or near Major\nThoroughfares as identified in the Brunswick County Comprehensive Transportation Plan; to rail service; and to in-place infrastructure such as\nwater, sewer, and/or natural gas.\n(Ord.
