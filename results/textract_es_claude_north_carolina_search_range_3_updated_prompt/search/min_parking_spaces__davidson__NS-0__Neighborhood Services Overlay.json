It is the purpose\nof this section to allow such uses by establishing standards that\nmitigate the impacts of their design or operation. The specified\nstandards are intended to ensure that these uses fit the vision of\nthe planning areas in which they are permitted, and that these\nuses are compatible with other development permitted within\nthe planning area.\n3.1.1\nUSES PERMITTED WITH ADDITIONAL STANDARDS\nA. Uses listed in the Permitted Uses Tables in Section\n2 as Uses Permitted with Additional Requirements\n(AR) shall comply with the additional criteria set\nforth in this section for such uses in addition to\nother applicable criteria contained in this ordinance.\nSuch uses are permitted by-right provided they\nmeet the specific additional standards set forth in\nthis section.\nB.

Separation Requirements\n1. Separation requirements are included in this chapter for certain uses which, by\ntheir nature, tend to have a blighting effect upon surrounding properties when\nthey are permitted to cluster in groups of more than one such use, or when they\nare located too near adjacent sensitive uses.\n2. When separation requirements are established, the distance specified shall be\nmeasured as a straight line on a map, not street distance.\n3.\nWhen separation requirements are established from specific uses, the distance\nspecified shall be enforced from any buildings used for the purpose identified\nand any off-street parking areas associated with such uses.\n4. Any use lawfully operating as a conforming use shall not be rendered\nnonconforming by the subsequent location of a different use from which a\nseparation requirement is established in this chapter.\nB. Conflict with Other Regulations: If there is a conflict between the standards\nset forth in this chapter and any other requirements of this ordinance, the most\nrestrictive standard shall control, except that in the event of any inconsistency\nbetween this chapter and the use listings found in Section 2, then Section 2 shall\ncontrol.\nC.
