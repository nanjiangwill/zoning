Additional development\nrequirements for the BP district are specified below:\n(a)\nMinimum required open space. At least 20 percent of every project in the\nbusiness park district must be devoted to permanent open space. This area\nmust be used for landscaping, lawns, screening, or buffer areas. It may\nnot contain any parking or loading areas, outdoor storage, trash handling,\nor utility or service areas. The area devoted to the minimum project edge\nrequirement may be counted toward this requirement.\n(b)\nUtility lines underground. All utility lines such as electric, telephone,\nCATV, or other similar lines must be installed underground, unless the\nfollowing criteria are met:\n(i)\nThe power lines existed above ground at the time of first approval\nof a plat or development plan by the local government, whether or\nnot the power lines are subsequently relocated during construction\nof the subdivision or development plan.\n(ii)\nThe power lines are located outside the boundaries of the parcel of\nland that contains the subdivision or property covered by the\ndevelopment plan.\nThis requirement applies to lines serving individual sites as well as to\nsecurity and street lighting within the project. However, distribution lines\nwhich serve the entire site may be located above ground. All utility boxes,\ntransformers, meters, and similar structures must be screened from public\nview.\n(c)\nOutdoor storage is permitted. Outdoor storage is permitted as an\naccessory use on any individual lot. Any such storage must be completely\nscreened from adjoining development within and without the site as well\nas from the general public. The screening must be effective at the time\nthat it is installed, even if plant materials are used for all or part of the\nscreening. Access through the screening for vehicles is permitted, but is\nlimited to one 30-foot wide location per-street frontage. All setbacks and\nyards must be observed for outside storage areas. In no case may the\namount of land area devoted to outside storage exceed 20 percent of the\nlot area.\n(d)\nCovenants required. The developer of any business park project must\nestablish restrictive covenants for the entire project area. The restrictive\ncovenants must be submitted to show compliance, but will not be\nreviewed as to form, legality, or methods of enforcement. Those\n9-127\n\nNEW PAGE 278\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 8: BUSINESS DISTRICTS\ncovenants must, at a minimum, accomplish the following objectives:\ni.\nCreate a property owners association;\nii.\nProvide for maintenance of individual sites, common areas, open\nspaces, and private streets; and\niii.\nProvide for minimum development and operational standards for\neach site which require adherence to local ordinances and establish\nuniform landscaping, signage, site design, parking, and loading\nstandards. The covenants may include additional restrictions or\nrequirements at the discretion of the developer. However, the\nminimum standards of this ordinance must always be met.\n(e)\nProject edge. The protection of the project edge is essential to the proper\nintegration of a business park development into the community, especially\nwhen adjoining residential areas. The objective of the standards for the\nproject edge is to provide the appropriate separation, screening,\nlandscaping and transition between the development and the adjoining\nproperties.\nThe minimum project edge required around the perimeter of the site is 100\nfeet. However, if the abutting land is zoned and used for business,\nbusiness park, research or industrial purposes, or if the project adjoins the\nright-of-way of a railroad, Class I, or Class II thoroughfare, the minimum\nedge for that part of the project boundary may be reduced to 50 feet. The\nminimum project edge must remain undisturbed except that utility lines,\nstreets and driveways, may be installed in this area pursuant to specific\nsite plan approval. If the project edge does not contain sufficient\nvegetation to adequately screen and buffer, it must be revegetated or\nscreened according to a Class B buffer as per Table 12.302(b). (Petition\n2019-103,10-21-19)\n(f)\nStreet trees. Street trees must be planted along all public and private\nstreets within and abutting any business park development in accordance\nwith the standards and specifications of the Charlotte Street Tree Planting\nprogram and the Charlotte Tree Ordinance (City Code Chapter 21), which\nare adopted herein by reference.\n(g)\nProject entrance. The entrance or entrances to the project should receive\nspecial emphasis in design and construction. It should set the tone for the\ndevelopment within and should create an identity for the project at the\npublic street frontage. Special attention should be paid to signage,\nlandscaping, street configuration, future transit potential, and traffic\ncirculation. At a minimum, a divided street entrance must be used at the\nprincipal entrance to the site. Where internal streets are provided within a\nBP district, individual development sites shall be accessed only from\ninternal streets.\n9-128\n", "page_number": 276, "page_range": [276, 277, 278], "highlight": ["NEW PAGE 276\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 8: BUSINESS DISTRICTS\nTable 9.805(1)(1)\nMaximum <em>Building</em> <em>Coverage</em> for", "CELL (1, 2): \nMaximum <em>Building</em>\n<em>Coverage</em> (%)\nCELL (2, 1): \nUp to 4,000\nCELL (2, 2): \n50\nCELL (3, 1):", "At least 20 <em>percent</em> of every project in the\nbusiness park district must be devoted to permanent open", "In no case may the\namount of land area devoted to outside storage exceed 20 <em>percent</em> of the\nlot area.", "However, if the abutting land is zoned and used for business,\nbusiness park, <em>research</em> or industrial purposes"], "score": 13.080044, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Research\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RE-1\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RE1\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RE-1\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building area as % of lot\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"pervious surface\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"percent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"%\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per cent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ratio\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 570\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 2: OFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING\n(a)\nCovered spaces.
