RU-I: Industrial-Rural\n1. This District is intended to accommodate uses on lands which have not been in productive agricultural or farm use in the previous five year\nperiod. Also, this District is intended to be applied only on lands not anticipated to become urban or suburban by the Land Use Plan, and\nwhich are not wetlands or environmentally sensitive lands. This District is intended to provide areas for uses of open air or extensive rather\nthan intensive character such as:\ni. Agricultural industry;\nii.\nRepositories for waste products whose composition and features require they be removed from other Zoning Districts;\niii.\nChemical extraction or energy generation from crops or woods or the wastes of same, or conversion of crops, woods, and animals to\nvarious products of use to society; and\niv. Animal slaughtering and processing operations and even incineration of animal remains.\n2. This District is intended to be used in an extremely limited manner sufficient only to meet proven needs for such generally adverse uses.\n3. Such land uses require restriction of other uses such as residential, institutional, commercial, and manufacturing where there are\nconcentrations of persons likely at any given time.\nCommentary: The Sunny Point Military Ocean Terminal's buffer zone is an illustration of how man would be expected to be limited in\naccessibility or closeness to uses in this District.\nB. I-G: Industrial-General\nThe I-G District is intended to provide locations for enterprises engaged in a broad range of manufacturing, processing, creating, repairing,\nrenovating, painting, cleaning, or assembly of goods, merchandise or equipment. Lands in this District are to be located on or near Major\nThoroughfares as identified in the Brunswick County Comprehensive Transportation Plan; to rail service; and to in-place infrastructure such as\nwater, sewer, and/or natural gas.\n(Ord. No. UDO-19-02, \u00a7 9, 9-19-19)\n4.6.2. Permitted Uses in Industrial Districts\nOnly uses specifically listed in the use table in Section 5.2 as permitted use (\"P\"), permitted subject to limited use standards (\"L\"), or permitted\nsubject to special use permit (\"SUP\") shall be permitted in Industrial districts.\n4.6.3. Development Standards\nA. Applicability\nThe following standards shall apply to all development within an Industrial zoning district. In addition to the standards contained in this Section,\nall other provisions in this Ordinance and all other applicable laws shall apply, except those that are incompatible with the provisions contained\nherein.\nB.

In the I-G District\nIf the Zoning Administrator finds that the CAMA Land Use Plan identifies hazardous or fragile areas or features in close proximity to the land in\nquestion in the application, or where other natural and manmade environmental impacts are anticipated, the Zoning Administrator shall\nwithhold action on the application and present it to the Planning Board at the next available meeting. The Planning Board shall make a\ndetermination of whether additional information will have to be filed. The nature and detail expected in the study may include a filing for\napproval of an Environmental Impact Statement to national standards and requirements, which may require an amended application upon the\nbasis of studies.\nB. RU-I District\n1. In addition to the requirements for rezoning listed in Section 3.8, an application for a rezoning to the RU-I District shall be accompanied by a\nstudy which meets the most current requirements and guidelines for preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (E.I.S.) under\nfederal law. Prior to initiation of the required study, the Zoning Administrator shall establish the scope and required details of the required\nstudy. This scope shall be approved by the Planning Board and the Board of County Commissioners. All costs associated with the\npreparation of the required study shall be borne by the applicant.
