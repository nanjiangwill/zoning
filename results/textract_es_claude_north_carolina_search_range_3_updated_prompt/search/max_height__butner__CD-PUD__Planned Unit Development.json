LDOTA.24.05,\nadopted 6-6-2024). The text of the amendment will be incorporated below when the ordinance is codified.\n6.3.1 Purpose and intent. The Conditional Zoning District classification allows the Town\nCouncil to consider proposed uses and tailor the zoning to accommodate those uses while\naddressing anticipated problems that may arise from the establishment of the proposed uses. This\nsection sets forth the types of Conditional Zoning Districts and explains their relationship to the\nBase Zoning Districts\n3 of 28\n7/3/2024, 12:56 PM\n\nNEW PAGE 4\nFirefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cf7024e7-0dae-4e00-83.\n6.3.2 Designation. Conditional Zoning Districts shall be designated only in accordance with the\nprocedures set forth in division 3.2.3, Conditional Zoning District Classification, and may not\ncontain conditions which are less restrictive than this ordinance, other town requirements, or other\napplicable state or federal laws.\n6.3.3 Allowable uses. No use shall be permitted within a Conditional Zoning District except\npursuant to the conditions imposed as part of the approval. The permitted uses shall be limited to\nthose permitted in the corresponding Base Zoning District unless otherwise restricted in the\nconditions set forth in the approval of the Conditional Zoning District classification. Any use allowed\nin one Gateway District may be approved as a Conditional District in any other Gateway District.\n6.3.4 Applicable standards.\n(A) Base Zoning District standards apply. All standards and requirements that apply to the\ncorresponding Base Zoning District shall also apply to the Conditional Zoning District, except where\nallowed in division 6.3.6(B) and \u00a7 6.5.\n(B) No less restrictive than base district. Conditions imposed on a Conditional Zoning District\nmay be no less restrictive than the standards that apply to the corresponding Base Zoning District,\nexcept where allowed in division 6.3.6(B) and 6.5.\n(C) Stricter standards adopted. Existing conditions or limitations associated with an approved\nConditional Zoning District classification shall become null and void if future amendments to this\nordinance require stricter standards than those imposed under the Conditional Zoning District\nclassification.\n(D) Application of conditions. In cases where the ability to implement an approved Conditional\nZoning District condition is impossible or impractical (e.g., a condition requiring trees to be\npreserved when the trees have subsequently died due to natural causes), the Ordinance\nAdministrator shall enforce the condition in a way that most closely meets the condition's original\nintent.\n6.3.5 Parallel Conditional Districts established. Each Base Zoning District shall have a\ncorresponding \"parallel\" Conditional Zoning District. Conditional Zoning District classifications shall\nbe indicated on the Official Zoning Map by the suffix \"CD\" in front of the associated Base Zoning\nDistrict.\n6.3.6 Planned Unit Development District (CD-PUD).\n(A) General. The Planned Unit Development District (CD-PUD) is a special purpose\nConditional Zoning District that is established in order to accommodate a diverse mix of residential\nand nonresidential uses and structures that function as a cohesive, integrated, and unified\ndevelopment. This district encourages innovative development patterns by allowing flexibility in\npermitted uses, design, and layout requirements in conjunction with a concept plan. This district\nmay only be established through the process set forth in division 3.2.3, Conditional Zoning District\nClassification.\n(B) Planned unit development standards.\n(1) Minimum size. The minimum size for an application for Conditional Zoning District\nclassification to a CD-PUD district is 25 acres.\n(2) Permitted uses. Planned Unit Developments may contain any use allowed in the RP,\nRR, RS, RT, RMF, OI, NB, CB, CX, SI, NI, CW, and CE Districts except for agricultural uses.\n(3) Preservation of environmentally sensitive areas. All areas of wetlands as defined by\n4 of 28\n7/3/2024, 12:56\n\nNEW PAGE 5\nFirefox\nhtps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cf7024e7-0dae-4e00-83.\nstate and federal agencies, steep slopes of 15% and greater, floodways as delineated by the North\nCarolina Division of Emergency Management or its successor, and sites listed in the most recent\nNatural Heritage Inventory shall be preserved as open space.\n(4) Protection of open space corridors. Open space connections must be retained in a\nnatural condition, with the exception of greenways that comply with the town's adopted standards,\nwhich are still allowed in these areas.\n(5) Density. The overall residential density of the PUD is established by the concept plan as\npart of the Conditional Zoning District classification.\n(6) Minimum lot size. Minimum lot sizes in each area of the PUD are established by the\nconcept plan as part of the Conditional Zoning District classification.\n(7) Minimum interior setbacks. Setback requirements within the PUD are established by\nthe concept plan as part of the Conditional Zoning District classification. While no minimum setback\nis required, if one is provided it must be at least five feet in width.\n(8) Minimum street setbacks. Minimum street (front yard) setbacks within the PUD are\nestablished by the concept plan as part of the Conditional Zoning District classification.\n(9) Maximum height. Within single-family residential portions of a PUD, the maximum\nheight limit is 35 feet. In nonresidential or mixed-use portions of a PUD, the maximum height limit is\ndetermined by the concept plan.\n(10) Open space and recreation facilities. A minimum of 20% of the gross area of the\nPUD must be dedicated to open space. No more than 50% of the dedicated open space may be\nused for active recreation purposes (i.e., soccer fields, tennis courts) and the like. At least 50% of\nthe passive recreation/natural areas must be usable and accessible (i.e., not wetlands, steep\nslopes, or other marginal lands).\n(11) Nonresidential areas. Nonresidential areas and adjacent residential areas must be\narranged in such a manner that convenient pedestrian access is provided between and within\nthose areas.\n(12) Parking and loading. Off-street parking and loading areas must be provided in\naccordance with Article 13.\n(13) Street design.
