CONVENTIONAL ZONING DISTRICT INTENT STATEMENTS\nA. RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS\nThe residential zoning districts are proposed to provide a comfortable, healthy, safe, and pleasant\nenvironment in which to live and recreate. More specifically, they are intended to:\n1. Provide appropriately located lands for residential development that are consistent with the goals,\nobjectives, and policies of the City's adopted policy guidance;\n2. Ensure adequate light, air, privacy, and open space areas for each dwelling, and protect residents\nfrom the negative effects of noise, excessive population density, traffic congestion, flooding, and other\nsignificant adverse environmental impacts;\n3. Protect residential areas from fires, explosions, toxic fumes and substances, and other public safety\nhazards;\n4. Provide for residential housing choice, affordability, and diversity with varying housing densities, types,\nand designs, including accessory dwelling units;\n5.\nProvide for safe and efficient vehicular access and circulation and promote bicycle-, and pedestrian-\nfriendly neighborhoods;\n6. Provide safe and efficient access to public transit facilities and alternative forms of transportation, like\ngreenways;\n7. Provide for public services and facilities needed to serve residential areas and accommodate public\nand very low intensity neighborhood-serving non-residential uses in the higher density residential\ndistricts while protecting residential areas from incompatible non-residential development;\n8. Create neighborhoods and preserve existing community character while accommodating new\ndevelopment and redevelopment consistent with the City's goals and objectives; and\n9.\nPreserve the unique character and historic resources of the traditional neighborhoods and the\ncommunity.\nB. BUSINESS ZONING DISTRICTS\nThe business zoning districts are intended to ensure a wide range of office, retail, service, industrial, and\nrelated uses necessary to meet resident and visitor needs, and more specifically to:\n1. Provide appropriately located lands for the full range of business uses needed by the City's residents,\nbusinesses, and workers, consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies in the City's adopted policy\nguidance;\n2. Strengthen the City's economic base, and provide employment opportunities close to home for\nresidents of the City and surrounding areas;\n3.\nCreate suitable environments for various types of business uses, and protect them from the adverse\neffects of incompatible uses;\n4.\nProvide safe and efficient access to alternative forms of transportation like public transit facilities,\nsidewalks, trails, and greenways;\n5. Preserve the unique character and historic resources of the downtown area while increasing\nopportunities for urban development in areas already well-served by infrastructure; and\n6. Minimize the impact of business development on residential districts and sensitive natural\nenvironments.\nC. SPECIAL ZONING DISTRICTS\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\nThe special zoning districts are intended to recognize those portions of the City's jurisdiction that are\nunique or that require special consideration in order to:\n1. Protect and preserve environmentally-sensitive lands;\n2. Accommodate various types of mixed-use development in ways that establish functioning\nneighborhoods where people can live, work, shop, and recreate without travelling extensive distances;\n3. Provide safe and efficient access to alternative forms of transportation like public transit facilities,\nsidewalks, trails, and greenways; and\n4.\nCreate appropriate amounts of flexibility to foster redevelopment, infill, downtown revitalization, and\neconomic opportunities for City residents.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \n3-9\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\nNEW PAGE 132\nCHAPTER 3 ZONING DISTRICTS\nSection 3.4 Central Business (CBD) District\n3.4. CENTRAL BUSINESS (CBD) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Central Business (CBD) District is established and intended to\nserve as the commercial and cultural heart of the City's jurisdiction.\nDevelopment in the CBD includes the highest average densities and\nbuilding heights in the City. Development is configured for an urban\ncontext, with buildings built to the street, ground floor uses that\nsupport pedestrian travel, and numerous civic gathering spaces and\ncultural attractions. The district is intended to accommodate a well-\nbalanced mix of uses (e.g., office, retail, service, high-density\nresidential, and entertainment), promote a strong pedestrian-\noriented environment (with a reduced need for off-street parking),\nand preserve and protect the downtown's historical and architectural\nscale and character. The district requires urban-style open space\n(greens, seating areas, plazas, pocket parks, roof gardens, etc.) to\nbe included as a part of new development. Low density residential\nlike single-family detached homes and most forms of industrial\ndevelopment are prohibited in the CBD district. New commercial,\nmixed-use, and multi-family developments in the district are subject\nto the design standards in CHAPTER 5. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.\nB. DISTRICT DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS\nNOTES:\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20 & 3.4.21 UDOTA-01-21)\n[1] Development of fewer than three units within a single building is permitted.\n[2] Development within an existing building on an existing lot of record may reduce these dimensions in accordance with\nexisting conditions.\n[3] On corner lots of record, the street setback may be reduced by 50 percent on the long side of the lot.\n[4] When the lot abuts a residential district, the OI zoning district, or an alley, the setback shall be at least 15 feet; when the\nbuilding wall abutting the lot line includes an opening (such as for a door or window), the setback shall be at least 5 feet.\nCity of Burlington\n3-10\nUnified Development Ordinance\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\nCELL (1, 1):

Density rounding is permitted to the tenths place but is not permitted to the hundredths place.\nC. Land area associated with floodplains and riparian buffers may be included in the calculation of\nthe square footage of a tract or site for the purposes of determining the maximum residential\ndensity.\nd. Land area located within a right-of-way shall not be included in the calculation of allowable density.\ne. Maximum residential density in a particular zoning district may be increased beyond the amount\nstated in CHAPTER 3. ZONING DISTRICTS, in accordance with the standards in Section 7.6,\nSustainability Incentives.\n2. Calculation of Maximum Number of Lots\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\nThe maximum number of lots is calculated by dividing the total square footage of a lot or tract by the\nminimum lot area for the type of use proposed, the resulting number (the quotient) is then rounded\ndownwards to the next lowest whole number to produce the total number of lots permissible for the\ntype of use proposed. The effective density of a lot or tract may differ based on the type of use being\nproposed.\ni.\nExample 1: 67,000 Square-foot Site in the MDR District for Single-family\nDetached Dwelling Lots\na) Lot size: 67,000 square feet.\nb) Minimum lot area for a single-family detached dwelling: 9,000 square feet.\nc) Maximum number of single-family detached dwelling lots: 67,000 / 9,000 = 7.44, or 7\nsingle-family detached lots (fractions are rounded downwards).\nii. Example 2: 67,000 Square-foot Site in the MDR district for Single-family\nAttached Dwelling lots\na) Lot size: 67,000 square feet.\nb) Minimum lot area for single-family attached dwelling: 9,000 square feet + 1,600 square\nfeet for each unit.\nc) Maximum number of single-family attached dwelling lots: (67,000 - 9,000) / 1,600 = 36.25\nor 36 single-family attached lots (fractions are rounded downwards).\n3. Calculation of Allowable Residential Yield\n(AMENDED 05.16.23 UDOTA-01-23)\nAllowable residential yield is the lesser of the maximum allowable density or the maximum number of\nlots for a given site.\ni.\nExample 1: 67,000 Square -foot Site in the MDR District for Single-Family\nDetached Dwelling lots\na) Maximum density (based on Example 1 in Sub-section 1 above): 8 units.\nb) Maximum number of lots (based on Example i in Sub-section 2 above): 7 lots.\nc) Allowable residential density = 7 units.\nii. Example 2: 67,000 Square -foot Site in the MDR District for Single-Family\nAttached Dwelling lots\na) Maximum density (based on Example 1 in Sub-section 1 above): 8 units.\nb) Maximum number of lots (based on Example ii in Sub-section 2 above): 36 lots.\nc) Allowable residential density = 8 units.\n4. Density Equivalence\na. Accessory dwelling units associated with a single-family residential principal use shall not be\ncounted towards the maximum allowable residential density.\nb. When calculating the density for a private dormitory associated with an educational use, two\nbedrooms in a private dormitory shall be equivalent to one regular dwelling unit.\nC. Maximum density amounts do not apply to student housing or lodging on college or university\ncampuses when the housing is owned or operated by the college or university. In these instances,\nresidential land uses are considered as an accessory to the college or university principal use.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \n8-14\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\nNEW PAGE 527\nCHAPTER 8 MEASUREMENT AND DEFINITIONS\nSection 8.3 Rules of Measurement\nG. GROSS FLOOR AREA (GFA)\nGross floor area (GFA) shall be defined as the sum in square feet of all floors of the building measured\nfrom the exterior face of the exterior walls. The gross floor area shall include or exclude areas as indicated\nbelow:\n1. Areas Included in Gross Floor Area\na. All enclosed habitable space.\nb. Elevators, hallways, and stairwells on stories containing habitable space.\n2. Areas Excluded from Gross Floor Area\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\na. Unenclosed porches or decks.\nb. Off-street parking areas, including the elevators, hallways, mechanical equipment, and stairwells\nserving structured parking.\nC. Utility services areas devoted to the electric service, the potable water service, the wastewater\nsystem, the telephone service, the cable service, or to a backup generator.\nd.\nMechanical areas and uninhabited enclosed spaces on tops of roofs not intended for general\nstorage.\nH. HEIGHT\n1. Measurement\nBuilding height shall be measured from the finished or established grade elevation following any land\ndisturbing activities.\n2. Maximum Height\nBuilding height is the vertical distance from a point established as the mean elevation of the finished\ngrade along the front fa\u00e7ade of a building to any of the following points (see Figure 8.3.H: Building\nHeight):\na. The highest point of a flat roof (excluding coping or parapet walls shorter than five feet above the\nroof deck);\nb. The deck line of a mansard roof;\nC. The mid-point of the roof between the ridge and the leaves for a gable, hip, or gambrel roof; or\nd. To the highest point of a dome, shed, or cricket-style roof.\n3. Story\nA building story is the portion of a building where all rooms share the same floor and ceiling level.\na. A crawlspace or basement with an average ceiling height of less than seven feet is not considered\nas a story.\nb. An attic with an average ceiling height of less than six feet is not considered a story.\n4. Exceptions\na. Except when proposed within the AHO, the following features are exempted from the maximum\nheight requirements in this Ordinance:\ni. Parapet walls of less than five feet in height above the roof deck;\nii.\nSpires, steeples, minarets, belfries, cupolas, domes, and similar architectural features not\nintended for human habitation;\niii. Water tanks, vent housings, elevator housings, and equipment covers;\niv. Chimneys, vent pipes, skylights, or mechanical equipment; and\nV. Bulkheads or a single-story penthouse occupying 25 percent or less of the total roof area.\nb.\nIn the AHO, such structures shall be subject to the maximum height limits, and shall require a\nvariance in accordance with Section 2.4.CC, Zoning/Subdivision Variance.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \n8-15\nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\nNEW PAGE 528\nCHAPTER 8 MEASUREMENT AND DEFINITIONS\nSection 8.3 Rules of Measurement\nFIGURE 8.3.H: BUILDING HEIGHT\n(AMENDED 12.3.19 UDOTA-01-20)\nDome\nHigh Point\nMidpoint\n/ of Flat Roof\nof Roof\nHEIGHT\nGrade\nHEIGHT\nGrade\nSpire/Steeple\nDeck\nLine\nSkylight\nHEIGHT\nHEIGHT\nGrade\nI. LOT COVERAGE\n(AMENDED 12.3.19 UDOTA-01-20)\nLot coverage is the percentage of a lot or development site that is covered by buildings or roof structures,\nexcluding allowed projecting leaves and balconies.\nJ.
