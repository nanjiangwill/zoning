The Highway Business District (B-3) is appropriate and reserved primarily for high intensity/density auto-dependent\ncommercial development and contemplates commercial development that utilizes the limited prime property with I-40 access\nand thoroughfares of N. Oxford and Centennial as well as the necessary utility infrastructure including water and sewer.\nWhile not easily developed for a comfortable pedestrian environment, connectivity via sidewalks is necessary. The Highway\nBusiness District (B-3) will serve not only the local community, but interstate and highway travelers as well. Because of the\nscale and access requirements of uses for this category, they often cannot be compatibly integrated with the Central\nBusiness and Community Business Districts. Development at district boundaries must provide a compatible transition to\nuses outside the district and frontages on major or minor arterials will require formal street tree planting.\n1.
