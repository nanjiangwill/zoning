The SCENIC CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT (SCO) is established to protect the pastoral\nscenes and open spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and visitors traveling the\nmajor entrance roads and gateways to the City. The pastoral scenes and undeveloped\nproperty along the entrance roads and gateways contribute significantly to Creedmoor's\ncommunity character and sense of place. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District provides\ndevelopment options for the owners of the property abutting the entrance roads and\ngateways. The goal of this district is to protect the scenic value of the corridors through\ndevelopment standards. These standards will preserve the rural character of the City by\nmaintaining the sense of a rural corridor in an urban environment; provide an aesthetically\nappealing experience for those traveling the corridor; provide multi-modal transportation\noptions for travel; and ensure a safe transportation corridor for motorists, bicyclists, and\npedestrians. The Detached House lot/building type is allowed in this district.\nB.\nTYPES. Three (3) types of scenic corridors are hereby created:\n1. RURAL SCENIC CORRIDOR. A corridor along which development is limited, consisting\nlargely of fields, pastures, and scattered residential uses. The rural scenic corridor evokes\na sense of traveling through an undeveloped area, with pastoral scenes and a sense of\nbeing removed from the urban environment.\n2. GATEWAY SCENIC CORRIDOR. A corridor that serves as an entrance way to a place that is\nunique and different from other communities in the area. The gateway corridor provides\na sense of arrival to a place that is special and different from the typical places. The\ngateway scenic corridor may be more developed than the rural scenic corridor, but the\ncharacter of the development is such that those using the corridor are aware they are in\na special place.\n3.\nBYPASS SCENIC CORRIDOR. A corridor providing for buffering of the bypass to protect the\ntraffic carrying capacity of the road and to provide for a pleasant experience for motorists\nusing the bypass. The bypass scenic corridor requires an undeveloped setback from the\nbypass, ensuring that the bypass through Creedmoor is unique and portrays the character\nof the community while enhancing the safety of motorists using the road.\nC.\nGENERAL REQUIREMENTS\n1.\nDEVELOPMENT PATTERN. Building placement, parking placement, building type, and lot\narrangement shall be controlled by the lot and building type standards (Article 9) for the\nlot and building types permitted in the Scenic Corridor Overlay District.\n2.\nACTIVITIES PERMITTED IN THE SCENIC CORRIDOR.

Uses in this district include services,\nemployment, residential and industrial. Allowed building/lot types include Urban Workplace,\nShop-front Commercial, and Civic Building.\nThe INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT (IND) is established to provide locations for industrial uses that, due to\nthe scale of the buildings and/or the nature of the use, cannot be integrated into the community.\nUses within the Industrial District are buffered from adjacent uses. The dominant uses in this\ndistrict are manufacturing and warehouse storage. Small scale manufacturing and storage that is\ncompatible with less intensive uses can and should be located in other non-residential or mixed\nuse districts. The Industrial District is reserved for uses which require very large buildings and/or\nlarge parking and loading facilities.

The SCENIC CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT (SCO) is established to protect the pastoral\nscenes and open spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and visitors traveling the\nmajor entrance roads and gateways to the City. The pastoral scenes and undeveloped\nproperty along the entrance roads and gateways contribute significantly to Creedmoor's\ncommunity character and sense of place. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District provides\ndevelopment options for the owners of the property abutting the entrance roads and\ngateways. The goal of this district is to protect the scenic value of the corridors through\ndevelopment standards. These standards will preserve the rural character of the City by\nmaintaining the sense of a rural corridor in an urban environment; provide an aesthetically\nappealing experience for those traveling the corridor; provide multi-modal transportation\noptions for travel; and ensure a safe transportation corridor for motorists, bicyclists, and\npedestrians. The Detached House lot/building type is allowed in this district.\nB.\nTYPES. Three (3) types of scenic corridors are hereby created:\n1. RURAL SCENIC CORRIDOR. A corridor along which development is limited, consisting\nlargely of fields, pastures, and scattered residential uses. The rural scenic corridor evokes\na sense of traveling through an undeveloped area, with pastoral scenes and a sense of\nbeing removed from the urban environment.\n2. GATEWAY SCENIC CORRIDOR. A corridor that serves as an entrance way to a place that is\nunique and different from other communities in the area. The gateway corridor provides\na sense of arrival to a place that is special and different from the typical places. The\ngateway scenic corridor may be more developed than the rural scenic corridor, but the\ncharacter of the development is such that those using the corridor are aware they are in\na special place.\n3.\nBYPASS SCENIC CORRIDOR. A corridor providing for buffering of the bypass to protect the\ntraffic carrying capacity of the road and to provide for a pleasant experience for motorists\nusing the bypass. The bypass scenic corridor requires an undeveloped setback from the\nbypass, ensuring that the bypass through Creedmoor is unique and portrays the character\nof the community while enhancing the safety of motorists using the road.\nC.\nGENERAL REQUIREMENTS\n1.\nDEVELOPMENT PATTERN. Building placement, parking placement, building type, and lot\narrangement shall be controlled by the lot and building type standards (Article 9) for the\nlot and building types permitted in the Scenic Corridor Overlay District.\n2.\nACTIVITIES PERMITTED IN THE SCENIC CORRIDOR. In order to preserve the aesthetic\nquality of the scenic corridors, uses and activities within the designated scenic corridors\nshall be limited to the following:\nArticle 8 - Page 14\nCELL (1, 1): \nMinimum\nLot Size\nCELL (1, 2): \nMinimum\nLot Width\nCELL (1, 3): \nMinimum\nFront Yard\nSetback\nCELL (1, 4): \nMinimum Rear\nYard Setback\nCELL (1, 5): \nMinimum Side\nYard Setback\nCELL (1, 6): \nMinimum Corner Lot\nSide Yard Setback\nCELL (2, 1): \n50,000 S.F.\nCELL (2, 2): \n85'\nCELL (2, 3): \n60'\nCELL (2, 4): \n25'\nCELL (2, 5): \n25'\nCELL (2, 6): \n50'\n\nNEW PAGE 113\na.\nThe scenic corridor overlay area may be used for passive recreation, agricultural uses,\nand equestrian uses. No other use shall be permitted within the scenic corridor\noverlay area.\nb. No building construction, parking, land disturbing activity, signs, tree removal,\nlighting (other than street lighting provided by the City of Creedmoor or the North\nCarolina Department of Transportation, and driveway or private road lighting\nprovided that said lighting is provided by full cutoff fixtures), or other development\nactivity shall occur within the scenic corridor overlay area except as follows:\ni.\nA bikeway, greenway, and/or other pedestrian/bicycle facility may be located\nwithin the scenic corridor easement.\nii. Underground utilities and easements for underground utilities may be located\nwithin the scenic overlay area, provided that no above ground transmission or\nother equipment is located within the scenic easement.\niii. Buildings used primarily for agricultural and/or equestrian related activities may\nbe built in the scenic corridor overlay area upon approval by the City Board of\nCommissioners as a Special Use Permit. Parking shall be located behind the\nbuilding, shall not be located within the scenic corridor overlay area, and shall\nbe buffered from the scenic corridor. The City Board of Commissioners shall\nconsider the following items in making the decision to allow aforesaid buildings\nin the scenic corridor overlay area:\n1. The building's visual impact on the scenic corridor;\n2. The building's size;\n3. The compatibility of the building's architecture with community character\nand the purposes of the scenic corridor overlay district.\n3. SCENIC CORRIDOR DIMENSIONS. The designated scenic corridors shall meet the following\ndimensional standards:\na.\nThe width of the scenic overlay within the rural scenic corridor shall be 10% of the lot\ndepth but no more than 100 feet from the edge of the public right-of-way.\nb. The width of the scenic overlay within the gateway scenic corridor shall be 10% of\nthe lot depth but no more than 50 feet from the edge of the highway right-of-way.\nC.\nThe width of the scenic overlay within the bypass scenic corridor shall be 10% of the\nlot depth but no more than 75 feet from the edge of the public right-of-way.\n4. SCENIC CORRIDOR PROVISIONS. The following provisions shall govern development\nwithin a designated scenic corridor:\na. The area within the scenic overlay may be dedicated to the City as a conservation\neasement, provided it meets the standards for such an easement as established by\napplicable state and federal standards.\nb.\nThe maximum residential density is established by the underlying general use zoning\ndistricts as defined in Section 8.4.\nC.\nDevelopment may be clustered on the portion of the property located outside the\nscenic overlay.\n5. CURB CUTS. There shall be a minimum separation of 500' between curb cuts in the rural\nscenic corridors. This separation requirement may be waived by the Planning, Zoning and\nSubdivision Administrator if the width of the property frontage would preclude a second\ncurb cut meeting this spacing requirement.\n6.\nLOT REQUIREMENTS. The lot type standards and building type standard permitted in the\nunderlying district, as set forth in section 8.4 and further described in Article 9, shall apply\nin the Scenic Corridor Overlay District.\nD. OPEN SPACE. The provision and design of open space shall comply with the requirements set\nforth in Article 21.

be developed for principal uses, accessory uses (e.g., parking), or roadways, with\nthe exception that gazebos, tool sheds, barns, shelters, or similar accessory uses and\nstructures may be constructed within the agricultural and common open space upon\napproval of the Planning, Zoning and Subdivision Administrator.\nJ.\nGeneral Standards.\n1.\nThe following shall apply in the Mini Farm Overlay District:\n8.5-3\nSCENIC CORRIDOR OVERLAY (SCO)\nA.\nINTENT. The SCENIC CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT (SCO) is established to protect the pastoral\nscenes and open spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and visitors traveling the\nmajor entrance roads and gateways to the City. The pastoral scenes and undeveloped\nproperty along the entrance roads and gateways contribute significantly to Creedmoor's\ncommunity character and sense of place. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District provides\ndevelopment options for the owners of the property abutting the entrance roads and\ngateways. The goal of this district is to protect the scenic value of the corridors through\ndevelopment standards. These standards will preserve the rural character of the City by\nmaintaining the sense of a rural corridor in an urban environment; provide an aesthetically\nappealing experience for those traveling the corridor; provide multi-modal transportation\noptions for travel; and ensure a safe transportation corridor for motorists, bicyclists, and\npedestrians. The Detached House lot/building type is allowed in this district.\nB.\nTYPES. Three (3) types of scenic corridors are hereby created:\n1. RURAL SCENIC CORRIDOR. A corridor along which development is limited, consisting\nlargely of fields, pastures, and scattered residential uses. The rural scenic corridor evokes\na sense of traveling through an undeveloped area, with pastoral scenes and a sense of\nbeing removed from the urban environment.\n2. GATEWAY SCENIC CORRIDOR. A corridor that serves as an entrance way to a place that is\nunique and different from other communities in the area. The gateway corridor provides\na sense of arrival to a place that is special and different from the typical places. The\ngateway scenic corridor may be more developed than the rural scenic corridor, but the\ncharacter of the development is such that those using the corridor are aware they are in\na special place.\n3.\nBYPASS SCENIC CORRIDOR. A corridor providing for buffering of the bypass to protect the\ntraffic carrying capacity of the road and to provide for a pleasant experience for motorists\nusing the bypass. The bypass scenic corridor requires an undeveloped setback from the\nbypass, ensuring that the bypass through Creedmoor is unique and portrays the character\nof the community while enhancing the safety of motorists using the road.\nC.\nGENERAL REQUIREMENTS\n1.\nDEVELOPMENT PATTERN. Building placement, parking placement, building type, and lot\narrangement shall be controlled by the lot and building type standards (Article 9) for the\nlot and building types permitted in the Scenic Corridor Overlay District.\n2.\nACTIVITIES PERMITTED IN THE SCENIC CORRIDOR. In order to preserve the aesthetic\nquality of the scenic corridors, uses and activities within the designated scenic corridors\nshall be limited to the following:\nArticle 8 - Page 14\nCELL (1, 1): \nMinimum\nLot Size\nCELL (1, 2): \nMinimum\nLot Width\nCELL (1, 3): \nMinimum\nFront Yard\nSetback\nCELL (1, 4): \nMinimum Rear\nYard Setback\nCELL (1, 5): \nMinimum Side\nYard Setback\nCELL (1, 6): \nMinimum Corner Lot\nSide Yard Setback\nCELL (2, 1): \n50,000 S.F.\nCELL (2, 2): \n85'\nCELL (2, 3): \n60'\nCELL (2, 4): \n25'\nCELL (2, 5): \n25'\nCELL (2, 6): \n50'\n\nNEW PAGE 113\na.\nThe scenic corridor overlay area may be used for passive recreation, agricultural uses,\nand equestrian uses. No other use shall be permitted within the scenic corridor\noverlay area.\nb. No building construction, parking, land disturbing activity, signs, tree removal,\nlighting (other than street lighting provided by the City of Creedmoor or the North\nCarolina Department of Transportation, and driveway or private road lighting\nprovided that said lighting is provided by full cutoff fixtures), or other development\nactivity shall occur within the scenic corridor overlay area except as follows:\ni.\nA bikeway, greenway, and/or other pedestrian/bicycle facility may be located\nwithin the scenic corridor easement.\nii. Underground utilities and easements for underground utilities may be located\nwithin the scenic overlay area, provided that no above ground transmission or\nother equipment is located within the scenic easement.\niii. Buildings used primarily for agricultural and/or equestrian related activities may\nbe built in the scenic corridor overlay area upon approval by the City Board of\nCommissioners as a Special Use Permit. Parking shall be located behind the\nbuilding, shall not be located within the scenic corridor overlay area, and shall\nbe buffered from the scenic corridor. The City Board of Commissioners shall\nconsider the following items in making the decision to allow aforesaid buildings\nin the scenic corridor overlay area:\n1. The building's visual impact on the scenic corridor;\n2. The building's size;\n3. The compatibility of the building's architecture with community character\nand the purposes of the scenic corridor overlay district.\n3. SCENIC CORRIDOR DIMENSIONS. The designated scenic corridors shall meet the following\ndimensional standards:\na.\nThe width of the scenic overlay within the rural scenic corridor shall be 10% of the lot\ndepth but no more than 100 feet from the edge of the public right-of-way.\nb. The width of the scenic overlay within the gateway scenic corridor shall be 10% of\nthe lot depth but no more than 50 feet from the edge of the highway right-of-way.\nC.\nThe width of the scenic overlay within the bypass scenic corridor shall be 10% of the\nlot depth but no more than 75 feet from the edge of the public right-of-way.\n4. SCENIC CORRIDOR PROVISIONS. The following provisions shall govern development\nwithin a designated scenic corridor:\na. The area within the scenic overlay may be dedicated to the City as a conservation\neasement, provided it meets the standards for such an easement as established by\napplicable state and federal standards.\nb.\nThe maximum residential density is established by the underlying general use zoning\ndistricts as defined in Section 8.4.\nC.\nDevelopment may be clustered on the portion of the property located outside the\nscenic overlay.\n5. CURB CUTS. There shall be a minimum separation of 500' between curb cuts in the rural\nscenic corridors. This separation requirement may be waived by the Planning, Zoning and\nSubdivision Administrator if the width of the property frontage would preclude a second\ncurb cut meeting this spacing requirement.\n6.\nLOT REQUIREMENTS. The lot type standards and building type standard permitted in the\nunderlying district, as set forth in section 8.4 and further described in Article 9, shall apply\nin the Scenic Corridor Overlay District.\nD. OPEN SPACE. The provision and design of open space shall comply with the requirements set\nforth in Article 21.
