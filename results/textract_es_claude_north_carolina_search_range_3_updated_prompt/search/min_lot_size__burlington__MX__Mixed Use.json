DISTRICTS\nSection 3.12 Mixed Use (MX) District\n3.12. MIXED USE (MX) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Mixed Use (MX) district is intended to foster functional neighborhoods where City\nresidents and visitors can live, work, shop, and recreate without travelling large distances\nbetween differing uses. Buildings are built close to the sidewalk and served by public\ngathering areas that create places for people to congregate and interact. The district\nencourages a fine-grained network of streets and pedestrian ways that allow a wide\nfreedom of movement and choices in transportation mode, including public transit. Land\nuses are mixed (including both residential and non-residential) either in the same building\n(vertical integration) or on the same development site (horizontal integration), and are\nlocated in close proximity to one another. Mixed use districts are located on principal and\nminor arterials as well as collector streets. The district allows a wide variety of housing\ntypes to promote population density and to support nearby retail, dining, and entertainment\nestablishments. The district discourages the establishment of single-use, monolithic, and\nautomobile-oriented forms of development that require large areas of off-street parking.\nNOTES:\n(AMENDED 06.21.22 UDOTA-03-22)\n[1] Includes duplex, triplex, and quadriplex dwellings.\n[2] 10,000 for duplex buildings; 15,000 for triplex buildings; 20,000 for quadriplex buildings; and 5,400 for a single-family\nattached development plus an additional 1,600 square feet per single-family attached unit in the development.\n[3] This is a minimum development size, not a minimum lot area.\n[4] Development in the WPO is subject to Section 3.20.F, Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay (WPO) District.\n[5] Increased to 90% for lots in pocket neighborhoods and 80% for lots in bungalow courts.\n[6] Not applied to single-family attached lots but the entire development shall maintain a max. lot coverage of 50%.\n[7] Applied to entire development (not individual lots) when configured as a pocket neighborhood or bungalow court.\n[8] Standards applied to entire development, not individual lots.\n[9] Open space set-aside requirements applied to single-family detached subdivisions of six or more lots and developments\ncomprised of six or more duplex, triplex, or quadriplex buildings. All single-family attached and multi-family development\nshall provide open space set-aside.\n[10] Open space set-aside shall be configured with at least 50 percent devoted to active recreation features in accordance\nwith Section 7.1, Open Space Set-Aside.\n[11] Reduced to as low as 3 feet for dwellings in pocket neighborhoods and bungalow courts.\n[12] On corner lots of record, the street setback may be reduced by 50 percent on the long side of the lot.\n[13] Duplex dwellings may utilize a side yard setback that is the same as a single-family detached dwelling.\n[14] Duplex, triplex, and quadplex buildings with party walls may maintain a sideyard setback of zero feet along building\nsides with party walls.\n[15] Applied in lieu of side or rear setbacks in multi-building developments.\n[16] Dev. in the AHO is subject to maximum building heights in Section 3.20.B, Airport Height Overlay (AHO) District.\n[17] May be increased one foot in height for each one foot in additional side and rear setback beyond the min. requirement.\n[18] Maximum building height of 36 feet for buildings located within 500 feet of a single-family detached dwelling.\nCity of Burlington\nUnified Development Ordinance\n3-35\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\nCELL (1, 1): \nB.
