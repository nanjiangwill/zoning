Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets, highways,\nor railroads, or rights-of-way of same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such\ndistance there from as indicated on the zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use\nof the scale shown on said zoning map.\n4.
