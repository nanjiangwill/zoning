DEDICATION REQUIREMENTS\n1. The applicant shall provide land for open space within the proposed development\nas required in Section 7.6 of this ordinance.\n2. Open space shall be accessible to all lots in the development through a\ncombination of direct access to the street and sidewalks, walkways or connecting\npaths.\n3. Land preserved for the purpose described in this section, shall only be eligible for\nfull credit towards the minimum open space requirement if it is an integral part of\nthe development. If the entire preserved area is located on the periphery of the\ndevelopment, the area shall only be credited for a maximum fifty (50) percent of\nthe required open space. The purpose of this limit is to ensure open space is not\nisolated but is an integral part of the development.\nD. PERMITTED USES WITHIN OPEN SPACE:\nOpen spaces required in this chapter may be used only as specified and as follows:\n1. Buffers required in Section 7.3, BUFFERS\n2. Undeveloped land without a designated purpose held by a property owners\nassociation or non-profit conservation entity\nE. PROHIBITED USES WITHIN OPEN SPACE:\nRequired open spaces may not be used for any of the following:\n1. Storm water management ponds, swales, conveyances, and treatment areas\n2.

An applicant may propose fences,\ncommunity gardens, and passive uses including walking trails, available to the\npublic or restricted to occupants of the development, at the time of development\nreview. The applicant shall construct any trails proposed, which may count toward\na recreational requirement in Section 7.6.D.4.(b).\n2. Utility easements may cross common open space, if necessary, to connect to the\narea network.
