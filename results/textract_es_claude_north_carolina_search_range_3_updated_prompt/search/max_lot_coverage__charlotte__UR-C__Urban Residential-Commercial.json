If twenty (20) or more short-term bicycle spaces are\nrequired, then at least fifty (50) percent of the required short-term bicycle\nspaces shall be covered. Coverage may be provided under roof overhangs\nor awnings, in bicycle lockers or within or under other structures.\n(b)\nLocation. Short-term bicycle parking should be located along a major\nbuilding approach line and clearly visible from the approach. The rack\narea shall be no more than 120 feet from the entrance it serves, or as close\nas the nearest non-handicap, off-street auto parking space, whichever is\nfarther. Rack area(s) should be clearly visible from the entrance they serve\nand should be provided near each actively used entrance. In general,\nmultiple buildings should not be served with a combined, distant rack\narea. It is preferred to place smaller rack areas in locations that are more\nconvenient.\nShort-term bicycle parking may be located within the public right-of-way\nand/or within the required setback in the UR-1, UR-2, UR-3, UR-C, RE-3,\nMUDD, UMUD, NS, PED, TOD-UC, TOD-CC, TOD-NC, TOD-TR, and\nUI zoning districts, subject to the following additional requirements:\n1.\nThe short-term bicycle parking shall not obstruct the required\nsidewalks, movement from on-street parking to the required\nsidewalks, or impact the minimum planting area or spacing\nrequirements for street trees or required screening.\n2.\nBicycle parking may be located in the public right-of-way subject\nto approval by the Charlotte Department of Transportation\n(CDOT) or the North Carolina Department of Transportation\n(NCDOT). If bicycle parking is not approved, then the required\nparking must be located entirely on the site.\n3.\nThere shall be no more than 5 required short-term bicycle parking\nspaces per 100 linear feet of street frontage. Additional bicycle\nparking beyond the required amount can exceed the 5 short-term\nbicycle parking spaces per 100 linear feet of street frontage\nrequirement.\n(2)\nLong-term bicycle parking shall meet the following standards:\n12 31\n", "page_number": 567, "page_range": [567, 568, 569], "highlight": ["If twenty (20) or more short-term bicycle spaces are\nrequired, then at least fifty (50) <em>percent</em> of the", "<em>Coverage</em> may be provided under roof overhangs\nor awnings, in bicycle lockers or within or under other", "located within the public right-of-way\nand/or within the required setback in the UR-1, UR-2, UR-3, <em>UR</em>-<em>C</em>"], "score": 8.429993, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Urban Residential-Commercial\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"UR-C\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"URC\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"UR-C\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building area as % of lot\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"pervious surface\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"percent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"%\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per cent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ratio\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [549, 550, 551, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571]}
