The purpose of this section is to allow a broad range of secondary uses\nand structures, provided they comply with the standards set forth in this section in order to reduce\npotentially adverse impacts on surrounding lands.\n4.5.2. ORGANIZATION OF THESE STANDARDS\nThese provisions set out the configuration standards and allowable locations for secondary uses and\nstructures in the County's planning jurisdiction, and are generally organized into the following\nstructure:\nA.\nThe procedure for establishing a secondary use or structure;\nB.\nThe general standards applicable to all secondary uses and structures under this Ordinance;\nC.\nA summary table of common secondary uses and the zoning districts where they are permitted;\nand\nD.\nAdditional standards applied to specific secondary use types, where identified in the summary\ntable.\n4.5.3. PROCEDURE FOR ESTABLISHMENT\nA.\nSecondary uses or structures may be approved in conjunction with the approval of the principal\nuse or subsequently following the establishment of the principal use through the approval of\na\nzoning compliance permit or special use permit, as appropriate. Except as permitted in the AR-\n30 zoning district, no secondary use or structure shall be approved, established, or constructed\nbefore a principal use is approved in accordance with this Ordinance.\nB.\nApplications to establish a planned development district shall be supplemented by a site plan\nshowing proposed secondary uses or by a written list of proposed secondary uses included in\nthe terms and conditions documents.\nC.\nTable 4.5.5, Common Secondary Use Table, may not be inclusive of all possible secondary uses,\nand in the event a secondary use is proposed that is not listed in the table, the Zoning\nAdministrator shall consult Table 4.2.1, Principal Use Table, to determine if the proposed\nsecondary use corresponds to a listed principal use. Any permitted principal use in a zoning\ndistrict is also permitted as secondary use. In no instance shall a secondary use be permitted in\na zoning district where it is prohibited as a principal use.\nD.\nIn the event a proposed secondary use is not listed in Table 4.5.5, Common Secondary Use\nTable, and there is no corresponding principal use, the Zoning Administrator shall determine\nhow to treat the secondary use in accordance with Section $4.7, Unlisted Uses.\n4.5.4. GENERAL STANDARDS FOR ALL SECONDARY USES, STRUCTURES, AND\nOPEN AIR USES OF LAND\nA.\nPERMITTED SECONDARY USES, STRUCTURES, AND OPEN AIR USES OF\nLAND\nPermitted secondary uses, structures, and open air uses of land shall comply with the following:\n1. Are clearly incidental to an allowed principal use or structure;\n2. Are subordinate to and serve an allowed principal use or structure;\n3. Are subordinate in area, extent, and purpose to the principal use or structure;\n4.

WITHIN A REQUIRED SETBACK\nNo secondary use, structure, or open air use of land may be located in a required setback\nexcept as permitted by Table 3.1.4.C.1, Allowable Encroachments.\n3. WITHIN OTHER AREAS ON A SITE\nNo secondary use, structure, or open air use of land shall:\ni. Be within five feet of a lot line, except as authorized by Table 3.1.4.C.1, Allowable\nEncroachments;\nii. Be located within a designated fire lane;\niii.

WITHIN AN EASEMENT\nExcept for authorized stormwater control measures within a drainage easement, no\nsecondary use, structure, or open air use of land shall be located within any platted or\nrecorded easement without the prior written consent of the landowner.\nC.\nSTRUCTURE HEIGHT\nSecondary structures shall comply with the height requirements for the zoning district where\nlocated.\nD.\nMAXIMUM NUMBER OF STRUCTURES, USES, OR OPEN AIR USE OF LAND\n1.
