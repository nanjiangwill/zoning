Preservation of\nopen space in developing areas serves a variety of purposes, including meeting the\nrecreational needs of residents, improving the aesthetic character of the community,\nreducing stormwater runoff, improving stormwater runoff water quality, and enhancing\nair quality. The standards set forth below establish regulations for open space.\n21.2 Open Space.\nAlthough open space can be agricultural or natural in character, sub-urban open space is\ntypically planned and developed as part of a development. The following standards are\nhereby established for open space, with the exception of the Main Street (MS) District\nwhich shall be exempt from the requirements of this section.\n21.2-1 Open space land area requirements. Open space shall be provided in accordance with\nthe following table 21.1 for:\n(A.) new residential development containing eight or more units,\n(B.) redevelopment or additional development that adds eight or more residential units,\n(C.) initial non-residential or mixed-use development greater than 0.6 acres, and\n(D.) re-development or additional development that adds 25 percent more non-residential\nor mixed-use floor area on a site that exceeds 0.6 acres within any 36-consecutive\nmonth period.\nTABLE 21.1\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 21 - Page 1\nCELL (1, 1): \nZONING DISTRICT\nCELL (1, 2): \nREQUIRED OPEN SPACE\nCELL (2, 1): \nResidential Uses/Districts.\nCELL (2, 2): \nSingle-family/and/or duplex subdivisions:\n5.0% of total subdivision project site area.\nOther residential: the greatest of 500 square\nfeet of open space per dwelling unit or 9% of\ntotal project site area.\nCELL (3, 1): \nAll other districts, excluding \"MS\" which\nis exempt from these requirements\nCELL (3, 2): \n7.5% of total project site area\n\nNEW PAGE 432\n21.2-2 Land designated as future open space. Regardless of the requirements and\nexemptions of this subsection, any portion of the site of the proposed development\nthat is designated as future open space or greenway in the Plan referenced in Section\n1.5 of this Ordinance, adopted by the Town of Chadbourn, as amended from time to\ntime, shall be reserved for open space. This area may be counted toward the total\namount of open space required for the development.\nIf the total amount of land designated as future open space or greenway is less than\nthe total amount of open space required for the development by Table 21.1, then the\ndeveloper shall provide additional open space to meet the requirement of Table 21.1.\nIf the amount of land designated as future open space or greenway exceeds the total\namount of open space required by Table 21.1, then the developer must provide the\nopen space designated in the official adopted plan.\nAs compensation for any open space dedication associated with implementing any\nofficial adopted plan above that requirement listed in Table 21.1, the developer is\neligible for a density bonus of one dwelling unit per each 4,356 square feet of land\narea in excess of that required in Table 21.1 or 500 square feet of non-residential\ngross floor area per each 2,178 square feet of land area in excess of that required in\nTable 21.1, up to a maximum of a fifteen (15%) percent increase above the maximum\ndensity or intensity allowed in the applicable zoning district. The density bonus in\nthe proposed development is limited to additional yield that can be configured with\nless than a ten (10%) percent reduction in(s) in lot area and/or setback dimensions\nspecified in Article 8.\n21.2-3 Minimum open space area. Individual areas designated as open space areas shall not\ncontain less than 500 square feet, although smaller areas may be approved by the\nPlanning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator if the intent of this Ordinance is\ndetermined to be met through the provision of bus/transit stops and/or mail kiosk.\n21.2-4 Improvement of open space.

In major subdivisions and multi-building developments in all\nzoning districts, except Agricultural, open space shall be integrated into the design of\nthe site. In subdivisions where 50% or more of the lots are less than 0.75 acre in size,\nopen space shall be located within 1/4 mile of at least 90% of the building lots, as\nmeasured along the rights-of-way of streets providing access between the two. In\nsubdivisions where 50% or more of the lots are 0.75 acre or more in size, open space\nshall be located within 1/2 mile of at least 90% of the building lots, as measured along\nthe rights-of-way of streets providing access between the two.\n21.2-6 Focal point. Open space features shall provide focal points for the neighborhood.

Open space types include Squares, Parks, Forecourts, Plazas,\nGreenways, and Natural and Agricultural. Standards for these open space types are\nset forth below:\n(A.) Squares\nSquares are areas for passive recreational use. Squares shall be bounded by streets on\neither a minimum of three sides or 56% of their perimeter.\nSquares shall be used in high-density environments where residents have little yard\nspace. Squares are used to bring a natural landscape into a high-density environment.\nAs such, not more than 25% of a square should be impervious surface coverage.\nHardscaping shall be of an enhanced decorative finish to improve aesthetic impact for\npersons viewing and/or visiting the Square (example brick pavers or decorative\nconcrete edges instead of solid asphalt ribbon or broom finished concrete for\nwalkways).\nMin size: 500 sq. feet, unless approved per Section 21.2-3 of this Ordinance.\nMax Size: 4 acres\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 21 - Page 3\n", "page_number": 431, "page_range": [431, 432, 433], "highlight": ["or additional development that adds eight or more residential units,\n(C.) initial non-residential or <em>mixed</em>-<em>use</em>", "development greater than 0.6 acres, and\n(D.) re-development or additional development that adds 25 <em>percent</em>", "more non-residential\nor <em>mixed</em>-<em>use</em> floor area on a site that exceeds 0.6 acres within any 36-consecutive", "square feet of land area in excess of that required in\nTable 21.1, up to a maximum of a fifteen (15%) <em>percent</em>", "As such, not more than 25% of a square should be impervious surface <em>coverage</em>."], "score": 7.1749525, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Mixed Use\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MU-2\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MU2\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MU-2\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building area as % of lot\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"pervious surface\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"percent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"%\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per cent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ratio\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [431, 432, 433]}
