The intent of this\ndistrict is to recognize that most of the area surrounding the core of the downtown developed\nprior to the adoption of standards such as zoning and subdivision regulations. The gradual\ntransformation of existing development to high quality mixed density residential development\nis needed to support the central core of the City. Allowed building/lot types in these districts\nare the Detached House, Attached House, Multi-family Building, and Civic Building.
