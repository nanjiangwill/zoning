Use of the conservation subdivision\nSuburban\nconfiguration is optional for residential subdivisions. While the\ndistrict allows single-family detached homes, mobile homes on\nindividual lots are prohibited. Nonconforming mobile homes\nmay remain but may not be expanded or replaced with another\nmobile home. The district accommodates equestrian uses,\nResidential\nutilities, as well as various neighborhood-supporting\ninstitutional uses such as parks, schools, and public safety\nfacilities. District regulations discourage uses that interfere\nwith the development of residential neighborhoods or that are\ndetrimental to the suburban nature of the district.\nB.\nDimensional

This is done in order to:\nA.\nConserve open land, including those areas containing productive agricultural soils, unique and sensitive natural\nfeatures such as floodplains, wetlands, river and stream corridors, areas with mature hardwood trees, and\nwatersheds;\nB.\nPromote existing rural character particularly in areas visible from major roadways in the County;\nC.\nRetain and protect existing environmental, natural, and cultural resources;\nD.\nCreate a linked network of open lands; and\nE.\nProvide reasonable economic use of the land.\nFIGURE 6.5.1: CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION\nMON\nLEGEND\nLot Line\nPrivate Road\nTrail\nWoodland\nFarmland\n6.5.2.\nAPPLICABILITY\nA.\nType of Development\nThis conservation subdivision option shall be limited to development of single-family detached residential dwellings\non individual lots in subdivisions of more than five lots. The conservation subdivision option shall not be available for\nany other form of development or use type.\nB.\nWhere Required\nSingle-family detached residential subdivisions of more than five lots in the WL and RR districts shall be configured\nas conservation subdivisions, in accordance with the standards in this section.\nC.\nWhere Allowed\nSingle-family detached residential subdivisions of more than five lots in the SR and PD districts may be developed\nas a conservation subdivision, in accordance with the standards in this section.\nD.\nWhere Prohibited\n1. The conservation subdivision option is not available for use in the NR, VR, or MX districts.\n2.\nSuburban Residential Zoning District will not have individual septic systems due to the decrease in\nDimensional Requirements specifically the minimum lot area from 1 acre to 0.5 acre.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCamden County\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLast Updated:\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \n6-26\nCELL (2, 3): \nFebruary 4, 2019\n\nNEW PAGE 339\nARTICLE 151.6 Subdivision Requirements\n6.5 Conservation Subdivision\n6.5.4 Conservation Subdivision Standards\n6.5.3.\nPROCEDURE\nDevelopment utilizing the conservation subdivision option shall be approved as a preliminary plat in accordance with the\nprocedures and standards in Section 2.3.20, Preliminary Plat, after approval of a conservation and development plan in\naccordance with this section.\nA.\nConservation and Development Plan\nPrior to review of an application for preliminary plat for a conservation subdivision, an applicant shall have a\nconservation and development plan for the land reviewed and approved, or approved with conditions by the UDO\nAdministrator in accordance with this section and the standards of Section 6.5.4, Conservation Subdivision\nStandards, and Section 6.5.5, Delineation of Conservation and Development Areas.\nB.\nConservation and Development Plan Requirements\n1.\nStep 1-Site Analysis Map\nThe applicant shall prepare a site analysis map that provides information about existing site conditions and\ncontext, and that analyzes existing conditions both on the land proposed for the development site and on\nland within 500 feet of the site, and submit the site analysis map to the UDO Administrator. It is the intent\nof this section that the information required to be presented in the site analysis map be produced primarily\nfrom existing sources, maps, in order to ensure the process is economical for the applicant.\n2.\nStep 2-Site Inspection\nAfter receipt of the site analysis map, the UDO Administrator shall schedule a site inspection of the land with\nthe applicant. The applicant or the applicant's representative shall attend the site inspection with a County\nstaff member. The purpose of this site visit is to:\na.\nFamiliarize the staff with the existing site conditions and natural and historic features of the site;\nb.\nIdentify potential site development issues, including the best location for the development to ensure\nits visibility from surrounding areas and major roadways is minimized; and\nC.\nProvide an opportunity to discuss site development concepts, including the general layout of\nconservation areas and potential locations for proposed structures, utilities, streets, and other\ndevelopment features. Comments made by the staff during the site inspection shall be interpreted\nas being only suggestive. No official decision on the conservation and development plan shall be\nmade during the site inspection.\n3.\nStep 3-Conservation and Development Areas Map\nBased on the site analysis map and the information obtained during the site inspection, the applicant shall\nprepare a conservation and development areas map that depicts proposed primary conservation areas,\nsecondary conservation areas, and development areas, in accordance with Section 6.5.5, Delineation of\nConservation and Development Areas.\n4.\nStep 4-Conservation and Development Plan\nBased on the site analysis map, the information obtained during the site inspection, and the conservation\nand development areas map, the applicant shall prepare and submit to the UDO Administrator a\nconservation and development plan. The conservation and development plan shall include the following:\nC.\nReview of Conservation and Development Plan\nThe UDO Administrator shall review the conservation and development plan in accordance with the procedures and\nrequirements of Section 6.5.4, Conservation Subdivision Standards, and Section 6.5.5, Delineation of Conservation\nand Development Areas.\nD.\nReview and Approval of Conservation Subdivision\nFollowing review and approval or approval with conditions of the conservation and development plan by the UDO\nAdministrator for a preliminary plat of the conservation subdivision shall be submitted and reviewed in accordance\nwith Section 2.3.20, Preliminary Plat.\n6.5.4.\nCONSERVATION SUBDIVISION STANDARDS\nA conservation subdivision shall comply with the following standards:\nA.\nLocation\nConservation subdivisions shall be configured to minimize their visibility from adjacent lands and major roadways.\nB.\nMinimum Project Size\nConservations subdivisions shall be at least 10 acres in area.\nCELL (1, 1): \na.\nCELL (1, 2): \nA site analysis map;\nCELL (2, 1): \nb.\nCELL (2, 2): \nA conservation and development areas map; and\nCELL (3, 1): \nC.\nCELL (3, 2): \nA preliminary site improvements plan, showing proposed site development, including utilities,\nstreets, other development features, buffers (if applicable), and lot lines located in the proposed\ndevelopment area(s).\nCELL (1, 1): \nCamden County\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLast Updated:\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \n6-27\nCELL (2, 3): \nFebruary 4, 2019\n\nNEW PAGE 340\nARTICLE 151.6 Subdivision Requirements\n6.5 Conservation Subdivision\n6.5.5 Delineation of Conservation and Development Areas\nC.\nRequired Conservation Area\n1.\nThe required conservation area shall occupy at least 50 percent of the total acreage of the conservation\nsubdivision site, but nothing shall limit it from occupying more than 50 percent of a conservation subdivision\nsite.\n2.\nThe conservation area shall be considered open space set-aside subject to the applicable standards in\nSection 7.5, Open Space Set-Aside.\nD.\nMaximum Residential Density\nA conservation subdivision shall be limited to the maximum density for a conservation subdivision in the zoning district\nin which it is located.
