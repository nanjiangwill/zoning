District.\nPurpose: This residential district is intended to maintain a compatible mixture of single-family\nresidential and bona fide farm uses with a density of two families per acre in accordance with\nthe North Carolina State Board of Health recommendations for residential areas without public\nwater and public sewer, and to prevent the development of blight and slum conditions.\nB) R-8MH Residential Manufactured Home Park/Recreational Vehicle Park District.\nPurpose: This residential district is established as per N.C.G.S. 160A-383.1 (zoning\nregulations for manufactured homes) to provide a medium density district in which the\nprincipal use of land is for site-built, single-family dwelling units and approved manufactured\nhome and/or recreational vehicle parks. Uses in this district which require potable water or\nsanitary sewer must be connected to municipal water and municipal sewer.\nC) R-8 Residential Medium Density District.\nPurpose: This residential district is established as a medium density district in which the\nprincipal use of the land is for single-family dwelling units. The regulations of this district are\nintended to provide areas of the community for those persons desiring residences in relatively\nmedium density areas. No buildings, houses, or structures, excepting noncommercial docks or\npiers as specified in section 2-H of this Ordinance, will be erected on the south side of Front\nStreet in this district. Uses in this district which require potable water or sanitary sewer must\nbe connected to municipal water and municipal sewer.\nD) R-8A Residential Single-Family Waterfront District.\nPurpose: This residential district is established to provide a medium density district area in\nwhich the principal use of the land is for single-family residences together with customary\naccessory buildings, structures and docks in conformity with sections 2-F and 2-H of this\nOrdinance. This district is identified on the Town's zoning map and is confined to the existing\nresidential portions on the south side of Front Street. Uses in this district which require potable\nwater or sanitary sewer must be connected to municipal water and municipal sewer.\nE) RC-5 Residential Cluster Development District.\nPurpose: This district is established as a medium to high density district encouraging the\npractice of residential cluster development designed to conserve land, create useable open\nspace, reduce building and infrastructure costs, and provide for more attractive and functional\ncommunities. The regulations of this district are designed to provide greater open space and\nother amenities, while relaxing minimum yard and similar regulations which would apply to a\ntraditional district. Uses in this district which require potable water or sanitary sewer must be\nconnected to municipal water and municipal sewer.\n62\n\nNEW PAGE 83\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\nF) RS-5 Residential Single-Family 5 Development District.\nPurpose: This residential district classification is intended for existing or older neighborhoods\ncharacterized by single-family residences on relatively smaller lots and provides reduced\nsetback requirements and a defined street orientation. The purpose of this district is to provide\nrelief to existing lots of record which make them difficult to be developed as single-family\nresidences. The RS-5 district has a fifty percent (50%) lot coverage restriction which must be\nmaintained. No buildings, houses, or structures, excepting noncommercial docks or piers as\nspecified in section 2-H of this Ordinance, will be erected on the south side of Front Street in\nthis district. Uses in this district which require potable water or sanitary sewer must be\nconnected to municipal water and municipal sewer.\nG) TCA Townhomes, Condominiums, Apartments District.\nPurpose: This district is established to provide a high density district in which the primary uses\nare multi-family residences and duplexes. Uses in this district which require potable water or\nsanitary sewer must be connected to municipal water and municipal sewer.\nH) TR Transitional District.\nPurpose: This intent of this district is to serve as a transition between residential and more\nintensive districts. This includes residential and commercial uses with a low noise and traffic\nimpact which would generally be considered compatible with a residential area which may or\nmay not have buffering requirements as documented in section 19 of this Ordinance. Uses in\nthis district which require potable water or sanitary sewer must be connected to municipal\nwater and municipal sewer.\nI) PUD Planned Unit Development.\nPurpose: This district is defined as an area characterized by an orderly integration of\nresidential, commercial (inclusive of offices and institutions), industrial, and open space land\nuses which conform to the design requirements contained herein.\nJ) CS-MU Cedar Street Mixed-Use District.\nPurpose: The reason for this district is to protect, enhance and guide the redevelopment of the\nCedar Street corridor by reducing visual clutter through the implementation of commercial\ndesign standards and selecting the appropriate type of uses for this district. These standards are\ndesigned to improve the aesthetics, traffic congestion and provide for a solid and vibrant tax\nbase as well as promote the public health, safety and welfare of the town.\nK) H-BD Historic Business District.\nPurpose: The intent of this district is to allow land and structures which provide personal\nservices, retailing, and business services compatible with the district's historic character. This\ndistrict should be limited to the Town's Historic Overlay District and may be subject to\nadditional requirements found within the \"Design Guidelines for the Beaufort Historic District\n& Landmarks.'

compatible mixture of single-family\nresidential and bona fide farm uses with a density of two families per acre in accordance with\nthe North Carolina State Board of Health recommendations for residential areas without public\nwater and public sewer, and to prevent the development of blight and slum conditions.\nB) R-8MH Residential Manufactured Home Park/Recreational Vehicle Park District.\nPurpose: This residential district is established as per N.C.G.S. 160A-383.1 (zoning\nregulations for manufactured homes) to provide a medium density district in which the\nprincipal use of land is for site-built, single-family dwelling units and approved manufactured\nhome and/or recreational vehicle parks. Uses in this district which require potable water or\nsanitary sewer must be connected to municipal water and municipal sewer.\nC) R-8 Residential Medium Density District.\nPurpose: This residential district is established as a medium density district in which the\nprincipal use of the land is for single-family dwelling units. The regulations of this district are\nintended to provide areas of the community for those persons desiring residences in relatively\nmedium density areas. No buildings, houses, or structures, excepting noncommercial docks or\npiers as specified in section 2-H of this Ordinance, will be erected on the south side of Front\nStreet in this district. Uses in this district which require potable water or sanitary sewer must\nbe connected to municipal water and municipal sewer.\nD) R-8A Residential Single-Family Waterfront District.\nPurpose: This residential district is established to provide a medium density district area in\nwhich the principal use of the land is for single-family residences together with customary\naccessory buildings, structures and docks in conformity with sections 2-F and 2-H of this\nOrdinance.
