Existing trees and vegetation, other than exotic, non-native species,\nmay count toward meeting the requirements of this section, when such vegetation is in good\ncondition, is properly protected during development, and helps to further the purpose of the district.\nExisting vegetation that is used to meet the standards of this section shall be maintained or\nreplaced if it dies during the first year after the completion of the development.\n(3) New plant material. Regionally grown and native species of plants are preferred. Any plant\nlisted with the Agricultural Extension Office as a native plant shall be considered to be a native\nplant for these purposes. New plant material shall complement existing site vegetation, should be\nmixed with it and should be integrated with all other natural site features.\n(I) Parking lots; parking lot yards. The purpose of this section is to ensure that the Commercial\nThoroughfare Overlay District of Beech Mountain is an attractive and appealing place for residents\nand visitors. This often means that a higher priority must be placed upon being an attractive and\nfunctional place for people than being convenient for automobiles.\n(1) Parking location. Parking is encouraged to be located to the rear or sides of buildings, with\nthe building fronting on the public way. However, nothing in this section is to prevent the\nestablishment of parking in front of a building so long as the project adheres to all other relevant\nregulations. When parking is to be established in front of buildings, it is recommended that the\napplicant create and utilize on-street parking if such is approved by the NCDOT and/or the town.\n(For the purposes of this section, ON-STREET PARKING is defined as a parking area without a\ndivider between the street and the parking area, in which automobiles directly access the parking\nspaces from the road. On-street parking may be parallel, angled or straight in, as approved by the\nNCDOT and the town.)\n(J) Buffer yards. The purpose of the buffer yard is to provide a transitional area between uses\nthat may differ in development intensity and density. A BUFFER YARD is defined as a planting yard\nthat serves as a visual separation between uses and should be densely planted. No buildings,\nparking areas or other development may encroach within the buffer yard, with the exception of\ntown-approved public walkways or sidewalks. Refer to \u00a7 154.165 for the standards for buffer yards.\n(Ord. 2014-05, passed 12-9-2014; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\u00a7 154.130 ZONING AFFECTS EVERY BUILDING AND USE.\nNo building or land shall hereafter be used and no building or part thereof shall be erected,\nmoved or altered except in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district in which\nit\nis located, except as provided in this chapter.\n(1989 Code, Title V, Ch. 51, Art.
