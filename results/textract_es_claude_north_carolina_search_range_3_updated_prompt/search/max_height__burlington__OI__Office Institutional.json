Dimensional Standards for Wall Signs\nMaximum Number of Signs and Maximum Sign Face Area\nNOTES:\n[1] See Section 8.3.N, Building Fa\u00e7ade Type, for building fa\u00e7ade type determination.\n[2] This is the total amount of allowable wall sign face area per fa\u00e7ade of a single-tenant or a large format retail\nbuilding, regardless of the number of individual wall signs on the fa\u00e7ade. It is also the total amount of allowable wall\nsign face area per individual tenant wall frontage in a multi-tenant building (see Section 8.3.M, Signage Measurement,\nfor determination of individual tenant wall frontage).\n[3] The maximum allowable wall sign face area may increase by 0.5 sf per linear foot of fa\u00e7ade for each additional\nbuilding story above the third floor where the sign is placed.\n[4] Does not include large format retail establishments.\n[5] End units in a multi-tenant building may have a wall sign on a primary, secondary, and tertiary building fa\u00e7ade.\n[6] Wall signs not permitted on secondary or tertiary building facades.\n[7] Wall signs that project into a right-of-way shall maintain a minimum vertical clearance of at least 9 feet above grade.\n[8] Wall signs shall not project into a right-of-way by more than six inches.\nd. Additional Standards for Wall Signs\ni. No wall sign shall be located in a manner that covers or blocks ingress or egress from a door, window, or fire escape.\nii. Any electrical wiring shall be located within the sign or the wall it is affixed to.\niii. Wall signs on secondary or tertiary building walls abutting a residential use shall not be illuminated.\niv. Wall signs that are illuminated shall comply with the applicable limitations on glare in Section 5.7, Exterior Lighting.\nV. Signage may be subject to additional standards identified in Section 3.20.D, Gateway Corridor Overlay (GCO) District.\nvi. A wall sign face area may consist of durable, UV resistant, professionally printed fabric stretched taught over an\ninterior frame is permitted provided the sign does not show visible disrepair (fading, torn corners, etc.).\nvii.
