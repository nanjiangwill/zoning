Prevent the creation or establishment of obstructions that are a hazard to air navigation;\n2. Prevent the types of lighting and markings that are a hazard to air navigation;\n3.\nPrevent the types of electronic impulses or signals that would interfere with radio\ncommunications between aircraft and the Tarboro-Edgecombe County Airport; and\n4. Restrict the allowable land uses in the immediate vicinity of the approaches and traffic\npatterns of the Tarboro-Edgecombe County Airport to non-residential uses that do not\ninvolve high population concentrations and that are not significantly impacted by high levels\nof aircraft noise.\nB.\nINTENT\nIt is the intent of these standards to:\n1. Restrain influences which are averse to the airport property and safe conduct of aircraft in\nthe vicinity of the Tarboro-Edgecombe County Airport;\n2. Prevent creation of conditions hazardous to aircraft operation;\n3. Prevent conflict with land development which may result in loss of life and property; and\n4.
