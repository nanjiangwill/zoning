Some land uses are of such a\nnature and scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediate area and on the entire\ncommunity, which cannot be predetermined and controlled by the standards of a general use district. In\naddition, this process will ensure compatibility with the Town's Land Use Plan and other adopted plans. The\nreview process established in this Article provides for a specific review process subject to specific conditions\nwhich mitigate concerns with the proposed development and ensure compatibility of the use with the\nsurrounding community.\n8.2 - General Requirements.\nProperty may be placed in a conditional district only in response to a petition by the owners of all the\nproperty to be included. Specific conditions applicable to these districts may be proposed by the petitioner\nor the Town, but only those conditions mutually approved by the Town and the petitioner may be\nincorporated into approval and permit requirements.

the property is subject to predetermined ordinance standards and the rules,\nregulations, and conditions imposed as part of the legislative decision creating the district and applying it to\nthe particular parcel or parcels.\nA conditional zoning district allows particular uses to be established only in accordance with specific\nstandards and conditions pertaining to each individual development project. Some land uses are of such a\nnature and scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediate area and on the entire\ncommunity, which cannot be predetermined and controlled by the standards of a general use district. In\naddition, this process will ensure compatibility with the Town's Land Use Plan and other adopted plans. The\nreview process established in this Article provides for a specific review process subject to specific conditions\nwhich mitigate concerns with the proposed development and ensure compatibility of the use with the\nsurrounding community.\n8.2 - General Requirements.\nProperty may be placed in a conditional district only in response to a petition by the owners of all the\nproperty to be included. Specific conditions applicable to these districts may be proposed by the petitioner\nor the Town, but only those conditions mutually approved by the Town and the petitioner may be\nincorporated into approval and permit requirements.

A statement analyzing the reasonableness of\nthe proposed rezoning shall be prepared for each petition to a conditional district. If the petitioner believes\nthat development of their property in a specific manner will lessen the adverse effects upon surrounding\nproperties or otherwise make the rezoning more in accordance with development principles found in the\nTown's Land Use Plan, they may apply for a rezoning to the appropriate conditional zoning district, as found\nin Section 7.1. Conditional zoning districts do not have any inherent permitted or conditional uses;\ndevelopment activities are only allowed through specific conditions approved by the Town Board. Those\nuses permitted and conditions approved by the Town Board shall be reflected on the Conditional Zoning\nDistrict Supplement issued by the Zoning Administrator. Proposed development activities shall be consistent\nwith the established permitted and conditional uses of the corresponding general use zoning district. The\npetitioner shall meet all of the requirements of the corresponding general use zoning district. If the\npetitioner elects to petition for conditional district zoning, the petition must specify the following:\n(1) The actual use or uses intended for the entire tract or any part or parts thereof, for the parcel\nor parcels specified in the petition;\n(2) Actual use or uses shall be specified permitted or conditional uses in the corresponding\ngeneral use zoning district, found in Article 7, \"Table of Permitted Uses\", of this Ordinance;\nand\n(3) If the petitioner petitions for two (2) or more conditional zoning districts, the petitioner shall\nsubmit a separate petition for each district.\nIn addition, the petition shall be accompanied by a site specific development plan as required by Section\n8.6 of this Article. In the event of an approval, the site plan shall be binding as to the location and extent of\nall proposed development activities on the parcel.\n8.3 - Compliance With General Use District Provisions.\nAny petition to amend district boundaries to create a conditional zoning district shall comply with\nprocedures and provisions for general use district amendments set out in this Ordinance, especially Article 4\nof this Ordinance.\n8.4 - Conditions on Development Activities.\nA landowner petitioning to rezone land to a conditional zoning district may propose conditions to be\nplaced on the property should a rezoning to a conditional zoning district be approved by the Town Board.\nThe petition shall specify any proposed conditions on the petition and the site specific development plan as\nrequired. These conditions shall be in addition to the limitation on uses as provided in Section 8.2 above.\nabout:blank\n55/167\n", "page_number": 53, "page_range": [53, 54, 55], "highlight": ["1): \nB-1\nCELL (12, 2): \nCELL (12, 3): \nCELL (12, 4): \nCELL (12, 5): \nCELL (12, 6): \nCELL (13, 1): \n<em>Central</em>", "<em>Business</em>\nCELL (13, 2): \nCELL (13, 3): \n3 (f)\nCELL (13, 4): \n0 (e)\nCELL (13, 5): \n0 (e)\nCELL (13, 6):", "17, 5): \n20\nCELL (17, 6): \n50 (b)\n\nNEW PAGE 54\n6/3/24, 7:55 PM\nDobson, NC Code of Ordinances\n(a) 15 <em>feet</em>", "from edge of right-of-way where abutting a street or 45 <em>feet</em> from the center of the\nstreet (assuming", "(b) Additional <em>height</em> above the specified limits for every foot or fraction thereof of building\n<em>height</em>"], "score": 5.4934173, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Central Business\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"B-1-C\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"B1C\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"B-1-C\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 160, 161, 162, 163]}
