The district is designed to facilitate stated public policies to encourage\ndesign which emphasizes lively, people-oriented environments and compatible, visually interesting development. This district provides areas where moderate scale mixed use centers can locate\nwith an emphasis on development of a balance of residential, office and commercial uses.\nIt is further intended that the mixed use districts shall encourage development within which mutually supporting residential, commercial and office uses are scaled, balanced and located to\nreduce general traffic congestion by providing housing close to principal destinations, and convenient pedestrian and bicycle circulation systems and mass transit to further reduce the need for\nprivate automobile usage. Mixed use districts are intended to encourage development that allows multiple destinations to be achieved with a single trip. These standards encourage a design such\nthat uses within a mixed use district are arranged in a manner that encourages internal vehicular trip capture and the development patterns that encourage walking, transit and bicycling as\nalternatives to automotive travel.\nWhen such districts adjoin residential development or residential zoning districts, it is intended that arrangement of buildings, uses, open space, and vehicular or pedestrian and bicycle access\nshall be such as to provide appropriate transition and reduce potentially adverse effects.\n(a) The mixed-use village conditional zoning district (MU-V-CZD) is permitted only upon approval of a conditional zoning district rezoning application by the town council pursuant to section 4.4.5\nof this appendix.\n(b) Permitted uses and development intensities.\n(1) The uses permitted in the MU-V-CZD include the following:\nA. Vertical mixed-use buildings, or\nB. Uses listed in subsection (2), below, which are mixed horizontally. Uses are \"mixed horizontally\" where:\ni. Such uses comprise not less than the minimum, and not more than the maximum, percentage of floor area prescribed in subsection (b)(2)A, below; and\nii. Uses within a land use category set forth below, are located not further than eight hundred (800) feet from the uses located within another land use category;\niii. The uses within separate land use categories, as set forth below, are linked by a continuous system of sidewalks or trails. Sidewalks or trails shall be considered \"continuous\" if they\nare interrupted only by street intersections, but shall not be considered \"continuous\" if interrupted by natural or man-made barriers to pedestrian and bicycle movement or by\na\nstreet consisting of more than two (2) lanes of traffic, unless a pedestrian and bicycle island is provided.\n(c) Land use categories.\n(1) An MU-V shall include office, commercial, and residential uses as described below.

Dimensional standards.\nPurpose statement: It is the intent of this article to provide for performance standards which serve to define the development character of an area, and to ensure the compatibility of development both\nwith the environmental characteristics, accessibility levels, and special amenities offered by the development site and with surrounding land uses and development intensities. It is further intended that the\nestablishment of intensity regulations reflect the protection of critical environmental areas and the suitability of land for a particular level of development intensity, in accord with the goals and objectives of\nthe comprehensive plan.\nThe setback and height regulations established in the dimensional matrix are intended to ensure adequate solar access, privacy, and ventilation; access to and around buildings, off-street parking areas,\nloading space, and service areas; space for landscaping; and spacing between buildings and portions of buildings to reduce potential adverse effects of noise, odor, glare, or fire. Adequate solar access is\ndeemed to consist of varying levels of access ranging from rooftop solar access in high-intensity zoning districts to south wall solar access in low-intensity zoning districts.\n3.8.1 Establishment and General Applicability of Dimensional Regulations.\nExcept as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, regulations governing the dimensions of lots and buildings are hereby established as described in section 3.8.2 and shown in Table 3.8-1.\n(a) No land or structure shall be used or occupied, and no structure, or part thereof, shall be constructed, erected, altered, or moved except in compliance with the dimensional regulations herein\nspecified for each zoning district.\n(b)\nNo portion of land used in connection with an existing or proposed structure or use of land and necessary for compliance with the dimensional regulations of this article shall also be used,\nthrough sale or otherwise, as part of the land required in connection with any other development.\n(c) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, dimensional regulations applicable to OI-3 and OI-4 zoning districts and planned development zoning lots shall be applied to the district or lot as a\nwhole and not to individual parts thereof.\n3.8.2 Dimensional Regulations.\nAbout the Building Envelope. Sections (f)-(j) define the three-dimensional building envelope. All structures, or portions thereof, must be placed within the building envelope and may not encroach the\nbuilding envelope unless specifically exempted by this Appendix.\nDivisions (f) and (g) regulate the setback height and core height, respectively, which together define the vertical extent of the building envelope.\nDivisions (h)-(j) regulate the street, interior, and north setback lines, respectively, which together define the perimeter setback line and horizontal extent of the building envelope.\nDefinitions. Refer to Appendix A for definitions of applicable terms.\n(a) Zoning District. Column (A) refers to the applicable Zoning District. The requirements set forth in sections (b)-(i) below, relate to the zoning district specified in the row under Column (A),\n(b) Minimum Lot Size. Column (B) is expressed in square feet of gross land area.\nNotes:\n(1) Where a zoning lot is located in more than one zoning district, the minimum gross land area required of such zoning lot shall be the sum of the areas derived by multiplying the minimum\ngross land area required for each represented district by the proportion of the zoning lot located within that district.\n(2) For all uses that consist of three (3) or more dwelling units, the minimum lot size is two (2) times the figure shown in Column (B).\n(c) Minimum Frontage. Column (C) is the minimum width of the lot measured along the street.\nNotes:\n(1) Where a zoning lot fronts on two (2) or more streets, minimum street frontage width requirements shall be considered met if the frontage along any one of such streets meets the minimum\nstreet frontage width requirements.\n(2) Where a zoning lot fronts on a turning circle of a cul-de-sac or at a point of a street where the radius of the curvature of the right-of-way is less than ninety (90) feet, the minimum street\nfrontage width requirement shall be thirty-five (35) feet.\n(d) Minimum Lot Width. Column (D) is the minimum width of the lot, expressed in feet, measured at least twenty-five (25) feet interior from the minimum street setback. No portion of a lot, created\nas part of a subdivision, between a street setback and the opposite interior (rear) setback, shall be less than twenty (20) feet in width.\nException:\n(1) Authorized flag lots, created as part of a subdivision and subject to the lot layout standards in section 5.2, may contain areas between a street setback and the opposite interior (rear) setback\nthat are less than twenty (20) feet in width. Authorized flag lots shall reach the minimum lot width at a point not to exceed two hundred (200) feet from the street right-of-way.\nNotes:\n(2) Where a zoning lot fronts on two (2) or more streets, minimum lot width requirements shall be considered met if the lot width at the street setback from any one of such streets meets the\nminimum lot width requirement.\n(3)\nWhere a zoning lot fronts on a turning circle of a cul-de-sac or at a point of a street where the radius of the curvature of the right-of-way is less than ninety (90) feet, the minimum lot width\nshall be reached at a distance derived by the following formula: D = 50 (W)(35) 50, where W = minimum required lot width, and D = maximum distance from street right-of-way to where the\nlot width equals the minimum required width for that district.\n(e) Maximum Setback Height: Column (E) is the maximum allowable height at the perimeter setback line of a zoning lot, as defined by the minimum street, interior, and solar setbacks.\n(1)\nHeight shall be measured from mean finished grade, along the street fa\u00e7ade of the building. Where a structure fronts more than one (1) street, height shall be measured from the lower, more\nrestrictive mean finished grade.\n(2)\n42 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 43\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nTo determine mean finished grade, take the spot elevations from the highest and lowest points of the foundation. The average of these two (2) spots elevations is the mean finished grade and the elevation\nfrom which height measurements are made.\n(3) The entire structure, and all portions thereof, is subject to the maximum setback height.\nExceptions:\nA. The structure or part thereof is below the allowable core height, as described in division (g) below.\nB. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted in section 3.8.3 Exceptions to Setback and Height Requirements, below.\nC. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted as provided elsewhere in this Appendix.\n(4) For purposes of applying setback and height regulations to development within an OI-3 or OI-4 zoning district or within a townhouse development or a planned development, all contiguous\nland within the district, townhouse development, or planned development shall be considered as a single zoning lot.\n(f) Maximum Core Height: Column (F) is the maximum allowable height in the interior or core area of a lot. The core height provides additional allowable height on the interior of a zoning lot based\non the horizontal distance measured away from the perimeter setback line of the lot. The allowable core height increases with the distance interior to the lot, measured from the perimeter\nsetback line at a rate described below.\n(1) In all Zoning Districts, except those explicitly named in subdivision (2), the allowable core height increases at a rate of one (1) foot in height for every two (2) feet of distance interior to the lot,\nmeasured away from the perimeter setbacks. This is equivalent to a slope of 1/2 (rise/run) or 1:2.\n(2) In the Town Center 1 to 3, Office/Institutional 3 to 4 zoning districts the allowable core height increases at the following rates:\nA. Street and interior setbacks: one (1) feet in height for every one (1) feet of distance interior to the lot, measured away from the street and interior setbacks. This is equivalent to a slope of\n1/1 (rise/run) or 1:1.\nB. Solar setbacks: one (1) feet in height for every one (1) foot and seven-tenths of a foot (1.7 feet) of distance interior to the lot, measured away from the street and interior setbacks. This is\nequivalent to a slope of 1/1.7 (rise/run) or 1:1.7.\n(3) No structure, or part thereof, shall project beyond the allowable core height of a structure or part thereof.\nExceptions:\nA. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted in section 3.8.3 Exceptions to Setback and Height Requirements, below.\nB. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted as provided elsewhere in this Appendix.\n(4) If a structure is located in the vicinity of an airport, the height limitations set forth in Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 77, or successor regulations, shall apply where such limitations are\nstricter than those established in this appendix.\n(g) Minimum Street Setback. Column (G) establishes a minimum setback from the street right-of-way line. Where a zoning lot fronts on a street with a right-of-way width not meeting the standards of\nthis appendix, street setback shall be measured from a line running parallel to the centerline of the street at a distance from such centerline equal to one-half (1/2) the standard right-of-way width\nof the street.\nException:\n(1) The town manager or town council may exempt lots from this requirement upon making one (1) of the following findings:\nA. Where a building line has already been established by existing structures along the block which are situated on lots comprising at least twenty-five (25) percent of the street frontage, the\nbuilding may be constructed at the established building line; or\nB. The existing right-of-way is adequate to encompass any anticipated need for widening of the street or other improvements and widening of the right-of-way to town standards would\ncreate nonconforming street setbacks for other structures on the street.\n(h) Minimum Interior Setback. Column (H) establishes a minimum setback measured from the interior lot lines.\nException:\n(1) The interior setback requirements may be reduced to zero (0) under certain conditions (see section 5.2.8.).\nNote:\n(2) Side setbacks are set at zero (0) in many non-residential districts in order to encourage the formation of a street wall, as is found in traditional commercial centers such as the TC district along\nFranklin Street.\n(i) Minimum Solar Setback. Column (I) establishes a minimum setback measured from north lot lines. Where a solar setback and either a street or interior setback both apply to the same portion of a\nlot line, the required minimum setback shall be the greater of the two (2).\nExceptions:\n(1) The solar setback may be reduced to zero (0) under certain conditions (see section 5.2.8).\n(2) Minimum solar setback requirements shall not apply to any structure, or part thereof, when the proposed height of the structure is ninety (90) percent, or less, of the maximum allowed\nsetback height. In such cases, the lesser interior setback may be used instead.\n(j)\nMaximum Impervious Surface Ratio. Column (J) establishes the maximum ratio of impervious surface on a lot. The maximum amount of impervious surface area is divided by multiplying the gross\nland area of the lot by the ratio established in Column (K) and as described below:\n(1) Single-family and two-family residential development: (.50)\n(2) Multifamily developments, fraternities and sororities, non-residential, or mixed-use development: (.70).\nException:\n(3) Impervious surface restrictions shall not apply to town center zoning districts.\n(k) Maximum Floor Area Ratio. Maximum floor area allowed shall be the number of square feet derived by multiplying gross land area by the applicable floor area ratio (FAR) as shown in Table 3.8.1.\nExceptions:\n(1) A maximum floor area ratio shall not apply to:\nA. Dwelling Units, Single-Family\nB. Dwelling Units, Single-Family with Accessory Apartment\nC. Dwelling Units, Single-Family with Cottage\nD. Public Cultural Facilities\n(2) For two-family dwellings on a single zoning lot, the floor area shall be .40 in all zones and overlay zones, except where the overlay zone establishes a more restrictive floor area ratio for\nduplexes.\n(3)\nFor public elementary and secondary schools, the maximum floor area ratio shall be 0.174 unless a higher floor area ratio is established in Column (L).\n43 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 44\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(4) Where a lot is partially within the resource conservation district, the maximum allowable floor area of the portion of the lot outside of the resource conservation district shall be calculated\nthe sum of:\nas\nA.
