A flush wall sign is mounted or applied directly to the building wall, generally on the fascia.

A hanging sign is suspended from a simple bracket attached to a building wall and\nrequires eight (8) or more feet of vertical clearance from the ground. It is most appropriately used along pedestrian-oriented\nstreets to identify attached or closely spaced shops, restaurants, and service businesses. Only one (1) hanging sign is\npermitted per building or business bay (in a multi-tenant building). The sign face area does not include the area of the\nbracket. A hanging sign may project no more than four (4) feet from the building wall. It may project up to three (3) feet over\na sidewalk in a city maintained right-of-way (or state ROW if permitted).

Wall mounted signs.\na. One or a combination of the wall sign types below may be used on a building. Wall sign area is the total of the square\nfootage of all wall signs associated with a business or structure.\nb. A flush wall sign is mounted or applied directly to the building wall, generally on the fascia. It may in no instance\nextend above the parapet; in the residential and mixed use districts, it must be located below the parapet.\nC. A hanging sign is also a wall sign. A hanging sign is suspended from a simple bracket attached to a building wall and\nrequires eight (8) or more feet of vertical clearance from the ground. It is most appropriately used along pedestrian-oriented\nstreets to identify attached or closely spaced shops, restaurants, and service businesses. Only one (1) hanging sign is\npermitted per building or business bay (in a multi-tenant building). The sign face area does not include the area of the\nbracket. A hanging sign may project no more than four (4) feet from the building wall. It may project up to three (3) feet over\na sidewalk in a city maintained right-of-way (or state ROW if permitted). However, in any case the sign shall no be closer\nthan three (3) feet to a power or other utility line or the outside edge of street pavement.\nd. A canopy or lawning sign is sign copy applied directly onto a canopy or lawning.\n2. Ground mounted signs (defined as follows):\na. A monument sign is mounted generally flush with the ground plane. It may not be mounted on a pole or pylon, nor\nraised by mounting on a man-made berm, wall, or similar structure. Supporting elements may not exceed three (3) feet in\nheight and are included in measurement of sign height.\nb. A raised sign may hang from a pole and beam frame as illustrated below, or be placed within a frame mounted on up\nto two (2) supporting poles.\n(Ord. of 12-7-04, No. 37-02)\nSec. 9-3-166 Sign measurement.\n1. Sign face area. The area within a single, continuous perimeter enclosing the characters, lettering, logos, illustrations,\nand ornamentation, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate the sign\nfrom the background against which it is placed.\n2. Sign height. The distance from the ground plane beneath the sign to the highest point of the sign's frame.\nOrnamentation atop signs, such as small caps and spires, are not included in the height measurement.

Concrete sidewalks, minimum five (5) feet wide, shall be built along all street frontages of the lot according to city\nspecifications (four (4) inches thick except at non-residential driveways it shall be six (6) inches thick).

A TIS shall be required for all development that experiences a change in zoning classification\nafter the effective date of this chapter and is projected to generate one thousand five hundred (1,500) daily trips. A TIS may\nbe required by the City of Claremont for any redevelopment or change in use of an existing occupied development that has\nexperienced a change in zoning classification after the effective date of this chapter that would generate one thousand\n(1,000) additional daily trips, and shall be required when the subject development is expected to generate one thousand five\nhundred (1,500) additional daily trips, subject to the exception set out below.\nWhen sufficient information on the proposed development is available for the City of Claremont to determine that the\naforementioned criteria is met, a TIS shall be submitted with all preliminary plats, site plans, site plan revisions, and special\nuse permit applications. The trip rates shall be based on trip generation rates contained in the latest edition of Trip\nGeneration published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers or any local trip generation rates either published or\napproved by the City of Claremont. Additional trips shall be determined by subtracting the gross trip generation of the\nexisting use from the gross trip generation of the proposed use. The additional trip calculation shall apply to property that is\noccupied at the time of submittal or has been occupied at any time prior to submittal.\nIf a development or property experiences a change in zoning classification after the effective date of this chapter and\nspecial circumstances exist, the City of Claremont may require a TIS without regard to the expected trip generation of the\ndevelopment. Factors that would warrant such a requirement are:\n1. There are existing levels of service deficiencies in the area of the proposed development. (\"Level of Service\" as\ndefined in the Highway Capacity Manual - Transportation Research Board Special Report 209) and/or\n2. Available accident data and/or operational and geometric factors indicate safety concerns.\nNotwithstanding the above, a TIS shall not be required if the property to be rezoned or developed has been the subject of\na TIS within the previous three (3) years and the projected trip generation of the newly proposed development is equal to or\nless than the previous study performed and the trip distribution has not significantly changed. As a part of subdivision, site\nplan and driveway permit approval, the City of Claremont may require needed transportation improvements for the property\nrequesting development approval; however, a TIS shall not be utilized as a means for staff to require the party developing\nthe property to make needed transportation improvements remote from the property for which the TIS is submitted, nor shall\nidentified deficiencies in level of service automatically preclude approval of the proposed development.\nThe TIS shall address the proposed land use, the trip generation therefrom, site access, modal splits if appropriate,\nimpacts on the transportation system from the proposed development, and physical improvements or enforceable\nmanagement strategies to mitigate negative impacts. At a minimum, the TIS shall identify the improvements necessary to\n\nNEW PAGE 21\nmaintain Level of Service D for streets and intersections as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual - Transportation\nResearch Board Special Report 209. Any TIS, whether required or voluntarily prepared, must be prepared by a licensed\nengineer in accordance with city guidelines. Additionally, the TIS should be reviewed and approved by city staff before being\nconsidered by City Council or any planning agency of the city.\nDevelopments/properties that have not experienced a change in zoning classification since the effective date of this\nchapter are not required to prepare a TIS as a part of their site plan approval.

Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets, highways,\nor railroads, or rights-of-way of same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such\ndistance there from as indicated on the zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use\nof the scale shown on said zoning map.\n4. Where a district boundary line divides a lot in single ownership, the district requirements for the least restricted portion\nof such lot shall be deemed to apply to the whole thereof, provided that such extensions shall not include any part of such a\nlot more than thirty-five (35) feet beyond the district boundary line.
