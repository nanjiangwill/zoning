GENERAL INDUSTRIAL (M-2) DISTRICT\nA.\nM-2 DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENT\nThe General Industrial (M-2) district is established to accommodate heavy manufacturing, assembly,\nfabrication, processing, distribution, storage, and research and development. It is typically located in\nareas with good access to surface transportation by trucks and rail. Development takes place on larger\nlots and is often enclosed by security fencing. The district accommodates large-scale industrial uses\nincluding outdoor operations or storage with extensive movement of vehicles, materials, and goods,\ntruck traffic and greater potential for adverse environmental and visual impacts on neighboring lands.\nThe district also allows limited forms of heavier commercial use types, but residential development is\nprohibited (except for caretaker quarters as an accessory use). District standards are intended to\nprevent the establishment of any use types that would interrupt industrial operations. Development\nshall comply with all applicable standards in Article 6.

STREETSCAPE BUFFERS\nA.\nPURPOSE AND INTENT\nStreetscape buffers are proposed to soften the view of development from the arterial and\ncollector street rights-of-way, and are intended to:\n1. Enhance pedestrian orientation and encourage pedestrian travel;\n2. Address urban heat islands by providing shade for streets and sidewalks;\n3. Provide shade on pavement;\n4. Support property values by enhancing the aesthetic character of the community; and\n5. Provide habitat for flora and fauna.\nB.\nAPPLICABILITY\n1. The standards in this section shall apply to all lot lines bounded by the following features,\nwhether existing or identified in the County's adopted policy guidance.\ni. Collector streets; and\nii. Arterial streets.\n2. In cases where a future street is planned but its approximate location is not indicated on an\nadopted or approved County map or plan, streetscape buffering shall not be required on\nlots abutting the future street alignment.\nC.\nEXEMPTION\n1. Streetscape buffers are not required along lot lines abutting the following features:\ni. Driveways, private drives, or alleys;\nii. Lot lines abutting platted street rights-of-way that are or have remained unopened for\nat least 15 years; or\niii. Lot frontages where the entirety of the lot frontage is within a required sight distance\ntriangle.\n2. Development providing street trees in accordance with Section 6.5.11, Street Trees, is not\nrequired to provide streetscape buffers.\nD.\nREQUIRED PLANT MATERIAL\nStreetscape buffers shall be configured in one of the following three ways (see Figure 6.5.10,\nStreetscape Buffer Configuration):\n1. Three canopy trees for every 100 linear feet of lot frontage; or\n2. Two canopy trees and two understory trees for every 100 linear feet of lot frontage; or\n3. Four understory trees for every 100 linear feet, where overhead utilities are present.\nE.\nPLACEMENT\n1.

STREETSCAPE BUFFERS\nA.\nPURPOSE AND INTENT\nStreetscape buffers are proposed to soften the view of development from the arterial and\ncollector street rights-of-way, and are intended to:\n1. Enhance pedestrian orientation and encourage pedestrian travel;\n2. Address urban heat islands by providing shade for streets and sidewalks;\n3. Provide shade on pavement;\n4. Support property values by enhancing the aesthetic character of the community; and\n5. Provide habitat for flora and fauna.\nB.\nAPPLICABILITY\n1. The standards in this section shall apply to all lot lines bounded by the following features,\nwhether existing or identified in the County's adopted policy guidance.\ni. Collector streets; and\nii. Arterial streets.\n2. In cases where a future street is planned but its approximate location is not indicated on an\nadopted or approved County map or plan, streetscape buffering shall not be required on\nlots abutting the future street alignment.\nC.\nEXEMPTION\n1. Streetscape buffers are not required along lot lines abutting the following features:\ni. Driveways, private drives, or alleys;\nii. Lot lines abutting platted street rights-of-way that are or have remained unopened for\nat least 15 years; or\niii. Lot frontages where the entirety of the lot frontage is within a required sight distance\ntriangle.\n2. Development providing street trees in accordance with Section 6.5.11, Street Trees, is not\nrequired to provide streetscape buffers.\nD.\nREQUIRED PLANT MATERIAL\nStreetscape buffers shall be configured in one of the following three ways (see Figure 6.5.10,\nStreetscape Buffer Configuration):\n1. Three canopy trees for every 100 linear feet of lot frontage; or\n2. Two canopy trees and two understory trees for every 100 linear feet of lot frontage; or\n3. Four understory trees for every 100 linear feet, where overhead utilities are present.\nE.\nPLACEMENT\n1. Vegetation required as part of a streetscape buffer shall be located outside the street right-\nof-way.\n2. Canopy trees shall be located within ten feet of the right-of-way edge.\n3. Understory trees shall be located within five feet of the right-of-way edge.\n4. An alternative location may be approved by the Zoning Administrator in cases where\nunderground utilities, drainage easements, topography, or other obstructions make\nplacement of streetscape buffer vegetation in accordance with these standards impractical.\nF.\nPROHIBITED FEATURES\nOff-street parking, off-street loading, merchandise display, or outdoor storage shall not take\nplace within a required streetscape buffer.\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage\n393\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n", "page_number": 391, "page_range": [391, 392, 393], "highlight": ["3, 3): \nR-30 &\nR-20\nCELL (3, 4): \nR-10\nCELL (3, 5): \nOI &\nB-1\nCELL (3, 6): \nB-2 &\nM-1\nCELL (3, 7): \n<em>M</em>-", "<em>2</em>\nCELL (4, 1): \nAR-30\nCELL (4, 2): \nNone\nCELL (4, 3): \nNone\nCELL (4, 4): \nNone\nCELL (4, 5): \nA\nCELL (", "CELL (8, 3): \nC\nCELL (8, 4): \nB\nCELL (8, 5): \nA\nCELL (8, 6): \nNone\nCELL (8, 7): \nNone\nCELL (9, 1): \n<em>M</em>-", "<em>2</em>\nCELL (9, 2): \nC\nCELL (9, 3): \nC\nCELL (9, 4): \nC\nCELL (9, 5): \nB\nCELL (9, 6): \nA\nCELL (9, 7): \nNone", "PROHIBITED FEATURES\n<em>Off</em>-<em>street</em> <em>parking</em>, off-street loading, merchandise display, or outdoor storage shall"], "score": 7.3659267, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"General Industrial\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"M-2\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"M2\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"M-2\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking space for each\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 459\nARTICLE 6.
