Classification of Unlisted Uses. The listings of permitted and special uses in the various\ndistricts in this Ordinance are considered to be specific in regard to the types of uses\nintended for each of the districts. When a proposed use is not specifically listed in the\nPermitted Uses Table, the Administrator shall determine the most similar use in the Table of\nPermitted Uses and classify the proposed use in the same manner with respect to whether it\nis permitted or prohibited in a specific district, as well as for the purposes of applying any\nspecial requirements or development standards to such use.\n2. Uses Not Specifically Listed. A use not specifically listed in the Table of Permitted Uses is\nprohibited unless the Ordinance Administrator determines the use to be the equivalent of a\nlisted use in conformance with the standards of Subsection 1.\n3. Final Determinations. Following his determination of the classification of a proposed\nunlisted use, the Ordinance Administrator shall make a written finding and keep a record of\nsuch findings to ensure consistent application of such administrative interpretations.\n6.3 Principal Uses\nTable 6-1 lists the principal uses that are permitted by right, permitted with a Special Use Permit,\npermitted subject to an Overlay District, or prohibited in each Base District. The following is a key to\nthe notations in the Table of Permitted Uses:\n1. Permitted Use (P). A \"P\" in the table indicates that the use is permitted by right in the district.\n2. Special Use (S). An \"S\" in the table Indicates that the use requires the approval of a Special\nUse Permit by the Planning & Zoning Board.\n3. Prohibited. A blank space under a zoning district column indicates that a use is not\npermitted in that district. Where a use is listed in the Table of Permitted Uses, but is not\nindicted as being permitted in any district, such use shall be prohibited throughout the\njurisdiction of this Ordinance.\n4. Performance Standards. An \"X\" in the \"PS\" column indicates that the use has special\nrequirements for the zoning district(s) in which it is permitted.\n6.4 Accessory Uses\nCELL (1, 1): \nWater Storage Tanks and Towers\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (1, 6): \nCELL (1, 7): \nPPPPPPPPPP\nCELL (1, 8): \nCELL (1, 9): \nCELL (1, 10): \nCELL (1, 11): \nCELL (1, 12): \nCELL (2, 1): \nWater Treatment Plants\nCELL (2, 2): \nP\nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (2, 5): \nCELL (2, 6): \nCELL (2, 7): \nCELL (2, 8): \nCELL (2, 9): \nCELL (2, 10): \nPP\nCELL (2, 11): \nCELL (2, 12): \nCELL (3, 1): \nWireless Telecommunications Towers\nCELL (3, 2): \nS\nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (3, 4): \nCELL (3, 5): \nCELL (3, 6): \nCELL (3, 7): \nCELL (3, 8): \nCELL (3, 9): \nCELL (3, 10): \nSSSSX\nCELL (3, 11): \nCELL (3, 12): \nCELL (4, 1): \nWood Product Processing and Manufacturing (Excluding\nPaper Products)\nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (4, 3): \nCELL (4, 4): \nCELL (4, 5): \nCELL (4, 6): \nCELL (4, 7): \nCELL (4, 8): \nCELL (4, 9): \nCELL (4, 10): \nS\nCELL (4, 11): \nCELL (4, 12): \n\nNEW PAGE 46\n1.

Classification of Unlisted Uses. The listings of permitted and special uses in the various\ndistricts in this Ordinance are considered to be specific in regard to the types of uses\nintended for each of the districts. When a proposed use is not specifically listed in the\nPermitted Uses Table, the Administrator shall determine the most similar use in the Table of\nPermitted Uses and classify the proposed use in the same manner with respect to whether it\nis permitted or prohibited in a specific district, as well as for the purposes of applying any\nspecial requirements or development standards to such use.\n2. Uses Not Specifically Listed. A use not specifically listed in the Table of Permitted Uses is\nprohibited unless the Ordinance Administrator determines the use to be the equivalent of a\nlisted use in conformance with the standards of Subsection 1.\n3. Final Determinations. Following his determination of the classification of a proposed\nunlisted use, the Ordinance Administrator shall make a written finding and keep a record of\nsuch findings to ensure consistent application of such administrative interpretations.\n6.3 Principal Uses\nTable 6-1 lists the principal uses that are permitted by right, permitted with a Special Use Permit,\npermitted subject to an Overlay District, or prohibited in each Base District. The following is a key to\nthe notations in the Table of Permitted Uses:\n1. Permitted Use (P). A \"P\" in the table indicates that the use is permitted by right in the district.\n2. Special Use (S). An \"S\" in the table Indicates that the use requires the approval of a Special\nUse Permit by the Planning & Zoning Board.\n3. Prohibited. A blank space under a zoning district column indicates that a use is not\npermitted in that district. Where a use is listed in the Table of Permitted Uses, but is not\nindicted as being permitted in any district, such use shall be prohibited throughout the\njurisdiction of this Ordinance.\n4. Performance Standards. An \"X\" in the \"PS\" column indicates that the use has special\nrequirements for the zoning district(s) in which it is permitted.\n6.4 Accessory Uses\nCELL (1, 1): \nWater Storage Tanks and Towers\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (1, 6): \nCELL (1, 7): \nPPPPPPPPPP\nCELL (1, 8): \nCELL (1, 9): \nCELL (1, 10): \nCELL (1, 11): \nCELL (1, 12): \nCELL (2, 1): \nWater Treatment Plants\nCELL (2, 2): \nP\nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (2, 5): \nCELL (2, 6): \nCELL (2, 7): \nCELL (2, 8): \nCELL (2, 9): \nCELL (2, 10): \nPP\nCELL (2, 11): \nCELL (2, 12): \nCELL (3, 1): \nWireless Telecommunications Towers\nCELL (3, 2): \nS\nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (3, 4): \nCELL (3, 5): \nCELL (3, 6): \nCELL (3, 7): \nCELL (3, 8): \nCELL (3, 9): \nCELL (3, 10): \nSSSSX\nCELL (3, 11): \nCELL (3, 12): \nCELL (4, 1): \nWood Product Processing and Manufacturing (Excluding\nPaper Products)\nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (4, 3): \nCELL (4, 4): \nCELL (4, 5): \nCELL (4, 6): \nCELL (4, 7): \nCELL (4, 8): \nCELL (4, 9): \nCELL (4, 10): \nS\nCELL (4, 11): \nCELL (4, 12): \n\nNEW PAGE 46\n1. Permitted Accessory Uses. Accessory uses are permitted in conjunction with permitted\nprincipal uses. To be classified as an accessory use, the proposed use must meet the\nfollowing standards:\na. The proposed use is clearly incidental to the principal use with which it is associated;\nb. The proposed use is customarily associated with the principal use with which it is\nassociated;\nC. The proposed use is subordinate in the principal use, meaning that it would not be\nestablished without the presence of the permitted principal use;\nd. The use contributes directly to serving an identifiable need of the permitted principal\nuse; and\ne. The use is located on the same lot as the permitted principal use with which it is\nassociated.\n2. Prohibited Accessory Uses. Uses which do not meet the standards of Subsection 1 above\nshall be prohibited. In no case shall an accessory use be established prior to the\nestablishment of the permitted principal use on the property on which it is proposed.\n3. Accessory Use of Residences for Customary Home Occupations. The accessory use of\nresidential dwellings for customary home occupations shall be permitted subject to the\nstandards of Subsection 1(a) and the following:\na. Such use shall be conducted entirely within a dwelling used for residential purposes,\nexcept that in the RA District, customary home occupations may be established within\na permitted accessory structure.\nb. The area of the dwelling used for the customary home occupation may not exceed\ntwenty-five percent (25%) of the gross floor area of the dwelling or five-hundred\nsquare feet (500ft2), whichever is less.\nC. Where permitted, an accessory structure used for a customary home occupation may\nnot exceed two-hundred percent (200%) of the gross floor area of the residence with\nwhich it is associated, or two-thousand square feet (2,000ft2), whichever is less.\nd. No more than one (1) employee, other than immediate family members residing in the\ndwelling may be employed or otherwise engaged in the customary home occupation.\ne. The exterior of the structure shall not be altered to accommodate the customary home\noccupation.\nf. Retail sales associated with a home occupation are prohibited, with the exception of\nart, crafts or similar products that are produced on the premises in association with\nthe customary home occupation.\ng. The outdoor storage of equipment, stock or other materials used in conjunction with\nthe home occupation is prohibited, with the exception of one (1) licensed motor\nvehicle used in conjunction with the business.\nh.
