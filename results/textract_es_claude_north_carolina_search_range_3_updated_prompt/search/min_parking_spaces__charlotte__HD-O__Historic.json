The surface cleaning of structures,\nif appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible.\nCELL (8, 1): \n(h)\nCELL (8, 2): \nSignificant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be\nprotected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation\nmeasures shall be undertaken.\nCELL (9, 1): \n(i)\nCELL (9, 2): \nNew additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not\ndestroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work\nshall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the\nmassing, size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic\nintegrity of the property and its environment.\n\nNEW PAGE 371\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 2: HISTORIC DISTRICTS\nundertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential\nform and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be\nunimpaired.\n(3)\nParking Standards. All structures within a historic district shall comply with the\nregulations of the underlying zoning district, except where the Historic District\nCommission, in considering an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness,\nshall find that the number of off-street parking spaces and/or design standards for\nparking lots specified in the underlying zoning district would render the site\nincompatible with the historic aspects of the district. In such case, the Historic\nDistrict Commission may recommend to the Board of Adjustment a variance to\nthe provisions of the off-street parking requirements and/or design standards. The\nBoard of Adjustment shall authorize as a variance a reduced standard concerning\noff-street parking provided it finds:\n(a)\nThat the lesser standard will not create serious problems due to increased\non-street parking; and\n(b)\nThat the lesser standard will not create a threat to the public safety.\nSection 10.211. Ordinary maintenance.\nNothing in these provisions should be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance, repair, or\nremoval of any exterior architectural feature in a historic district which does not involve a\nchange in design, material, or outer appearance nor to prevent the construction, reconstruction,\nalteration, restoration, or demolition of any such feature which the building inspector or similar\nofficial shall certify is required for public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition.\nThe Historic District Commission staff shall be consulted and/or the feature shall be well\ndocumented photographically and such documentation shall be made available to the Historic\nDistrict Commission for its files, if appropriate.\nSection 10.212. Demolition or removal.\n(1)\nAfter the designation of a historic district, no building or structure located in that\ndistrict shall be demolished or otherwise removed until the owner of the property\nhas applied for a certificate of appropriateness for demolition or removal. If the\nHistoric District Commission determines that the property does not contribute to\nthe character of the historic district because of age or structural condition, the\nHistoric District Commission may grant a certificate of appropriateness for the\nimmediate demolition or removal of the property. However, if the property is\ndetermined by the Historic District Commission to be a contributing element in\nthe district, the Historic District Commission may delay demolition or removal for\nno more than 365 days. During such 365-day period, the Historic District\nCommission may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort\n10 8\n\nNEW PAGE 372\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 2: HISTORIC DISTRICTS\nto find a means of preserving the building.\n(2)\nAn application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the demolition of a\nbuilding or structure within the district may not be denied. However, the effective\ndate of such a certificate may be delayed for a period of up to 365 days from the\ndate of approval. The maximum period of delay authorized by this section shall\nbe reduced by the Historic District Commission where it finds that the owner\nwould suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use of\nor return from such property by virtue of the delay. If the Historic District\nCommission finds that the building has no particular significance or value toward\nmaintaining the character of the district, it shall waive all or part of such period\nand authorize earlier demolition or removal.\n(3)\nIf the Commission has voted to recommend designation of an area as an Historic\nDistrict and final designation has not been made by City Council, the demolition\nor destruction of any building, site, or structure located in the proposed District\nmay be delayed by the Commission for a period of up to 180 days or until City\nCouncil takes final action on the designation, whichever occurs first. Should City\nCouncil approve the designation prior to the expiration of the 180-day delay\nperiod, an application for a certificate of appropriateness for demolition must then\nbe filed; however, the maximum period of delay for such demolition certificate\nshall be reduced by the Commission by the period of delay while the designation\nwas pending.\nSection 10.213. Appeal to Zoning Board of Adjustment.\n(1)\nAn appeal in the nature of certiorari may be taken by any aggrieved party to the\nZoning Board of Adjustment from the Historic District Commission's action\ngranting or denying the certificate of appropriateness pursuant to Chapter 5 of\nthese regulations.\n(2)\nAny appeal must be filed with the Board of Adjustment within thirty days from-\nreceipt of the written notice of the issuance or denial of the certificate. When\nfirst-class mail is used to deliver notice, three days shall be added to the time to\nfile the petition. An appeal from the Board of Adjustment's decision in any such\ncase shall be heard by the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County.\n(3)\nIf it is necessary to have a verbatim transcript prepared for the Board of\nAdjustment, then the petitioner shall pay for that expense and any other\nappropriate, reasonable expenses for the preparation of the record. The transcript\nmust be received by the Zoning Board of Adjustment prior to the appeal hearing\non the Historic District Commission's action granting or denying the certificate of\nappropriateness. If the final decision by the Board of Adjustment or by a court is\nin favor of the petitioner, then the City shall reimburse the petitioner for the costs\ninvoiced by the City for the preparation of the record.\n10 9\n", "page_number": 370, "page_range": [370, 371, 372], "highlight": ["NEW PAGE 370\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 2: <em>HISTORIC</em> DISTRICTS\n(Petition No. 2015-094, \u00a7 10.210,(1) 04/18/2016", "of Appropriateness,\nshall find that the number of <em>off</em>-<em>street</em> <em>parking</em> spaces and/or design standards", "the provisions of the <em>off</em>-<em>street</em> <em>parking</em> <em>requirements</em> and/or design standards.", "The\nBoard of Adjustment shall authorize as a variance a reduced standard concerning\n<em>off</em>-<em>street</em> <em>parking</em>", "of the <em>historic</em> district because of age or structural condition, the\n<em>Historic</em> District Commission may"], "score": 8.760464, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Historic\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"HD-O\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"HDO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"HD-O\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking space for each\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [7, 8, 9, 10, 212, 213, 214, 369, 370, 371, 372]}
