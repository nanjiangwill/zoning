Some of these districts are designated as historic districts, others may lack sufficient historical, architectural or cultural significance at\nthe present time to be designated as historic districts. As a matter of public policy, the town council aims to preserve, protect, enhance, and perpetuate the value of these residential neighborhoods or\ncommercial districts through the establishment of neighborhood conservation districts.\nThe purposes of a neighborhood conservation district in older town residential neighborhoods or commercial districts are as follows:\nTo promote and provide for economic revitalization and/or enhancement\nTo protect and strengthen desirable and unique physical features, design characteristics, and recognized identity, charm and flavor\nTo protect and enhance the livability of the town;\nTo reduce conflict and prevent blighting caused by incompatible and insensitive development, and to promote new compatible development;\nTo stabilize property values;\nTo provide residents and property owners with a planning bargaining tool for future development;\nTo promote and retain affordable housing;\nTo encourage and strengthen civic pride; and\nTo encourage the harmonious, orderly and efficient growth and redevelopment of the town.\n(a) Designation criteria. To be designated a neighborhood conservation district, the area must meet the following criteria:\n(1) The area must contain a minimum of one (1) block face (all the lots on one (1) side of a block);\n(2) The area must have been platted or developed at least forty (40) years prior to the date of the submittal and acceptance of a petition to initiate Phase One of the neighborhood conservation\ndistrict process, or prior to a town council action to initiate Phase One of the neighborhood conservation district process;\n(3) At least seventy-five (75) percent of the land area in the proposed district is presently improved;\n(4) The area must possess one (1) or more of the following distinctive features that create a cohesive identifiable setting, character or association;\nA. Scale, size, or type of construction;\nB. Lot layouts, setbacks, street layouts, alleys or sidewalks;\nC. Special natural or streetscape characteristics, such as creek beds, parks, gardens or street landscaping;\nD. Land use patterns, including mixed or unique uses or activities; or\nE. Abuts or links designated historic landmarks and/or districts.\n(5) The area must be predominantly residential in use and character.\nAny designated historic overlay district shall be deemed to satisfy the criteria listed above.\n(b) Zoning authority. Separate ordinances are required to designate each district. Ordinances designating each neighborhood conservation district shall identify the designated district boundaries,\nand specify the individual purposes and standards for that district.\n(1) Overlay district. Neighborhood conservation districts are designed as overlays to the regular zoning districts. Property designated within these districts must also be designated as being within\none (1) of the general use districts. Authorized uses must be permitted in both the general use district and the overlay district. Property designated as a neighborhood conservation district\nmay have additional designations. Such property shall comply with all applicable use restrictions.\n33 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 34\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(2) Zoning designation.\nA. The zoning designation for property located within a neighborhood conservation district shall consist of the base zone symbol and the overlay district symbol (CD) as a suffix.\nNeighborhood conservation districts shall be numbered sequentially to distinguish among different districts, i.e., R-4 (CD-1), R-1 (CD-2), etc.\nB. The designation of property within a neighborhood conservation district places such property in a new zoning district classification and all procedures and requirements for zoning/\nrezoning must be followed.\nC. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of a specific neighborhood conservation district ordinance and the general use district regulations, the provisions of the neighborhood\nconservation district ordinance shall control.\nD. Except as modified by this section, the procedures for zoning changes set forth in section 4.4 shall otherwise apply to the designation of an area as a neighborhood conservation district.\n(c) Initiation. The process to initiate the designation of a neighborhood conservation district shall consist of two (2) phases. Phase One must be completed in order to initiate Phase Two.\n(1) Phase One shall consist of a town sponsored public information meeting to provide general information about neighborhood conservation districts including a review of existing neighborhood\nconservation districts and an explanation of the rezoning process.\nA. Phase One may be initiated by the town council; by property owners representing fifty-one (51) percent of the land area within the proposed district, upon submittal and acceptance of a\npetition by the town council; or by fifty-one (51) percent of property owners in a proposed district upon submittal and acceptance of a petition by the town council.\nB. The town manager shall prescribe the form(s) on which a neighborhood conservation district petition is made.\nC.\nThe planning commission shall review the council motion or the petition to initiate Phase One of the process to create a neighborhood conservation district.

No. 2015-11-23/0-16, adopted Nov. 23, 2015, states that upon notification by the University of North Carolina that the Horace Williams Airport is closed, subsection 3.6.1, which\npertained to the Airport Hazard District shall be repealed.\n3.6.2 Historic Districts.\nPurpose statement: The historic district is intended to protect and conserve the heritage and character of the Chapel Hill community by providing for the preservation of designated areas within the\nplanning jurisdiction, including individual properties therein that embody important elements of social, economic, political, or architectural history, and by promoting the stabilization and enhancement of\nproperty values throughout such areas. The purpose of requiring regulation of placement and design of telecommunications equipment in this district is to help achieve these objectives and to protect the\nspecial character of the historic district.\nIt is intended that these regulations ensure, insofar as possible, that buildings or structures in the historic district shall be in harmony with other buildings or structures located therein. However, it is not\nthe intention of these regulations to require the reconstruction or restoration of individual or original buildings, or to prohibit the demolition or removal of such buildings, or to impose architectural styles\nfrom particular historic periods, but rather to encourage design, whether contemporary or traditional, which is harmonious with the character of the historic district.\n(a) Establishment of historic district.\n(1) The historic district is hereby established as a district which overlays other zoning districts established in sections 3.3-3.5. The boundaries of the historic district are as shown on the official\nzoning atlas.\n(2) No new historic district or any change to the boundaries of any existing historic district shall be designated until the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, or its successor agency,\nshall have been given an opportunity, in accord with Chapter NCGS 160D-944, or its successor statutes, to make recommendations with respect to the establishment of such new district or\nchange in the boundaries of an existing district.\n(3) The use and development of any land or structure within the historic district shall comply with use regulations and intensity regulations applicable to the use district in which it is located.\n(b) Certificate of appropriateness required.\n(1) No exterior portion of any building or other structure (including masonry walls, fences, light fixtures, steps and pavement, or other appurtenant features), or any aboveground utility structure,\nor any type of outdoor advertising sign shall be erected, altered, restored, moved, or demolished within the historic district until an application for a certificate of appropriateness as\nto\nexterior architectural features has been approved. For purposes of this article, \"exterior architectural features\" shall include the architectural style, general design, and general arrangement of\nthe exterior of a building or other structure, including the kind and texture of the building material, the size and scale of the building, and the type and style of all windows, doors,\nlight\n23 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 24\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nfixtures, signs, and other appurtenant fixtures. In the case of outdoor advertising signs, \"exterior architectural features\" shall be construed to mean the style, material, size, and location of all\nsuch signs.\n(2) A certificate of appropriateness shall be issued prior to the issuance of a zoning compliance permit or any other permit granted for purposes of constructing, altering, or demolishing buildings\nor structures. A certificate of appropriateness shall be required whether or not a zoning compliance permit is required. Any zoning compliance permit or other permit not issued in conformity\nwith this section shall be invalid.\n(3)\nThe town and all public utility companies shall be required to obtain a certificate of appropriateness prior to initiating any changes in the character of street paving, sidewalks, utility\ninstallations, lighting, walls, fences, structures, and buildings on property owned or franchised by the Town of Chapel Hill or public utility companies, excluding regulatory signs, other traffic\ncontrol measures and devices, and utility distribution systems located in public right-of-way.\n(4)\nA certificate of appropriateness application and amendments to a certificate of appropriateness application may be reviewed and approved by the town manager according to specific review\ncriteria contained in state law and Design Principles and Standards approved by the commission when the application is determined to involve minor works or modifications.

Such minor works or modifications shall be limited to those listed in the Commission's Design Principles and Standards, or a successor document. No application\ninvolving a minor work or modification may be denied without the formal action of the commission. Ordinance requirements for notification of affected property owners must be met for all\napplications.\n(c) Certain changes not prohibited.\n(1) Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in the historic district that does not involve a change in design,\nmaterial, or outer appearance thereof, or to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, moving, or demolition of any such feature that the building inspector or similar\nofficial shall certify is required by the public safety because of unsafe or dangerous condition.\n(2)\nOn the basis of preliminary sketches or drawings and other supporting data, the town manager may exempt from requirements for a certificate of appropriateness projects involving the\nordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature that does not involve a change in design, material, or outer appearance thereof. The town manager shall notify the\ncommission of all such exemptions.\n(d) Procedures for approval of certificates of appropriateness.\n(1) Application submittal requirements.\nA.

The town manager or the commission shall approve the application, approve the application with conditions, or deny the application for a certificate of\nappropriateness by the end of the next commission meeting following ninety days after the application is filed; provided, if timely action is not taken, and the time for taking action is not\nextended by the Commission and consented to by written notice from the applicant, the certificate of appropriateness shall be deemed to have been approved as submitted and shall be\nissued administratively.\nThe Commission may extend the time for consideration and deliberation for a period or for periods up to a total of one hundred eighty days from the date of acceptance of the application as\ncomplete, where it finds such action to be necessary:\na) Because of meeting cancellations or postponements, quorum shortages, or backlogs of pending applications with priority by filing date, or other practical considerations; or\nb) To receive additional information requested by the Commission, or to deliberate fully on memoranda submitted by one or more parties, or to seek resolution of outstanding questions,\nissues, or goals.\nNothing herein shall prevent extensions by and with the consent of the Applicant. The time periods for action by the Commission shall be stayed during periods of appeal to the Board\nof\nAdjustment by any party.\nUnder no circumstances shall the time period for which the Commission or staff may take action on an application for a certificate of appropriateness be extended beyond 180 days from the\ndate an application is filed. An application is considered filed when it has been submitted, deemed complete by the town manager, and the requisite application fee has been received by the\nTown.\nThe town manager or the commission may impose such reasonable conditions on the approval of an application as will ensure that the spirit and intent of this article are achieved. An\napplication for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the demolition of a building or structure within the historic district may not be denied. However, the effective date of such a\ncertificate may be delayed for up to three hundred sixty-five (365) days from the date of approval. The maximum period of delay authorized by this section shall be reduced by the commission\nwhere it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use of or return from such property by virtue of the delay. During such period the\ncommission may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building. If the commission finds that the building has no particular\nsignificance or value toward maintaining the character of the historic district, it shall waive all or part of such period and authorize earlier demolition or removal. In every case, the record of\nthe commission's action shall include the reasons for its action.\"\n(6) Actions subsequent to decision. The town manager shall notify the applicant of a decision in writing, and shall file a copy of it with the town's planning department. If the application is denied,\nthe notice shall include the reasons for such action.\n(7) Appeal of decision. A decision by the commission on an application for a certificate of appropriateness may be appealed to the board of adjustment in accordance with the provisions of\nsection 4.10. Appeals of administrative decisions shall be made to the historic district commission pursuant to the relevant procedures in NCGS 160D-405.\n(8) Submittal of new application. If the commission denies an application for a certificate of appropriateness, a new application affecting the same property may be accepted by the town manager\nonly if substantial change, with respect to the reasons for its denial, is made in plans for the proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or moving.\n(9) A certificate of appropriateness shall be valid for three hundred sixty-five (365) calendar days from date of issuance, or, in the case of a certificate for demolition, from the effective date. If the\nauthorized work has not commenced within that period, has not been extended by the commission, or has been discontinued for more than three hundred sixty-five (365) calendar days from\nthe
