Intent. The Mini Farm Overlay District (MFO) permits buildings to be grouped\non a site, parcel, or property in order to optimize the use of land and resources for\nboth residential and agricultural purposes. By clustering development at a density\nno greater than 1.15 unit per developed acre, projects developed in accordance\nwith these standards can obtain density bonuses while preserving unique natural\nfeatures for agricultural use. The Mini Farm Overlay District mandates the\ndedication of both agricultural land and open space with density bonuses provided\nas an incentive for adhering to the standards. It is the intent of this district to be\nused for new development in undeveloped outlying areas of the Town. Allowed\nbuilding/lot type is Detached House.\n(B.) Applicability. The provisions set forth below may be applied, upon designation\nof the property as a Mini Farm Overlay District, to properties with a minimum size\nof 66 acres in the Agricultural zoning district. The provisions of this section shall\nnot be applicable in platted and recorded residential subdivisions.\n(C.) Listed Uses: See underlying Primary General-Use District for Listed Uses.\n(D.) Listed Building and Lot Type: Detached House\n(E.) Development standards. The following development standards shall apply to\ndevelopments approved in accordance with the provisions of this section:\n(1.) Maximum density shall be one dwelling per 0.34 acre of the Tract(s) within the\nMFO district, excluding Accessory Dwellings meeting the limitations of and in\naccordance with Article 10, Section 10.1-3.\n(2.) There shall be a minimum separation of 12 feet between all enclosed structures.\n(3.) Parking shall comply with the requirements set forth in Article 12.\n(F.) Agricultural and Open Space. Not less than 67% of the site shall be conveyed as\nCommon Agricultural and Open Space. The provision and design of agricultural\nand open space shall comply with the requirements set forth below.\n(1.) Common agricultural and open space provided by a development shall be\nconveyed as follows:\n(a.) To the Town of Coats and accepted by it for park, open space,\nagricultural, or other specified use or uses, provided that the conveyance is\napproved by the Town Board of Commissioners; or\n(b.) To a nonprofit organization whose principal purpose is the conservation\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 37\n\nNEW PAGE 168\nof open space, to a corporation or trust owned or to be owned by the\nowners of lots or dwelling units within the development, or to owners of\nshares within a cooperative development. If such a corporation or trust is\nused, ownership shall pass with the conveyances of the lots or dwelling\nunits. Such corporation or trust shall maintain the property in use for\nagricultural purposes and/or as open space.\n(2.) Where the common agricultural and open space in a development is conveyed\npursuant to subparagraph 1.b above, a deed restriction enforceable by the\nTown of Coats shall be recorded that provides that the common agricultural\nand open space shall:\n(a.) be maintained in the authorized conditions(s); and\n(b.) not be developed for principal uses, accessory uses (e.g., parking), or\nroadways, with the exception that gazebos, tool sheds, barns, shelters, or\nsimilar accessory uses and structures may be constructed within the\nagricultural and common open space upon approval of the Planning,\nZoning and Subdivision Administrator.\n(G.)

These parks may be ideally suited for\nalternative designs such as Tiny House, Park Model and other styles of housing\nwhere installation standards are considered temporary.

The standards\nand specifications set forth below are established to ensure that new development and\nconstruction is enduring and compatible with the character of the Town of Coats, that it\naccomplishes the purposes of this Ordinance, and that it achieves the goals identified in\n\"the Plan\" referenced in Article 1 of this Ordinance and other adopted and or approved\nplans.\n9.2\nDetached House Lot and Building Type\n9.2-1 Description. The detached house is the most prevalent building type in Coats. The\ndetached house building type is generally found in residential neighborhoods,\nalthough it may coexist with other, similarly scaled buildings in commercial or\nmixed-use areas. Where possible, structures should be designed to maintain a\nharmonious image of the neighborhood when viewed from a distance. Where\nappropriate and possible, structures shall be designed to terminate vistas. For\ndetached homes on large lots accessed by a private drive, building placement and site\nplanning shall be dictated by landscape features and landscape preservation. Within\nthe limits described below and unless the zoning district standards require greater\nmeasures, these regulations shall apply to all houses built in the Town of Coats.\nThe photographs of
