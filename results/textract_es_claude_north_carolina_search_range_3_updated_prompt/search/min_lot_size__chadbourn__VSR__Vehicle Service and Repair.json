Intent: The Vehicle Service and Repair District (VSR) is established to provide\nlocations for specific uses that, due to their unique characteristics and importance\nto the community, and the traveling public, require different criteria and\nspecifications than typical commercial development. Development standards in\nthe Vehicle Service and Repair District acknowledge that the automobile is the\nprimary mode of transportation in suburban communities and there is a vital need\nfor such businesses to be located in close proximity to one another. Uses within\nthe Vehicle Service and Repair District are buffered from adjacent uses. The\ndominant uses in this district are vehicle oriented and/or dependent and include\nvehicle-based services, vehicle repair shops and disabled vehicle storage areas.\nThe Vehicle Service and Repair District is reserved for uses which require broad\nmaneuvering spaces and avoid pedestrian interaction with potentially hazardous\nconditions. Goals of the Vehicle Service and Repair District include providing a\npleasant environment for motorists, a safe environment for pedestrians along the\nnetwork of streets and pedestrian facilities; promoting the safety of motorists and\npedestrians; and preserving the capacity of Main Street and it's interconnecting\nnetwork of streets outside the core area as shown in the adopted Town Plan. Uses\nin this district include heavy commercial goods and services for motor vehicles,\nand some limited industrial. Allowed building/lot type is Highway Commercial.\n(B.) Listed Uses:\n(1.) Uses listed by right: See Table of Uses (Table 8.1) of this Article\n(2.) Uses listed with additional standards: See Table of Uses (Table 8.1) of this\nArticle and Article 10, Section 10.1\n(3.)
