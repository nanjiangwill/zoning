The district also allows commercial\nactivities intended to serve the primary businesses in the district and their employees. Uses allowed in\nthe district do not require large amounts of land or large building areas for operation nor large yard\nareas for isolation or protection from adjoining premises or activities. Activities take place almost\nentirely indoors and result in minimal exterior movement of vehicles, materials, and goods in areas\naround the district. Buildings are situated so as to have minimal visual impacts and are well-screened\nfrom adjacent lower intensity uses. Heavy industrial uses and uses with significant adverse impacts on\nadjoining lands, residential uses, and other low-intensity uses are prohibited. District standards are\nintended to prevent the establishment of any use types that would interrupt industrial operations.\nDevelopment shall comply with all applicable standards in Article 6.
