Purpose. The purpose of establishing supplementary requirements for development in\ndowntown Pilot Mountain is to protect and enhance the visual character of development and\nto preserve the unique streetscape of downtown by encouraging compatibility among\ndowntown structures. It is not the intent of this overlay district to eliminate architectural\nfreedom or discourage innovative design, but rather to complement the Town of Pilot\nMountain's Development Ordinance and development guidelines for Downtown.\n2.\nApplicability. Buildings within the Downtown Design Overlay (DDO) District exhibit design\nelements that contribute to the unique sense of character of downtown Pilot Mountain.\nSpecifically, buildings tend to have flat or low pitch roofs concealed by the front facade\nparapet, no front or side yard setback, large storefront windows on the street level floor and\nstrong horizontal separations between the first and any upper floors created by windows and/\nor changes in fa\u00e7ade materials.\nIn order to continue and, in some cases, recreate the historic development pattern of\ndowntown Pilot Mountain, the following standards shall apply to all new construction,\nadditions and substantial modifications to existing structures located within the Downtown\nDesign Overlay (DDO) District. For the purposes of this section substantial modification shall\nbe defined as any work which involves the alteration of the building's footprint, construction of\nadditional stories, changes in roof pitch, modification of building fenestration and entryways,\nmaterial changes to the building fa\u00e7ade, or painting.\n3. Exemptions. When in compliance with all other town ordinances, the following types of\nprojects are exempt from the standards of the Downtown Design Overlay (DDO) district:\na.

Purpose. The purpose of establishing supplementary requirements for development in\ndowntown Pilot Mountain is to protect and enhance the visual character of development and\nto preserve the unique streetscape of downtown by encouraging compatibility among\ndowntown structures. It is not the intent of this overlay district to eliminate architectural\nfreedom or discourage innovative design, but rather to complement the Town of Pilot\nMountain's Development Ordinance and development guidelines for Downtown.\n2.\nApplicability. Buildings within the Downtown Design Overlay (DDO) District exhibit design\nelements that contribute to the unique sense of character of downtown Pilot Mountain.\nSpecifically, buildings tend to have flat or low pitch roofs concealed by the front facade\nparapet, no front or side yard setback, large storefront windows on the street level floor and\nstrong horizontal separations between the first and any upper floors created by windows and/\nor changes in fa\u00e7ade materials.\nIn order to continue and, in some cases, recreate the historic development pattern of\ndowntown Pilot Mountain, the following standards shall apply to all new construction,\nadditions and substantial modifications to existing structures located within the Downtown\nDesign Overlay (DDO) District. For the purposes of this section substantial modification shall\nbe defined as any work which involves the alteration of the building's footprint, construction of\nadditional stories, changes in roof pitch, modification of building fenestration and entryways,\nmaterial changes to the building fa\u00e7ade, or painting.\n3. Exemptions. When in compliance with all other town ordinances, the following types of\nprojects are exempt from the standards of the Downtown Design Overlay (DDO) district:\na. Interior and exterior alterations of buildings that were originally designed and built for\nsingle-family residential use and continue to be used for single-family residential use.\nb. Underground construction which does not consist of any above ground components,\nincluding utility boxes, pipes, poles or similar appurtenant features;\nC. Conducting regular maintenance work on buildings, landscaping, or grounds,\n(including parking lots), which does not significantly alter the appearance or function\nof the building, landscaping or grounds;\nd. Interior remodeling work, which does not involve the alteration of any building\ncomponent that does not alter any exterior building component;\ne. Landscape maintenance and upkeep, excluding the replacement trees;\nf. Temporary uses and structures;\ng. Routine roof maintenance and repair, when using like materials; and\nh. Painting of murals on the side and/or rear fa\u00e7ade of buildings.\n4.

Expansions to structures classified as existing\n\nNEW PAGE 87\ndevelopment must meet the requirements of this section; however, the built-upon area of the\nexisting development is not required to be included in the density calculations.\nA pre-existing lot owned by an individual prior to the effective date of this section, regardless\nof whether or not a vested right has been established, may be developed for single-family\nresidential purposes without being subject to the restrictions of this section. However, this\nexemption is not applicable to multiple contiguous lots under single ownership.\n3. Cluster Development. Minimum lot sizes are not applicable to single-family cluster\ndevelopments projects; however, the total number of lots shall not exceed the number of lots\nallowed for single-family detached developments. The overall residential density or\nnonresidential built-upon area shall not exceed that allowed for the critical area or the\nbalance of the watershed, whichever is applicable.\n4. Buffer Zone Required\na. A buffer zone for the purposes of this requirement is defined as an area of natural\nor\nplanted vegetation through which storm water runoff flows in a diffuse manner so that\nthe runoff does not become channelized and which provides for infiltration of the\nrunoff and filtering of pollutants. The buffer zone is measured from the normal pool\nelevation of impounded structures and from the bank of each side of streams and\nrivers.\nb. No new development is allowed in the buffer zone, except for water dependent\nstructures and public projects such as road crossings and green ways where no\npractical alternative exists.\nC. These activities should minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff away from the\nsurface waters and maximize the utilization of storm water best management\npractices.\nd. A minimum thirty (30') foot vegetative buffer zone for development activities is\nrequired along all perennial waters indicated on the most recent versions of U.S.G.S.\n1:24,000 (7.5 minute) scale topographic maps or as determined by local government\nstudies, unless a high density option is chosen and then a one-hundred (100') foot\nbuffer zone is required. Desirable artificial stream bank or shoreline stabilization\nis\npermitted.\n5. Ordinance Administrator's Duties. It shall be the duty of Ordinance Administrator to\nadminister and enforce the provisions of this section as follows:\na.
