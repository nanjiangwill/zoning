Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n91.72 PRIMARY ZONING DISTRICTS.\nFor the purposes of this Unified Development Ordinance, the town is hereby divided into the following primary zoning districts.\n(A) R-15 Residential District. The R-15 Residential District is intended as a single-family residential area with a low to medium population\ndensity. Certain structures and uses of governmental, educational, religious and noncommercial recreational natures are either permitted\noutright or are subject to special conditions intended to preserve and protect the residential character of this district.\n(B) R-12 Residential District. The R-12 Residential District is intended as a single-family residential area with a low to medium population\ndensity. Certain structures and, uses of governmental, educational, religious and noncommercial recreational natures are either permitted\noutright or are subject to special conditions intended to preserve and protect the residential character of this district.\n(C) R-8 Residential District. The R-8 Residential District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for single-family,\ntwo-family and multi-family residences. The regulations of this district are intended to provide areas of the community for those persons\ndesiring residence and multi-family structures in medium density neighborhoods. The regulations are intended to discourage any use which\nbecause of its character would interfere with the residential nature of this district.\n(D) R-6 Residential District. The R-6 Residential District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for single-family,\ntwo-family and multi-family residences. The regulations of this district are intended to provide areas in the community for those persons\ndesiring small residences and multi-family structures in relatively high density neighborhoods. The regulations are intended to discourage any\nuse which because of its character would interfere with the residential nature of this district. The R-6 District was in effect prior to the date of\nadoption of this Unified Development Ordinance and shall continue in effect for those areas following the date of adoption of this Unified\nDevelopment Ordinance. It is the intention of the town that there will be no additional R-6 zoning.\n(E) MFH I Manufactured Home District I. The MFH I Manufactured Home District I is established as a district in which the principal use of\nland is for double-wide manufactured homes Class \"A.\"\n(F) MFH // Manufactured Home District II. The MFH II Manufactured Home District II is established as a district in which the principal use of\nland is for Class \"B\" manufactured homes.\n(G) O/I Office and Institutional District. This district is established primarily for office and institutional uses which cause no offensive noises,\nodors, smoke, fumes, excessive traffic or other objectionable conditions. This district may serve as a buffer between residential and\ncommercial/industrial districts.\n(H) NB Neighborhood Business District. The regulations for this district are designed to permit a concentrated development of permitted\nfacilities which are normally adjacent to non-federal highways and routinely adjacent to residential areas.\n(I) HC Highway Commercial District. The HC Highway Commercial District is established primarily for those businesses that serve the\ntraveling public, require large areas for displays of goods, and are not oriented to the pedestrian shopper.\n(J) ID Industrial District. The ID Industrial District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for industries which can be\noperated in a relatively clean and quiet manner and which will not be obnoxious to adjacent residential or business districts. The regulations\nare designed to prohibit the use of land for heavy industry, which should be properly segregated, and to prohibit any other use that would\nsubstantially interfere with the development of industrial establishments in the district.\n(K) CRD Conservation Recreation District. This district is established as a district intended to preserve Carolina Shores' essential open\nspace areas, by protecting/preserving natural resources such as: floodplain areas, existing and proposed residential areas, recreational\nresources; and limiting impervious surfaces, thereby reducing stormwater runoff. Conservation zoning may be incorporated into surrounding\ndevelopments. Large lot zoning for single-family residential development is conditionally allowed as an effective way to preserve natural and\ncommunity open space resources.\n(L) PRD Planned Residential District.

Nonconforming uses may be continued subject to the limitations noted herein. For purposes of determining whether a right to\ncontinue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section, all buildings, activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to\nbe considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building or one space in a\nnonconforming manufactured home park for 90 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as\nthe apartment building or manufactured home park as a whole is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a\nnonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter.\n(A) Expansions: no nonconforming use shall be extended, expanded, enlarged or moved to occupy a different or greater area of land,\nbuildings or structures than was occupied by such use at the time it became nonconforming; provided, however, a nonconforming use may be\nextended throughout any parts of a building which were specifically designed and arranged for such use at the time it became nonconforming.\n(B) No building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered\nunless such building or structure is thereafter devoted to a conforming use; provided, however, such building or structure may be enlarged or\nextended upon prior authorization from the Board of Adjustment, which authorization shall not be granted unless the Board of Adjustment\nmakes each of the following findings of fact.\n(1) The proposed enlargement or extension shall be minor or insignificant in relation to the existing building or structure.\n(2) The proposed enlargement or extension shall not increase the intensity of the nonconforming use, which is to say, it will not result in\nan increase in dwelling units for a residential use nor in gross floor area for a nonresidential use.\n(3) The proposed enlargement or extension is designed so that it will not render the use of the property any less compatible than it is in\nits existing circumstances.\n(4) The authorization of such proposed enlargement or extension is not otherwise contrary to the public health, safety or welfare.\n(C) (1) A nonconforming use of a structure may not be changed to another nonconforming use unless such change is authorized by the\nBoard of Adjustment.
