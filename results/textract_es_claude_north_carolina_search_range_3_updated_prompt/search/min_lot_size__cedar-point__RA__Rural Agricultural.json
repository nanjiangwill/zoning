INTENT\nThe Town of Cedar Point North Carolina is committed to sustainable development\nwhile protecting and retaining the natural hydrology of the town's current and future\nsystem of storm water management. Through a series of best management practices\nas related to design and dimensional flexibility, the Town promotes the balance of\nnatural resource protection and development through the utilization of Low Impact\nDevelopment Storm Water Techniques.\nB. LID PROJECT REQUIREMENTS\nAny project that wishes to utilize the dimensional and design standards variations\nallowable under Low Impact Development, as set forth in this section, shall submit\ncertification from a licensed professional that said project conforms to the following\ncriteria. Any project that meets the subsequent criteria shall hereinafter be defined as\na \"LID Project\".\n1. Compliance with all LID requirements for storm water management.\n2. Per Chapter 4: LID Storm Water BMPs of North Carolina State University's Low\nImpact Development: A Guidebook for North Carolina (June 2009) all LID\nProjects must utilize a combination of engineered, structural LID storm water best\nmanagement practices (BMPs) to:\n(a) Design the \"LID Project\" to treat runoff from all surfaces generated by one\nand one-half inches of rainfall, or the difference in the storm water runoff\nfrom all surfaces from the predevelopment and post-development\nPage\n204\n\nNEW PAGE 205\nconditions for a one-year, 24-hour storm, whichever is greater, in order to\nachieve average annual 85% Total Suspended Solids (TSS) removal for the\ndeveloped area of a site.\n(b)\nControl and treat the increase in volume of storm water runoff associated with\npost-construction conditions as compared with pre-construction (existing)\nconditions for the 1-year frequency, 24-hour duration storm event in order to\nachieve a storage volume discharge rate equal to or less than the\npredevelopment discharge rate for the same storm event conditions prescribed\nabove. This may be achieved by any accepted management practice as\ndescribed in the North Carolina Division of Water Quality's Storm Water Best\nManagement Practices Manual, and in consultation with North Carolina State\nUniversity's Low Impact Development: A Guidebook for North Carolina.\nC. ALLOWABLE DIMENSIONAL STANDARD VARIATIONS FOR CERTIFIED\nLID PROJECTS\n1.\nCertified LID Projects in the Residential Zoning Districts shall be granted a 25%\nreduction in the \"Lot Size\" dimensional standard requirements found in Chapter\n5.\n2. Certified LID Projects in the Zoning Districts RA, R-20, R-15, R-15M,\nB-3, B-2, B-1, LIW, and IW shall be granted a 50% reduction in the \"Minimum\nLot Width\", \"Minimum Chord Length at ROW Line for cul-de-sac's\", Minimum\n\"Front\", \"Side\", and \"Rear Yards\", and \"Minimum Required Structure\nSeparation\" dimensional standard requirements.\nD. CERTIFIED LID PROJECT LANDSCAPING AND OPEN SPACE\nREQUIREMENT INCLUSIONS\n1. Residential projects, LID BMPs including but not limited to swales, pocket\nwetlands, bio retention areas, and infiltration trenches shall be allowed to be\nincluded in the acreage requirement for Open Space as prescribed in Section 7.13,\nSO long as the intent of the project's required buffer is met as per Sections 7.3 and\n7.4, BUFFERING AND LANDSCAPING. Basins and other retention and\ndetention facilities shall not be included in the required Open Space.\n2. Non-residential projects, LID BMPs shall be allowed to be incorporated into the\nbuffer and landscaping areas required in Sections 7.3 and 7.4, BUFFERING AND\nLANDSCAPING.\nE. EDUCATIONAL PLACARDS\nAll Certified LID projects meeting the criteria defined in Section 7.17.B. and utilizing\nany Dimensional Standards variations outlined in Section 7.17.C., or any landscaping\nor open space inclusions outlined in Section 7.17.D. shall install durable, all weather\neducational placards no smaller than 0.5 square feet and no larger than 2 square foot\nat each BMP to provide information to the public as to the function and benefit of\nthe best management practice for the life of the BMP.\nF. OPEN SPACE\nAll open space in certified residential LID Projects shall comply with the open space\nrequirements set forth in Section 7.13, OPEN SPACE.\nG. OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT\nAll storm water best management practices (BMP) utilized in any Certified LID\nPage\n205\n\nNEW PAGE 206\nProject to meet the per the requirements of Section 7.17.B., shall be maintained in\naccordance with the recommendations set forth by the NC DENR Division of Water\nQuality. For each BMP, an Operations and Maintenance Agreement shall be\nrecorded with the Carteret County Register of Deeds. These Operation and\nMaintenance Agreement forms can be obtained from the NC DENR DWQ website:\nhttp://portal.ncdenr.org/web/wq/ws/su/bmp-manual\n7.17\nWASTEWATER DISPOSAL\nPlans for a proposed public or community sewage system shall be approved by the\nHealth Department, or Director of the Division of Environmental Management,\nwhichever is appropriate.\nOn-site septic tanks shall be approved by the Carteret County Health Department and/or\ncomply with other agencies and jurisdictions.\n7.18\nWATER SUPPLY\nPlans for a proposed public or community water system shall be approved by the West\nCarteret Water Corporation.\n7.19\nWALLS AND FENCES\nA. The setback requirements of these regulations shall not prohibit any necessary\nretaining wall or prohibit any wall or fence except as regulated below:\n1. On a corner lot, no planting, structure, sign, fence, wall or other obstruction to\nvision more than three (3) feet in height shall be placed or maintained within the\ntriangular area formed by the intersecting right-of-way lines and a straight line\nconnecting points on said street line each of which is ten (10) feet distant from the\npoint of intersection.\n2. For driveways other than for single-family or duplex use, no planting, structure,\nsign, fence or obstruction to vision more than three (3) feet in height shall be\nplaced or maintained within the triangular area formed by the intersection of the\ndriveway, the right-of-way line and a straight line connecting points on said edge\nof pavement of the driveway and right-of-way line which is ten (10) feet distant\nfrom the point of intersection.\nB. Walls and fences of wood construction must be constructed SO that exposed framing\nof each section of fence faces the interior yard.\nC. Within any residential district, no wall or fence shall exceed four (4) feet in height\nwithin a front yard or ten (10) feet in height in a side or rear yard.\nD. Within any commercial district, no wall or fence shall exceed ten (10) feet in height.\nE. Fences used in conjunction with any permitted outdoor recreational use shall not\nexceed ten (10) feet in height in any zoning district.\nF.
