In no case, however, shall minimum lot area be\nless than specified in this table.\n(2) On all corner lots, a 15-foot side yard setback is required except in the CBD, where a five-foot side yard setback is\nrequired.\n(3) In the CBD, where adjacent buildings have front yard setbacks less than five feet, the minimum front setback may be\nequivalent to the adjacent properties.\n(4) Regulations pertaining to mobile home parks are contained in Chapter 150\n(5) Regulations pertaining to Mixed Use (MU) Districts and Traditional Neighborhood Districts (TND) are contained in \u00a7\u00a7\n154.066(A) and 154.066(B), respectively.\n(Ord., Art. IX, passed -\n\u00a7 154.067 BUILDING HEIGHT OVERLAY DISTRICTS.\n(A) Reason for regulation. It is recognized that two major characteristics of the town greatly contribute to the atmosphere,\ncultural heritage and appeal of the whole community. Specifically, the scenic mountain views bounding the town on the north\nand north west and the historic county courthouse located in the middle of town both offer a sense of place and community\nto the town's residents and add to the attractiveness of the area. It is further recognized that the height of buildings, if left\nunregulated or inadequately regulated, can detract from these two features. Therefore, building heights shall be regulated\nbased on the location of the subject building in relation to mountain view-sheds and to the historic county courthouse.\n(B) Establishment of Building Height Overlay Districts The boundaries of the Building Height Overlay Districts shall be\ndepicted on a map named the \"Town of Columbus Building Height Overlay District Map\" and shall be made part of this\nchapter upon adoption of this section.\n(C) Districts. For the purposes of determining maximum building heights, the town shall be divided into the following\nBuilding Height Overlay Districts:\n(1) General;\n(2) Courthouse; and\n(3) Mountain View-Shed.\n(D) General Building Height District. In this district no building shall be taller than 36 feet. However, if the average\nelevation (above mean sea level) of the ridgelines of existing adjacent buildings situated on lots having a common boundary\nwith the subject parcel upon which the proposed building is to be situated (adjacent lots that are vacant not being included in\nthis calculation) is less than the elevation (above mean sea level) determined by measuring 36 feet vertically from the\naverage grade of the proposed building envelope on the subject parcel, then the proposed building shall be no taller than\nthat average. In the event that the average elevation (above mean sea level) of the existing buildings' ridgelines on the\nsurrounding adjacent properties is such that the subject parcel is rendered unbuildable (meaning a single story building with\nan appropriate roof is not feasible), then the proposed building shall have a height not exceeding 29 feet. The determination\nthat a subject parcel is rendered unbuildable under this division (D) shall be at the discretion of the approving administrator,\nboard, or council.\n(E) Courthouse Building Height District. In this district no building's ridgeline shall have an elevation higher than the\nelevation defined by the plane of the soffit of the eave of the roof of the historic county courthouse; however, in no case shall\na buildings height be taller than 29 feet.\n(F) Mountain View-Shed District. Buildings on areas of high elevation are highly visible from surrounding public spaces.\nAs such, buildings in this district shall not be more than 29 feet tall.\n(G) Height. The height of a building shall be measured from the grade of the average grade of the property to the highest\nridge of the roof of the structure.\n(Ord., Art. IX, \u00a7 900, passed - -; Ord. passed - -)\n\u00a7 154.068 FLOOR AREA.\n(A) Potential. Large scale commercial development has the potential to pose many challenges to a relatively small\ncommunity such as the town. The development can overwhelm local police services, undermine a current diversified\ncommercial market, strain the character of the local community, cause excessive vehicular congestion, and can be difficult\nCELL (1, 1): \nIndustrial\nDistrict\n(IND)\nCELL (1, 2): \nSame as\nHC\nCELL (1, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (1, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (1, 5): \n80\nCELL (1, 6): \n30\nCELL (1, 7): \n60\nCELL (1, 8): \n10\nCELL (1, 9): \n20\nCELL (1, 10): \n50\nCELL (2, 1): \nPublic\nService\nDistrict (PD)\nCELL (2, 2): \nSame as\nHC\nCELL (2, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (2, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (2, 5): \n80\nCELL (2, 6): \n30\nCELL (2, 7): \n60\nCELL (2, 8): \n10\nCELL (2, 9): \n20\nCELL (2, 10): \n50\n\nNEW PAGE 25\nto handle once left vacant. As such, the town finds it necessary to limit the allowable floor area of commercial development\nin order to ensure that the development is carried out in a manner that is appropriate and consistent with the character of the\ntown.\n(B) Commercial development. The building footprint of any structure and any accessory structure in the aggregate to be\nused for any commercial enterprise shall not be larger than 10,000 square feet in size. The building's footprint shall be\nconstrued to mean the perimeter line created by the edge of the roof of any structure and building on a lot in the aggregate.\nFor the purposes of this section, the term commercial development shall include any development intended to be used or\npotentially used by for-profit enterprises, including manufacturing and industrial developments, except that those uses\nallowed within the town's Public Service District shall not be considered commercial. It is recognized that in certain\ncircumstances it may be appropriate to allow for a larger building footprint for commercial developments. In order for a\ncommercial structure proposed to have a footprint larger than 10,000 square feet to be constructed, a special use permit\nshall be obtained prior to the commencement of the development. See \u00a7\u00a7 154.082 and 154.083 below for details regarding\nthe issuance of a special use permit for large scale commercial developments.\n(C) Residential development. The building footprint of all newly constructed residential developments shall not be larger\nthan 35% of the lot on which the residential development is proposed to be erected.\n(D) Public service development. Development to be used for any land use allowed in the town's Public Service (PS)\nzoning district shall have no limit on the size of the building footprint.\n(Ord., Art. IX, \u00a7 901, passed -)\nCONDITIONAL AND SPECIAL USES\n\u00a7 154.080 CONDITIONAL USE DISTRICTS.\n(A) For each general use district established in 154.060 through 154.064 above, there is also established a\ncorresponding conditional use district as follows:\n(B) It is recognized that certain types of zoning districts would be inappropriate at certain locations in the absence of\nspecial conditions. Where the applicant for rezoning desires property to be rezoned to such a district in those situations, the\nConditional Use District (CUD) is a means by which the special conditions can be imposed in the furtherance of the\npurposes of this chapter. The Conditional Use District classification will be considered for rezoning only upon request of a\nproperty owner. If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these regulations is found to be illegal or invalid or if the\napplicant should fail to accept any condition, it is the intent of this chapter that the authorization of the conditional use permit\nshall be null and void and of no effect, and that proceedings shall be instituted to rezone the property to its previous zoning\nclassification.\n(C) Within a CUD, only those uses authorized as either permitted or conditional uses in the zoning district with which the\nCUD corresponds shall be permitted, and all other requirements of the corresponding district shall be met as minimum\nstandards. In addition, with a CUD no use shall be permitted except pursuant to a conditional use permit authorized by the\nTown Council, which shall specify the use or uses authorized. The permit may further specify the location on the property of\nthe proposed use or uses, the number of dwelling units, the location and extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots,\ndriveway and access streets, the location and extent of buffer areas, and other special purpose areas, the timing of\ndevelopment, the location and extent of right-of-way and other areas to be dedicated for public use, and other such matters\nas the applicant may propose as conditions upon the request, but not to include conditions not generally a part of land\ndevelopment controls. In granting a conditional use permit, the Town Council may impose additional reasonable and\nappropriate safeguards upon the permit as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose and intent of this chapter are\nserved, public welfare secured and substantial justice done.\n(D) In approving a Conditional Use District Rezoning, the Town Council shall make the following (in addition to the\nfindings for conditional use permits in \u00a7 154.081(C) below) affirmative findings:\n(1) That the use(s) requested is among those listed as an eligible use in the Conditional Use District in which the\nsubject property is located or is to be located; and\n(2) That the location and character of the Conditional Use District if developed according to the site specific plan will

Vehicular turnarounds of various configurations are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately\nprovided.\n5. Pedestrian connections should be provided as extensions of terminating streets where not precluded by\ntopography or other physical constraints.\n6. The average perimeter of all blocks within the TND should not exceed 1,350 feet. No block face should have a\nlength greater than 500 feet without a dedicated alley or pathway providing through access.\n7. A continuous network of rear alleys shall provide vehicular access to lots 49 feet or less in width.\n8. Utilities may run along alleys provided that a permanent public access and utility easement is recorded for the full\nlength of alley being used for utilities or public services such as garbage collection.\n9. TND streets shall be organized according to a hierarchy based on function, size, capacity, and design speed;\nstreets and rights-of-way are therefore expected to differ in dimension. The proposed hierarchy of streets shall be indicated\non the submitted site plan. Each street type in a TND shall be separately detailed.

Alternative methods of assembling the required street elements\nwill be considered to allow neighborhood street designs that are most appropriate to setting and use.\n10. To prevent the buildup of vehicular speed, disperse traffic flow, and create a sense of visual enclosure, long\nuninterrupted segments of straight streets should be avoided. Methods to achieve this interruption include:\n(i) A street can be interrupted by intersections designed to calm the speed and disperse the flow of traffic and\nterminate vistas with a significant feature (building, park, natural feature);\n(ii) A street can be terminated with a public monument, specifically designed building facade, or a gateway to the\nensuing space;\n(iii) Perceived street length can be reduced by a noticeable street curve where the outside edge of the curve is\nbounded by a building or other vertical elements that hug the curve and deflect the view; and\n(iv) Other traffic calming configurations are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately provided.\n(c) Buildings and lots.\n1.

not served by public water and/or sewer shall be subject to approval by the Polk County\nHealth Department to ensure proper operation of septic tanks and wells. In no case, however, shall minimum lot area be\nless than specified in this table.\n(2) On all corner lots, a 15-foot side yard setback is required except in the CBD, where a five-foot side yard setback is\nrequired.\n(3) In the CBD, where adjacent buildings have front yard setbacks less than five feet, the minimum front setback may be\nequivalent to the adjacent properties.\n(4) Regulations pertaining to mobile home parks are contained in Chapter 150\n(5) Regulations pertaining to Mixed Use (MU) Districts and Traditional Neighborhood Districts (TND) are contained in \u00a7\u00a7\n154.066(A) and 154.066(B), respectively.\n(Ord., Art. IX, passed -\n\u00a7 154.067 BUILDING HEIGHT OVERLAY DISTRICTS.\n(A) Reason for regulation. It is recognized that two major characteristics of the town greatly contribute to the atmosphere,\ncultural heritage and appeal of the whole community. Specifically, the scenic mountain views bounding the town on the north\nand north west and the historic county courthouse located in the middle of town both offer a sense of place and community\nto the town's residents and add to the attractiveness of the area. It is further recognized that the height of buildings, if left\nunregulated or inadequately regulated, can detract from these two features. Therefore, building heights shall be regulated\nbased on the location of the subject building in relation to mountain view-sheds and to the historic county courthouse.\n(B) Establishment of Building Height Overlay Districts The boundaries of the Building Height Overlay Districts shall be\ndepicted on a map named the \"Town of Columbus Building Height Overlay District Map\" and shall be made part of this\nchapter upon adoption of this section.\n(C) Districts. For the purposes of determining maximum building heights, the town shall be divided into the following\nBuilding Height Overlay Districts:\n(1) General;\n(2) Courthouse; and\n(3) Mountain View-Shed.\n(D) General Building Height District. In this district no building shall be taller than 36 feet. However, if the average\nelevation (above mean sea level) of the ridgelines of existing adjacent buildings situated on lots having a common boundary\nwith the subject parcel upon which the proposed building is to be situated (adjacent lots that are vacant not being included in\nthis calculation) is less than the elevation (above mean sea level) determined by measuring 36 feet vertically from the\naverage grade of the proposed building envelope on the subject parcel, then the proposed building shall be no taller than\nthat average. In the event that the average elevation (above mean sea level) of the existing buildings' ridgelines on the\nsurrounding adjacent properties is such that the subject parcel is rendered unbuildable (meaning a single story building with\nan appropriate roof is not feasible), then the proposed building shall have a height not exceeding 29 feet. The determination\nthat a subject parcel is rendered unbuildable under this division (D) shall be at the discretion of the approving administrator,\nboard, or council.\n(E) Courthouse Building Height District. In this district no building's ridgeline shall have an elevation higher than the\nelevation defined by the plane of the soffit of the eave of the roof of the historic county courthouse; however, in no case shall\na buildings height be taller than 29 feet.\n(F) Mountain View-Shed District. Buildings on areas of high elevation are highly visible from surrounding public spaces.\nAs such, buildings in this district shall not be more than 29 feet tall.\n(G) Height. The height of a building shall be measured from the grade of the average grade of the property to the highest\nridge of the roof of the structure.\n(Ord., Art.

IX, passed -\n\u00a7 154.067 BUILDING HEIGHT OVERLAY DISTRICTS.\n(A) Reason for regulation. It is recognized that two major characteristics of the town greatly contribute to the atmosphere,\ncultural heritage and appeal of the whole community. Specifically, the scenic mountain views bounding the town on the north\nand north west and the historic county courthouse located in the middle of town both offer a sense of place and community\nto the town's residents and add to the attractiveness of the area. It is further recognized that the height of buildings, if left\nunregulated or inadequately regulated, can detract from these two features. Therefore, building heights shall be regulated\nbased on the location of the subject building in relation to mountain view-sheds and to the historic county courthouse.\n(B) Establishment of Building Height Overlay Districts The boundaries of the Building Height Overlay Districts shall be\ndepicted on a map named the \"Town of Columbus Building Height Overlay District Map\" and shall be made part of this\nchapter upon adoption of this section.\n(C) Districts. For the purposes of determining maximum building heights, the town shall be divided into the following\nBuilding Height Overlay Districts:\n(1) General;\n(2) Courthouse; and\n(3) Mountain View-Shed.\n(D) General Building Height District. In this district no building shall be taller than 36 feet. However, if the average\nelevation (above mean sea level) of the ridgelines of existing adjacent buildings situated on lots having a common boundary\nwith the subject parcel upon which the proposed building is to be situated (adjacent lots that are vacant not being included in\nthis calculation) is less than the elevation (above mean sea level) determined by measuring 36 feet vertically from the\naverage grade of the proposed building envelope on the subject parcel, then the proposed building shall be no taller than\nthat average. In the event that the average elevation (above mean sea level) of the existing buildings' ridgelines on the\nsurrounding adjacent properties is such that the subject parcel is rendered unbuildable (meaning a single story building with\nan appropriate roof is not feasible), then the proposed building shall have a height not exceeding 29 feet. The determination\nthat a subject parcel is rendered unbuildable under this division (D) shall be at the discretion of the approving administrator,\nboard, or council.\n(E) Courthouse Building Height District. In this district no building's ridgeline shall have an elevation higher than the\nelevation defined by the plane of the soffit of the eave of the roof of the historic county courthouse; however, in no case shall\na buildings height be taller than 29 feet.\n(F) Mountain View-Shed District. Buildings on areas of high elevation are highly visible from surrounding public spaces.\nAs such, buildings in this district shall not be more than 29 feet tall.\n(G) Height. The height of a building shall be measured from the grade of the average grade of the property to the highest\nridge of the roof of the structure.\n(Ord., Art. IX, \u00a7 900, passed - -; Ord. passed - -)\n\u00a7 154.068 FLOOR AREA.\n(A) Potential. Large scale commercial development has the potential to pose many challenges to a relatively small\ncommunity such as the town. The development can overwhelm local police services, undermine a current diversified\ncommercial market, strain the character of the local community, cause excessive vehicular congestion, and can be difficult\nCELL (1, 1): \nIndustrial\nDistrict\n(IND)\nCELL (1, 2): \nSame as\nHC\nCELL (1, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (1, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (1, 5): \n80\nCELL (1, 6): \n30\nCELL (1, 7): \n60\nCELL (1, 8): \n10\nCELL (1, 9): \n20\nCELL (1, 10): \n50\nCELL (2, 1): \nPublic\nService\nDistrict (PD)\nCELL (2, 2): \nSame as\nHC\nCELL (2, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (2, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (2, 5): \n80\nCELL (2, 6): \n30\nCELL (2, 7): \n60\nCELL (2, 8): \n10\nCELL (2, 9): \n20\nCELL (2, 10): \n50\n\nNEW PAGE 25\nto handle once left vacant. As such, the town finds it necessary to limit the allowable floor area of commercial development\nin order to ensure that the development is carried out in a manner that is appropriate and consistent with the character of the\ntown.\n(B) Commercial development. The building footprint of any structure and any accessory structure in the aggregate to be\nused for any commercial enterprise shall not be larger than 10,000 square feet in size. The building's footprint shall be\nconstrued to mean the perimeter line created by the edge of the roof of any structure and building on a lot in the aggregate.\nFor the purposes of this section, the term commercial development shall include any development intended to be used or\npotentially used by for-profit enterprises, including manufacturing and industrial developments, except that those uses\nallowed within the town's Public Service District shall not be considered commercial. It is recognized that in certain\ncircumstances it may be appropriate to allow for a larger building footprint for commercial developments. In order for a\ncommercial structure proposed to have a footprint larger than 10,000 square feet to be constructed, a special use permit\nshall be obtained prior to the commencement of the development. See \u00a7\u00a7 154.082 and 154.083 below for details regarding\nthe issuance of a special use permit for large scale commercial developments.\n(C) Residential development. The building footprint of all newly constructed residential developments shall not be larger\nthan 35% of the lot on which the residential development is proposed to be erected.\n(D) Public service development. Development to be used for any land use allowed in the town's Public Service (PS)\nzoning district shall have no limit on the size of the building footprint.\n(Ord., Art. IX, \u00a7 901, passed -)\nCONDITIONAL AND SPECIAL USES\n\u00a7 154.080 CONDITIONAL USE DISTRICTS.\n(A) For each general use district established in 154.060 through 154.064 above, there is also established a\ncorresponding conditional use district as follows:\n(B) It is recognized that certain types of zoning districts would be inappropriate at certain locations in the absence of\nspecial conditions. Where the applicant for rezoning desires property to be rezoned to such a district in those situations, the\nConditional Use District (CUD) is a means by which the special conditions can be imposed in the furtherance of the\npurposes of this chapter. The Conditional Use District classification will be considered for rezoning only upon request of a\nproperty owner. If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these regulations is found to be illegal or invalid or if the\napplicant should fail to accept any condition, it is the intent of this chapter that the authorization of the conditional use permit\nshall be null and void and of no effect, and that proceedings shall be instituted to rezone the property to its previous zoning\nclassification.\n(C) Within a CUD, only those uses authorized as either permitted or conditional uses in the zoning district with which the\nCUD corresponds shall be permitted, and all other requirements of the corresponding district shall be met as minimum\nstandards. In addition, with a CUD no use shall be permitted except pursuant to a conditional use permit authorized by the\nTown Council, which shall specify the use or uses authorized. The permit may further specify the location on the property of\nthe proposed use or uses, the number of dwelling units, the location and extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots,\ndriveway and access streets, the location and extent of buffer areas, and other special purpose areas, the timing of\ndevelopment, the location and extent of right-of-way and other areas to be dedicated for public use, and other such matters\nas the applicant may propose as conditions upon the request, but not to include conditions not generally a part of land\ndevelopment controls. In granting a conditional use permit, the Town Council may impose additional reasonable and\nappropriate safeguards upon the permit as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose and intent of this chapter are\nserved, public welfare secured and substantial justice done.\n(D) In approving a Conditional Use District Rezoning, the Town Council shall make the following (in addition to the\nfindings for conditional use permits in \u00a7 154.081(C) below) affirmative findings:\n(1) That the use(s) requested is among those listed as an eligible use in the Conditional Use District in which the\nsubject property is located or is to be located; and\n(2) That the location and character of the Conditional Use District if developed according to the site specific plan will be\nreasonable and consistent with the surrounding area and with adopted plans of the town.\nCELL (1, 1): \n(1) CU-R-1 Conditional Use R-1 District;\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \n(2) CU-R-2 Conditional Use R-2 District;\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (3, 1): \n(3) CU-CBD Conditional Use CBD District;\nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (4, 1): \n(4) CU-HC Conditional Use HC District;\nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (5, 1): \n(5) CU-IND Conditional Use IND District;\nCELL (5, 2): \nCELL (6, 1): \n(6) CU-PS Conditional Use PS District;\nCELL (6, 2): \nCELL (7, 1): \n(7) CU-MU Conditional Use MU District; and\nCELL (7, 2): \nCELL (8, 1): \n(8) CU-TND Conditional Use TND District.\nCELL (8, 2): \n\nNEW PAGE 26\n(Ord., Art.

Conditional use permits shall only be granted in conjunction with a Conditional Use District\nrezoning, and shall be processed and considered in a quasi-judicial manner by the Town Council. Proposals for a rezoning\nto any Conditional Use District shall always be accompanied by a request for a conditional use permit and shall be heard and\nconsidered simultaneously.\n(B) Approval process.\n(1) The Town Council shall consider the application in accordance with the findings-of-fact in division (C) below. The\nproposals and requests shall be processed and considered in the same procedure as conventional rezoning proposals,\nexcept as otherwise set forth herein, and the voting shall be the same as that required for zoning matters.\n(2) If the Town Council should determine that the property involved in the proposal should be rezoned and the\nconditional use permit issued, it shall adopt an ordinance rezoning the property and authorizing the issuance of a conditional\nuse permit. Otherwise the proposal shall be denied.\n(3) An application shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator and shall be accompanied by a site specific plan with the\nfollowing requirements:\n(a) Existing site conditions, including contours, water courses, identified flood hazard area, and unique natural or\nhuman-made features.\n(b) Boundary lines of the proposed development, proposed lot lines and plot designs;\n(c) Proposed location and use of all existing and proposed structures;\n(d) Location and size of all areas to be conveyed, dedicated or reserved as common open space, parks, recreation\nareas, school sites and similar public and semi-public uses;\n(e) The existing and proposed street system, including location and number of off-street parking spaces, service\nareas, loading areas and major points of access to public right-of-way.
