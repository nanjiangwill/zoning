The town encourages cluster developments as defined in Appendix A [Definitions]. Cluster developments, as defined in Appendix A [Definitions], require modification of lot size\nstandards; individual lots may be somewhat smaller but the sum of reductions in lot area becomes common recreation area for the benefit of all residents of the cluster development. The\nrecreation area is increased and the intensity of development is controlled. Cluster developments also allow the developer greater design flexibility and will permit reasonable use of land with\ndifficult topography.\n(b) Approval requirements. The town council may approve a cluster development in any residential district, or the HR-L or HR-M Special Districts, if it finds that:\n(1) The tract proposed for cluster development is at least two (2) acres in size.\n(2) Public, separate, water supply and sewerage connections are available for every subdivided lot.\n(3)\nThe total number of lots proposed for the tract, excluding parcels of reserved recreation area, is not greater than the number determined by multiplying the total gross land area by the\nmaximum density established in section 3.8 for that zoning district.\n(4) The recreation area reserved within the tract shall conform to the recreation area standards of section 5.5.\n(5) The minimum amount of land reserved as recreation area shall be the sum of all reductions in minimum gross land area as a result of the cluster form of development, combined with the\nminimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5. Only the minimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5 may be dedicated outside the boundaries of the land being\nsubdivided as specified in section 5.5.2.\n(c)\nReductions in lot and setback requirements. For lots created as part of a cluster development, minimum gross land area, minimum lot width, and minimum setback requirements may be reduced\nas follows:\n(1) Minimum lot size requirements specified in section 3.8 may be reduced to five thousand, five hundred (5,500) square feet gross land area.\n(2) Minimum lot width requirements specified in section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to fifty (50) feet.\n(3) Minimum street setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the street lot line forms an exterior boundary of the cluster development.\n(4)\nMinimum interior setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to eight (8) feet except where the interior lot line\nforms a boundary of the cluster development.\n(5) Minimum solar setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the north lot line forms\na\nboundary of the cluster development.\n(d) Floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations. For lots created as part of a cluster development, floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations, as shown in Table 3.8-1, shall be\ncalculated using the gross land area of the lot or the minimum lot size for the zoning district, whichever is greater.\n(Ord.

Except when MU-V\ndevelopment is separated from the residential district by an arterial street with a right-of-way of one hundred (100) feet or greater, in which case the setbacks of the underlying zoning district\nwould apply.\n(2)\nMinimum interior setback adjacent to residentially zoned land shall be equal to the interior setback applicable in the adjacent residential district.\n(3) Minimum solar setback adjacent to residentially zoned land shall be equal to the solar setback applicable in the adjacent residential district.\n(4) The primary height limitation applicable at any of the modified setbacks identified in (1)-(3) above shall not exceed thirty-five (35) feet.\n3.8.5 Reserved.\n3.8.6 Reserved.\nEditor's note- Ord. No. 2010-06-21/0-11, 4, adopted June 21, 2010, repealed subsection 3.8.5, Housing Floor Area Restrictions for Major Subdivisions and subsection 3.8.6, Alternatives to Floor Area\nRestrictions of the Land Use Development Ordinance; provided, however, that in the event Section 2 of this ordinance No. 2010-06-21/O-11 is, subsequent to its enactment, ruled void or unenforceable in its\nentirety or in substantial part by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction, Sections 3.8.5 and 3.8.6 shall be automatically reinstated without the need for further action by the Town Council.\n3.8.7 Incentive for Residential Construction in Town Center (TC) Districts.\nThe purpose of this section is to provide an incentive for the construction of dwelling units in the town center.\n(a) The amount of floor reserved for residential uses on new or expanded lots shall be excluded from the floor area ratio calculation as follows:\nTC Residential Floor Area Bonus\n3.8.8 Cluster Development.\n(a) Generally. The town encourages cluster developments as defined in Appendix A [Definitions]. Cluster developments, as defined in Appendix A [Definitions], require modification of lot size\nstandards; individual lots may be somewhat smaller but the sum of reductions in lot area becomes common recreation area for the benefit of all residents of the cluster development. The\nrecreation area is increased and the intensity of development is controlled. Cluster developments also allow the developer greater design flexibility and will permit reasonable use of land with\ndifficult topography.\n(b) Approval requirements. The town council may approve a cluster development in any residential district, or the HR-L or HR-M Special Districts, if it finds that:\n(1) The tract proposed for cluster development is at least two (2) acres in size.\n(2) Public, separate, water supply and sewerage connections are available for every subdivided lot.\n(3)\nThe total number of lots proposed for the tract, excluding parcels of reserved recreation area, is not greater than the number determined by multiplying the total gross land area by the\nmaximum density established in section 3.8 for that zoning district.\n(4) The recreation area reserved within the tract shall conform to the recreation area standards of section 5.5.\n(5) The minimum amount of land reserved as recreation area shall be the sum of all reductions in minimum gross land area as a result of the cluster form of development, combined with the\nminimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5. Only the minimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5 may be dedicated outside the boundaries of the land being\nsubdivided as specified in section 5.5.2.\n(c)\nReductions in lot and setback requirements. For lots created as part of a cluster development, minimum gross land area, minimum lot width, and minimum setback requirements may be reduced\nas follows:\n(1) Minimum lot size requirements specified in section 3.8 may be reduced to five thousand, five hundred (5,500) square feet gross land area.\n(2) Minimum lot width requirements specified in section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to fifty (50) feet.\n(3) Minimum street setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the street lot line forms an exterior boundary of the cluster development.\n(4)\nMinimum interior setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to eight (8) feet except where the interior lot line\nforms a boundary of the cluster development.\n(5) Minimum solar setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the north lot line forms\na\nboundary of the cluster development.\n(d) Floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations. For lots created as part of a cluster development, floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations, as shown in Table 3.8-1, shall be\ncalculated using the gross land area of the lot or the minimum lot size for the zoning district, whichever is greater.\n(Ord.

Except where exempted in Section 3.5.7(c), Exemptions, the standards in this section apply to all land and development located within the HR district and subdistrict boundaries as\nidentified and located on the Chapel Hill Zoning Atlas.\nc) Exemptions. Minor additions to lawfully-established buildings that existed on May 22, 2019 are exempt from the standards in this section. For the purposes of this section, \"minor additions\" are\ndefined as increases in the amount of floor area on a lot of up to 25 percent beyond what existed on May 22, 2019 or up to a maximum total size of 2,000 square feet of heated floor area,\nwhichever is greater.\nd) Effective Date. The effective date of these standards is May 22, 2019.\ne) District Boundary. The boundary for the HR District is depicted in Figure 3.5.7(e), below:\nFigure 3.5.7(e): HR District Boundary\nLegend\nHR District Boundary\nParcel Lines\nRoadways\nCarrboro Jurisdiction\nParallel HR District\n1:10000\nNOTES:\n[1] Because the Historic Rogers Road Neighborhood, as defined in Mapping Our Community's Future, is located across two jurisdictions (the Town of Chapel Hill and the Town of\nCarrboro), a parallel district was prepared for the Town of Carrboro, to be applicable in the grey-shaded area on the map.\nf) Subdistricts Established. The HR District is comprised of subdistricts, or character areas. The purpose and intent of each subdistrict is as follows:\n1) Residential-Low Density (HR-L) Subdistrict. The Residential-Low Density (HR-L) Subdistrict is established with the intent to protect and preserve the character of existing lower-density areas\n(minimum lot size 14,500 square feet, or no more than three lots per acre) within the neighborhood while providing for compatible new development, including new housing choice options,\nand increased home occupation opportunities for residents.\n2) Residential-Medium Density (HR-M) Subdistrict. The Residential-Medium Density (HR-M) Subdistrict is established with the intent of designating areas within the neighborhood for medium-\ndensity (minimum lot size 9,000 square feet, or no more than five lots per acre) residential development that offers a broader range of housing options and increased home occupation\nopportunities for residents.\n3)\nHousing and Employment Mixed-Use (HR-X) Subdistrict. The Housing and Employment Mixed-Use (HR-X) Subdistrict is established with the intent of providing areas within the neighborhood\nwith a broader range of housing and employment options. These areas are intended to concentrate new development into nodes which will balance providing areas for desired new uses\nwhile protecting the overall neighborhood character. Uses appropriate in the HR-X Subdistrict include live-work units, flex offices, and low-intensity neighborhood-serving establishments such\nas healthcare, assisted living, elder care, child care, and recreation facilities.\nNOTE: As of May 22, 2019, no lands bear the HR-X designation. This subdistrict is established as a placeholder for future use within the district, subject to a rezoning.\n4) Conservation (HR-C) Subdistrict. The Conservation (HR-C) Subdistrict is established with the intent of preserving and protecting environmentally sensitive areas as well as lands under joint\nmanagement by the Town of Chapel Hill and Orange County.\nNOTE: As of May 22, 2019, no lands bear the HR-C designation. This subdistrict is established as a placeholder for future use within the district, subject to a rezoning.\ng) Modification of District Standards.\n1) Minor modifications or deviations of up to 10 percent may be approved by the Planning Director through an administrative adjustment for the following numerical requirements:\nA. Maximum single-family home size;\nB. Maximum block length; or\nC. Street Configuration\n2) In order to be granted a modification, the applicant requesting the modification must demonstrate all of the following:\nA. The modification is consistent with the character of development on surrounding land and results in development that is compatible with surrounding land uses;\nB. The modification results in development that is consistent with both the purpose and intent statement of the HR District, as stated in Section 3.5.7(a), and the purpose and intent\nstatement of the subdistrict in which the development is located, as stated in Section 3.5.7(g)(2);\n21 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 22\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nC. The modification compensates for some unusual aspect of the site or the proposed development that is not shared by landowners in general;\nD. The modification will not pose a danger to the public health or safety; and\nE. Any adverse impacts resulting from the modification will be fully mitigated.\n3) No modification granted under this section shall result in a change in use.\nh) Development Standards. This section sets out the special standards for new development or redevelopment in the HR District. Development standards not listed in this section (including\nRecreational Area for Residential Subdivisions, Required Buffers for Adjacent Vacant Land Zoning, and Permitted Sign Types, Dimensional Standards, and Lighting) shall comply with the standards\nfor development in the R-1 District listed in Article 5.\n1) Buffering.\nA. Purpose and Intent. The standards in this section are intended to protect the residential character of existing neighborhoods surrounding new mixed-use development in the HR District.\nB. Applicability. The standards in this section shall apply to lands in the Housing and Employment Mixed-Use (HR-X) Subdistrict.\nC. Buffering Standards.\n1. Development in the HR-X Subdistrict shall maintain an undisturbed perimeter buffer of no less than 30 feet in which no development shall occur.\n2. Development in the HR-X Subdistrict shall be screened with existing vegetation and/or new plantings to meet the requirements of a Type D buffer as described in the Town of Chapel\nHill Public Works Engineering Design Manual.

Minor modifications to a previously approved development agreement may be approved by the town manager as long as such changes continue to be in substantial compliance with the\napproving action of the town council and all other applicable requirements and result in a configuration of buildings/development that is generally consistent with the town council-\napproved development agreement. The town manager shall make a decision on the proposed minor amendment within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days of the date of the town\nmanager's determination that a complete application was submitted or such further time as mutually agreed to by the applicant and the town. The town manager shall not have the\nauthority to approve changes that constitute a major modification of a town council-development agreement.\nF.\nThe time periods referenced in this subsection shall not run during any period in which the applications for subsequent development agreements or major modifications to a previously\napproved development agreement have been returned to the applicant for substantial modification or analysis. The time periods set forth in this subsection may also be modified by\nmutual consent of the applicant and the town council.\"\n(k) Actions after decision on a development agreement.\n(1) Recording approval. If the application for approval of a development agreement or major modification is approved or approved with conditions, the town manager shall execute the\ndevelopment agreement or major modification in accord with the action of the town council. The applicant shall then execute the development agreement or major modification and record\nthe development agreement or amendment in the office of the applicable county register of deeds within fourteen (14) days after the town enters into the development agreement. The\nburdens of the development agreement are binding upon, and the benefits of the agreement shall inure to, all successors in interest to the parties to the agreement.\n(2) Individual site development permits. After an executed development agreement is recorded, the town manager may then accept applications for individual site development permits\nfor\nspecific buildings that the applicant proposes to build within the physical boundaries covered by the agreement. No construction work on any such building identified in the agreement may\nbegin until a site development permit has been issued. The town manager shall prescribe the form(s) of applications as well as any other material the town manager may reasonably require to\ndetermine compliance with the agreement. The town manager shall approve or deny of the individual site development permit application within fifteen (15) working days of the manager's\ndetermination that the individual site development plan application is complete. The town manager shall approve the application upon finding it is substantially consistent with and does not\nviolate any term of the agreement and shall deny approval upon finding the application is NOT substantially consistent with or violates a term of the agreement. If the application is denied,\nthe Town manager shall specify the grounds for finding that it is inconsistent or in violation and refer the applicant to the special use permit process described in section 4.5 of this appendix.\nAlternatively, the applicant may modify the site development permit application or apply for a major modification to the development agreement. Provided, under no circumstances shall a\nchange in floor area of less than one thousand (1,000) square feet or fewer than ten (10) parking spaces be deemed either a minor or major modification of the development agreement nor\nrequire approval or modification of an individual site development permit; such changes shall be reported by the applicant to the town manager.\n(3)\nExpiration, abandonment, revocation or development agreement. The term of any development agreement shall be set forth in the agreement. The development agreement shall also contain\nspecific provisions relative to default or termination of the agreement.\n(4) Periodic review and amendment of the development agreement. The town manager shall at least every twelve (12) months conduct a review of the development agreement at which time the\napplicant or its successors in interest must demonstrate good faith compliance with the terms of the development agreement. The town manager shall promptly report the results of this\nreview to the town council. If, as a result of this periodic review, the town council finds and determines that the applicant or its successors in interest has committed a material breach of the\nterms or conditions of the agreement, the town manager shall serve notice in writing, within a reasonable time not to exceed thirty (30) working days after the periodic review, upon the\napplicant or its successors in interest setting forth with reasonable particularity the nature of the breach and the evidence supporting the finding and determination, and providing the\napplicant or their successors in interest a reasonable time in which to cure the material breach. If the applicant or its successors in interest fail to cure the material breach within the time\ngiven, then the town council unilaterally may terminate or modify the development agreement pursuant to NCGS 160D-1008; provided, the notice of termination or modification may be\nappealed to the board of adjustment in the manner provided by 160D-405. Thereafter the applicant or its successors in interest may pursue any other rights and remedies available at law or\nin equity. If the town council elects to unilaterally modify the agreement, the applicant or its successors in interest may elect for the development agreement to be terminated rather than\naccede to the development agreement with the modifications unilaterally made by the town council.\n3.5.7. Historic Rogers Road Neighborhood District.\na) Purpose and Intent. The purpose of the Historic Rogers Road Neighborhood (HR) District is to implement the relevant goals and recommendations of the Mapping Our Community's Future\ncommunity planning effort, completed in May 2016.

Except where exempted in Section 3.5.7(c), Exemptions, the standards in this section apply to all land and development located within the HR district and subdistrict boundaries as\nidentified and located on the Chapel Hill Zoning Atlas.\nc) Exemptions. Minor additions to lawfully-established buildings that existed on May 22, 2019 are exempt from the standards in this section. For the purposes of this section, \"minor additions\" are\ndefined as increases in the amount of floor area on a lot of up to 25 percent beyond what existed on May 22, 2019 or up to a maximum total size of 2,000 square feet of heated floor area,\nwhichever is greater.\nd) Effective Date. The effective date of these standards is May 22, 2019.\ne) District Boundary. The boundary for the HR District is depicted in Figure 3.5.7(e), below:\nFigure 3.5.7(e): HR District Boundary\nLegend\nHR District Boundary\nParcel Lines\nRoadways\nCarrboro Jurisdiction\nParallel HR District\n1:10000\nNOTES:\n[1] Because the Historic Rogers Road Neighborhood, as defined in Mapping Our Community's Future, is located across two jurisdictions (the Town of Chapel Hill and the Town of\nCarrboro), a parallel district was prepared for the Town of Carrboro, to be applicable in the grey-shaded area on the map.\nf) Subdistricts Established. The HR District is comprised of subdistricts, or character areas. The purpose and intent of each subdistrict is as follows:\n1) Residential-Low Density (HR-L) Subdistrict. The Residential-Low Density (HR-L) Subdistrict is established with the intent to protect and preserve the character of existing lower-density areas\n(minimum lot size 14,500 square feet, or no more than three lots per acre) within the neighborhood while providing for compatible new development, including new housing choice options,\nand increased home occupation opportunities for residents.\n2) Residential-Medium Density (HR-M) Subdistrict. The Residential-Medium Density (HR-M) Subdistrict is established with the intent of designating areas within the neighborhood for medium-\ndensity (minimum lot size 9,000 square feet, or no more than five lots per acre) residential development that offers a broader range of housing options and increased home occupation\nopportunities for residents.\n3)\nHousing and Employment Mixed-Use (HR-X) Subdistrict. The Housing and Employment Mixed-Use (HR-X) Subdistrict is established with the intent of providing areas within the neighborhood\nwith a broader range of housing and employment options. These areas are intended to concentrate new development into nodes which will balance providing areas for desired new uses\nwhile protecting the overall neighborhood character. Uses appropriate in the HR-X Subdistrict include live-work units, flex offices, and low-intensity neighborhood-serving establishments such\nas healthcare, assisted living, elder care, child care, and recreation facilities.\nNOTE: As of May 22, 2019, no lands bear the HR-X designation. This subdistrict is established as a placeholder for future use within the district, subject to a rezoning.\n4) Conservation (HR-C) Subdistrict. The Conservation (HR-C) Subdistrict is established with the intent of preserving and protecting environmentally sensitive areas as well as lands under joint\nmanagement by the Town of Chapel Hill and Orange County.\nNOTE: As of May 22, 2019, no lands bear the HR-C designation. This subdistrict is established as a placeholder for future use within the district, subject to a rezoning.\ng) Modification of District Standards.\n1) Minor modifications or deviations of up to 10 percent may be approved by the Planning Director through an administrative adjustment for the following numerical requirements:\nA. Maximum single-family home size;\nB. Maximum block length; or\nC. Street Configuration\n2) In order to be granted a modification, the applicant requesting the modification must demonstrate all of the following:\nA. The modification is consistent with the character of development on surrounding land and results in development that is compatible with surrounding land uses;\nB. The modification results in development that is consistent with both the purpose and intent statement of the HR District, as stated in Section 3.5.7(a), and the purpose and intent\nstatement of the subdistrict in which the development is located, as stated in Section 3.5.7(g)(2);\n21 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 22\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nC. The modification compensates for some unusual aspect of the site or the proposed development that is not shared by landowners in general;\nD. The modification will not pose a danger to the public health or safety; and\nE.

Separate ordinances are required to designate each district. Ordinances designating each neighborhood conservation district shall identify the designated district boundaries,\nand specify the individual purposes and standards for that district.\n(1) Overlay district. Neighborhood conservation districts are designed as overlays to the regular zoning districts. Property designated within these districts must also be designated as being within\none (1) of the general use districts. Authorized uses must be permitted in both the general use district and the overlay district. Property designated as a neighborhood conservation district\nmay have additional designations. Such property shall comply with all applicable use restrictions.\n33 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 34\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(2) Zoning designation.\nA.
