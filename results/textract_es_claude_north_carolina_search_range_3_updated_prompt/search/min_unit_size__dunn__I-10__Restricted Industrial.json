More specifically, the intent of these regulations is to provide for\nadequate buffering between incompatible land uses; protect, preserve and enhance the aesthetic appeal and\nscenic beauty of the city; reduce noise and air pollution; reduce storm water run-off; filter and reduce glare\nfrom artificial light sources; and provide shaded areas along streets and in parking lots.\nB.\nAPPLICABILITY\nThe landscaping and buffering standards of this Section shall apply to the following:\n1. All new developments (except for infill single-family detached) shall be designed in accordance with the\nrequirements of this Article.\n2. Pre-existing development\na. Non-conforming preexisting development is subject to these standards as follows:\n(1) A change in type of occupancy, as set forth in the North Carolina Building Code\n(2) A change in land use which requires an increase in the number of off-street parking spaces or\nthe provision of a buffer yard\n(3) Additions or expansions which singularly or collectively exceed 25% of the land area or gross\nbuilding floor area existing at the effective date of this ordinance.\nb. The City of Dunn recognizes that designing preexisting development to meet new regulations is more\ndifficult and expensive than applying these standards to undeveloped properties. Therefore, greater\nflexibility will be afforded preexisting development in meeting the requirements of this Section, in\nthat:\n(1) A modification of up to 25% percent may be granted by the Administrator for planting area and\ndimension requirements where compliance presents hardships due to building location, lot size,\nor vehicular area configuration.\n(2) A credit for reducing required off-street parking by one (1) space shall be given for the\nconstruction of each landscape island.\nC.\nSTREET TREES\n1. Street yard trees are an essential part of the City streetscape. Street trees or front yard trees are planted\nin the public right-of-way or on in the front yard of private property, just outside of the right-of-way line.\nCITY OF DUNN, NC\n6-34\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nADOPTION DATE: 04.11.2023\n\nNEW PAGE 123\nARTICLE 6\nGENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nThe City seeks to maintain existing trees where possible and to encourage the planting and continuance\nof the established street tree patterns. To accomplish this objective, the following shall apply:\na.\nAll subdivisions and developments subject to approval shall provide street trees along their frontage\nwith adjacent public streets.\nb. Street trees shall be planted on private property or on the public right-of-way. When planted on\nprivate property, they shall be located five (5) to ten (10) feet from back of curb or edge-of-sidewalk,\nwhichever is greater, or as close as possible to those criteria.\nC.\nStreet trees shall be selected from the list of small or understory trees, or, where power lines are\nlocated, small trees included in Appendix B of this ordinance.\nd. Where necessary, planting strips shall be a minimum of five (5) feet wide.\ne.\nPlanting location shall take into consideration planned roadway widening, public safety, standard\ndrainage requirements, and maintenance of sight distances for traffic safety.\n2. Front yard trees, unless subject to overhead power lines, shall be planted at the rate of one (1) two-inch\ncaliper tree per forty (40) feet of property line abutting a public street, excluding driveways and traffic\nvisibility zones. This rate may be varied based upon planned signage areas, existing trees, and the\ncrowns of planted trees.\n3. Trees used to meet buffer and vehicle use area requirements, may be used to meet the street\nrequirements to the extent that the trees are located within twenty-five (25) feet of a street.\nD.\nBUFFER YARD REQUIREMENTS\n1. Buffers provide compatible transitions between differing land uses, reduce the visual impacts of\ndevelopment and retain existing plant materials.\n2. In situations where a development is adjacent to multiple uses then the most restrictive buffer requirement\nfor a property line shall be required along each side and rear property line abutting the property, otherwise\nthe development shall follow the requirements listed below. Buffer-yards shall be required to meet the\nfollowing minimum screening requirements:\nCITY OF DUNN, NC\n6-35\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nADOPTION DATE: 04.11.2023\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nTYPE A\nCELL (1, 3): \nTYPE B\nCELL (2, 1): \nADJACENT LAND USES\nCELL (2, 2): \nResidential VS.
