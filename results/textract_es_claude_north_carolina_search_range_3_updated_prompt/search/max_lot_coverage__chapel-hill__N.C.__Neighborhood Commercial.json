A site bound by vehicular or non-vehicular thoroughfares on all sides, forming a complete block and complying with the maximum block perimeter as specified for the Subdistrict, is\nencouraged where feasible. A site that is only partially bound by thoroughfares shall locate the thoroughfares in a way that allows a feasible alignment for a vehicular or non-vehicular\nconnection on adjacent properties that would complete the block without exceeding the maximum block perimeter.\nE. Gross land area. Gross Land Area is all area within the boundaries of a zoning lot (net land area) plus half of the following areas located within or adjoining the lot: (1) publicly-owned or otherwise\npermanently dedicated open space, such as parks, recreation areas, water bodies, cemeteries and the like, and (2) existing or proposed right-of-way, whether dedicated or not dedicated to public\nuse; provided that the total amount of credited open space and public streets shall not exceed ten (10) percent of the net land area of the zoning lot.\nF. Outdoor amenity space.\n1. In General. Outdoor amenity space is required for all uses. Outdoor amenity space must be provided on the lot, or lands permanently designated as publically accessible open space, and must\nbe available as unenclosed exterior space appropriately improved as a pedestrian amenity or for aesthetic appeal and cannot include areas used for vehicles, except for incidental service,\nmaintenance or emergency actions. Outdoor amenity space shall be made available to the general public.\n2. Fee alternative. A minimum of ten (10) percent of any outdoor amenity space requirement must occur on the development site; however, up to ninety (90) percent of the outdoor amenity\nspace requirement may, with the approval of the town manager, be met through payment of a fee in-lieu to the town. The amount of the payment is the product of the amount of outdoor\namenity space required multiplied by a dollar amount established by the town council annually as part of the budget process. The applicant must make the payment before issuance of a form\ndistrict permit, provided, however, that the town manager may allow phasing of payments consistent with the approved phasing of the development.\n3. Greenway alternative. Form District development applications for sites that include any land which overlaps a portion of a proposed greenway shown on the town's adopted Greenway Master\nPlan must be designed to accommodate the extension of that greenway in accordance with the Greenway Master Plan. A developer's financial obligation to contribute to the dedication and\nconstruction of the greenway is based on the formulas for calculation of amenity space and recreation space provided in this section 3.11.2.7. Land dedicated for a public pedestrian and non-\nmotorized vehicle easement or deeded to the town along the greenway may be substituted for required improved outdoor amenity or recreation space, where deemed acceptable by the\ntown manager.\n4. Standards.\na. The minimum size of outdoor amenity space is the number of square feet derived by multiplying the net land area of the development by the applicable ratio shown for the zoning district.\nb. Outdoor amenity space may be met in one contiguous open area or in multiple open areas on the lot and must meet minimum dimensions described as follows:\ni. Where not located adjacent to a building, or where located adjacent to a building that is three stories in height or less, an outdoor amenity space must be at least 20 feet in width and\nlength.\nii.\nWhere located adjacent to a building that is four stories in height or greater, the outdoor amenity space shall have greater dimensions, such that the space is in proportion to the\nassociated building, provides a comfortable scale for pedestrians, and invites public use and enjoyment. In no case shall the area of a single outdoor amenity space be required to\nexceed the minimum outdoor amenity space ratio as specified for the Subdistrict.\niii. Where located in the build-to zone and used to create inviting space along a street facing fa\u00e7ade, the width of the outdoor amenity space measured perpendicular to the right-of-way\nmay be less than the dimension prescribed above, subject to approval of a design alternative.\nC. Outdoor amenity space must be adjacent or adjoining a public right-of way, greenway, or publicly accessible thoroughfare, and must be within one-half story in elevation of the adjoining\npublic walkway except under the following circumstances:\ni. An administrative adjustment is provided due to unusual topographical or environmental conditions of the site.\nii. A design alternative is approved for outdoor amenity space to be within two stories in elevation of the adjoining public walkway. A rooftop amenity space must be highly visible from\nthe adjoining public walkway and must have an easily identified route of public access, including provision of ADA access.\nd. Outdoor amenity space may be counted to meet the build-to-zone percentage requirements; however, only half the width of the applicable outdoor amenity space can be counted toward\nthe required percentage.\n65 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 66\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\ne. Where pedestrian connectivity requirements are met through spaces between buildings, any portions meeting all requirements of this section 3.11.2.7.F.4 may qualify as outdoor amenity\nspace.\nf. Outdoor amenity space cannot be parked or driven upon, except for emergency access and permitted temporary events.\ng. Outdoor amenity spaces may include but not be limited to:\ni. Facilities such as a playground, sport court, dog park, garden, community garden, park, green, pavilion, seating area plaza or water feature\nii. Areas used to meet minimum tree canopy coverage as required under Section 5.7.2 for applications that require Council approval.\nh. Outdoor amenity space expressly does not include:\ni. Any streetscape components located within the public right-of-way; and\nii. Any landscaping internal to or screening a parking lot.\ni. The requirement for outdoor amenity space may also be met by means of a design alternative approved by the Community Design Commission where the space is located on a parcel\nother than the subject property, no further than eight hundred (800) feet from the subject parcel and within the boundaries of the Blue Hill District. This provision is intended to allow the\naggregation of outdoor amenity space to create larger, publically accessible areas.\nG. Recreation space.\n1.\nIn general. Active, improved outdoor space must be provided for common active recreational use by residents of multifamily or mixed use developments.\n2. Fee alternative. In lieu of providing recreation space, an applicant may, with the approval of the town manager, make a payment to the town whereby the town may acquire or develop\nrecreation land or greenways to serve the development. A minimum of fifty (50) percent of the required recreation space must be met through a payment in lieu. The amount of the payment\nis the product of the amount of recreational space required multiplied by a dollar amount established by the town council annually as part of the budget process. The applicant must make the\npayment before issuance of a Form District permit, provided, however, that the town manager may allow phasing of payments consistent with the approved phasing of the development.\n3. Greenway alternative. Form District development applications for sites that include any land which overlaps a portion of a proposed greenway shown on the town's adopted Greenway Master\nPlan must be designed to accommodate the extension of that greenway in accordance with the Greenway Master Plan. A developer's financial obligation to contribute to the dedication and\nconstruction of the greenway is based on the formulas for calculation of amenity space and recreation space provided in section 3.11.2.7. Land dedicated for a public pedestrian and non-\nmotorized vehicle easement or deeded to the town along the greenway may be substituted for required improved outdoor amenity or recreation space, where deemed acceptable by the\ntown manager.\n4. Standards.\na. The minimum size of active recreation space is the number of square feet derived by multiplying gross land area of the development by the applicable ratio shown for the zoning district\nand building height. Where a development contains residential and nonresidential uses, this standard applies only to the residential portion of the building. The land area used for\napplying the ratio described above is calculated based on the proportion of residential floor area.\nb. Recreation space not provided as a Fee or Greenway Alternative shall be provided on-site at ground level, at the perimeter lot line of the site.\nC. Recreation space shall be unobstructed above by any building elements. Canopies, coverings, or other roofs incidental to the intended use or purpose of the recreation space may be\nconsidered as unobstructed above.\nd. A pedestrian connection shall be provided between a recreation space and an adjoining public sidewalk or greenway.\ne.\nA pedestrian connection shall be provided between a recreation space and at least one area provided for outdoor amenity space.\nH. Building setbacks.\n1. There are three types of building setbacks-front, side interior and rear.\n2. Front setbacks are measured from the edge of the nearest right-of-way line.\n3.\nSide interior setbacks are measured from the side property line or the edge of the right-of-way where applicable.\n4. Rear setbacks are measured from the rear property line or the edge of the right-of-way where applicable.\n5. When the side interior or rear setback is zero (0) or five (5) feet, the building or structure must be placed on the side or rear property line or be placed a minimum of five (5) feet from the side\nor rear property line or the edge of the right-of-way line where applicable.\n6. The town manager will determine the application of front, side and rear setbacks to any irregularly-shaped lot.\nI. Build-to Requirements.\n1.\nThe build-to zone is the area on the lot where a certain percentage of the front building fa\u00e7ade must be located, measured as a minimum and maximum setback range from the edge of the\nright-of-way.\n2. The required percentage specifies the amount of the front building fa\u00e7ade that must be located in the build-to zone, measured based on the width of the building divided by the buildable\nwidth of the lot and applied as follows:\na. On a lot developed according to the Conventional conditions, the required build-to percentage applies to the primary Frontage. On a corner lot, the required build-to percentage\nadditionally applies to the continuation of the Frontage for a minimum of seventy-five (75) feet around the corner, in accordance with Section 3.11.2.1.D.7. For additional principal\nstructures along secondary Frontages, the street-facing building fa\u00e7ade(s) must meet the maximum setback requirement for at least two-thirds (2/3) of the fa\u00e7ade width.\nb.\nOn a lot developed according to the Enhanced Development conditions, the required build-to percentage applies to all Frontages.

Outdoor amenity space cannot be parked or driven upon, except for emergency access and permitted temporary events.\ng. Outdoor amenity spaces may include but not be limited to:\ni. Facilities such as a playground, sport court, dog park, garden, community garden, park, green, pavilion, seating area plaza or water feature\nii. Areas used to meet minimum tree canopy coverage as required under Section 5.7.2 for applications that require Council approval.\nh. Outdoor amenity space expressly does not include:\ni. Any streetscape components located within the public right-of-way; and\nii. Any landscaping internal to or screening a parking lot.\ni. The requirement for outdoor amenity space may also be met by means of a design alternative approved by the Community Design Commission where the space is located on a parcel\nother than the subject property, no further than eight hundred (800) feet from the subject parcel and within the boundaries of the Blue Hill District. This provision is intended to allow the\naggregation of outdoor amenity space to create larger, publically accessible areas.\nG. Recreation space.\n1.\nIn general. Active, improved outdoor space must be provided for common active recreational use by residents of multifamily or mixed use developments.\n2. Fee alternative. In lieu of providing recreation space, an applicant may, with the approval of the town manager, make a payment to the town whereby the town may acquire or develop\nrecreation land or greenways to serve the development. A minimum of fifty (50) percent of the required recreation space must be met through a payment in lieu. The amount of the payment\nis the product of the amount of recreational space required multiplied by a dollar amount established by the town council annually as part of the budget process. The applicant must make the\npayment before issuance of a Form District permit, provided, however, that the town manager may allow phasing of payments consistent with the approved phasing of the development.\n3. Greenway alternative. Form District development applications for sites that include any land which overlaps a portion of a proposed greenway shown on the town's adopted Greenway Master\nPlan must be designed to accommodate the extension of that greenway in accordance with the Greenway Master Plan. A developer's financial obligation to contribute to the dedication and\nconstruction of the greenway is based on the formulas for calculation of amenity space and recreation space provided in section 3.11.2.7. Land dedicated for a public pedestrian and non-\nmotorized vehicle easement or deeded to the town along the greenway may be substituted for required improved outdoor amenity or recreation space, where deemed acceptable by the\ntown manager.\n4. Standards.\na. The minimum size of active recreation space is the number of square feet derived by multiplying gross land area of the development by the applicable ratio shown for the zoning district\nand building height. Where a development contains residential and nonresidential uses, this standard applies only to the residential portion of the building. The land area used for\napplying the ratio described above is calculated based on the proportion of residential floor area.\nb. Recreation space not provided as a Fee or Greenway Alternative shall be provided on-site at ground level, at the perimeter lot line of the site.\nC. Recreation space shall be unobstructed above by any building elements. Canopies, coverings, or other roofs incidental to the intended use or purpose of the recreation space may be\nconsidered as unobstructed above.\nd. A pedestrian connection shall be provided between a recreation space and an adjoining public sidewalk or greenway.\ne.\nA pedestrian connection shall be provided between a recreation space and at least one area provided for outdoor amenity space.\nH. Building setbacks.\n1. There are three types of building setbacks-front, side interior and rear.\n2. Front setbacks are measured from the edge of the nearest right-of-way line.\n3.\nSide interior setbacks are measured from the side property line or the edge of the right-of-way where applicable.\n4. Rear setbacks are measured from the rear property line or the edge of the right-of-way where applicable.\n5. When the side interior or rear setback is zero (0) or five (5) feet, the building or structure must be placed on the side or rear property line or be placed a minimum of five (5) feet from the side\nor rear property line or the edge of the right-of-way line where applicable.\n6. The town manager will determine the application of front, side and rear setbacks to any irregularly-shaped lot.\nI. Build-to Requirements.\n1.\nThe build-to zone is the area on the lot where a certain percentage of the front building fa\u00e7ade must be located, measured as a minimum and maximum setback range from the edge of the\nright-of-way.\n2. The required percentage specifies the amount of the front building fa\u00e7ade that must be located in the build-to zone, measured based on the width of the building divided by the buildable\nwidth of the lot and applied as follows:\na. On a lot developed according to the Conventional conditions, the required build-to percentage applies to the primary Frontage. On a corner lot, the required build-to percentage\nadditionally applies to the continuation of the Frontage for a minimum of seventy-five (75) feet around the corner, in accordance with Section 3.11.2.1.D.7. For additional principal\nstructures along secondary Frontages, the street-facing building fa\u00e7ade(s) must meet the maximum setback requirement for at least two-thirds (2/3) of the fa\u00e7ade width.\nb.\nOn a lot developed according to the Enhanced Development conditions, the required build-to percentage applies to all Frontages.

District Character.\n3.11.2.1. Districts and Frontages.\nA. District summary. The Blue Hill District is a vital node of living, shopping and working, centrally located between downtown Chapel Hill and Durham. The Form District ensures that this essential\nhub is able to reach its full potential as both a destination and a community. The regulations support residential and mixed uses at varying levels of intensity, all of which will combine to foster a\nlively and engaging street environment easily accessible to pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders and automobile users.\nB. District intent. This Form District is intended to implement the Ephesus Church Road/Fordham Boulevard Small Area Plan. Specifically, the Blue Hill District provides the implementation\nmechanism for the citizen-endorsed vision for the project area, which is a more dense, walkable urban environment with balanced access for all modes of travel.\nC. Subdistricts established. In order to implement the vision of the Ephesus Church Road/Fordham Boulevard Focus Area Plan, the following subdistricts have been established and are depicted on\nthe Regulating Plan in section 3.11.2.2.\n1. Walkable Residential (WR-). The Walkable Residential Subdistrict is intended to create residential neighborhoods with a mix of housing types, together with civic buildings and open space\nessential to creating neighborhoods. The Walkable Residential Subdistricts are differentiated by the maximum building height permitted.\na. WR-3: maximum height limit of three (3) stories (forty-five (45) feet).\nb. WR-7: maximum height limit of seven (7) stories (ninety (90) feet).\nD.\nFrontages established. Frontages are established in this code to apply certain standards for development along all thoroughfares in the district, both existing and proposed. All public\nthoroughfare frontages shall be assigned one of the frontage types defined in this code.\n1. Type A Frontage. The Type A Frontage is intended for areas where the highest level of walkability is desired. The Frontage creates a \"main street\" environment with buildings pulled up to the\nstreet edge. Type A frontage is differentiated into Type A-1, Type A-2, and Type A-3 to provide three different levels of build-to-zone coverage, sidewalk width, and setback criteria. Type A\nfrontages are generally appropriate for Collector Streets, Local Streets, and District Streets.\n2. Type B Frontage. The Type B Frontage is intended for areas adjacent to major streets where pushing buildings back creates a quiet pedestrian setting at the building. While buildings are\nallowed to be pulled up to the street edge, they may also be set back behind one or two rows of head-in or angle parking served by a single drive aisle.\n3. Type C Frontage. Streets with significant traffic volumes that are not conducive to sustained pedestrian activity have been designated with a Type C Frontage.\n52 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 53\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n4. Type D Frontage. The Type D Frontage is appropriate for Alleys that are shared between sites and provide residents and businesses access to garages, parking decks, loading docks and service\nareas. An alley used to satisfy the maximum block length requirement shall meet the assigned frontage requirement.\n5. Type E Frontage. The Type E Frontage is intended for non-vehicular thoroughfares where development fronts on a multiuse path corridor and/or a significant natural feature.\n6. The Regulating Plan shows assigned frontages for existing streets and some proposed streets in the district. Frontages along all new thoroughfares west of Fordham Boulevard not otherwise\nshown in the Regulating Plan are assigned as Type A-1. Frontages along all new thoroughfares south of Europa Drive, least of 15-501, and north of Ephesus Church Road not otherwise shown\nin the Regulating Plan are assigned as Type A-1. Frontages along all new thoroughfares south of Ephesus Church Road and east of Fordham Boulevard not otherwise identified in the\nRegulating Plan are assigned as Type A-2. Frontages along any new thoroughfares north of Europa Drive not otherwise identified in the Regulating Plan are assigned as Type A-2.\nFor new thoroughfares not shown on the Regulating Plan, the town manager may assign a different frontage other than what is described in the preceding paragraph where one of the\nfollowing applies:\na. Because there are Type A-1 and/or Type A-2 Frontages on other sides of the development parcel;\nb. To protect sensitive natural areas or save healthy existing trees;\nC. To protect natural conditions, such as watercourses, riparian buffers, natural rock formations or topography;\nd. Due to the presence of existing utilities or other easements;\ne. For traffic safety, site distance considerations, intersection spacing, or intersection alignment and/or adequate site distance;\nf. Because there are no other options for ingress and egress;\ng. To provide greater consistency with pedestrian infrastructure, building placement and/or streetscape on adjoining lots and/or the opposite side of the street; or\nh. Because an alternative designation of frontage would promote greater consistency with the overall objectives of the district.\n7. Corner lot application of frontage.\na. Where a corner lot has two different assigned frontages, the more restrictive frontage requirement shall apply to the assigned frontage, and must be continued for a minimum of seventy-\nfive (75) feet around the corner, measured from the intersection of the two (2) right-of-way lines.\nb. Where a corner lot has the same assigned frontage on two (2) or more sides, the town manager shall designate one (1) side of the lot as the primary frontage where one (1) of the following\napplies:\ni. To provide greater consistency with pedestrian infrastructure, building placement and/or streetscape on adjoining lots and/or the opposite side of the street.\nii. Because of a condition where a longer frontage on a development parcel promotes consistent pedestrian character; or\niii. Because the frontage designation would promote greater walkability and support the overall objectives of the district as described in section 3.11.1.\nThe assigned frontage requirements shall apply to that primary frontage, and must be continued along all other frontages for a minimum of seventy-five (75) feet around the corner,\nmeasured from the intersection of the two (2) right-of-way lines.\nC. Any frontages not designated as the primary frontage shall be deemed secondary lot frontages, and shall meet at least one half (1/2) of the minimum Build-to-zone percentage requirement\nof the underlying frontages unless a design alternative is approved by the community design commission.\n3.11.2.2. Regulating Plan.\nThe Walkable Residential (WR-), Walkable Mixed Use (WX-) subdistricts are identified and located on the Town of Chapel Hill Official Zoning Map. The Regulating Plan is intended to show the general areas\nof\neach subdistrict and associated road frontage(s). Additional street right-of-way or public easement may be required at the time of development, in accordance with the Ephesus Church/Fordham\nBoulevard Small Area Plan, the Ephesus Fordham District Illustrative Block Studies, the Ephesus Fordham sections of the Mobility and Connectivity Plan and this section 3.11.\n-\nFrontage\n[The image of the map above is revised to show a Type A-2 frontage in (purple) along the north side of Franklin Street, the south side of Legion Road extension, the north side of Legion Road, both\nsides of Europa Drive and both sides of the new/proposed street that crosses Elliott Road extending from Franklin Street eastward to the new/proposed street that parallels the Booker Creek\ngreenway.
