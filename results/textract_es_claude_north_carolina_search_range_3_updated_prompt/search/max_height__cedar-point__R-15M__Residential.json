Computation of Area of Individual Signs - The area of the sign face\n(that is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one\nface) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle,\nrectangle or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme\nlimits of the writing, representation, emblem or other display\ntogether with any material or color forming an integral part of the\nbackground of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the\nbackdrop or structure against which it is placed.\nb. Computations of Area of Multi-Faced Signs - The sign area for a\nsign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together\nthe area of all sign faces visible from any one point at the same\ntime, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure\nand are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be\ncomputed by the measurement of one of the faces.\nC.\nComputation of Height - The height of a sign shall be computed as\nthe distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of\nthe highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be\nconstrued to be the lower of:\n(1) existing grade prior to construction or\n(2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of\nany filling, berming, mounding or excavating.\nIn cases where the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined,\nsign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation\nof the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation\nof the nearest point of the crown of a public street or grade of the\nland at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the\nparcel, whichever is lower. (Amended March 23, 2010)\nd. Computation of Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area for a parcel\n- The permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a parcel\nmay not be more than 200 square feet in total, except on parcels\nwith more than one principal use where the maximum permitted\nsum of all signage can be 400 square feet.\n(b)\nExterior Lighting Standards\ni. Standards:\nThe following standards are required of all exterior lighting except the\noutdoor recreational uses specifically exempted below. Many uses have\nthe option of providing a lower light post with a non-cutoff type of\nluminaire or a higher pole, up to 40 feet, with a luminaire that totally\ncuts off light spillover at a cutoff angle smaller than 90 degrees.\na. The maximum height light post permitted is dependent upon the\namount of cutoff provided.
