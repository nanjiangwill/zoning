There are three (3) transect zones that can be utilized in the Downtown Overlay\nDistrict. These zones and their general elements are as follows:\na. Transect Zone A - Also known as the General Urban Zone, this zone is\nprimarily a commercial and retail zone with less density and intensity than\nother Transect Zones and with a wide range of building types, all of which are\nless than two (2) stories in height. Setbacks and landscaping are variable.\nBuildings are generally connected by hardscaping or pedestrian paths.\nb.\nTransect Zone B - Also known as the Urban Zone, this zone is generally a\ntransition zone with medium density and intensity and with building types\n5\n\nNEW PAGE 108\naccommodating retail, commercial, residential, row houses and mixed-use\nuses, and generally bordering a secondary street grid and public spaces with\ncivic buildings and spaces connected by cross block passages.\nC. Transect Zone C - Also known as the Urban Core, this zone is generally a\nhigher density and intensity zone with primarily mixed use development and\nbuilding types accommodating retail, commercial, and residential uses, and\ngenerally bordering a primary street grid and major thoroughfares with\npedestrian corridors.\n2. Master Development Plans for property consisting of five (5) or more acres\nshall include a minimum of two (2) transect zones (A, B, or C). Master\nDevelopment Plans for property consisting of less than five (5) acres may\nutilize one (1) transect zone (A, B, or C).\n3. Within any single Master Development Plan, development within Transect\nZones A, B, and C shall not exceed those limits specified in Table 7.2.1,\nDevelopment Standards for Transect Zones and Specialized Zones.\nB. Specialized Zones\n1. The Specialized Zone, or SD Zone, is a zone established for uses such as\nstand alone hotels and mid-rise residential developmentwhich do not\nconform to one of the three normative Transect Zones (A, B, and C).\n2. Master Development Plans for properties consisting of five (5) or more acres\nmay include a Specialized Zone. Master Development Plans for property\nconsisting of less than five (5) acres shall not incorporate a Specialized Zone.\n3. Within any single Master Development Plan, development within a\nSpecialized District (SD Zone) shall not exceed those limits specified in\nTable 7.2.1, Development Standards for Transect Zones and
