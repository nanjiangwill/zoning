Corners: Setback at street corners will generally replicate frontage conditions.\nSide setbacks on a minor residential street may be less than the front\ndimension.\n(2.) Side and rear setbacks will vary according to side and rear buffer requirements as\nset forth in Article 11, with a minimum 0-foot setback when no buffer is required.\n(3.) Front and rear building facades shall be generally parallel to frontage property\nlines. The fa\u00e7ade shall be determined by the massing of the building. Buildings\nin all locations should relate the principal fa\u00e7ade to the sidewalk and public space\nof the street.\n(4.) Parking shall be located primarily to the rear of the building; side-yard parking\nshall occupy no more than 35% of the primary frontage line and shall not be\nplaced in any side-yard abutting an intersecting street. Where dimensions of\nexisting lots restrict parking behind buildings, the limitations on side-yard parking\nmay be modified.\n(5.) Hedges, garden walls, or knee walls may be built on property lines or as the\ncontinuation of building walls. A garden wall, hedge or knee wall a minimum 2.5'\nin height, maximum 3.5' in height, shall be installed along any street frontage\nadjacent to parking areas. Knee walls should be built of brick, stone or other\ndecorative masonry material, or should be built of wrought iron or other\ndecorative metal, and shall generally match the architectural style of Chadbourn.\n(6.) Parking areas on adjacent lots shall be connected with vehicular and pedestrian\nconnections wherever practical.\n(7.) Trash containers shall be located in a rear parking area (see Parking Regulations,\nArticle 12) and shall be screened from the right-of-way with a Type D Buffer\nYard per standards and specifications set forth in Article 11.\n(8.) Mechanical equipment at ground level shall be placed on the parking lot side of\nthe building away from buildings on adjacent sites and shall be screened from\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 25\n\nNEW PAGE 209\nview by either an opaque screen or fence, or a Type D Buffer Yard per standards\nand specifications set forth in Article 11.\n(9.) Building facades at street frontage lines shall be pedestrian oriented and of\npedestrian scale. The building's design shall promote pedestrian activity and\npedestrian-driven commerce. The sidewalk shall be an extension of the street\nlevel businesses' operations. As such, pedestrians should be able to preview\nbusinesses' merchandise and/or dine from the sidewalk. Business activities shall\nnot impede on the required pedestrian travel widths and shall not encroach more\nthan 5 feet into the sidewalk.\n(B.) Encroachments and Pedestrian Access to Building.\n(1.) Balconies, bay windows, arcades, awnings and porches at an upper level and their\nsupports are permitted and encouraged within the sidewalk as shown by the un-\nshaded area. Encroachments affixed\nto the building and horizontally\nprotruding more than 6\" from the face\nPARKING\nof the building must have a minimum\n7'6\" clearance from the finished\ngrade. Encroaching canopies should\ncover the entire sidewalk within the\npermitted distance shown by the un-\n5' MAX BALCONY/PORCH\nshaded area.\nENCROACHMENT\n(2.) Primary pedestrian access into the\nROW\nbuilding shall be from the street\nSIDEWALK\nSTREET\nfrontage line (indicated by larger\narrow). Secondary access may be from parking areas indicated by smaller\narrows).\n9.7-3 Urban Workplace Building Type.\n(A.) Permitted Height and Use Limitations.\n(1.) For buildings with flat roofs, building height shall be measured as the vertical\ndistance from the mean elevation of the existing grade to the highest finished roof\nsurface. The height of parapet walls is not counted in the building height\ncalculations and may vary depending upon the need to screen mechanical\nequipment.\n(2.) For buildings with pitched roofs, building heights shall be measured as the\nvertical distance from the mean elevation of the finished grade to a point\nrepresenting the midpoint of the peak and leave heights.\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 26\n\nNEW PAGE 210\n(3.) Building height to the ridge may vary depending on the roof pitch.\n(4.) Buildings shall have no less than 2 stories. Buildings shall have no more than 3\nstories, unless the building is in a \"TNDO\" district, in which case the maximum\nnumber of\nstories and\nmaximum\nbuilding\nheight is\nregulated by\n45' MAX\nthe procedure\nfor \"TNDO\"\napproval in\nArticle 7 of\nthis\n5' MAX\nENCROACHMENT\nOrdinance.\n(5.) Buildings shall have no more than 50% of the 1st floor in residential use.\n(B.) Architectural Standards.\n(1.) Principles:\n(a.) To perpetuate the unique building character of the Town and its environs, and\nto re-establish its local identity, development shall generally employ building\nstyles that are compatible with the architectural vocabulary of the area in their\nexternal treatment.\n(b.) Building elevations fronting or visible from public streets shall be clad with\nmasonry, wood, stucco, or similar material. Vinyl siding shall not comprise a\nstreet fronting building face to maintain compatibility with structures within\nthe Town.\n(c.) The front elevations facing the street, and the overall massing shall\ncommunicate an emphasis on the human scale and the pedestrian environment\nto maintain compatibility with structures within the Town.\n(d.) Each building should be designed to form part of a larger composition of the\narea in which it is situated. Adjacent buildings should thus be of similar scale,\nheight, and configuration to maintain compatibility with structures within the\nTown.\n(e.) Drive-through customer services, if permitted in the district, must be located\nat the rear of the building or on a side which does not abut a street to maintain\ncompatibility with structures within the Town.\n(f.) Trailers (mobile and/or manufactured units) may not be used as permanent\nworkplace buildings.\nChadbourn Development Ordinance - Article Page 27\n", "page_number": 208, "page_range": [208, 209, 210], "highlight": ["Buildings will range from 10' to 18' behind the street curb-line in <em>Mixed</em> <em>Use</em>\n(\"MU\"), Main Street (\"MS", "A garden wall, hedge or knee wall a minimum 2.5'\nin <em>height</em>, maximum 3.5' in <em>height</em>, shall be installed", "activities shall\nnot impede on the required pedestrian travel widths and shall not encroach more\nthan 5 <em>feet</em>", "Buildings shall have no less than 2 <em>stories</em>.", "the maximum\nnumber of\n<em>stories</em> and\n<em>maximum</em>\n<em>building</em>\n<em>height</em> is\nregulated by\n45' MAX\nthe procedure\nfor"], "score": 14.411129, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Mixed Use\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MU-1\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MU1\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MU-1\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 15\nnot exceed 50% of the width of the dwelling at the rear building line except in\nattached residential structures.\n2.10-10\nBackflow Preventers.
