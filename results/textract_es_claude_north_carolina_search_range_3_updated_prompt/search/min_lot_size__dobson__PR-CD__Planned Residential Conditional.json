The purpose of the Planned Residential Conditional District (PR-CD) is to encourage the\ndevelopment of environments which provide certain development privileges in exchange for\npreplanning and design considerations. The PR-CD provides an alternative to conventional\nsubdivision design by promoting the conservation and creation of viable, connected open space\nand more flexible lot design options while minimizing development costs. The Planned Residential\nConditional District (PR-CD) provides flexibility in utilizing new development concepts, including\nthe incorporation of a limited amount of non-residential uses. In return for development\nflexibility, additional site plan information and development conditions may be required of the\ndeveloper to assist in evaluating the suitability of a proposed PR-CD. While maximum open space\npreservation and high-quality residential development is the primary goal of PR-CDs, open space\nwithin PR-CDs must balance the need for open space preservation with an increased need for\nintegration with surrounding developments through street connectivity and compatibility with\nadjacent and internal land uses.\n(B) Minimum Size. A PR-CD shall be located on a site containing at least five (5) contiguous acres.\n(C)\nabout:blank\n59/167\n\nNEW PAGE 60\n6/3/24, 7:55 PM\nDobson, NC Code of Ordinances\nPre-Application Conference Required. Prior to the formal submission of a proposed PR-CD, the petitioner or\ntheir representative shall attend a pre-application conference with the Town's planning staff concerning the\nproposed development of the site. The petitioner shall be required to produce a scaled sketch site plan\nshowing the existing cultural, historic, and physical features of the site for review by the planning staff as\nwell as conditions the developer proposes to incorporate into the development. Staff may ask for additional\ninformation such as the location of prime agricultural soils, historical structures, archeological/cultural\nelements, the depth of viewshed as seen from existing public rights-of-way, the location of \"unique\"\nfeatures on the site, and the location and general specifications of any existing and proposed water/sewer\ninfrastructure.\nThe Town's Planning Staff in consultation with other departments shall comment on the site plan within\n15 days. The official plan of the PR-CD shall be submitted for review by the Planning and Zoning Board and\nthe Board of Commissioners only after the completion of the pre-application conference and the written\nresponse.\n(D) Permitted Principal Uses. PR-CDs do not have any inherent permitted or conditional uses and\ndevelopment activities are only allowed through specific conditions approved by the Board of\nCommissioners; however PR-CDs are primarily intended for single-family developments. A\nmaximum of ten percent (10%) of the total land of the development may be utilized for non-\nresidential uses. The compatibility and appropriateness of any non-residential uses proposed\nshall be carefully considered. Those uses permitted and conditions approved by the Board of\nCommissioners shall be reflected on the Conditional Zoning District Supplement issued by the\nZoning Enforcement Officer.\n(E) Relationship to Other Applicable Regulations. A PR-CD shall be subject to all applicable standards,\nprocedures, and regulations of this Ordinance unless otherwise set forth in this section.\n(F) Maximum Density. Maximum residential density shall be calculated based on the existing zoning\ndistrict the proposed PR-CD is located in. All land proposed for non-residential development shall\nbe excluded from density calculations. If all of the PR-CD or a portion of the PR-CD is unable to be\nserved by public water and sewer, minimum lot sizes and maximum density shall be determined\nin consultation with the Surry County Health Department.\n(G) Development Standards. A PR-CD shall meet the following standards:\n(1) Outside Perimeter Lot Setback Requirements. Any lot which adjoins the outside boundary of\nthe PR-CD shall be considered an outside perimeter lot. Internal street refers to a street that\nis within the boundary of the PR-CD. Adjoining street is a street which is not located within the\nPR-CD but is adjacent to the outside boundary of the PR-CD.

The purpose of the Planned Residential Conditional District (PR-CD) is to encourage the\ndevelopment of environments which provide certain development privileges in exchange for\npreplanning and design considerations. The PR-CD provides an alternative to conventional\nsubdivision design by promoting the conservation and creation of viable, connected open space\nand more flexible lot design options while minimizing development costs. The Planned Residential\nConditional District (PR-CD) provides flexibility in utilizing new development concepts, including\nthe incorporation of a limited amount of non-residential uses. In return for development\nflexibility, additional site plan information and development conditions may be required of the\ndeveloper to assist in evaluating the suitability of a proposed PR-CD. While maximum open space\npreservation and high-quality residential development is the primary goal of PR-CDs, open space\nwithin PR-CDs must balance the need for open space preservation with an increased need for\nintegration with surrounding developments through street connectivity and compatibility with\nadjacent and internal land uses.\n(B) Minimum Size.

The impact of one homeowner's\nactivities on his neighbor will be less than if the property owners were located side by side in a\nsubdivision.

Because development\nwill be on smaller lots than in the R-A District, more restrictions will be imposed on\nlandowners. Generally, these areas are not served by municipal water or sewer.\nR-15 Residential District\nThe intent of the R-15 Residential District is to provide a quiet, medium-density residential\nneighborhood inside the corporate limits that is served by both public water and sewer.\nR-8A Residential Multifamily District\nThe intent of the R-8A Multifamily Residential District is to provide areas for high density\nresidential development such as apartments and condominiums. It is expected that both\npublic water and sewer will be available within the corporate limits.\nR-MH Manufactured Home Residential District\nThe intent of the R-MH Manufactured Home Residential District is to insure that\nmanufactured home parks meet minimal development standards in order to protect the\nresidents of these parks as well as neighboring land owners.\nPR-CD Planned Residential Conditional District\nThe purpose of the PR-CD Planned Residential Conditional District is to encourage the\ndevelopment of environments which provide certain development privileges in exchange for\npreplanning and design considerations. The PR-CD provides an alternative to conventional\nsubdivision design by promoting the conservation and creation of viable, connected open\nspace and more flexible lot design options while minimizing development costs.\nO-I Office-Institution District\nThe intent of the Office-Institution District is to provide locations primarily for office and\ninstitutional development, although single-family dwellings are also permitted. Normally this\ndistrict provides a buffer between nonresidential and residential zoning districts.\nB-1 Central Business District\nThe intent of the B-1 Central Business District is to provide an area

However, it is clearly the intent to exclude commercial or industrial uses that will\ninfringe on agricultural and residential use of the area.\nR-S Residential-Suburban District\nabout:blank\n27/167\nCELL (1, 1): \n(A) Where such district boundaries are indicated as approximately following street or highway\nCELL (1, 2): \n(A) Where such district boundaries are indicated as approximately following street or highway\nlines, such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries;\nCELL (2, 1): \n(B) Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow lot lines, such lot\nCELL (2, 2): \n(B) Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow lot lines, such lot\nlines shall be construed to be said boundaries;\nCELL (3, 1): \n(C) Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the\nCELL (3, 2): \n(C) Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the\ncenterline of streets or highways, or the rights-of-way of same.

Because development\nwill be on smaller lots than in the R-A District, more restrictions will be imposed on\nlandowners. Generally, these areas are not served by municipal water or sewer.\nR-15 Residential District\nThe intent of the R-15 Residential District is to provide a quiet, medium-density residential\nneighborhood inside the corporate limits that is served by both public water and sewer.\nR-8A Residential Multifamily District\nThe intent of the R-8A Multifamily Residential District is to provide areas for high density\nresidential development such as apartments and condominiums. It is expected that both\npublic water and sewer will be available within the corporate limits.\nR-MH Manufactured Home Residential District\nThe intent of the R-MH Manufactured Home Residential District is to insure that\nmanufactured home parks meet minimal development standards in order to protect the\nresidents of these parks as well as neighboring land owners.\nPR-CD Planned Residential Conditional District\nThe purpose of the PR-CD Planned Residential Conditional District is to encourage the\ndevelopment of environments which provide certain development privileges in exchange for\npreplanning and design considerations. The PR-CD provides an alternative to conventional\nsubdivision design by promoting the conservation and creation of viable, connected open\nspace and more flexible lot design options while minimizing development costs.\nO-I Office-Institution District\nThe intent of the Office-Institution District is to provide locations primarily for office and\ninstitutional development, although single-family dwellings are also permitted. Normally this\ndistrict provides a buffer between nonresidential and residential zoning districts.\nB-1 Central Business District\nThe intent of the B-1 Central Business District is to provide an area near the center of Dobson\nwhere compatible commercial and governmental uses may be established that do not infringe\non neighboring residential uses.\nB-2 Highway Business District\nabout:blank\n28/167\n\nNEW PAGE 29\n6/3/24, 7:55 PM\nDobson, NC Code of Ordinances\nThe intent of the B-2 Highway Business District is to provide areas along thoroughfares and\ncollector streets for commercial uses, particularly the sales of retail goods and provision of\nservices.\nL-I Light Industrial District\nThe intent of the L-I Light Industrial District is to provide sites for manufacturing,\nwarehousing, processing, and related uses whose operating characteristics limit their effects\non adjacent uses.\nH-I Heavy Industrial District\nThe intent of the H-1 Heavy Industrial District is to provide sites for industrial, processing, and\nrelated operations whose external effects could be detrimental to certain classes of uses. This\ndistrict shall normally be located so that traffic to and from the use has direct access to an\narterial street and shall not be located directly adjacent to residentially zoned land.\nTABLE OF
