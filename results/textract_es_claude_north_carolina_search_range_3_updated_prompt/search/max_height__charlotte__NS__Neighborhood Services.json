with an\naverage height of 5 to 6 feet to be expected as normal growth within four\nyears. However, 25% of the shrubs may vary from the above standard.\nThe allowed variations are as follows:\n(i)\nShrubs may be deciduous; or\n(ii)\nShrubs may be 2 feet tall when planted, provided an average height\nof 3 to 4 feet is expected as normal growth within four years.\nShrubs planted on a berm may be of a lesser height, provided the\ncombined height of the berms and plantings is at least 6 feet after 4 years;\n(d)\nShrubs and trees shall be on the approved plant species list in the\n\"Approved Plant Species\" matrix in the Charlotte Land Development\nStandards Manual;\n(Petition No. 2009-083, \u00a7 12.302(9)(d), 01/19/10)\n(e)\nAll specifications for the measurement, quality, and installation of trees\nand shrubs shall be in accordance with the \"American Standards for\nNursery Stock\" published by the American Association of Nurserymen,\nand free of disease; and\n(f)\nTwenty-five percent of all trees within the buffer shall be evergreen.\n(10)\nGuidelines for landscaping buffers are as follows:\n(a)\nThe arrangement of trees and shrubs in the buffer area shall be done in a\nmanner that provides a visual separation between abutting land uses.\nShrubs shall be massed in rows or groups to achieve the maximum\nscreening effect; and\n(b)\nGuidelines for the arrangement of plant materials are illustrated in\nFigures 12.302.\n(11)\nIn the event that it can be demonstrated that existing vegetation meets the intent\nof this Section, but the plant materials are not on the approved list, the Zoning\nAdministrator may waive the requirements for plant materials.
