SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nThe following Special Development Standards shall apply to the uses specified in addition to the\ngeneral standards:\nSTANDARD A - MINIMUM SOLAR FARM REQUIREMENTS\n1. All solar farms must be set back from an adjacent highway right-of-way at least 50 feet.\nSimilarly, a side or rear set-back distance of 30 feet from any property line is required.\n2. A vegetative buffer consisting of either one or two rows of staggered evergreen vegetation\nis required as per the vegetative buffer design specification sheet available from the\nColumbus County Planning Department. A vegetative buffer may be constructed using any\nof those evergreen varieties identified or an approved equivalent. A staggered two row\nbuffer is to be located between any solar farm fencing and an adjacent highway. Similarly,\na two-row vegetative buffer is required to screen the farm from the direct view of adjacent\nresidential housing units. Where required, a single row vegetative buffer is required along\nperimeter fencing as noted in item three (3) below.\n3. A vegetative buffer consisting of one row of evergreen vegetation is required along all\nperimeter areas not covered under item number 2 above (i.e. where two-row vegetative\nbuffering is called for) but with the following exceptions:\na.\nWhere a natural vegetative buffer already exists on the property and which allows\nfor said natural vegetative buffer to remain and be maintained in an undisturbed\nnatural state which provides adequate screening to adjacent parcels on the side or\nsides, or along the back fence line of the solar farm.\nb. When a solar farm is located over 250 feet from an adjacent highway such that only\nminimal vegetative screening is needed to prevent the farm from becoming a\ndistraction to drivers on the adjacent highway or to adjacent landowners.\n4. Vegetative buffers may be located within the required setback areas.\n5. The maximum height for a ground mounted solar system under these guidelines is 15 feet\nabove ground level.\n6.

SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nThe following Special Development Standards shall apply to the uses specified in addition to the\ngeneral standards:\nSTANDARD A - MINIMUM SOLAR FARM REQUIREMENTS\n1. All solar farms must be set back from an adjacent highway right-of-way at least 50 feet.\nSimilarly, a side or rear set-back distance of 30 feet from any property line is required.\n2. A vegetative buffer consisting of either one or two rows of staggered evergreen vegetation\nis required as per the vegetative buffer design specification sheet available from the\nColumbus County Planning Department. A vegetative buffer may be constructed using any\nof those evergreen varieties identified or an approved equivalent. A staggered two row\nbuffer is to be located between any solar farm fencing and an adjacent highway. Similarly,\na two-row vegetative buffer is required to screen the farm from the direct view of adjacent\nresidential housing units. Where required, a single row vegetative buffer is required along\nperimeter fencing as noted in item three (3) below.\n3. A vegetative buffer consisting of one row of evergreen vegetation is required along all\nperimeter areas not covered under item number 2 above (i.e. where two-row vegetative\nbuffering is called for) but with the following exceptions:\na.\nWhere a natural vegetative buffer already exists on the property and which allows\nfor said natural vegetative buffer to remain and be maintained in an undisturbed\nnatural state which provides adequate screening to adjacent parcels on the side or\nsides, or along the back fence line of the solar farm.\nb. When a solar farm is located over 250 feet from an adjacent highway such that only\nminimal vegetative screening is needed to prevent the farm from becoming a\ndistraction to drivers on the adjacent highway or to adjacent landowners.\n4. Vegetative buffers may be located within the required setback areas.\n5. The maximum height for a ground mounted solar system under these guidelines is 15 feet\nabove ground level.\n6.
