Combined Parking Spaces. The required parking space for any number of separate uses may be combined in one\nlot, but the required space for one use may not be assigned to another use, except that one-half of the parking\nspaces required for churches, theaters, or assembly halls whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sundays\nmay be assigned to a use which will be closed at night or Sundays.\n2. Location on Other Property. If the off-street parking space required cannot be reasonably provided on the same\nlot on which the principal use is located, such space may be provided within four hundred (400) feet of the main\nentrance to such principal use, provided such land is in the same ownership as the principal use. Said land shall\nbe used for no other purpose so long as no other adequate provisions for parking space meeting the\nrequirements of this ordinance have been made for the principal use. In such case, the applicant for a certificate\nof zoning compliance for the principal use shall submit with his application an instrument duly executed and\nacknowledged, which subjects said land to parking use in connection with the principal use or for which it is\nmade available. Upon the payment of the necessary fee and the issuance of a building permit, the Town Clerk\nshall cause the said instrument to be registered with the Register of Deeds of Yancey County.\nSection 1214. Off-Street Loading and Unloading Space\nExcept in the C-1 zoning district every lot on which a business, trade or industry use is hereafter established shall provide\nspace as indicated herein for the loading and unloading or vehicles off the street. Such space shall have access to a\nstreet or alley.
