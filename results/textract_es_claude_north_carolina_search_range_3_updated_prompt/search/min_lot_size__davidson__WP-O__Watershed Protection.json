Expansions to structures classified as existing development on any lot other than a lot\ncontaining a single-family residence as the principle use must meet the requirements of this\nordinance; however, the built-upon area of existing development is not required to be included\nin the impervious calculations (i.e. the maximum built-upon area). If structures classified as\nexisting development are removed, the parcel's built-upon-area must comply with the standards\nof this ordinance.\n17.6.2 PRE-EXISTING LOTS\nAn existing lot of record owned by an individual prior to the effective date of these regulations,\nregardless of whether or not a vested right has been established, may be developed or used\nfor single-family residential purposes without being subject to these regulations.
