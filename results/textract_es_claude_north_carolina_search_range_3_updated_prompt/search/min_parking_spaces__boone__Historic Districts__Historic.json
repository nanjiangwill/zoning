Property up to two (2) acres in size shall be limited to three-quarters (3/4) of an\nacre of land disturbance. Therefore, a three-quarter (3/4) acre or smaller property\nin the viewshed is unrestricted by this Section with regard to land disturbing\nactivity.\nCELL (7, 1): \nCELL (7, 2): \n2. The maximum allowable land disturbance for property in the viewshed which is\nlarger than two (2) acres shall be limited to three-quarters (3/4) of an acre for the\n\nNEW PAGE 259\nTown of Boone\nUnified Development Ordinance\nArticle 14 Zoning Districts Regulations\nfirst two (2) acres, plus thirty percent (30%) of the additional property. For\nexample, a tract of land of four (4) acres can be developed with three-quarters (3/4)\nacre, or 32,670 square feet, of land disturbed based upon the first two acres, and\nan additional thirty percent (30%), or 26,136 square feet of land disturbed, based\non the additional two (2) acres. Therefore, a total of 58,806 square feet can be\ndisturbed in the development of the four (4) acres, and this total amount of land\ndisturbance may be consolidated in one area of the property. In this example, the\nland in one (1) acre can be 100% disturbed, in a second acre, partly disturbed, and\nin the remaining two (2) acres, undisturbed.\n3.\nLand disturbance of portions of a property below the viewshed are unrestricted by\nthis Section, but do not increase the amount of land disturbance which can take\nplace on the portion of the property in the viewshed.\nB. The intensity of development of property zoned RA within the viewshed shall be as\nestablished for the RA district. The intensity, including height limitations, of\ndevelopment of property in all other zoning districts within the viewshed shall be as\nestablished for the R1 zoning district.\nC. With respect to development existing before the effective date of this amendment:\n1. When the intensity of the existing development does not exceed the limits\nestablished by Subsection 14.42.03(B), the existing development may be increased\nin size up to ten percent (10%) greater than the limits established by Subsection\n14.42.03(B).\n2. When the intensity of the existing development already exceeds the limits\nestablished by Subsection 14.42.03(B), additional development is permitted up to\na size 10% greater than the existing structure, and likewise, an additional ten\npercent (10%) of impervious surface may be created.\n3. The limits on land disturbing activity created by Subsection 14.42.03(A) shall be\ncalculated as if no development on the property has yet taken place. In other\nwords, the Administrator shall exclude from the calculations of allowable land\ndisturbance that portion of the property upon which an impervious surface exists\nat the time this amendment is effective. For example, if a house with a 2,000 square\nfoot footprint and 2,000 square feet of driveway already exists on a three (3) acre\ntract, and the owner wishes to construct an addition, the Administrator will first\nadd the square footage of the house's footprint and the square footage of the\ndriveway to determine that there is already 4,000 square feet of impervious surface\non the property. This existing square footage of impervious surface will be\nsubtracted from the total land area of the property to calculate how much of the\nremaining property can be disturbed. In the example, the property will be viewed\nnot as a three (3) acre tract, but as a tract of two (2) acres, plus 39,560 square feet\n(an acre = 43,560 square feet, minus 4,000 square feet of existing impervious\n14-109\n\nNEW PAGE 260\nTown of Boone\nUnified Development Ordinance\nArticle 14 Zoning Districts Regulations\nsurface). The amount of allowable land disturbance to put in the addition ends up\nbeing 44,538 square feet.\nD. Persons developing property in the viewshed shall strive to reasonably site any\nstructures to be developed on the property in such way as to minimize their visual\nimpact from the major corridors. To this end, the Administrator may request a redesign\nof the development to accomplish this goal.\nE.\nPersons developing property in the viewshed shall strive to reasonably preserve and\nprotect foliage and trees on the property, without placing the construction in danger,\nwith a goal of minimizing the visual impact of the development from the major\ncorridors.\nF. All development in the viewshed shall include a plan for landscape buffering, using the\ntechniques and vegetation authorized in in Appendix C, Town of Boone Details and\nSpecifications Manual, in the line of sight from the major corridors, to reduce to the\nextent reasonably possible the visual impact of the development from the major\ncorridors. Such plans, in the case of the construction of a single-family home, need not\nbe \"formal\" or prepared by a landscape professional, but must be in writing sufficiently\ndetailed to allow the Administrator to know what is planned.\nG. All development along ridgelines must be designed in an effort to reasonably minimize\nthe visual impact of such development from the major corridors. To this end, the\nAdministrator may require a redesign of the development to accomplish this goal or\nmay require specific landscape buffering, such as trees and other plant material, to be\ninstalled. This requirement by the Administrator shall be considered an appealable\ndecision to the Board of Adjustment, and may be appealed in conformity with the\nprocedures of Article 6.\nH.
