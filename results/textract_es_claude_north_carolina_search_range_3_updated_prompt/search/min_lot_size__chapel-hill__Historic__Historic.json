The town encourages cluster developments as defined in Appendix A [Definitions]. Cluster developments, as defined in Appendix A [Definitions], require modification of lot size\nstandards; individual lots may be somewhat smaller but the sum of reductions in lot area becomes common recreation area for the benefit of all residents of the cluster development. The\nrecreation area is increased and the intensity of development is controlled. Cluster developments also allow the developer greater design flexibility and will permit reasonable use of land with\ndifficult topography.\n(b) Approval requirements. The town council may approve a cluster development in any residential district, or the HR-L or HR-M Special Districts, if it finds that:\n(1) The tract proposed for cluster development is at least two (2) acres in size.\n(2) Public, separate, water supply and sewerage connections are available for every subdivided lot.\n(3)\nThe total number of lots proposed for the tract, excluding parcels of reserved recreation area, is not greater than the number determined by multiplying the total gross land area by the\nmaximum density established in section 3.8 for that zoning district.\n(4) The recreation area reserved within the tract shall conform to the recreation area standards of section 5.5.\n(5) The minimum amount of land reserved as recreation area shall be the sum of all reductions in minimum gross land area as a result of the cluster form of development, combined with the\nminimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5. Only the minimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5 may be dedicated outside the boundaries of the land being\nsubdivided as specified in section 5.5.2.\n(c)\nReductions in lot and setback requirements. For lots created as part of a cluster development, minimum gross land area, minimum lot width, and minimum setback requirements may be reduced\nas follows:\n(1) Minimum lot size requirements specified in section 3.8 may be reduced to five thousand, five hundred (5,500) square feet gross land area.\n(2) Minimum lot width requirements specified in section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to fifty (50) feet.\n(3) Minimum street setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the street lot line forms an exterior boundary of the cluster development.\n(4)\nMinimum interior setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to eight (8) feet except where the interior lot line\nforms a boundary of the cluster development.\n(5) Minimum solar setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the north lot line forms\na\nboundary of the cluster development.\n(d) Floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations. For lots created as part of a cluster development, floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations, as shown in Table 3.8-1, shall be\ncalculated using the gross land area of the lot or the minimum lot size for the zoning district, whichever is greater.\n(Ord.

The town encourages cluster developments as defined in Appendix A [Definitions]. Cluster developments, as defined in Appendix A [Definitions], require modification of lot size\nstandards; individual lots may be somewhat smaller but the sum of reductions in lot area becomes common recreation area for the benefit of all residents of the cluster development. The\nrecreation area is increased and the intensity of development is controlled. Cluster developments also allow the developer greater design flexibility and will permit reasonable use of land with\ndifficult topography.\n(b) Approval requirements. The town council may approve a cluster development in any residential district, or the HR-L or HR-M Special Districts, if it finds that:\n(1) The tract proposed for cluster development is at least two (2) acres in size.\n(2) Public, separate, water supply and sewerage connections are available for every subdivided lot.\n(3)\nThe total number of lots proposed for the tract, excluding parcels of reserved recreation area, is not greater than the number determined by multiplying the total gross land area by the\nmaximum density established in section 3.8 for that zoning district.\n(4) The recreation area reserved within the tract shall conform to the recreation area standards of section 5.5.\n(5) The minimum amount of land reserved as recreation area shall be the sum of all reductions in minimum gross land area as a result of the cluster form of development, combined with the\nminimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5. Only the minimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5 may be dedicated outside the boundaries of the land being\nsubdivided as specified in section 5.5.2.\n(c)\nReductions in lot and setback requirements. For lots created as part of a cluster development, minimum gross land area, minimum lot width, and minimum setback requirements may be reduced\nas follows:\n(1) Minimum lot size requirements specified in section 3.8 may be reduced to five thousand, five hundred (5,500) square feet gross land area.\n(2) Minimum lot width requirements specified in section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to fifty (50) feet.\n(3) Minimum street setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the street lot line forms an exterior boundary of the cluster development.\n(4)\nMinimum interior setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to eight (8) feet except where the interior lot line\nforms a boundary of the cluster development.\n(5) Minimum solar setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the north lot line forms\na\nboundary of the cluster development.\n(d) Floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations. For lots created as part of a cluster development, floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations, as shown in Table 3.8-1, shall be\ncalculated using the gross land area of the lot or the minimum lot size for the zoning district, whichever is greater.\n(Ord.

The conditional zoning district shall include a condition\nrequiring recordation of a deed in accordance with the requirements of subsection (2), below.\n(2) Dedication.\nPrior to issuance of a building permit, the owner of the transferor parcel shall record a deed in the chain of title of the transferor parcel expressly restricting the use of the land in perpetuity to\nopen space, agricultural lands or street/road right-of-way. The deed restriction shall be expressly enforceable by the town council, and a boundary plat for the transferor parcel shall be recorded\nreflecting the restriction.\n(d) Evidence of restriction required for development approval.\nA developer of a receiver site must submit, in conjunction with his/her application for development approval, evidence that the transferor parcel has been restricted to non-development uses and\nthat a boundary plat has been recorded in accordance with the above provisions. No plat for a subdivision in conjunction with which severable development rights are exercised shall be recorded\nby the register of deeds, and no new building, or part thereof, or addition to or enlargement of an existing building, that is part of a development project in conjunction with which severable\ndevelopment rights are exercised shall be occupied, until documents have been recorded in the office of the register of deeds transferring title from the owner of the severable development rights\nto the receiver.\n(Ord.

The boundary for the HR District is depicted in Figure 3.5.7(e), below:\nFigure 3.5.7(e): HR District Boundary\nLegend\nHR District Boundary\nParcel Lines\nRoadways\nCarrboro Jurisdiction\nParallel HR District\n1:10000\nNOTES:\n[1] Because the Historic Rogers Road Neighborhood, as defined in Mapping Our Community's Future, is located across two jurisdictions (the Town of Chapel Hill and the Town of\nCarrboro), a parallel district was prepared for the Town of Carrboro, to be applicable in the grey-shaded area on the map.\nf) Subdistricts Established. The HR District is comprised of subdistricts, or character areas. The purpose and intent of each subdistrict is as follows:\n1) Residential-Low Density (HR-L) Subdistrict. The Residential-Low Density (HR-L) Subdistrict is established with the intent to protect and preserve the character of existing lower-density areas\n(minimum lot size 14,500 square feet, or no more than three lots per acre) within the neighborhood while providing for compatible new development, including new housing choice options,\nand increased home occupation opportunities for residents.\n2) Residential-Medium Density (HR-M) Subdistrict. The Residential-Medium Density (HR-M) Subdistrict is established with the intent of designating areas within the neighborhood for medium-\ndensity (minimum lot size 9,000 square feet, or no more than five lots per acre) residential development that offers a broader range of housing options and increased home occupation\nopportunities for residents.\n3)\nHousing and Employment Mixed-Use (HR-X) Subdistrict. The Housing and Employment Mixed-Use (HR-X) Subdistrict is established with the intent of providing areas within the neighborhood\nwith a broader range of housing and employment options. These areas are intended to concentrate new development into nodes which will balance providing areas for desired new uses\nwhile protecting the overall neighborhood character. Uses appropriate in the HR-X Subdistrict include live-work units, flex offices, and low-intensity neighborhood-serving establishments such\nas healthcare, assisted living, elder care, child care, and recreation facilities.\nNOTE: As of May 22, 2019, no lands bear the HR-X designation. This subdistrict is established as a placeholder for future use within the district, subject to a rezoning.\n4) Conservation (HR-C) Subdistrict. The Conservation (HR-C) Subdistrict is established with the intent of preserving and protecting environmentally sensitive areas as well as lands under joint\nmanagement by the Town of Chapel Hill and Orange County.\nNOTE: As of May 22, 2019, no lands bear the HR-C designation. This subdistrict is established as a placeholder for future use within the district, subject to a rezoning.\ng) Modification of District Standards.\n1) Minor modifications or deviations of up to 10 percent may be approved by the Planning Director through an administrative adjustment for the following numerical requirements:\nA. Maximum single-family home size;\nB. Maximum block length; or\nC. Street Configuration\n2) In order to be granted a modification, the applicant requesting the modification must demonstrate all of the following:\nA. The modification is consistent with the character of development on surrounding land and results in development that is compatible with surrounding land uses;\nB. The modification results in development that is consistent with both the purpose and intent statement of the HR District, as stated in Section 3.5.7(a), and the purpose and intent\nstatement of the subdistrict in which the development is located, as stated in Section 3.5.7(g)(2);\n21 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 22\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nC. The modification compensates for some unusual aspect of the site or the proposed development that is not shared by landowners in general;\nD. The modification will not pose a danger to the public health or safety; and\nE. Any adverse impacts resulting from the modification will be fully mitigated.\n3) No modification granted under this section shall result in a change in use.\nh) Development Standards.

The manager and applicant also shall present the draft agreement in informal public\ninformation sessions for public review and comment.\nC. Initial development agreement: Applications for approval of an initial development agreement within this zone shall be processed concurrently with the petition for rezoning to the DA-1\ndistrict. The legislative hearing on the initial development agreement shall be noticed and held concurrently with the hearing on the proposed rezoning. Notice of the legislative hearing\nbefore the town council on the proposed development agreement shall follow the same notice requirements as are applicable for hearing on proposed zoning atlas amendments. The\npublic notice shall include the location of the property covered by the proposed development agreement; the development uses proposed on the property, and how a copy of the\nproposed development agreement may be obtained or reviewed. The town council shall take action on an application for an initial development agreement within this zone concurrently\nwith action on the application for rezoning to this district. The initial development agreement may be applicable to all or part of the land within the district.\nD. Subsequent development agreements and major modifications. Subsequent new development agreements within this zoning district and major modifications of a previously approved\ndevelopment agreement shall be considered using the following process:\n1. Upon receipt of an application for approval, the town manager shall review the proposal for completeness. The town manager shall determine within fifteen (15) working days whether\nthe application is complete and shall promptly notify the town council and applicant of that determination. If the application is determined to be incomplete, a notice of the deficiencies\nin the mandatory items to be included in a proposed agreement or major modifications shall be provided to the applicant with the notice of the town manager's determination. if the\napplication is determined to be complete, the town manager shall notify the applicant of that determination and shall prepare a report on the proposed agreement or major\nmodifications.\n2.\nThe town manager shall submit a complete proposed agreement or major modifications and the town manager's report to the planning commission for review and comment. The\nplanning commission shall review the application and the town manager's report and shall submit to the town council a written recommendation regarding the proposed agreement or\nmajor modification.

If the planning commission fails to prepare its recommendation to the Town\nCouncil within this time limit, or extensions thereof, the town council may consider the proposed agreement without a comment or recommendation from the planning commission.\n3.\nThe town council shall hold a legislative hearing on a proposed subsequent development agreement or major modifications to a previously approved development agreement. Notice\nof the date, time, and place of the legislative hearing before the town council shall follow the same published, mailed, and posted notice requirements as are applicable for hearings on\nproposed zoning atlas amendments. The public notice shall include the location of the property covered by the proposed development agreement, the development uses proposed on\nthe property, and the place a copy of the proposed development agreement may be obtained or reviewed.\n4. The town council shall make a decision on a proposed subsequent development agreement or major modifications to a previously approved development agreement within one\nhundred twenty (120) calendar days of the date of the town manager's determination that a complete application was submitted or such further time as mutually agreed to by the\napplicant and the town.\nE. Minor modifications to a previously approved development agreement may be approved by the town manager as long as such changes continue to be in substantial compliance with the\napproving action of the town council and all other applicable requirements and result in a configuration of buildings/development that is generally consistent with the town council-\napproved development agreement. The town manager shall make a decision on the proposed minor amendment within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days of the date of the town\nmanager's determination that a complete application was submitted or such further time as mutually agreed to by the applicant and the town. The town manager shall not have the\nauthority to approve changes that constitute a major modification of a town council-development agreement.\nF.\nThe time periods referenced in this subsection shall not run during any period in which the applications for subsequent development agreements or major modifications to a previously\napproved development agreement have been returned to the applicant for substantial modification or analysis. The time periods set forth in this subsection may also be modified by\nmutual consent of the applicant and the town council.\"\n(k) Actions after decision on a development agreement.\n(1) Recording approval. If the application for approval of a development agreement or major modification is approved or approved with conditions, the town manager shall execute the\ndevelopment agreement or major modification in accord with the action of the town council. The applicant shall then execute the development agreement or major modification and record\nthe development agreement or amendment in the office of the applicable county register of deeds within fourteen (14) days after the town enters into the development agreement. The\nburdens of the development agreement are binding upon, and the benefits of the agreement shall inure to, all successors in interest to the parties to the agreement.\n(2) Individual site development permits. After an executed development agreement is recorded, the town manager may then accept applications for individual site development permits\nfor\nspecific buildings that the applicant proposes to build within the physical boundaries covered by the agreement. No construction work on any such building identified in the agreement may\nbegin until a site development permit has been issued. The town manager shall prescribe the form(s) of applications as well as any other material the town manager may reasonably require to\ndetermine compliance with the agreement. The town manager shall approve or deny of the individual site development permit application within fifteen (15) working days of the manager's\ndetermination that the individual site development plan application is complete. The town manager shall approve the application upon finding it is substantially consistent with and does not\nviolate any term of the agreement and shall deny approval upon finding the application is NOT substantially consistent with or violates a term of the agreement. If the application is denied,\nthe Town manager shall specify the grounds for finding that it is inconsistent or in violation and refer the applicant to the special use permit process described in section 4.5 of this appendix.\nAlternatively, the applicant may modify the site development permit application or apply for a major modification to the development agreement. Provided, under no circumstances shall a\nchange in floor area of less than one thousand (1,000) square feet or fewer than ten (10) parking spaces be deemed either a minor or major modification of the development agreement nor\nrequire approval or modification of an individual site development permit; such changes shall be reported by the applicant to the town manager.\n(3)\nExpiration, abandonment, revocation or development agreement. The term of any development agreement shall be set forth in the agreement. The development agreement shall also contain\nspecific provisions relative to default or termination of the agreement.\n(4) Periodic review and amendment of the development agreement. The town manager shall at least every twelve (12) months conduct a review of the development agreement at which time the\napplicant or its successors in interest must demonstrate good faith compliance with the terms of the development agreement. The town manager shall promptly report the results of this\nreview to the town council. If, as a result of this periodic review, the town council finds and determines that the applicant or its successors in interest has committed a material breach of the\nterms or conditions of the agreement, the town manager shall serve notice in writing, within a reasonable time not to exceed thirty (30) working days after the periodic review, upon the\napplicant or its successors in interest setting forth with reasonable particularity the nature of the breach and the evidence supporting the finding and determination, and providing the\napplicant or their successors in interest a reasonable time in which to cure the material breach. If the applicant or its successors in interest fail to cure the material breach within the time\ngiven, then the town council unilaterally may terminate or modify the development agreement pursuant to NCGS 160D-1008; provided, the notice of termination or modification may be\nappealed to the board of adjustment in the manner provided by 160D-405. Thereafter the applicant or its successors in interest may pursue any other rights and remedies available at law or\nin equity. If the town council elects to unilaterally modify the agreement, the applicant or its successors in interest may elect for the development agreement to be terminated rather than\naccede to the development agreement with the modifications unilaterally made by the town council.\n3.5.7.

Except where exempted in Section 3.5.7(c), Exemptions, the standards in this section apply to all land and development located within the HR district and subdistrict boundaries as\nidentified and located on the Chapel Hill Zoning Atlas.\nc) Exemptions. Minor additions to lawfully-established buildings that existed on May 22, 2019 are exempt from the standards in this section. For the purposes of this section, \"minor additions\" are\ndefined as increases in the amount of floor area on a lot of up to 25 percent beyond what existed on May 22, 2019 or up to a maximum total size of 2,000 square feet of heated floor area,\nwhichever is greater.\nd) Effective Date. The effective date of these standards is May 22, 2019.\ne) District Boundary. The boundary for the HR District is depicted in Figure 3.5.7(e), below:\nFigure 3.5.7(e): HR District Boundary\nLegend\nHR District Boundary\nParcel Lines\nRoadways\nCarrboro Jurisdiction\nParallel HR District\n1:10000\nNOTES:\n[1] Because the Historic Rogers Road Neighborhood, as defined in Mapping Our Community's Future, is located across two jurisdictions (the Town of Chapel Hill and the Town of\nCarrboro), a parallel district was prepared for the Town of Carrboro, to be applicable in the grey-shaded area on the map.\nf) Subdistricts Established. The HR District is comprised of subdistricts, or character areas. The purpose and intent of each subdistrict is as follows:\n1) Residential-Low Density (HR-L) Subdistrict. The Residential-Low Density (HR-L) Subdistrict is established with the intent to protect and preserve the character of existing lower-density areas\n(minimum lot size 14,500 square feet, or no more than three lots per acre) within the neighborhood while providing for compatible new development, including new housing choice options,\nand increased home occupation opportunities for residents.\n2) Residential-Medium Density (HR-M) Subdistrict. The Residential-Medium Density (HR-M) Subdistrict is established with the intent of designating areas within the neighborhood for medium-\ndensity (minimum lot size 9,000 square feet, or no more than five lots per acre) residential development that offers a broader range of housing options and increased home occupation\nopportunities for residents.\n3)\nHousing and Employment Mixed-Use (HR-X) Subdistrict. The Housing and Employment Mixed-Use (HR-X) Subdistrict is established with the intent of providing areas within the neighborhood\nwith a broader range of housing and employment options. These areas are intended to concentrate new development into nodes which will balance providing areas for desired new uses\nwhile protecting the overall neighborhood character. Uses appropriate in the HR-X Subdistrict include live-work units, flex offices, and low-intensity neighborhood-serving establishments such\nas healthcare, assisted living, elder care, child care, and recreation facilities.\nNOTE: As of May 22, 2019, no lands bear the HR-X designation. This subdistrict is established as a placeholder for future use within the district, subject to a rezoning.\n4) Conservation (HR-C) Subdistrict. The Conservation (HR-C) Subdistrict is established with the intent of preserving and protecting environmentally sensitive areas as well as lands under joint\nmanagement by the Town of Chapel Hill and Orange County.\nNOTE: As of May 22, 2019, no lands bear the HR-C designation. This subdistrict is established as a placeholder for future use within the district, subject to a rezoning.\ng) Modification of District Standards.\n1) Minor modifications or deviations of up to 10 percent may be approved by the Planning Director through an administrative adjustment for the following numerical requirements:\nA. Maximum single-family home size;\nB. Maximum block length; or\nC. Street Configuration\n2) In order to be granted a modification, the applicant requesting the modification must demonstrate all of the following:\nA. The modification is consistent with the character of development on surrounding land and results in development that is compatible with surrounding land uses;\nB. The modification results in development that is consistent with both the purpose and intent statement of the HR District, as stated in Section 3.5.7(a), and the purpose and intent\nstatement of the subdistrict in which the development is located, as stated in Section 3.5.7(g)(2);\n21 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 22\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nC. The modification compensates for some unusual aspect of the site or the proposed development that is not shared by landowners in general;\nD. The modification will not pose a danger to the public health or safety; and\nE. Any adverse impacts resulting from the modification will be fully mitigated.\n3) No modification granted under this section shall result in a change in use.\nh) Development Standards.

No. 2020-10-28/0-10, \u00a7 8)\n3.5.2 Office/Institutional-4\n(a) Purpose and intent.\nThe purpose and intent of the office/institutional-4 district (OI-4) is to establish procedural and substantive standards for the town council's review and approval of development on large tracts of land\nwhere the predominant use is to be college, university, hospital, clinics, public cultural facilities, and related functions.\nThe objective of this section and the OI-4 district is to allow for growth and development while protecting the larger community, nearby neighborhoods, and the environment from impacts accompanying\nmajor new development. A key feature of this district is the preparation of a development plan that would allow the property owner, immediate neighbors, and the larger community to understand\nspecifically what levels of development are being proposed, and what impacts would likely accompany the development, so that mitigation measures can be designed and implemented.\n(b) Overview of Development Review Procedures.\nProcedures in this zoning district are designed to facilitate:\nArticulation of development plans that involve multiple buildings in multiple locations over an extended time period on a given tract of land, as defined in a development plan;\nIdentification of total infrastructure needs for such proposed development as specified in a development plan and cumulative impacts resulting from full development as specified in a\n10 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 11\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\ndevelopment plan; and\nProvision of measures to mitigate the negative impacts, including off-site construction of parking decks as described in subsection (d)(2), phased in a manner appropriate with the pace of\nconstruction.\nTo this end, owners of property zoned OI-4 are encouraged to prepare detailed development plans, as described below, for review and approval by the town council. For buildings that are included in an\napproved development plan, site development permits for individual buildings are to be issued by the town manager, following a determination by the town manager that such individual building plans are\ngenerally consistent with the town council-approved development plan.\nFor development proposed within an OI-4 zoning district that is not included in a town council-approved development plan, but is a minor modification according to the provisions of subsection (j) of this\nsection, the town manager may approve a change to the development plan and issue a site development permit. For development proposed within an OI-4 zoning district that is not included in a town\ncouncil-approved development plan and that cannot be considered a minor modification to the plan according to subsection (j) of this section, such development shall be considered to be a special use, and\nsubject to the special use permit procedural requirements of section 4.5 of this appendix. In the alternative, the applicant may apply to the town council for an amendment to the development plan.\nOnce a property is zoned office/institutional-4, all regulations, standards, and procedures prescribed for the previously-applicable zoning district shall apply until (1) a development plan is approved; or\n(2) six (6) months have elapsed, whichever comes first.\n(c) Concept plan review. Prior to submittal of a development plan or modification of development plan, a concept plan review shall be conducted by the Town Council. It is the intent of the\nconceptual development plan process to provide an opportunity for the Town Council, Town Manager and citizens to review and evaluate the impact of the proposed development on the\ncharacter of the area in which it is proposed to be located.\n(1) Submittal requirements. Applications for conceptual development plan review shall be filed with the Town Manager. The Town Manager shall prescribe the form(s) on which information shall\nbe submitted. Application submittal requirements shall include the following:\nA. Descriptions of proposed development with building locations, building sizes, parking arrangements, and description of building heights with consideration of impact on adjacent areas.\n(d) Development Plan.\nA development plan shall address issues such as general location and size of new facilities, parking, utilities, stormwater management, impervious surface, and access/circulation. A development plan\nshall identify the general location, size, and proposed uses of buildings. A development plan shall project anticipated impacts on streets, water and sewer facilities, stormwater runoff, air quality, noise, and\nlighting.\n(1) Submittal requirements. Application submittal requirements shall include the following:\nA. Specific descriptions of proposed development with building locations, building sizes, parking arrangements, and description of building heights with consideration of impact on adjacent\nareas.\nB. Analysis of impacts resulting from proposed development, along with options to mitigate impacts relating to:\nTransportation management (traffic, transit, parking, bikes, pedestrians, air quality);\nStormwater management analysis (quantity and quality); and\nNoise and lighting analysis.\nIndividual effects must be evaluated in the context of the whole development plan and not in isolation. Impacts shall be evaluated in accordance with guidelines endorsed for use by the town\ncouncil.\nC. Preliminary timetable and sequencing schedule for building construction and for related mitigation measures.\n(2) Off-site components. Mitigation measures involving construction of parking decks may need to be developed outside the boundaries of the development plan. Notwithstanding any other\nprovision of this Land Use Management Ordinance, a parking deck proposed to mitigate impacts of a development plan, and approved by the town council as part of a development plan, may\nbe located on a site not within the boundaries of an OI-4 zoning district. Any such facility shall be reviewed as a site development permit according to the provisions of subsection (i)(2) of this\nsection.\n(e) Permitted uses and development intensities.\nPermitted uses shall be identical with uses listed in the use matrix (section 3.7) as being permitted in OI-3, except that place of assembly shall be considered to be a permitted use and not a special use.\nThe maximum floor area allowed shall be as provided in a development plan that is approved by the town council. Special restrictions apply in perimeter transition areas (see subsection (g)).\nFor purposes of calculating compliance with a specified maximum floor area, the following land uses shall not be counted as floor area: new residential development (including Dwellings and residence\nhalls), and new public cultural facilities.\n(f) Standards.\nDevelopment in the OI-4 zoning district shall be designed in a manner that provides a mix of uses which are integrated, interrelated and linked by pedestrian ways, bikeways, and other transportation\nsystems. Development plans shall, as practical and consistent with applicable laws and regulations, include measures to encourage reduction of automobile use and promote alternative modes of\ntransportation; to mitigate adverse environmental impacts; to promote conservation of non-renewable energy resources; and to achieve visual continuity in the siting and scale of buildings. Specifically, a\ndevelopment plan shall address the following:\n(1) Noise: Noise levels from development proposed in the development plan shall not exceed those allowed by the Town of Chapel Hill Noise Ordinance.\n(2) Environment: Development proposed in the development plan shall minimize impacts on natural site features, and be accompanied by measures to mitigate those impacts.\n(3) Transportation: Development proposed in the development plan shall be accompanied by measures to mitigate transportation impacts that are caused by the development.\n(4) Stormwater management: Development proposed in the development plan shall be accompanied by measures to mitigate stormwater impacts (quantity and quality) that are caused by the\ndevelopment.\n(5) Public utilities: There shall be a general demonstration that water, sewer, and other needed utilities can be made available to accommodate development proposed in the development plan.\n(6) Historic districts: The provisions of section 3.6.2 of this appendix shall apply to any development proposed within one of Chapel Hill's Historic Districts.\n(g) Perimeter transition areas.\nA development plan shall designate a perimeter transition area establishing appropriate standards at borders of the development plan, necessary to minimize impacts of development proposed in\nthe development plan on adjacent property, to be approved by the town council as part of the development plan. Standards shall address:\n(1) Screening mechanical equipment,\n(2) Exterior lighting,\n(3) Height limits,\n(4) Landscaping.\n(h) Procedures for approval of development plans.\n11 of 89\n3/20/24,
