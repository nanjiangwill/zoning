Abuts or links designated historic landmarks and/or districts.\n(5) The area must be predominantly residential in use and character.\nAny designated historic overlay district shall be deemed to satisfy the criteria listed above.\n(b) Zoning authority. Separate ordinances are required to designate each district. Ordinances designating each neighborhood conservation district shall identify the designated district boundaries,\nand specify the individual purposes and standards for that district.\n(1) Overlay district. Neighborhood conservation districts are designed as overlays to the regular zoning districts. Property designated within these districts must also be designated as being within\none (1) of the general use districts. Authorized uses must be permitted in both the general use district and the overlay district. Property designated as a neighborhood conservation district\nmay have additional designations. Such property shall comply with all applicable use restrictions.\n33 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 34\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(2) Zoning designation.\nA. The zoning designation for property located within a neighborhood conservation district shall consist of the base zone symbol and the overlay district symbol (CD) as a suffix.\nNeighborhood conservation districts shall be numbered sequentially to distinguish among different districts, i.e., R-4 (CD-1), R-1 (CD-2), etc.\nB. The designation of property within a neighborhood conservation district places such property in a new zoning district classification and all procedures and requirements for zoning/\nrezoning must be followed.\nC. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of a specific neighborhood conservation district ordinance and the general use district regulations, the provisions of the neighborhood\nconservation district ordinance shall control.\nD. Except as modified by this section, the procedures for zoning changes set forth in section 4.4 shall otherwise apply to the designation of an area as a neighborhood conservation district.\n(c) Initiation.

Except where exempted in Section 3.5.7(c), Exemptions, the standards in this section apply to all land and development located within the HR district and subdistrict boundaries as\nidentified and located on the Chapel Hill Zoning Atlas.\nc) Exemptions. Minor additions to lawfully-established buildings that existed on May 22, 2019 are exempt from the standards in this section. For the purposes of this section, \"minor additions\" are\ndefined as increases in the amount of floor area on a lot of up to 25 percent beyond what existed on May 22, 2019 or up to a maximum total size of 2,000 square feet of heated floor area,\nwhichever is greater.\nd) Effective Date. The effective date of these standards is May 22, 2019.\ne) District Boundary. The boundary for the HR District is depicted in Figure 3.5.7(e), below:\nFigure 3.5.7(e): HR District Boundary\nLegend\nHR District Boundary\nParcel Lines\nRoadways\nCarrboro Jurisdiction\nParallel HR District\n1:10000\nNOTES:\n[1] Because the Historic Rogers Road Neighborhood, as defined in Mapping Our Community's Future, is located across two jurisdictions (the Town of Chapel Hill and the Town of\nCarrboro), a parallel district was prepared for the Town of Carrboro, to be applicable in the grey-shaded area on the map.\nf) Subdistricts Established. The HR District is comprised of subdistricts, or character areas. The purpose and intent of each subdistrict is as follows:\n1) Residential-Low Density (HR-L) Subdistrict. The Residential-Low Density (HR-L) Subdistrict is established with the intent to protect and preserve the character of existing lower-density areas\n(minimum lot size 14,500 square feet, or no more than three lots per acre) within the neighborhood while providing for compatible new development, including new housing choice options,\nand increased home occupation opportunities for residents.\n2) Residential-Medium Density (HR-M) Subdistrict. The Residential-Medium Density (HR-M) Subdistrict is established with the intent of designating areas within the neighborhood for medium-\ndensity (minimum lot size 9,000 square feet, or no more than five lots per acre) residential development that offers a broader range of housing options and increased home occupation\nopportunities for residents.\n3)\nHousing and Employment Mixed-Use (HR-X) Subdistrict. The Housing and Employment Mixed-Use (HR-X) Subdistrict is established with the intent of providing areas within the neighborhood\nwith a broader range of housing and employment options. These areas are intended to concentrate new development into nodes which will balance providing areas for desired new uses\nwhile protecting the overall neighborhood character. Uses appropriate in the HR-X Subdistrict include live-work units, flex offices, and low-intensity neighborhood-serving establishments such\nas healthcare, assisted living, elder care, child care, and recreation facilities.\nNOTE: As of May 22, 2019, no lands bear the HR-X designation. This subdistrict is established as a placeholder for future use within the district, subject to a rezoning.\n4) Conservation (HR-C) Subdistrict. The Conservation (HR-C) Subdistrict is established with the intent of preserving and protecting environmentally sensitive areas as well as lands under joint\nmanagement by the Town of Chapel Hill and Orange County.\nNOTE: As of May 22, 2019, no lands bear the HR-C designation. This subdistrict is established as a placeholder for future use within the district, subject to a rezoning.\ng) Modification of District Standards.\n1) Minor modifications or deviations of up to 10 percent may be approved by the Planning Director through an administrative adjustment for the following numerical requirements:\nA.

Street Configuration\n2) In order to be granted a modification, the applicant requesting the modification must demonstrate all of the following:\nA. The modification is consistent with the character of development on surrounding land and results in development that is compatible with surrounding land uses;\nB. The modification results in development that is consistent with both the purpose and intent statement of the HR District, as stated in Section 3.5.7(a), and the purpose and intent\nstatement of the subdistrict in which the development is located, as stated in Section 3.5.7(g)(2);\n21 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 22\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nC. The modification compensates for some unusual aspect of the site or the proposed development that is not shared by landowners in general;\nD. The modification will not pose a danger to the public health or safety; and\nE. Any adverse impacts resulting from the modification will be fully mitigated.\n3) No modification granted under this section shall result in a change in use.\nh) Development Standards. This section sets out the special standards for new development or redevelopment in the HR District. Development standards not listed in this section (including\nRecreational Area for Residential Subdivisions, Required Buffers for Adjacent Vacant Land Zoning, and Permitted Sign Types, Dimensional Standards, and Lighting) shall comply with the standards\nfor development in the R-1 District listed in Article 5.\n1) Buffering.\nA. Purpose and Intent. The standards in this section are intended to protect the residential character of existing neighborhoods surrounding new mixed-use development in the HR District.\nB. Applicability. The standards in this section shall apply to lands in the Housing and Employment Mixed-Use (HR-X) Subdistrict.\nC. Buffering Standards.\n1.
