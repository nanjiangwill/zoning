Review Process: All development proposals within the Cedar Point Business\nOverlay District shall submit a plan to the Planning Board to check for compliance\nwith this and any other applicable ordinances.\n(a) Development Plan - The applicant shall, at a minimum, submit plans\ncontaining data and information consistent with all other applicable\nprovisions of this ordinance.\n(b) Waiver of Overlay District Requirements - The applicant shall have the\noption of asking the Planning Board to waive certain aspects of this overlay\nif deemed necessary. The applicant must show the Planning Board and\nBoard of Commissioners that the waiver is the result of site-specific\ncondition and not the result of problems created by the property owner\nand/or developer.\n4. Design Standards: Developments shall comply with all applicable requirements\nof this regulation. In addition, the following design standards shall be followed:\n(In the event of inconsistencies, the standards contained in this section shall\ngovern.)\n(a)\nSigns\ni.\nFreestanding Signs (Figure 1):\na. Number - One freestanding sign shall be permitted per parcel.\n1 The original date of adoption of the regulation.\nPage 69\n\nNEW PAGE 70\nb. Height - No freestanding sign shall exceed twenty feet in height.\nFigure 1\n10 ft.\nMonument\n4 ft\n5 ft.\nSign\nGround Level\nii.\nWall Signs:\nThe maximum total area of all allowable signs on the wall of a building\nshall be equal to no more than ten percent of the area of the wall of\nwhich such sign is a part or to which each such sign is attached.\niii.\niii. Total Sign Area and Number of Signs:\nThe maximum aggregate of all allowable signs on each parcel, including\nfreestanding, building or any other signs, shall be equal to 200 square\nfeet. When a zoning parcel contains more than one principal use, the\nentire parcel shall be allowed 400 square feet of signage. The owner is\nresponsible for allocating sign space on the parcel.\niv.\nSigns shall be located such that there is at every street intersection a\nclear view of sight distance between the heights of three feet and ten\nfeet, and all signs shall be setback no less than five (5) feet from the\nright-of-way of any public street. In such case that a freestanding sign\nshall be located on the corner of two (2) rights-of-way, the sign shall\nhave a setback of fifteen (15) feet from both rights-of-way.\nV.\nNo animated sign or moving or flashing signs shall be permitted.\nvi.\nNo portable signs shall be permitted.\nvii.\nNo temporary signs shall be permitted.\nviii.\nNo projecting or suspended signs shall be permitted.\nix.\nNo inflatable signs or tethered balloons shall be permitted.\nX.\nNo beacons shall be permitted.\nxi.\nNo roof signs shall be permitted.\nxii.\nNo off-premises advertising signs (billboards) shall be permitted. Off-\npremises advertising signs existing at the time of the adoption of this\nOrdinance shall be considered conforming, and may be repaired or\nreplaced, as long as it is not abandoned or expanded in size. If the off-\npremises advertising sign is not used for a consecutive period of twelve\n(12) months, it is deemed abandoned.\nxiii.\nFlags used as promotional devices of any type, including but not limited\nto the promotion of goods, services, business establishments, events,\nPage 70\n\nNEW PAGE 71\netc., shall be prohibited. National, state and corporate flags may be\nflown.\nxiv.\nComputations:\na. Computation of Area of Individual Signs - The area of the sign face\n(that is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one\nface) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle,\nrectangle or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme\nlimits of the writing, representation, emblem or other display\ntogether with any material or color forming an integral part of the\nbackground of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the\nbackdrop or structure against which it is placed.\nb. Computations of Area of Multi-Faced Signs - The sign area for a\nsign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together\nthe area of all sign faces visible from any one point at the same\ntime, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure\nand are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be\ncomputed by the measurement of one of the faces.\nC.\nComputation of Height - The height of a sign shall be computed as\nthe distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of\nthe highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be\nconstrued to be the lower of:\n(1) existing grade prior to construction or\n(2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of\nany filling, berming, mounding or excavating.\nIn cases where the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined,\nsign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation\nof the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation\nof the nearest point of the crown of a public street or grade of the\nland at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the\nparcel, whichever is lower. (Amended March 23, 2010)\nd. Computation of Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area for a parcel\n- The permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a parcel\nmay not be more than 200 square feet in total, except on parcels\nwith more than one principal use where the maximum permitted\nsum of all signage can be 400 square feet.\n(b)\nExterior Lighting Standards\ni. Standards:\nThe following standards are required of all exterior lighting except the\noutdoor recreational uses specifically exempted below. Many uses have\nthe option of providing a lower light post with a non-cutoff type of\nluminaire or a higher pole, up to 40 feet, with a luminaire that totally\ncuts off light spillover at a cutoff angle smaller than 90 degrees.\na. The maximum height light post permitted is dependent upon the\namount of cutoff provided. This is designed as a protection against\nexcessive glare and light spilling over to neighboring properties.\nPage 71\n", "page_number": 69, "page_range": [69, 70, 71], "highlight": ["Application: The Cedar Point <em>Central</em> <em>Business</em> <em>Overlay</em> District\nregulations shall apply to all principal", "Exemptions: The Cedar Point <em>Central</em> <em>Business</em> <em>Overlay</em> District\nregulations shall not apply to:\na.", "<em>Height</em> - No freestanding sign shall exceed twenty <em>feet</em> in <em>height</em>.\nFigure 1\n10 <em>ft</em>.", "Monument\n4 <em>ft</em>\n5 <em>ft</em>.\nSign\nGround Level\nii.", "The <em>maximum</em> <em>height</em> light post permitted is dependent upon the\namount of cutoff provided."], "score": 21.843666, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Central Business Overlay\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"CBOD\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"CBOD\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"CBOD\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 76\nsome cases, the Planning Board and Board of Commissioners may\nallow parking to be located in the front of the commercial structure.\nFigure 4\nNOT THIS\nTHIS\nPlace parking behind buildings.\nh.

Dumpsters or trash-handling areas shall always be screened from\nadjacent properties and public view with a minimum six-foot high\nsolid wooden fence or solid (and finished) masonry wall with a\nsolid closeable gate. No chain link fencing may be used to comply\nwith any part of this section. Dumpsters shall not be allowed in any\nrequired setback or yard space.\nb. Dumpster or mechanical equipment may not be placed in any yard\nthat has access to a public street.\nC.\nMechanical equipment shall be screened from the public street by\nwalls, fencing and/or landscaping. Mechanical equipment on\nrooftops shall be screened from the view of the public street. No\nchain link fencing may be used to comply with any part of this\nsection.\nd. A developer may choose to substantially screen from public view\na parking area by utilizing an earthen berm, masonry wall or other\nsuitable means of screening as determined by the Planning Board.\nii.\nBuffering Standards\nWhen any commercially zoned parcel within the jurisdiction of the\nCedar Point Central Business Overlay District abuts and residentially\nzoned parcel, there shall remain a thirty-five (35) foot vegetative buffer\nto be approved by both the Planning Board and Board of\nCommissioners.\n(g)\nConstruction Standards\ni.\nType of Construction:\na. The predominate exterior building materials on a fa\u00e7ade visible\nfrom a public street shall be of brick, textured masonry unit, stucco,\nstone, wood, cement fiber material (such as \"Hardie board\"), glass\nor the equivalent. No concrete masonry units, such as concrete\nblocks or cinder blocks, are permitted when visible from a public\nstreet unless they are textured to give the appearance of rough\nstone.\nb. The use of vinyl or metal siding is prohibited. Residential\nmanufactured homes/units, non-residential manufactured\nhomes/units, mobile, modular and metal units shall be prohibited,\nexcept for temporary use during construction or for storage of\nmaterials during construction.\nii.\nBuilding Mass:\nHistorically, the buildings in Cedar Point were small and pedestrian\nscaled. Recently proposed developments include buildings which are\nmore massive with large big-box stores and expansive parking areas.\nThese developments have lost the human, intimate scale of Cedar Point.\nMany techniques in this regulation provide tools for allowing large\nPage 77\n\nNEW PAGE 78\ndevelopment while reducing their perceived massiveness. While the\nfootprint of new commercial development may remain large, massing\nand organization of building forms can help to retain the human scale of\nCedar Point. There is a difference between massively scaled buildings\nand monumentally scaled buildings. Monumental buildings still relate to\nthe human scale but are carefully made larger to exhibit a sense of\nimportance. Buildings such as churches and institutional buildings are\noften built with this kind of scale in mind. Massive buildings are simply\nhuge buildings that dwarf and are not intended to relate to human scale.\nAirplane hangars, for instance, relate to the scale of an airplane and are\ntherefore massive. When large retail stores become as massive as an\nairplane hangar, they lose their relationship to the human user and feel\nunfriendly.\na. Use techniques to reduce the perceived mass of large buildings.\nWhen making transitions to lower density areas, modulate the mass\nof the building to relate to smaller buildings. Heights can be greater\nif the mass is modulated and other scale techniques are adopted.\nReduce height near low density uses.\nb. Use building mass appropriate to the site. Place buildings of the\ngreatest footprint, massing, and height in activity center core areas\nor at the heart of office developments where the impact on adjacent\nuses is the least.\nC. Floor-to-floor heights of a building can have an impact on the mass\nof a building. For instance, typical ceiling heights in a residence are\n8-9 feet. First floors of office buildings or retail shops can range\nfrom 10-15 feet. Upper floors that include residential or office are\ngenerally 8-12 feet in height. Big-box retailers may have floor to\nceiling heights exceeding 15 feet. When actual or implied floor-to-\nfloor heights exceed these dimensions on the exterior, then a\nbuilding may begin to read more massive than human scaled. When\narticulating large buildings, keep these dimensions in mind.\niii.\nBuilding Size Limitations:\nParcels within the Cedar Point Business Overlay District shall be limited\nto only one commercial structure not to exceed 50,000 square feet of\ntotal structural building area, whether on one floor or multiple floors,\nincluding all attached portions, on any single parcel of land to serve as\nthe principal structure. Any additional buildings on a single lot shall\nfollow the requirements of the underlying zoning district.\niv.\nBuilding Elements and Materials:\nThis section addresses the design elements that impact the exterior\nappearance of a building including:\nroof form and articulation;\nfacade articulation;\narchitectural details;\nmaterials and textures; and\nPage 78\n", "page_number": 76, "page_range": [76, 77, 78], "highlight": ["Buffering Standards\nWhen any commercially zoned parcel within the jurisdiction of the\nCedar Point <em>Central</em>", "<em>Business</em> <em>Overlay</em> District abuts and residentially\nzoned parcel, there shall remain a thirty-five (35", "Reduce <em>height</em> near low density uses.\nb.
