CENTRAL BUSINESS (CBD) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Central Business (CBD) District is established and intended to\nserve as the commercial and cultural heart of the City's jurisdiction.\nDevelopment in the CBD includes the highest average densities and\nbuilding heights in the City. Development is configured for an urban\ncontext, with buildings built to the street, ground floor uses that\nsupport pedestrian travel, and numerous civic gathering spaces and\ncultural attractions. The district is intended to accommodate a well-\nbalanced mix of uses (e.g., office, retail, service, high-density\nresidential, and entertainment), promote a strong pedestrian-\noriented environment (with a reduced need for off-street parking),\nand preserve and protect the downtown's historical and architectural\nscale and character. The district requires urban-style open space\n(greens, seating areas, plazas, pocket parks, roof gardens, etc.) to\nbe included as a part of new development. Low density residential\nlike single-family detached homes and most forms of industrial\ndevelopment are prohibited in the CBD district. New commercial,\nmixed-use, and multi-family developments in the district are subject\nto the design standards in CHAPTER 5. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.\nB.

Provide for residential housing choice, affordability, and diversity with varying housing densities, types,\nand designs, including accessory dwelling units;\n5.\nProvide for safe and efficient vehicular access and circulation and promote bicycle-, and pedestrian-\nfriendly neighborhoods;\n6. Provide safe and efficient access to public transit facilities and alternative forms of transportation, like\ngreenways;\n7. Provide for public services and facilities needed to serve residential areas and accommodate public\nand very low intensity neighborhood-serving non-residential uses in the higher density residential\ndistricts while protecting residential areas from incompatible non-residential development;\n8. Create neighborhoods and preserve existing community character while accommodating new\ndevelopment and redevelopment consistent with the City's goals and objectives; and\n9.\nPreserve the unique character and historic resources of the traditional neighborhoods and the\ncommunity.\nB. BUSINESS ZONING DISTRICTS\nThe business zoning districts are intended to ensure a wide range of office, retail, service, industrial, and\nrelated uses necessary to meet resident and visitor needs, and more specifically to:\n1. Provide appropriately located lands for the full range of business uses needed by the City's residents,\nbusinesses, and workers, consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies in the City's adopted policy\nguidance;\n2. Strengthen the City's economic base, and provide employment opportunities close to home for\nresidents of the City and surrounding areas;\n3.\nCreate suitable environments for various types of business uses, and protect them from the adverse\neffects of incompatible uses;\n4.\nProvide safe and efficient access to alternative forms of transportation like public transit facilities,\nsidewalks, trails, and greenways;\n5. Preserve the unique character and historic resources of the downtown area while increasing\nopportunities for urban development in areas already well-served by infrastructure; and\n6. Minimize the impact of business development on residential districts and sensitive natural\nenvironments.\nC. SPECIAL ZONING DISTRICTS\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\nThe special zoning districts are intended to recognize those portions of the City's jurisdiction that are\nunique or that require special consideration in order to:\n1. Protect and preserve environmentally-sensitive lands;\n2. Accommodate various types of mixed-use development in ways that establish functioning\nneighborhoods where people can live, work, shop, and recreate without travelling extensive distances;\n3. Provide safe and efficient access to alternative forms of transportation like public transit facilities,\nsidewalks, trails, and greenways; and\n4.\nCreate appropriate amounts of flexibility to foster redevelopment, infill, downtown revitalization, and\neconomic opportunities for City residents.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \n3-9\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\nNEW PAGE 132\nCHAPTER 3 ZONING DISTRICTS\nSection 3.4 Central Business (CBD) District\n3.4.

GENERAL BUSINESS (GB) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe General Business (GB) district is the primary district intended to serve\nretail, business, and service uses in the City and is found along major\narterial streets, interstate interchanges, and on blocks surrounding the\ncentral business district. Development in the GB district tends to be\nautomobile oriented and comprised of a mix of individual buildings on\nindividual sites and multi-tenant or multi-building developments located\nnear major roadway intersections. In addition to commercial uses, the\ndistrict also accommodates wholesale sales, warehousing uses, and a very\nwide range of institutional uses. Limited forms of residential use are\nallowed, such as upper-story residential and multi-family development.\nUses in the district are subject to standards intended to ensure development\nis compatible with adjacent residential neighborhoods, ensure that the\ntraffic carrying capacity along the City's major roadways is not impaired due\nto unsafe turning movements, and that development is well landscaped and\naesthetically pleasing. In order to maintain compatibility with surrounding\nuses and ensure a high quality of development, all activities, including\nstorage shall be indoors or be fully screened from view from the street or\nfrom lands in lower-intensity zoning districts.\nB.
