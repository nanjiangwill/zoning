The factors that the Planning\nDirector or designee might consider in approving or denying a request for shared parking include, but are not limited to, number of spaces, cross-access easements,\naccess/egress points, driving aisles, islands, striping, signage, and landscaping.\n(Amend. of 10-15-07(3))\n3004.

HOME OCCUPATIONS\n2901. Purpose.\nThe home occupation regulations are established in order to preserve the neighborhoods and to prevent the intrusion of commercial ventures into residential\ndistricts.\n(Ord. of 12-19-11(6))\n2902. - Standards for home occupations.\nThe purpose of the home occupation regulations is to protect the character of the surrounding residential neighborhood, while recognizing that traditional\nworkplaces are no longer necessary in all situations due to changing technology, computerization, networking, and the changing job market. These regulations are\nintended to recognize this trend and allow home occupations that are located and conducted in such a manner that the existence of the home occupation is not\ndetectable outside of the dwelling unit or accessory building. The home occupation use shall be clearly subordinate and incidental to the residential use of the\nproperty.\nA. Classes of Home Occupation.\n1. Minor Home Occupations. Home occupations that have little or no impact on the surrounding residential area, such as:\na. Personal home business and professional offices; a service-oriented business use.\nb. Home craft businesses, including (but not limited to) artists, sculptors, and dressmakers.\nC. Instructional services including music, art, dance, voice, and tutoring.\nd. Day-care for six or fewer individuals, whether for adults or children.\n57 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\n\nNEW PAGE 58\nCarteret County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n2. Major Home Occupations. Home occupations that have or might have a noticeable impact on the surrounding residential area and, therefore, are\npermitted only by special use permit, such as:\na. Day-care for seven or more individuals, whether adults or children.\nb. Professional services, including (but not limited to) medical, dental, or physical therapy facilities, barbers, beauticians, and photographers.\nC. Bed-and-breakfast residence.\nB. General Regulations for All Home Occupations.\n1. No more than 25 percent of the gross area of such residence may be used for the home occupation (bed-and-breakfast and day-care uses are\nexempt from this provision) and no more than 400 square feet of the residence may be used for the home occupation. No more than 600 square feet\nof either an attached garage or detached accessory building, but not both, may be used for the home occupation. Due to its nature, day-care may be\nconducted throughout the residence.\n2. No use shall require either internal or external alterations or involve construction features or use of electrical or mechanical equipment that would\nresult in a lower fire rating of the structure.\n3. Except for drop-off activities, the use may increase vehicular traffic flow and parking by no more than two additional vehicles at a time.\n4. In no way shall the appearance of the structure be altered or the occupation within the residence be conducted in a manner which would cause the\npremises to differ from its residential character either by the use of colors, materials, construction, lighting, signs, or by the emission of sounds,\nnoise, vibration, dust, smell, smoke, glare, electrical interference, or any other hazard or nuisance to any greater extent than experienced in an\naverage residential neighborhood.\n5. No exterior storage, display, use, or activity of any kind related to the home occupation.\n6. There shall be no commodities sold or services rendered that require receipt or delivery of merchandise, goods, or equipment other than by\npassenger motor vehicle, parcel delivery service, or U.S. mail service. No deliveries by tractor/trailer trucks are permitted.\n7. Storage of combustible or flammable matter, accumulation of rubbish, wastepaper, cartons, or boxes, in excess of normal home activities is\nprohibited.\n8. The repair, detailing, and/or painting of automobiles, trucks, recreational vehicles, trailers, motorcycles and/or boats are prohibited.\nC. Specific Standards for Minor Home Occupations.\n1. Clients or customers will not be present on the site on a regularly-scheduled basis and shall not exceed ten per week, on average, except that\ninstructional services are limited to a maximum of five students at any one time in one day.\n2. No signage identifying the minor home occupation is permitted in a residential district.\n3. Retail sales on the premises shall be prohibited, except for products or goods produced or fabricated on the premises as part of the home\noccupation.\n4. No minor home occupation shall have more than one employee that is not a resident of the household, except that, upon notification to the planning\ndirector or designee, there may be a second employee who does not live in the home on the site for up to 30 days a year.\nD.

If the actual location of such\nright-of-way, easement, canal or water body varies slightly from the location as shown on the map, then the actual location will control.\n1006.2 Where a district boundary is shown to approximately coincide with a property line or city limit line, the property line or city limit line will be considered to be\nthe district boundary, unless otherwise indicated.\n1006.3 In cases where a district boundary does not coincide or approximately coincide with any street or alley, railroad, water body or canal, or property line, and no\ndimensions are shown, the location of the boundary will be determined by the use of the scale appearing on the map.\n1007.

Every lot must abut a street.\nNo building, structure or use of land for any purpose except agriculture may be placed on a lot which does not abut a street. The following sections list exceptions to\nthis rule.\n1013.1 A single-family detached dwelling may be constructed on a lot that does not abut a street, provided that the lot meets the terms of the Carteret County\nSubdivision Regulations or is a lot of record.\n1013.2 Any structure approved under the group housing ordinance is exempt from this section.\n1014. - Interpretation and application of these regulations.\nIn the interpretation and application of this ordinance, the provisions of the ordinance will be construed to be the minimum requirements adopted to promote the\npublic health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare.\n1015. - Relation of this ordinance to other ordinances.\nIt is not intended that this ordinance will in any way repeal, annul or interfere with the existing provisions of any law or ordinance except the zoning ordinance which\nthis ordinance replaces. In addition it is not intended that this ordinance will in any way repeal, annul or interfere with any rules, regulations or zoning permits which\nwere legally adopted or issued under previous ordinances for the use or development of land or structures.\n1016. Zoning boundaries over surface waters.\nSince 160D-702, as amended, permits a county to regulate development over estuarine waters and over lands covered by navigable waters owned by the state\npursuant to G.S. 146-12, within the bounds of that county, the zoning boundaries for waterfront parcels shall be extended linearly 400 feet waterward of the mean\nhigh-water mark. This water surface zoning shall not unreasonably infringe on the right to navigation protected by the federal government or on other rights, such as\nshellfishing rights, allowed by state government.\n(Res. of 6-21-21 )\n1017. Zoning district changes affecting the zoning maps.\nUpon the effective date of this ordinance, the R-50 (single-family residential district) zone shall be changed in name to RA (rural agricultural), and the C-I (planned\nmobile home and camp park district) zone shall be changed in name to MC (planned mobile home and camp park district). These changes do not constitute a change in\nthe dimensional requirements or uses permitted within these districts. The USG zoning classification, which has been shown on the official zoning map but has never\nhad any zoning requirements, shall be changed in name to P-I (port-industrial district).\n(Amend. of 9-17-12(1))\n1100. - RULES OF CONSTRUCTION AND DEFINITIONS\n1101.
