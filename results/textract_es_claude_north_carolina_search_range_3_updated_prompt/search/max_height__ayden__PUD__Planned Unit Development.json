All uses are subject to the standards and\nregulations within this UDO.\nB. Permitted and Prohibited Uses\nUses not listed as permitted (P); permitted with supplemental use standards (PS); or requiring a\nspecial use permit (S) are presumed to be prohibited (-) from the applicable zoning district.\nC. Uses Not Listed\nIn the event that a particular use is not listed in the Use Table, and such use is not listed as a\nprohibited use and is not otherwise prohibited by law, the Administrator shall determine whether\na\nmaterially similar use exists in this chapter. Should the Administrator determine that a materially\nsimilar use does exist, the regulations governing that use shall apply to the particular use not listed\nand the Administrator's decision shall be recorded in writing.\nD. Similar Uses\nThe Administrator may determine that a use is materially similar if a permitted use is similarly\nclassified by one or more of the following use classification systems:\n1. Land Based Classification Standards (LBCS) of the American Planning Association (APA)\n2. North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS)\nE. Use Table\nUses listed as (P) or (PS) which require a Transportation Impact Analysis (according to Article 7 -\nSubdivisions & Infrastructure), multi-family dwelling developments and all subdivision\ndevelopments with 10 lots or more, are subject to the Major Site/Major Subdivision Preliminary\nPlan Review Process established in Article 8 - Development Processes.
