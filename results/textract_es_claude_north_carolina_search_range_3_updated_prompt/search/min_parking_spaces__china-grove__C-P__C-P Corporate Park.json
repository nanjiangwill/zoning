Incentive is given to encourage mixed use development.\nAs a result, the list of commercial establishments allowed in this district is more limited than in other\ndistricts. The standards for these areas are designed to promote sound, permanent mixed-use development\nand to serve surrounding residential areas. All N-C districts shall be a minimum of three (3) acres and a\nmaximum of 50 acres.\n7.8.2 Uses\nSee Permitted Uses Table\n7.8.3 Re-use of Sites and Buildings Developed Prior to August , 2006\nSmaller sites in the N-C district with buildings 5,000 square feet or less in size, which were built prior to\nAugust 1, 2006, have the potential for new uses or revitalization.

Park-Parks may be designed for passive and/or active recreational use. Parks shall be bounded by\nstreets on a minimum of 25 percent of their perimeter. Parks are encouraged to be entirely bounded by\nstreets. Large parks should create a central open space which services an entire neighborhood or group\nof neighborhoods; or incorporates physical features which are an asset to the community (i.e. lake or\nriver frontage, high ground, significant stands of trees). Undergrowth should be limited and\nlandscaping shall be installed in a manner that promotes attractiveness and safety. Parks may be\ncombined with greenways and greenbelts.\nMinimum size: 1 acre\nE. Green- The green is an open space which is more natural. Like the square, it is small and surrounded\nby buildings. Unlike the square, it is informally planted and may have irregular topography. Greens are\nusually landscaped with trees at the edges and open lawns at the center. Greens should contain no\nstructures other than benches, pavilions, and memorials; paths are optional.\nMinimum size: 20,000 square feet\nF. Greenway-Greenways are large, irregular open spaces designed to incorporate natural settings such as\ncreeks and significant stands of trees within and between neighborhoods. Greenways are typically\nmore natural and may contain irregular topography. Greenways shall be used for certain active\nrecreational uses including, at a minimum, trails for walking, jogging, and biking. Greenways shall\nconnect points of interest in the community such as schools, parks, and other civic uses.\nG. Greenbelt-Greenbelts run along the perimeter of a neighborhood or Town, and serve to buffer a\nneighborhood from surrounding non-compatible uses such as a highway corridor or industrial district,\nor a Town from agricultural areas or adjacent towns. Greenbelts differ from the other types of open\nspaces in that they are left natural, and are not intended for recreational use.\nH. Nature Preserve-Open spaces designated as Nature Preserves shall be left largely undisturbed except\nfor the optional clearing of underbrush and provision of a walking trail (mulch or other natural material\nonly). Nature Preserve areas are encouraged to protect large stands of trees, wildlife, and natural water\nfeatures.\nMinimum size: 3 acres\nI.\nCluster Mailbox Court - A type of open space whose primary purpose is to provide a publicly-\naccessible location for a development's cluster mailbox unit(s), where such units are required by the\nUnited States Postal Service (USPS).\nJ.\nThoroughfare Open Space - A type of open space intended to provide a buffer between Major and\nMinor Thoroughfares as designated in the Cabarrus-Rowan MPO's Metropolitan Transportation Plan\nand Major Subdivisions. This open space shall be provided along any section of the subdivision which\nis adjacent to said thoroughfare(s), and shall consist of a minimum 20' wide Type E Bufferyard meeting\nthe composition requirements of Section 11.3.5.2.\nThoroughfare Open Space meeting the aforementioned standard shall not be required of subdivisions\nwhich utilize the Open Space Subdivision option (such subdivisions shall include open space along\nthoroughfares meeting the requirements of Section 7.3.4.4.C).\n12-3\nTown of China Grove Unified Development Ordinance\n\nNEW PAGE 197\nCHAPTER 12: OPEN SPACE & ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION\nSection 12.3 General Provisions for Open Space\nA. Land designated as open space on the approved development plan shall be maintained as open space\nand may not be separately sold, subdivided, or developed.\nB. Access from a public street shall be provided to all designated open space with a minimum 15-foot-\nwide access included in the open space area.\nC. Open space in the form of playgrounds, squares, plazas, parks, and greens shall be centrally located\nwithin a development.\nD. Open space may either be held in common ownership by a Homeowners Association or dedicated to\nthe Town of China Grove, Rowan County, another appropriate public entity, or non-profit agency SO\nlong as the space is accepted by the entity and will be properly maintained by the entity.\nE.\nCommon ownership of the open space requires that the Homeowners Association assume full\nresponsibility for its maintenance. The restrictive covenants shall provide that, in the event the\nhomeowners association fails to maintain the open space according to the standards of this Ordinance,\nthe Town may, following reasonable notice, demand that deficiency of maintenance be corrected, or\nenter the open space to maintain it. The cost of such maintenance shall be charged to the homeowners'\nassociation.\nF. Standards for Cluster Mailboxes:\ni.\nCluster mailboxes shall be located within 25' of a parking area serving a development's\nclubhouse, community pool, or similar common amenity; or within 25' of the ROW of a street\nwithin the development.\nii.\nTwo parking spaces shall be required for mailbox clusters of less than 50 mailboxes; three\nspaces shall be required for clusters of 50 mailboxes or more. These parking requirements\nshall not apply to cluster mailboxes located within 25' of parking areas for community\namenities described above.\niii.\nSidewalks or other all-weather surfaces shall connect cluster mailboxes to the community's\nsidewalk network.\nSection 12.4 Minimum Open Space Dedication\nOpen space shall be dedicated in accordance with the below table. Percentages are based on total\ndevelopment area. Areas within floodplains, stream buffers, utility rights-of-way, and other areas that\ncannot be developed shall not be used in the total development area in order to calculate minimum open\nspace dedication. However, these areas may be used to meet open space requirements if they fit into one\nof the open space categories listed in Section 12.2.\nSection 12.5 Tree Preservation and Environmental Protection\n12.5.1 Applicability\nSignificant forest stands, natural vegetation, specimen trees, severe natural topography, drainage features\nand water courses are encouraged to be preserved to the extent that is reasonable and practical while\notherwise not reasonably prohibiting development. Forested and vegetated areas whose physical site\nconditions render them unsuitable for development should be set aside as conservation areas or as open\n12-4\nTown of China Grove Unified Development Ordinance\n\nNEW PAGE 198\nCHAPTER 12: OPEN SPACE & ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION\nspace. Wooded sites should be developed with careful consideration of the natural characteristics of the\nsite. When portions of forested stands must be developed, careful consideration should be given to\npreserving wooded perimeters or the most desirable natural features in order to retain the aesthetic or visual\ncharacter of the site. Isolated pockets of existing trees or specimen trees should be protected as a valuable\nasset of the property. This section shall apply to all zoning districts regulated by this Ordinance.\nDetermination of the need to preserve significant vegetation on the site is also a function of a site's buildable\narea or potential for development defined as follows:\nPrime Buildable. Land with little or no building restrictions that occur as a result of slope conditions\nor site topography. These areas are defined as slopes less than 10 percent and generally offer\nthe\nleast opportunity for the preservation of existing tree canopy, forest stands, or significant vegetation\noutside of satisfying open space dedication requirements.\nSecondary Buildable. Areas with slopes of 10 to 15 percent, site preparation techniques should\nminimize grading. Such areas require selective clearing and grading. These areas offer limited\nopportunity for the preservation of existing tree canopy, forest stands, or significant vegetation\noutside of satisfying open space dedication requirements.\nConserved. Areas with slopes of 15 to 25 percent with severe slope restrictions. These areas offer\noptimal opportunity for the preservation of existing tree canopy, forest stands, or significant\nvegetation outside of satisfying open space dedication requirements.\nPreserved. Natural floodplain and floodways, wetland areas, existing tree canopy, forest stands, or\nsignificant vegetation on slopes exceeding 25 percent, and which present severe or prohibitive slope\nconditions for development shall be preserved.\nDevelopment proposals incorporating tree preservation shall include such measures as part of the required\nlandscaping plan as described in Section 11.2.\n12.5.2 Environmental Survey\nEnvironmental Surveys are required for all developments that have greater than one acre of disturbed area\nor otherwise require a soil and erosion control permit. Identification of existing trees, understory\nvegetation, known endangered species, wetlands, streams and creeks, floodplains, and topographical\nfeatures on a site prior to the advanced preparation of development plans enables the reasonable and\n12-5\nTown of China Grove Unified Development Ordinance\nCELL (1, 1): \nZoning District\nCELL (1, 2): \nPercent Open Space\nCELL (2, 1): \nR-P\nCELL (2, 2): \nn/a\nCELL (3, 1): \nR-S\nCELL (3, 2): \n10%;\n20% for Open Space Subdivisions developed in\naccordance with Section 7.3.4\nCELL (4, 1): \nR-T\nCELL (4, 2): \n15%\nCELL (5, 1): \nR-M\nCELL (5, 2): \n20%\nCELL (6, 1): \nR-MH\nCELL (6, 2): \n15%\nCELL (7, 1): \nO-I\nCELL (7, 2): \n15%\nCELL (8, 1): \nN-C\nCELL (8, 2): \n20%\nCELL (9, 1): \nC-B\nCELL (9, 2): \nn/a\nCELL (10, 1): \nH-B\nCELL (10, 2): \nn/a\nCELL (11, 1): \nC-P\nCELL (11, 2): \nn/a\nCELL (12, 1): \nL-I\nCELL (12, 2): \nn/a\nCELL (13, 1): \nH-I\nCELL (13, 2): \nn/a\n", "page_number": 196, "page_range": [196, 197, 198], "highlight": ["These <em>parking</em> <em>requirements</em>\nshall not apply to cluster mailboxes located within 25' of parking areas for", ", 2): \n20%\nCELL (9, 1): \nC-B\nCELL (9, 2): \nn/a\nCELL (10, 1): \nH-B\nCELL (10, 2): \nn/a\nCELL (11, 1): \n<em>C</em>-<em>P</em>"], "score": 4.288562, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"C-P Corporate Park\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"C-P\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"CP\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"C-P\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking space for each\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [62, 63, 64, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 196, 197, 198]}
