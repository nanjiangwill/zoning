$12.202, 07/18/11)\n*\nPlanning Department staff in conjunction with CDOT may waive or reduce bicycle parking depending on the\nsurrounding land uses of a particular development, and the accessibility of a site by bicycle. One example of a location\nwhere less bicycle parking would be required is at a freeway interchange with no connection to the surrounding\nneighborhoods.\n** All square footage is gross footage.\n12 - 30\nCELL (1, 1): \nPermitted Uses\nCELL (1, 2): \nNumber of Auto\nParking Spaces\nRequired\nCELL (1, 3): \nLong-term Bicycle\nParking Spaces\nRequired\nCELL (1, 4): \nShort-term\nBicycle Parking\nSpaces Required\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \noffice use that exceeds 10%\nof the total GFA.\nAccessory office use under\n10% shall not require\nadditional parking spaces\nbeyond that required for the\nfacility.\nCELL (2, 3): \nuse, that exceeds 10%\nof the GFA, or 50\nmaximum spaces.\nAccessory office use\nunder 10% shall not\nrequire additional\nparking spaces beyond\nthat required for the\nfacility.\nCELL (2, 4): \n30 maximum spaces.\nCELL (3, 1): \nWholesale establishments\nCELL (3, 2): \n.25 space per 1,000 square\nfeet for the wholesale\nportion plus 1 space per 400\nsquare feet for any\naccessory office\nCELL (3, 3): \n2, or 1 per 40,000\nsquare feet\nCELL (3, 4): \n1% of auto parking\nCELL (4, 1): \nOther business uses\nCELL (4, 2): \n1 space per 250 square feet\nCELL (4, 3): \n2, or 1 per 10,000\nsquare feet\nCELL (4, 4): \n5% of auto parking\nCELL (5, 1): \nINDUSTRIAL USES:\nCELL (5, 2): \nCELL (5, 3): \nCELL (5, 4): \nCELL (6, 1): \nAirports\nCELL (6, 2): \n1 space per 4 seats in the\nterminal\nCELL (6, 3): \nPer CMPC review*\nCELL (6, 4): \nPer CMPC review\nCELL (7, 1): \nManufacturers and\nwarehouses\nCELL (7, 2): \n.25 spaces per 1,000 square\nfeet for the manufacturing\nor warehousing portion plus\n1 space per 400 square feet\nfor any accessory office\nCELL (7, 3): \n2, or 1 per 40,000\nsquare feet\nCELL (7, 4): \n1% of auto parking\nCELL (8, 1): \nOther industrial uses\nCELL (8, 2): \n1 space per 400 sq feet\nCELL (8, 3): \n2, or 1 per 40,000\nsquare feet\nCELL (8, 4): \n1% of auto parking\nCELL (9, 1): \nSatellite dish farm\nCELL (9, 2): \n1 space, plus 1 space per\n300 square feet for any\naccessory office use.\nCELL (9, 3): \nNone, plus 1 space per\n10,000 square feet for\nany accessory office\nuse.\nCELL (9, 4): \nNone, plus 1 space per\n40,000 square feet for\nany accessory office\nuse.\n\nNEW PAGE 569\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 2: OFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING\nSection 12.202A.

If twenty (20) or more short-term bicycle spaces are\nrequired, then at least fifty (50) percent of the required short-term bicycle\nspaces shall be covered. Coverage may be provided under roof overhangs\nor awnings, in bicycle lockers or within or under other structures.\n(b)\nLocation. Short-term bicycle parking should be located along a major\nbuilding approach line and clearly visible from the approach. The rack\narea shall be no more than 120 feet from the entrance it serves, or as close\nas the nearest non-handicap, off-street auto parking space, whichever is\nfarther. Rack area(s) should be clearly visible from the entrance they serve\nand should be provided near each actively used entrance. In general,\nmultiple buildings should not be served with a combined, distant rack\narea. It is preferred to place smaller rack areas in locations that are more\nconvenient.\nShort-term bicycle parking may be located within the public right-of-way\nand/or within the required setback in the UR-1, UR-2, UR-3, UR-C, RE-3,\nMUDD, UMUD, NS, PED, TOD-UC, TOD-CC, TOD-NC, TOD-TR, and\nUI zoning districts, subject to the following additional requirements:\n1.\nThe short-term bicycle parking shall not obstruct the required\nsidewalks, movement from on-street parking to the required\nsidewalks, or impact the minimum planting area or spacing\nrequirements for street trees or required screening.\n2.\nBicycle parking may be located in the public right-of-way subject\nto approval by the Charlotte Department of Transportation\n(CDOT) or the North Carolina Department of Transportation\n(NCDOT). If bicycle parking is not approved, then the required\nparking must be located entirely on the site.\n3.\nThere shall be no more than 5 required short-term bicycle parking\nspaces per 100 linear feet of street frontage. Additional bicycle\nparking beyond the required amount can exceed the 5 short-term\nbicycle parking spaces per 100 linear feet of street frontage\nrequirement.\n(2)\nLong-term bicycle parking shall meet the following standards:\n12 31\n", "page_number": 567, "page_range": [567, 568, 569], "highlight": ["If twenty (20) or more short-term bicycle spaces are\nrequired, then at least fifty (50) <em>percent</em> of the", "<em>Coverage</em> may be provided under roof overhangs\nor awnings, in bicycle lockers or within or under other", "setback in the UR-1, UR-2, UR-3, UR-C, RE-3,\nMUDD, UMUD, NS, PED, TOD-UC, TOD-CC, TOD-NC, TOD-TR, and\n<em>UI</em>"], "score": 6.971004, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Urban Industrial\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"U-I\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"UI\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"U-I\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building area as % of lot\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"pervious surface\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"percent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"%\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per cent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ratio\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [567, 568, 569, 570, 571]}
