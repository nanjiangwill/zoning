The SCENIC CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT (SCO) is established to protect the pastoral\nscenes and open spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and visitors traveling the\nmajor entrance roads and gateways to the City. The pastoral scenes and undeveloped\nproperty along the entrance roads and gateways contribute significantly to Creedmoor's\ncommunity character and sense of place. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District provides\ndevelopment options for the owners of the property abutting the entrance roads and\ngateways. The goal of this district is to protect the scenic value of the corridors through\ndevelopment standards. These standards will preserve the rural character of the City by\nmaintaining the sense of a rural corridor in an urban environment; provide an aesthetically\nappealing experience for those traveling the corridor; provide multi-modal transportation\noptions for travel; and ensure a safe transportation corridor for motorists, bicyclists, and\npedestrians. The Detached House lot/building type is allowed in this district.\nB.\nTYPES. Three (3) types of scenic corridors are hereby created:\n1. RURAL SCENIC CORRIDOR. A corridor along which development is limited, consisting\nlargely of fields, pastures, and scattered residential uses. The rural scenic corridor evokes\na sense of traveling through an undeveloped area, with pastoral scenes and a sense of\nbeing removed from the urban environment.\n2. GATEWAY SCENIC CORRIDOR. A corridor that serves as an entrance way to a place that is\nunique and different from other communities in the area. The gateway corridor provides\na sense of arrival to a place that is special and different from the typical places. The\ngateway scenic corridor may be more developed than the rural scenic corridor, but the\ncharacter of the development is such that those using the corridor are aware they are in\na special place.\n3.\nBYPASS SCENIC CORRIDOR. A corridor providing for buffering of the bypass to protect the\ntraffic carrying capacity of the road and to provide for a pleasant experience for motorists\nusing the bypass. The bypass scenic corridor requires an undeveloped setback from the\nbypass, ensuring that the bypass through Creedmoor is unique and portrays the character\nof the community while enhancing the safety of motorists using the road.\nC.\nGENERAL REQUIREMENTS\n1.\nDEVELOPMENT PATTERN. Building placement, parking placement, building type, and lot\narrangement shall be controlled by the lot and building type standards (Article 9) for the\nlot and building types permitted in the Scenic Corridor Overlay District.\n2.\nACTIVITIES PERMITTED IN THE SCENIC CORRIDOR.
