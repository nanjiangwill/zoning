Statement of Purpose.\nIt is the purpose of this ordinance to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to\nminimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions\ndesigned to:\n(1) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or\nerosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;\n(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected\nagainst flood damage at the time of initial construction;\n(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective\nbarriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;\n(4) Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or\nflood damage; and\n(5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood\nwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\nSection 4. Objectives.\nThe objectives of this ordinance are:\n(1) To protect human life and health;\n(2) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\n(3) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally\nundertaken at the expense of the general public;\n(4) To minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;\n(5) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas mains, electric,\ntelephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;\n(6) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood\nprone areas; and\n(7) To ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area.\nARTICLE 2.
