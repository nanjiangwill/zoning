Changes to Development Approvals (modifications)\nAfter any development approval has been issued, no deviations from the terms of the application or the development\napproval shall be made until written approval of proposed changes or deviations has been obtained. The zoning\nadministrator may authorize minor modifications to any development approval including approved plans. The Town has\ndefined minor modifications to development approvals that can be exempted or administratively approved. The Town\nshall follow the same development review and approval process required for issuance of the development approval in\nthe review and approval of any MAJOR modification of that approval.\n1. General Limitations.\nThe minor modification:\na. Does not involve a change in uses permitted or the density of overall development permitted.\nb.\nDoes not increase the impacts generated by the development on traffic, stormwater runoff, or similar\nimpacts beyond what was projected for the original development approval; and\nC. Meets all other ordinance requirements.\n2. Site Design.\nSite design minor modifications are limited adjustments to the terms or design of an approved development\nplan or plat, including a site plan attached as a condition to a special use permit. In addition to the general\nlimitations for minor modifications, a site design minor modification must:\na. Comply with underlying zoning standards and other applicable conditions of the approval;\nb.\nBe limited to a minor change such as, without limitation, a minor adjustment to road configuration or\ninternal circulation, a minor adjustment to building location, or a minor adjustment utility alignment.\n3. Dimensional Standards.\nDimensional standard minor modifications are adjustments to the dimensional standards of the zoning\nordinance. Dimensional standards may only be modified upon a finding by the zoning administrator, based on\nevidence from the permit holder, that the modification is needed to address a site characteristic or technical\ndesign consideration not known at the time of initial approval.\na. In addition to the general limitations for minor modifications, dimensional standard minor modifications\nare limited to:\ni. An adjustment to parking requirements up to the greater of 2 spaces or 10 percent.\nii. An adjustment to setback requirements up to greater of 3 feet or 10 percent of the standard\nsetback.\niii. An adjustment to landscape standards up to 15 percent of required landscaping.\n4. Appeals\nA decision on minor modification may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment as an administrative\ndetermination. An application for a minor modification does not preclude an applicant from seeking a variance\nfrom the Board of Adjustment through a separate application.\n69\n", "page_number": 67, "page_range":
