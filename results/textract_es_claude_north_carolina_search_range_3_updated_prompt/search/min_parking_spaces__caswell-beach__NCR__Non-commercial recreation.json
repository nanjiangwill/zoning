Using the entirety of each adjacent structure with all attached above-ground level features,\nthe surveyor preparing the proposed building plan shall identify, by survey measurement, the point on each structure that is\nfarthest from the street lot line. The surveyor will prepare a certified line between those points, that will establish the build-to-\nline. Existing fences and walkways over the dunes shall not be used in the survey measurement. Elevated stairs leading\nfrom the principal structure to a walkway are, in their entirety, considered part of the structure. Stairs leading from the\nprincipal structure or attached porch/deck to the ground are, in their entirety, considered part of the structure and shall be\nconsidered in the build-to-line measurement. For purposes of identifying the build-to-line, transitions from residential\nstructure to walkway wider than six feet shall be considered part of the structure.\n(C) Applicability.\n(1) All above-ground construction and placement of structures, including but not necessarily limited to housing, exterior\ndecks, walkways, docks and viewing and seating platforms detached from housing shall be subject to the build-to-line\nprovisions established by this section. No decking, stairs, or at-grade improvements exceeding six inches in height shall be\npermitted ocean-ward or marsh-ward of the build-to-line except as provided in division (D), Exemptions.\n(2) For purposes of this section, structures include buildings, screened enclosures, fences, above-ground swimming\npools and/or man-made facilities or infrastructure that is principally above ground.\n(D) Exemptions. The following shall be permitted beyond the build-to-line subject to the standards provided.\n(1) Walkways, viewing platforms, docks, stairs to the beach, and similar appurtenances.\n(a) Walkways (including associated stairs) connecting the principal structure to beach and marsh walkways and\ndetached seating and viewing platforms shall occur as close as possible to the natural, undisturbed contour of the terrain,\nbut no lower than provided for by CAMA rules, so as to minimize intrusion into the natural features and beauty of the town's\nlandscape. Stairs leading from a walkway to a ground level feature, which may include an in-ground pool, beach, marsh, or\nsimilar, are permitted.\n(b) To minimize intrusion into the health and natural beauty of the dunes, residential walkways must follow, within\nreason, the shortest straight-line path from the structure to the beach. The maximum allowed width for a walkway from a\nresidential structure is six feet. The walking surface of the walkway deck shall be no greater than 18 inches above the\nhighest point of the natural, undisturbed peak of the terrain under the proposed path of the structure.\n(c) A viewing platform, with a total footprint not to exceed 200 square feet may be attached to the walkway. The\nplatform shall be immediately adjacent to the walkway with a transition from walkway to deck not to exceed four feet. The\nwalking surface of the platform may not be elevated above the walking surface of the walkway.\n(d) 1. Hand railings or guard railings on residential walkways shall be no higher than required by the NC Building\nCode. Where elevation requires fall protection, walkway railings must provide at least 50% open space, measured between\nthe vertical pilings. Where code mandates fall protection due to elevation, vertical or horizontal balusters shall be used in a\nmanner conforming to NC Building Code and shall be sized and spaced to provide at least 50% open space, measured\nbetween the vertical pilings. Lattice type closure on railings is not permitted.\n2. For example, a guard rail constructed with a top rail five inches tall, with one and one-half inch vertical or\nhorizontal balusters spaced three and four-fifths inches apart, and a bottom runner that is three and one-half inches tall will\nprovide more than 54% open space.\n(e) Under no circumstances shall a detached platform, walkway, or dock, be roofed, enclosed or have a second story.\n(2) Swimming pool fences. Pool security fences mandated by NC Building Code may be placed on the perimeter of the\npool at the minimum height required by code. Such fences shall be at minimum 70% transparent.\n(3) Construction of minor ornamental features. On marsh side properties, construction of minor ornamental features\nwith horizontal dimensions no greater than six feet and height no greater than three feet are permitted. Such features may\ninclude, but are not limited to, fire pits, benches, and seating.\n(E) Build-to-line when replacing, enlarging, or elevating an existing structure.\n(1) When an existing structure is removed, the build-to-line must be established for any new construction,\nredevelopment, or placement of a structure on that site relative to adjacent properties. The new principal structure and all\naccessory structures shall be subject to the provisions of this section.\n(2) Elevating an existing structure or adding another floor to an existing structure shall be subject to the build-to-line.\nSuch elevation or addition shall only be permitted if the existing structure and new construction are street-ward of the build-\nto-line.\n\nNEW PAGE 20\n(3) Should a structure be destroyed by fire, explosion, tornado, earthquake, hurricane, or similar uncontrollable cause, it\nmay be replaced in the same footprint provided the height, elevation, and building footprint of the replacement are no\ndifferent than existed before the structure was destroyed. If height, elevation, or building footprint are different, the build-to-\nline must be established and adhered to relative to adjacent structures.\n(Ord. passed - -; Ord. passed - -)\nOFF-STREET PARKING\n\u00a7 153.095 REQUIRED AREA FOR EACH PARKING SPACE.\nEach automobile parking space shall contain not less than 200 square feet nor less than the minimum width for stalls as\nspecified under \u00a7 153.097.\n(Ord. passed 6-8-78; Am.
