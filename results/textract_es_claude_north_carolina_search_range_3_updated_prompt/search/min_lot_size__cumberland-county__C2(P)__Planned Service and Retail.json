DISTRICTS\nSECTION 301. ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS.\nFor the purpose of this ordinance, the areas shown on the County's zoning map are divided\ninto the following general classes of districts.\nSECTION 302. CONSERVANCY DISTRICT.\nCD Conservancy District. This district is designed to preserve and protect identifiable natural\nresources from urban encroachment. The general intent of the district is to provide open\narea uses for such resource areas that will continue to provide limited development\npotential while preserving existing conditions to the extent feasible. Areas to be zoned in\nthis district shall be identifiable as swamp, marsh, flood land, poor or very severe soils areas\nor managed and unmanaged woodland on USGS (Geological Survey) maps, soil maps\nprepared by the USDA (Department of Agriculture) Soil Conservation Service or other\nappropriate sources and on file in the County Planning and Inspections Department.\nSECTION 303. AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS.\nA. A1 Agricultural District. This district is designed to promote and protect agricultural\nlands, including woodland, within the County. The general intent of the district is to permit\nall agricultural uses to exist free from most private urban development except for large lot,\nsingle-family development. Some public and/or semi-public uses as well as a limited list of\nconvenient commercial uses are permitted to ensure essential services for the residents.\nB. A1A Agricultural District. This district is primarily designed to allow for residential use\nof single-family residential dwellings and/or Class A manufactured homes on lots with an\narea of one acre or greater and is to be located within predominantly agricultural areas.\nThe\ndistrict is not intended to encourage large scale developments and shall not be considered\nfor tracts of land greater than ten acres.\nSECTION 304. RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.\nResidential districts are composed of certain existing residential areas of the County and\ncertain areas where similar residential development should be encouraged to occur. The\nregulations for these districts are designed to stabilize and protect the essential\ncharacteristics of each district by promoting and encouraging a suitable environment for\nfamily life and prohibiting certain incompatible activities of a commercial or industrial\n36\nJune 20, 2005 County Zoning Ordinance\nw/ Amendments through January 16, 2024\n\nNEW PAGE 49\nnature. To these ends, development is limited to dwellings that provide homes for the\nresidents plus certain additional such uses as schools, parks, recreation facilities and certain\nother public facilities. This system of classification optimizes orderly development by\nproviding a variety of living environments based on different levels of permitted population\ndensity, facilitating the adequate provision of transportation and other public services.\n(Amd. 04-18-11)\nA. R40 Residential District. A district designed primarily for single-family dwelling units\nwith a lot area of 40,000 square feet or above.\nB. R40A Residential District. A district designed primarily for single-family dwelling units\nincluding the use of manufactured homes on individual lots with a lot area of 40,000 square\nfeet or above.\nC.

A district for traditional rural use with lots of 20,000\nsquare feet or above. The principal use of the land is for suburban density residential,\nincluding manufactured housing units, and agricultural purposes. These districts are\nintended to ensure that residential development not having access to public water supplies\nand dependent upon septic tanks for sewage disposal will occur at a sufficiently low density\nto provide for a healthful environment.\n(Amd. 01-19-10, Amd. 04-18-11)\nH. R15 Residential District. A district designed primarily for single-family dwelling units\nwith a lot area of 15,000 square feet or above.\nI. R7.5 Residential District. A district designed primarily for single-family dwellings on\nlots with a lot area of 7,500 square feet or above.\n(Amd. 11-20-06)\nJ. R6 Residential District.

The uses in this\ndistrict classification may be characterized generally as having no retail or wholesale trade,\nexcept as incidental uses. The district is often situated between business and residential\nareas and may also consist of a mix of limited business and residential uses. The regulations\nare designed for maintaining more compatibility with nearby residential districts than a\ncommercial district would provide. To promote the essential design features with the\nO&I(P) district, plan approval is a requirement.\n(Amd. 04-18-11)\nSECTION 306. PLANNED COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS.\nA.
