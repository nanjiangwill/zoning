Conditional zoning affords a degree of certainty in\nland use decisions not possible when rezoning to a Primary General Use District.\nAdditional standards and regulations, mutually agreed upon in writing by the Town of\nCoats and the petitioner, may be attached to a proposed development to ensure\ncompatibility with the surrounding uses and with applicable adopted plans in\naccordance with the requirements of this section.\n5.4-2 Conditional zoning districts.\nConditional zoning is available for any of the Primary General Use or Overlay\nDistrict classifications enumerated in Article 8 of this Ordinance, except for those that\nrequire a site-specific development plan as part of the application (e.g., Traditional\nNeighborhood Development (TNDO) Overlay District, Heavy Industry (HIO)\nOverlay District). The conditional zoning designation shall be indicated on all zoning\nmaps and other official documents with the suffix, \"(CZ)\" and enumerated to\nreference the ordinance on record of the approval (e.g. \"MU-1(CZ-2021-01), Ord.\n#2021-99\").\n5.4-3 General requirements.\nThe following provisions shall apply in the administration of conditional zoning:\n(A) A conditional zoning application shall be considered only upon request of the\nowner of the affected property or a duly authorized representative of the property\nowner demonstrated by written, signed and notarized documentation.\n(B) Applicant shall meet with representatives of the surrounding property owners and\nof the surrounding neighborhood(s) to discuss the proposed development, and include\na report of any such meetings in accordance with Section 5.3-1(B) of this Article to\nthe Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator.\n(C) All standards and requirements of the corresponding Primary General Use District\nshall be met, except to the extent that the conditions imposed by the conditional\nzoning are more restrictive than the general use standards.\n(D) No uses shall be permitted except those enumerated in the ordinance adopting the\nconditional zoning.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 5 - Page 9\n\nNEW PAGE 92\n(E) The conditions agreed upon pursuant to the Conditional Zoning approval shall be\nstated in the adopting ordinance and may limit the uses which are permitted on the\nproperty. By way of illustration and not limitation, conditions may specify location on\nthe property of the proposed structure(s), the number of dwelling units, the location\nand extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways, and access streets,\nthe location and extent of buffer areas and other special purpose areas, the timing of\ndevelopment, the height of structures, the location and extent of rights-of-way and\nother areas to be dedicated for public purposes, and other such matters as may be\nidentified as appropriate for the proposed development.\n(F) Minor modifications to the approved Conditional Zoning ordinance may be\napproved by the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator per authorization\nunder G.S. 160D-703(b). The minor modifications authorized herein are intended to\nprovide relief where conditions established by the Conditional Zoning ordinance\ncreate a hardship based upon a unique physical attribute of the property itself or some\nother factor unique to the property which was not known at the time of ordinance\nadoption and which has subsequently rendered the property difficult or impossible to\nuse due to the condition(s) imposed by the zoning. The permit holder shall bear the\nburden of proof to secure the modification(s). Such modifications shall be limited to\nthe following:\n1. A deviation of up to ten percent or 24 inches, whichever is greater, from the\napproved setback, provided that the conditions for approving a deviation from\nthe required setback established by Article 14 (Flexible Development\nStandards) of this Ordinance are met.\n2.
