Adult Businesses (added as amended 07-11-01)\nA.\nPurpose and Intent\nAdult establishments, because of their nature, are recognized as having characteristics\nwhich may be objectionable to nearby residential districts and certain other uses\nconsidered to be sensitive- namely, churches, schools, parks, libraries, day care centers,\nnursing homes, and medical centers. Studies have shown that properties tend to be\ndevalued and crime rates tend to be increased by the concentration of adult\nestablishments. The Town Board determines that regulation of these uses is necessary to\nensure that these adverse effects do not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of\nnearby residential districts and to protect the integrity of those sensitive uses listed above.\nThe purpose of having regulations for adult establishments is to identify the appropriate\nlocations in which adult establishments or sexually oriented businesses may be\nestablished within the Town of Cleveland's zoning jurisdiction.\nB.\nRegulations\n1.\nAllowable zoning district(s): An adult establishment use shall be allowed in the\nM-2 district with a conditional use permit.\n2.\nSpacing:\na.\nNo two adult establishments may be located within 1,000 feet from each\nother.\nb.\nNo adult establishments may be located within 500 feet of any\nresidential (R-15, R-20, AG) zoning district.\nc.\nNo adult establishment may be located within 1,000 feet of any church/\nhouse of worship or any public or private daycare, elementary, middle,\njunior high, or high school.\nNOTE: All measurements shall be made by drawing straight lines from existing property\nlines and/or edge of zoning district as appropriate.\n3.\nArea, yard, and height requirements: The area, yard and height requirements shall\nbe the same as for other uses in the M-2 district.\n4.\nParking space requirements: The parking space requirements shall be as indicated\nfor retail uses in Article V. There shall be no enclosed parking.\n5.\nScreening requirements: Screening requirements shall be determined upon review\nof the Conditional Use Permit.\n82\n\nNEW PAGE 83\nZoning Ordinance of the Town of Cleveland, N.C.\nArticle VIII\nSection 17.
