It is recognized that certain types of general use zoning\ndistricts would be inappropriate at particular locations in the absence of special conditions. Conditional\nZoning Districts are a means by which the property owner may request a rezoning with special conditions\nto be imposed in the furtherance of the purpose of this Ordinance, and to better address adopted Town\nordinances and plans, or impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site.\nOnly those conditions mutually approved by the Town Council and the petitioner may be incorporated into\nthe approved Conditional Zoning District. Conditional Zoning District requests shall be handled as a\nlegislative decision.\n7.15.2 Requirements for Conditional Rezoning Conditions\nAll Conditional rezoning requests must include at least one of the following:\n1) conditions specifying the uses proposed;\n2) any relevant conditions related to how the property may be developed, such as building\nplacement or additional setbacks of buildings, parking or loading areas from property lines,\nadditional landscaping, buffering or berming beyond UDO requirements, more restrictive\nbuilding height limitations, limitations on where site ingress or egress may be located, or\noperational limitations designed to limit impacts on neighboring properties; and/or\n3) a major site plan or for single family residential development, a major subdivision plan.\nFor any rezoning request to the R-M (Mixed Residential) or PUD (Planned Unit Development) districts, as\nwell as any approval requests for Open Space Subdivisions in the R-S (Suburban Residential) district, such\nrequests must be submitted as a Conditional Rezoning request. Conditional Rezoning applications for R-M\nor PUD zoning must include all three above described components (proposed uses, proposed conditions\nconcerning how the property will be developed, and a site plan or subdivision plan); and all Conditional\nRezoning requests for an Open Space Subdivision must include a subdivision plan.\n7.15.3 Uses and Other Requirements\nWithin a Conditional Zoning District, only those uses authorized as permitted shall be permitted, and all\nother requirements of the corresponding district shall be met as minimum standards. Additional limitations\non use and other requirements may be recommended as conditions during the review process by the staff,\nTRC, Planning Board or Town Council; however, only those conditions mutually approved by the Town\nCouncil and the petitioner may be incorporated into the approved Conditional Zoning District.\nSee Chapter 15 for Conditional Zoning process provisions.\nSection 7.16 Watershed Overlay District\n7.16.1 Purpose and Applicability\nThe purpose of the Watershed Overlay District is to provide for protection of the Lake Fisher and Lake\nCorriher water supplies consistent with the WS-IV Protected Area management rules as adopted by the\nNorth Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.\n7.16.2 General Development Standards\nA. The construction of new roads and bridges and non-residential development should minimize built-\nupon area, divert storm water away from surface water supply waters as much as possible, and employ\n7-13\nTown of China Grove Unified Development Ordinance\n\nNEW PAGE 75\nCHAPTER 7: ZONING DISTRICTS AND PERMITTED USE TABLE\nbest management practices (BMPs) to minimize water quality impacts. The Department of\nTransportation BMPs as outlined in their document entitled \"Best Management Practices for the\nProtection of Surface Waters\" shall be used in all road and bridge construction projects in the\nWatershed Overlay District.\nB. All development activities within the Watershed Overlay District, in addition those activities\nspecifically regulated by these provisions, are subject to the standards, usage conditions and other\nregulations contained in the Rules and Requirements of the Surface Water Supply Protection Rules\nadopted by the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.\nC. A minimum 30-foot vegetative buffer for development activities is required along all perennial waters,\nincluding streams, rivers and impoundments, indicated on the most recent versions of USGS 1: 24,000\nscale topographic maps; provided, that nothing in this subsection shall prevent artificial streambank or\nshoreline stabilization. No new development is allowed in the buffer, except that water dependent\nstructures, or other structures such as flag poles, signs and security lights, which result in only\ndiminutive increase in impervious area and public works projects such as road crossings and greenways\nmay be allowed where no practicable alternative exists. These activities shall minimize built-upon\nsurface area, direct runoff away from the surface water, and maximize the utilization of BMPs. A\nminimum 100 foot vegetative buffer is required for all new development activities that exceed the low\ndensity option outlined in section 3.16.2.\nD. Where otherwise permitted in the underlying Primary Zoning District, Cluster Development is allowed\non a project by project basis as follows:\nThe overall density of the project meets the density requirements of this Ordinance;\nThe appropriate vegetative buffer in (c) above is provided;\nBuilt upon areas are designed and located to minimize stormwater runoff impact to the receiving\nwaters, minimize concentrated storm water flow, and maximize the flow through vegetated areas;\nAreas of concentrated development are located in upland areas and away, to the maximum extent\npracticable, from surface waters and drainage ways;\nRemainder of tract to remain in vegetated or natural state;\nThe area in the vegetated or natural state may be conveyed to a property owners association; a local\ngovernment for preservation as a park or greenway; a conservation organization; or placed in a\npermanent conservation or farmland preservation easement. A maintenance agreement shall be\nfiled with the property deeds; and\nCluster development shall transport storm water runoff from the development by vegetated\nconveyances to the maximum extent practicable.\nE.\nAll development in Watershed Overlay Districts, shall, to the maximum extent practicable, minimize\nbuilt-up surface area, direct storm water runoff away from surface waters and incorporate best\nmanagement practices to minimize water quality impacts.\nF. Existing development, as defined in this Ordinance, is not subject to the requirements of the overlay\nprovisions. Expansions to structures classified as existing development must meet the requirements of\nthese provisions, provided however, the built-upon area of the existing development is not required to\nbe included in the density calculations. In determining expansions to existing development, the\nmaximum permitted additional built-upon area is derived by multiplying the area of the portion of the\nproperty that is not built-upon by the appropriate percent built-upon limitation for the Overlay District\nin which the property is located.\n7-14\nTown of China Grove Unified Development Ordinance\n", "page_number": 73, "page_range": [73, 74, 75], "highlight": [", 1): \nCELL (6, 2): \nNot less than 70 percent (70%) of the residential units are located within 660 <em>feet</em>", "Section 7.16 <em>Watershed</em> <em>Overlay</em> District\n7.16.1 Purpose and Applicability\nThe purpose of the <em>Watershed</em>", "<em>Overlay</em> District.", "All development activities within the <em>Watershed</em> <em>Overlay</em> District, in addition those activities\nspecifically", "All development in <em>Watershed</em> <em>Overlay</em> Districts, shall, to the maximum extent practicable, minimize\nbuilt-up"], "score": 25.252943, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Watershed Overlay\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Watershed Overlay\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Watershed Overlay\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Watershed Overlay\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 72\nCHAPTER 7: ZONING DISTRICTS AND PERMITTED USE TABLE\n7.14.2 Processing Procedure\nA PUD shall be considered a conditional zoning district and shall be processed in accordance with Section\n13.6 of this Ordinance.\n7.14.3 Permitted Uses\nA.
