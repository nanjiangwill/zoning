IX, passed -\n\u00a7 154.067 BUILDING HEIGHT OVERLAY DISTRICTS.\n(A) Reason for regulation. It is recognized that two major characteristics of the town greatly contribute to the atmosphere,\ncultural heritage and appeal of the whole community. Specifically, the scenic mountain views bounding the town on the north\nand north west and the historic county courthouse located in the middle of town both offer a sense of place and community\nto the town's residents and add to the attractiveness of the area. It is further recognized that the height of buildings, if left\nunregulated or inadequately regulated, can detract from these two features. Therefore, building heights shall be regulated\nbased on the location of the subject building in relation to mountain view-sheds and to the historic county courthouse.\n(B) Establishment of Building Height Overlay Districts The boundaries of the Building Height Overlay Districts shall be\ndepicted on a map named the \"Town of Columbus Building Height Overlay District Map\" and shall be made part of this\nchapter upon adoption of this section.\n(C) Districts. For the purposes of determining maximum building heights, the town shall be divided into the following\nBuilding Height Overlay Districts:\n(1) General;\n(2) Courthouse; and\n(3) Mountain View-Shed.\n(D) General Building Height District. In this district no building shall be taller than 36 feet. However, if the average\nelevation (above mean sea level) of the ridgelines of existing adjacent buildings situated on lots having a common boundary\nwith the subject parcel upon which the proposed building is to be situated (adjacent lots that are vacant not being included in\nthis calculation) is less than the elevation (above mean sea level) determined by measuring 36 feet vertically from the\naverage grade of the proposed building envelope on the subject parcel, then the proposed building shall be no taller than\nthat average. In the event that the average elevation (above mean sea level) of the existing buildings' ridgelines on the\nsurrounding adjacent properties is such that the subject parcel is rendered unbuildable (meaning a single story building with\nan appropriate roof is not feasible), then the proposed building shall have a height not exceeding 29 feet. The determination\nthat a subject parcel is rendered unbuildable under this division (D) shall be at the discretion of the approving administrator,\nboard, or council.\n(E) Courthouse Building Height District. In this district no building's ridgeline shall have an elevation higher than the\nelevation defined by the plane of the soffit of the eave of the roof of the historic county courthouse; however, in no case shall\na buildings height be taller than 29 feet.\n(F) Mountain View-Shed District. Buildings on areas of high elevation are highly visible from surrounding public spaces.\nAs such, buildings in this district shall not be more than 29 feet tall.\n(G) Height. The height of a building shall be measured from the grade of the average grade of the property to the highest\nridge of the roof of the structure.\n(Ord., Art. IX, \u00a7 900, passed - -; Ord. passed - -)\n\u00a7 154.068 FLOOR AREA.\n(A) Potential. Large scale commercial development has the potential to pose many challenges to a relatively small\ncommunity such as the town. The development can overwhelm local police services, undermine a current diversified\ncommercial market, strain the character of the local community, cause excessive vehicular congestion, and can be difficult\nCELL (1, 1): \nIndustrial\nDistrict\n(IND)\nCELL (1, 2): \nSame as\nHC\nCELL (1, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (1, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (1, 5): \n80\nCELL (1, 6): \n30\nCELL (1, 7): \n60\nCELL (1, 8): \n10\nCELL (1, 9): \n20\nCELL (1, 10): \n50\nCELL (2, 1): \nPublic\nService\nDistrict (PD)\nCELL (2, 2): \nSame as\nHC\nCELL (2, 3): \nN/A\nCELL (2, 4): \nN/A\nCELL (2, 5): \n80\nCELL (2, 6): \n30\nCELL (2, 7): \n60\nCELL (2, 8): \n10\nCELL (2, 9): \n20\nCELL (2, 10): \n50\n\nNEW PAGE 25\nto handle once left vacant. As such, the town finds it necessary to limit the allowable floor area of commercial development\nin order to ensure that the development is carried out in a manner that is appropriate and consistent with the character of the\ntown.\n(B) Commercial development. The building footprint of any structure and any accessory structure in the aggregate to be\nused for any commercial enterprise shall not be larger than 10,000 square feet in size. The building's footprint shall be\nconstrued to mean the perimeter line created by the edge of the roof of any structure and building on a lot in the aggregate.\nFor the purposes of this section, the term commercial development shall include any development intended to be used or\npotentially used by for-profit enterprises, including manufacturing and industrial developments, except that those uses\nallowed within the town's Public Service District shall not be considered commercial. It is recognized that in certain\ncircumstances it may be appropriate to allow for a larger building footprint for commercial developments. In order for a\ncommercial structure proposed to have a footprint larger than 10,000 square feet to be constructed, a special use permit\nshall be obtained prior to the commencement of the development. See \u00a7\u00a7 154.082 and 154.083 below for details regarding\nthe issuance of a special use permit for large scale commercial developments.\n(C) Residential development. The building footprint of all newly constructed residential developments shall not be larger\nthan 35% of the lot on which the residential development is proposed to be erected.\n(D) Public service development. Development to be used for any land use allowed in the town's Public Service (PS)\nzoning district shall have no limit on the size of the building footprint.\n(Ord., Art. IX, \u00a7 901, passed -)\nCONDITIONAL AND SPECIAL USES\n\u00a7 154.080 CONDITIONAL USE DISTRICTS.\n(A) For each general use district established in 154.060 through 154.064 above, there is also established a\ncorresponding conditional use district as follows:\n(B) It is recognized that certain types of zoning districts would be inappropriate at certain locations in the absence of\nspecial conditions. Where the applicant for rezoning desires property to be rezoned to such a district in those situations, the\nConditional Use District (CUD) is a means by which the special conditions can be imposed in the furtherance of the\npurposes of this chapter. The Conditional Use District classification will be considered for rezoning only upon request of a\nproperty owner. If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these regulations is found to be illegal or invalid or if the\napplicant should fail to accept any condition, it is the intent of this chapter that the authorization of the conditional use permit\nshall be null and void and of no effect, and that proceedings shall be instituted to rezone the property to its previous zoning\nclassification.\n(C) Within a CUD, only those uses authorized as either permitted or conditional uses in the zoning district with which the\nCUD corresponds shall be permitted, and all other requirements of the corresponding district shall be met as minimum\nstandards. In addition, with a CUD no use shall be permitted except pursuant to a conditional use permit authorized by the\nTown Council, which shall specify the use or uses authorized. The permit may further specify the location on the property of\nthe proposed use or uses, the number of dwelling units, the location and extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots,\ndriveway and access streets, the location and extent of buffer areas, and other special purpose areas, the timing of\ndevelopment, the location and extent of right-of-way and other areas to be dedicated for public use, and other such matters\nas the applicant may propose as conditions upon the request, but not to include conditions not generally a part of land\ndevelopment controls. In granting a conditional use permit, the Town Council may impose additional reasonable and\nappropriate safeguards upon the permit as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose and intent of this chapter are\nserved, public welfare secured and substantial justice done.\n(D) In approving a Conditional Use District Rezoning, the Town Council shall make the following (in addition to the\nfindings for conditional use permits in \u00a7 154.081(C) below) affirmative findings:\n(1) That the use(s) requested is among those listed as an eligible use in the Conditional Use District in which the\nsubject property is located or is to be located; and\n(2) That the location and character of the Conditional Use District if developed according to the site specific plan will

Vehicular turnarounds of various configurations are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately\nprovided.\n5. Pedestrian connections should be provided as extensions of terminating streets where not precluded by\ntopography or other physical constraints.\n6. The average perimeter of all blocks within the TND should not exceed 1,350 feet. No block face should have a\nlength greater than 500 feet without a dedicated alley or pathway providing through access.\n7. A continuous network of rear alleys shall provide vehicular access to lots 49 feet or less in width.\n8. Utilities may run along alleys provided that a permanent public access and utility easement is recorded for the full\nlength of alley being used for utilities or public services such as garbage collection.\n9. TND streets shall be organized according to a hierarchy based on function, size, capacity, and design speed;\nstreets and rights-of-way are therefore expected to differ in dimension. The proposed hierarchy of streets shall be indicated\non the submitted site plan. Each street type in a TND shall be separately detailed.

Alternative methods of assembling the required street elements\nwill be considered to allow neighborhood street designs that are most appropriate to setting and use.\n10. To prevent the buildup of vehicular speed, disperse traffic flow, and create a sense of visual enclosure, long\nuninterrupted segments of straight streets should be avoided. Methods to achieve this interruption include:\n(i) A street can be interrupted by intersections designed to calm the speed and disperse the flow of traffic and\nterminate vistas with a significant feature (building, park, natural feature);\n(ii) A street can be terminated with a public monument, specifically designed building facade, or a gateway to the\nensuing space;\n(iii) Perceived street length can be reduced by a noticeable street curve where the outside edge of the curve is\nbounded by a building or other vertical elements that hug the curve and deflect the view; and\n(iv) Other traffic calming configurations are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately provided.\n(c) Buildings and lots.\n1.

not served by public water and/or sewer shall be subject to approval by the Polk County\nHealth Department to ensure proper operation of septic tanks and wells. In no case, however, shall minimum lot area be\nless than specified in this table.\n(2) On all corner lots, a 15-foot side yard setback is required except in the CBD, where a five-foot side yard setback is\nrequired.\n(3) In the CBD, where adjacent buildings have front yard setbacks less than five feet, the minimum front setback may be\nequivalent to the adjacent properties.\n(4) Regulations pertaining to mobile home parks are contained in Chapter 150\n(5) Regulations pertaining to Mixed Use (MU) Districts and Traditional Neighborhood Districts (TND) are contained in \u00a7\u00a7\n154.066(A) and 154.066(B), respectively.\n(Ord., Art. IX, passed -\n\u00a7 154.067 BUILDING HEIGHT OVERLAY DISTRICTS.\n(A) Reason for regulation. It is recognized that two major characteristics of the town greatly contribute to the atmosphere,\ncultural heritage and appeal of the whole community. Specifically, the scenic mountain views bounding the town on the north\nand north west and the historic county courthouse located in the middle of town both offer a sense of place and community\nto the town's residents and add to the attractiveness of the area. It is further recognized that the height of buildings, if left\nunregulated or inadequately regulated, can detract from these two features. Therefore, building heights shall be regulated\nbased on the location of the subject building in relation to mountain view-sheds and to the historic county courthouse.\n(B) Establishment of Building Height Overlay Districts The boundaries of the Building Height Overlay Districts shall be\ndepicted on a map named the \"Town of Columbus Building Height Overlay District Map\" and shall be made part of this\nchapter upon adoption of this section.\n(C) Districts. For the purposes of determining maximum building heights, the town shall be divided into the following\nBuilding Height Overlay Districts:\n(1) General;\n(2) Courthouse; and\n(3) Mountain View-Shed.\n(D) General Building Height District. In this district no building shall be taller than 36 feet. However, if the average\nelevation (above mean sea level) of the ridgelines of existing adjacent buildings situated on lots having a common boundary\nwith the subject parcel upon which the proposed building is to be situated (adjacent lots that are vacant not being included in\nthis calculation) is less than the elevation (above mean sea level) determined by measuring 36 feet vertically from the\naverage grade of the proposed building envelope on the subject parcel, then the proposed building shall be no taller than\nthat average. In the event that the average elevation (above mean sea level) of the existing buildings' ridgelines on the\nsurrounding adjacent properties is such that the subject parcel is rendered unbuildable (meaning a single story building with\nan appropriate roof is not feasible), then the proposed building shall have a height not exceeding 29 feet. The determination\nthat a subject parcel is rendered unbuildable under this division (D) shall be at the discretion of the approving administrator,\nboard, or council.\n(E) Courthouse Building Height District. In this district no building's ridgeline shall have an elevation higher than the\nelevation defined by the plane of the soffit of the eave of the roof of the historic county courthouse; however, in no case shall\na buildings height be taller than 29 feet.\n(F) Mountain View-Shed District. Buildings on areas of high elevation are highly visible from surrounding public spaces.\nAs such, buildings in this district shall not be more than 29 feet tall.\n(G) Height. The height of a building shall be measured from the grade of the average grade of the property to the highest\nridge of the roof of the structure.\n(Ord., Art.

Further\nchanges to the development may only be made by the Town Council by amending the conditional use permit. Any request\nto materially change the conditional use permit once it has been issued shall be reviewed in entirety through the Board\napproval process.\n(G) Re-application following denial.\n(1) If a request for conditional use permit is denied by the Town Council, a similar application for the same property or\nany portion thereof shall not be filed until the expiration of a 12 month period from the date of the most recent denial by\nthe\nCouncil. This waiting period shall not be applicable where the application for a conditional use permit is substantially different\nfrom the original application.\n(2) The term SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT as herein applied shall mean:\n(a) The proposed principal use is different from the use contained in the original application; or\n(b) The gross floor area of the proposed development has been reduced by 50% or more from that contained in the\noriginal application.\n(Ord., Art.

This chapter provides for a number of uses to be located by right in each general zoning\ndistrict subject to the use meeting certain area, height, yard and off-street parking and loading requirements. In addition to\nthese uses, the ordinance allows some uses on a special basis subject to the issuance of a special use permit by the Zoning\nBoard of Adjustment. The reason for making the uses \"special\" is to ensure that they are compatible with surrounding\ndevelopment and in keeping with the purposes of the general zoning district in which they are located. Those uses, shown\nas \"special\" in the permitted use table in \u00a7 154.065, shall be subject to the requirements and review process in this section.\n(B) Approval process. The hearing for a special use permit shall be processed and considered in a quasi-judicial manner\nby the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The Board may, in its review, suggest reasonable conditions for the location, nature and\nextent of the proposed use and its relationship to surrounding properties, parking areas, driveways, pedestrian and vehicular\ncirculation systems, and screening and landscaping, and may address timing of development and any other appropriate\nconditions.

Before issuing a special use permit, the Board of Adjustment\nshall find that all standards for specific uses listed in these sections as well as all standards and requirements listed in \u00a7\n154.082 above have been met.\n(A) Planned unit development.\n(1) Purpose. The purpose of this division (A) is to encourage and provide for flexibility and innovation in the design and\nlocation of structures and land development, to provide for mixtures of housing types and land use, to provide for the most\nefficient use of land resources, and to provide and opportunity to develop land areas in a manner different from the standard\narrangement of one principal building on one lot. Residential densities are calculated on a project basis, thus allowing the\nclustering of buildings in order to create useful open spaces and preserve natural site features. It is further intended that a\nplanned unit development will be in harmony with the character of the district in which it is located.\n(2) Planned unit development defined. In this chapter a planned unit development means a group residential\ndevelopment or a group commercial development where more than one principal building or use is proposed to be\nconstructed on a single tract; or any building with a gross floor area of 10,000 square feet or more; or a residential complex\nof five or more units with more than one principal building, shall be deemed a planned unit development (PUD). Residential\nunits within a planned unit development may include single-family detached or attached units, townhouse developments,\ngarden apartments, patio homes, condominiums and other type residential units excluding mobile homes and mobile home\nparks.\n(3) Land development standards. The following land development standards shall apply for all planned unit\ndevelopments. There shall be two types of PUD, a residential PUD and a commercial PUD. These planned unit\ndevelopments may be located only in certain specified districts as special uses, subject to a finding by the Board of\nAdjustment that the following conditions be met:\n(a) Ownership control. The land in a planned unit development shall be under single ownership or management by\nthe applicant before final approval and/or construction, or proper assurances (legal title or execution of a binding sales\nagreement) shall be provided that the development can be successfully completed by the applicant.\n", "page_number": 27, "page_range": [27, 28, 29], "highlight": ["<em>area</em> of any

This chapter provides for a number of uses to be located by right in each general zoning\ndistrict subject to the use meeting certain area, height, yard and off-street parking and loading requirements. In addition to\nthese uses, the ordinance allows some uses on a special basis subject to the issuance of a special use permit by the Zoning\nBoard of Adjustment. The reason for making the uses \"special\" is to ensure that they are compatible with surrounding\ndevelopment and in keeping with the purposes of the general zoning district in which they are located. Those uses, shown\nas \"special\" in the permitted use table in \u00a7 154.065, shall be subject to the requirements and review process in this section.\n(B) Approval process. The hearing for a special use permit shall be processed and considered in a quasi-judicial manner\nby the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The Board may, in its review, suggest reasonable conditions for the location, nature and\nextent of the proposed use and its relationship to surrounding properties, parking areas, driveways, pedestrian and vehicular\ncirculation systems, and screening and landscaping, and may address timing of development and any other appropriate\nconditions. Those conditions may include dedication of any rights-of-way or easements for streets, water, sewer or other\npublic utilities necessary to serve the proposed development. An application shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator and\nshall be accompanied by a site specific plan meeting the requirements as set forth in \u00a7 154.081(B) above.

Before issuing a special use permit, the Board of Adjustment\nshall find that all standards for specific uses listed in these sections as well as all standards and requirements listed in \u00a7\n154.082 above have been met.\n(A) Planned unit development.\n(1) Purpose. The purpose of this division (A) is to encourage and provide for flexibility and innovation in the design and\nlocation of structures and land development, to provide for mixtures of housing types and land use, to provide for the most\nefficient use of land resources, and to provide and opportunity to develop land areas in a manner different from the standard\narrangement of one principal building on one lot. Residential densities are calculated on a project basis, thus allowing the\nclustering of buildings in order to create useful open spaces and preserve natural site features. It is further intended that a\nplanned unit development will be in harmony with the character of the district in which it is located.\n(2) Planned unit development defined. In this chapter a planned unit development means a group residential\ndevelopment or a group commercial development where more than one principal building or use is proposed to be\nconstructed on a single tract; or any building with a gross floor area of 10,000 square feet or more; or a residential complex\nof five or more units with more than one principal building, shall be deemed a planned unit development (PUD). Residential\nunits within a planned unit development may include single-family detached or attached units, townhouse developments,\ngarden apartments, patio homes, condominiums and other type residential units excluding mobile homes and mobile home\nparks.\n(3) Land development standards. The following land development standards shall apply for all planned unit\ndevelopments. There shall be two types of PUD, a residential PUD and a commercial PUD. These planned unit\ndevelopments may be located only in certain specified districts as special uses, subject to a finding by the Board of\nAdjustment that the following conditions be met:\n(a) Ownership control. The land in a planned unit development shall be under single ownership or management by\nthe applicant before final approval and/or construction, or proper assurances (legal title or execution of a binding sales\nagreement) shall be provided that the development can be successfully completed by the applicant.\n\nNEW PAGE 30\n(b) Land uses permitted and location of PUDs. Those land uses normally permitted in the district within which a PUD\nis located shall be permitted in the PUD, including multi-family residential units in residential planned unit developments, and\na variety of commercial uses in commercial planned unit developments. Residential PUDs shall be permitted in the central\nbusiness district and the highway business district; and commercial PUDs shall be permitted in the central business district\nand highway business district. All PUDs must be compatible with and not violate the intent of the zoning district.\n(c) Density requirements. There are no density requirements for non-residential uses as long as the proposed project\ndoes not violate the intent of the district in which it is located. The proposed residential density of a residentially planned unit\ndevelopment (dwelling units per acre as shown in \u00a7\u00a7 154.066 through 154.068 above) shall conform to that permitted in the\ndistrict in which the development is located. If the planned unit development lies in more than one district, the number of\nallowable dwelling units must be separately calculated for each portion of the planned unit development that is in a separate\ndistrict, and must then be combined to determine the number of dwelling units allowable in the entire planned unit\ndevelopment.\n(d) Frontage requirements. Planned unit developments shall have access to a highway or road suitable for the scale\nand density of development being proposed.\n(e) Minimum requirements.\n1. The normal minimum lot size, setbacks and frontage requirements are hereby waived for the planned unit\ndevelopment, provided that the spirit and intent of this section are complied with in the total development plan, as\ndetermined by the Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment shall exercise ultimate discretion as to whether the total\ndevelopment plan does comply with the spirit and intent of this section.\n2. No building or structure shall exceed the height limitations of the district in which it is located.\n3. The minimum distance between buildings shall be 20 feet or as otherwise specified by the Board of Adjustment\nto ensure adequate air, light, privacy and space for emergency vehicles.\n(f) Privacy. Each development shall provide reasonable visual and acoustical privacy for all dwelling units. Fences,\ninsulation, walks, barriers and landscaping shall be used, as appropriate, for the protection and aesthetic enhancement of\nproperty and the privacy of its occupants, screening of objectionable views or uses, and reduction of noise. Multi-level\nbuildings shall be located within a planned unit development in such a way as to dissipate any adverse impact on adjoining\nlow-rise buildings and shall not invade the privacy of the occupants of the low-rise buildings.\n(g) Perimeter requirements.\n1. Structures located on the perimeter of the development must be setback from property lines and right-of-way of\nabutting streets in accordance with the provisions of the zoning ordinance controlling the district within which the property is\nsituated; and\n2. Structures other than single-family detached units, located on the perimeter of the development may require\nscreening in a manner, which is approved by the Board of Adjustment.\n(h) Plans and accompanying documentation. Plans and accompanying documentation to ensure that the water and\nsewer systems proposed for the planned unit development have been approved by the appropriate local and state agencies\nand submitted as part of the application.\n(i) Preliminary plans. Preliminary plans shall include parking provisions for all proposed uses within the planned unit\ndevelopments in accordance with \u00a7 154.106 below.\n(j) Pedestrian and bicycle path circulation system. Any pedestrian and bicycle path circulation system and its related\nwalkways shall be designed to minimize conflicts between vehicle and pedestrian traffic.\n(k) Layout of parking areas and the like Layout of parking areas, service areas, entrances, exits, yards, courts and\nlandscaping, and control of signs, lighting, noise and other potentially adverse influences shall be such as to protect the\ncharacter of the district and desirable character in any adjoining district.\n(I)\nConveyance and maintenance.
