Many streets, especially local ones, have purposes other than\nvehicular traffic. The following street standards, based on \"NC Department of Transportation Standard\nSpecifications For Roads and Structures\" and recommendations found in \"A Policy on Geometric Design of\nHighways and Streets\" (AASHTO \"green book\"), are provided for streets within the City of Creedmoor that will\nbe maintained by the City.\nStreets in Creedmoor should be inviting public space and integral components of community design. A\nhierarchical street network should accommodate a variety of uses, including bicycle, pedestrian, motor-vehicle\nand transit routes. All streets should connect to help create a comprehensive network that enables the free\nmovement of automobiles, bicyclists, and pedestrians. In order for this street network to be safe for motorists\nand pedestrians, design elements must consistently be applied to calm automobile traffic.\nWhere discrepancies occur between the text of this Ordinance and the City of Creedmoor Technical Standards\nand Specifications Manual, the Technical Standards and Specifications Manual shall prevail.\n13.2\nStreet Standards\n13.2-1\nINTERCONNECTION. Interconnection is required within a commercial development and with adjoining\ndevelopment. Residential cul-de-sacs shall be allowed only where topographical and/or lot line\nconfigurations offer no practical alternatives for connections or through traffic. Street stubs are\nstrongly recommended on the periphery of developments adjacent to open land to provide for future\nconnections except where environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands, creeks, steep slopes and\nconservation areas are vulnerable to harmful impacts by the extension of the street.\n13.2-2 PEDESTRIAN SCALED. Streets are designed as the most prevalent public space of the City and, thus,\nshall be scaled to the pedestrian.\n13.2-3 BORDERED BY SIDEWALKS. All streets shall be bordered by sidewalks with a minimum width of five (5)\nfeet on both sides, with the exception of cul-de-sacs, alleys, and the undeveloped edge of\nneighborhood subdivisions. Cul-de-sacs within residential subdivisions require sidewalks only on one\nside of the street. Sidewalks shall be located in the street right-of-way, or on public property.\n13.2-4 RESERVED.\n13.2-5 PUBLIC STREETS. All new subdivision streets shall be public. Alleys will be classified as public or private\ndepending on function, according to the street acceptance policy.\n13.2-6 FOCUS FOR BUILDINGS. All principal buildings, except for single family or two family residential\nstructures, shall front on public streets as dictated by the lot and building type standards of Article 9.\n[Reference G.S. 160D-702]\n13.2-7 STREET LIGHTS. Streets shall be illuminated by street lights located on at least one side and at all\nintersections. Street lights along streets shall be located in a minimum 5' landscape planting strip\nadjacent to the sidewalk. Illumination standards are specified in the Technical Standards and\nSpecifications Design Manual. The maximum height of street light fixtures shall be 14 feet in residential\nareas. Street light fixtures shall not produce direct light into adjacent properties at a height above 6\nvertical feet at the building setback line of residential districts. Street lights within mixed use districts\nshall not produce a direct light into adjacent properties at a height above 16 vertical feet at the building\nsetback line. Street lights within non-residential districts shall not produce a direct light into adjacent\nresidential properties at a height above 6 vertical feet at the property line.\nArticle 13 - Page 1\n\nNEW PAGE 186\n13.3\nIntersections\nSegments of straight streets should be interrupted by intersections designed to:\n13.3-1 REDUCE SPEED. Disperse traffic flow and reduce speeds.\n13.3-2\nTERMINATE VISTAS. Terminate vistas with a landmark such as a significant natural feature, a building,\na small park, or other public space.\n13.3-3\nCALM TRAFFIC. Other traffic calming measures are encouraged, and will be considered on a case by\ncase basis, based on safety and appropriateness in the proposed location.\n13.4\nBlocks\nStreet blocks defined by public streets are the fundamental design elements of traditional neighborhoods. In\nurban conditions, any dimension of a block may range from 500 to 1,000 linear feet between cross streets.\n13.5\nTable of Street Classifications\n13.6\nStreet Design\nDesigns should permit comfortable use of the street by motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Pavement widths,\ndesign speeds, and the number of motor travel lanes should be determined by anticipated traffic volume and\nprimary use in order to enhance safety for motorists and non-motorists alike. The specific design of any given\nstreet must consider the building types as shown in Article 9 which have frontage and the relationship of\nthe street to the overall City street network. The following specifications apply to street design:\n13.6-1 On-street parking is recommended where building type and use will generate regular parking use.\nOccasional on-street parking can be accommodated without additional pavement width. For streets\nthat serve workplace and storefront buildings, on-street parking lane(s) are required and should be\nmarked as such. An on-street parking lane on at least one side of the street is recommended on streets\nserving attached houses and detached houses with lots 60' or less in width. Parallel on-street parking\nwidth is 7' - 8'. On-street parking should be parallel; angled parking is only permitted as an intentional\ndesign element of retail centers.\n13.6-2 Traffic control plans showing signage and pavement markings shall be prepared in accordance with the\nguidance of the U.S. Department of Transportation Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices\n(MUTCD). The developer is responsible for the initial installation of the retroreflective signage\nor markings and the maintenance thereof until the public accepts the street for maintenance.\nArticle 13 -

Many streets, especially local ones, have purposes other than\nvehicular traffic. The following street standards, based on \"NC Department of Transportation Standard\nSpecifications For Roads and Structures\" and recommendations found in \"A Policy on Geometric Design of\nHighways and Streets\" (AASHTO \"green book\"), are provided for streets within the City of Creedmoor that will\nbe maintained by the City.\nStreets in Creedmoor should be inviting public space and integral components of community design. A\nhierarchical street network should accommodate a variety of uses, including bicycle, pedestrian, motor-vehicle\nand transit routes. All streets should connect to help create a comprehensive network that enables the free\nmovement of automobiles, bicyclists, and pedestrians. In order for this street network to be safe for motorists\nand pedestrians, design elements must consistently be applied to calm automobile traffic.\nWhere discrepancies occur between the text of this Ordinance and the City of Creedmoor Technical Standards\nand Specifications Manual, the Technical Standards and Specifications Manual shall prevail.\n13.2\nStreet Standards\n13.2-1\nINTERCONNECTION. Interconnection is required within a commercial development and with adjoining\ndevelopment. Residential cul-de-sacs shall be allowed only where topographical and/or lot line\nconfigurations offer no practical alternatives for connections or through traffic. Street stubs are\nstrongly recommended on the periphery of developments adjacent to open land to provide for future\nconnections except where environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands, creeks, steep slopes and\nconservation areas are vulnerable to harmful impacts by the extension of the street.\n13.2-2 PEDESTRIAN SCALED. Streets are designed as the most prevalent public space of the City and, thus,\nshall be scaled to the pedestrian.\n13.2-3 BORDERED BY SIDEWALKS. All streets shall be bordered by sidewalks with a minimum width of five (5)\nfeet on both sides, with the exception of cul-de-sacs, alleys, and the undeveloped edge of\nneighborhood subdivisions. Cul-de-sacs within residential subdivisions require sidewalks only on one\nside of the street. Sidewalks shall be located in the street right-of-way, or on public property.\n13.2-4 RESERVED.\n13.2-5 PUBLIC STREETS. All new subdivision streets shall be public. Alleys will be classified as public or private\ndepending on function, according to the street acceptance policy.\n13.2-6 FOCUS FOR BUILDINGS. All principal buildings, except for single family or two family residential\nstructures, shall front on public streets as dictated by the lot and building type standards of Article 9.\n[Reference G.S. 160D-702]\n13.2-7 STREET LIGHTS. Streets shall be illuminated by street lights located on at least one side and at all\nintersections. Street lights along streets shall be located in a minimum 5' landscape planting strip\nadjacent to the sidewalk. Illumination standards are specified in the Technical Standards and\nSpecifications Design Manual. The maximum height of street light fixtures shall be 14 feet in residential\nareas. Street light fixtures shall not produce direct light into adjacent properties at a height above 6\nvertical feet at the building setback line of residential districts. Street lights within mixed use districts\nshall not produce a direct light into adjacent properties at a height above 16 vertical feet at the building\nsetback line. Street lights within non-residential districts shall not produce a direct light into adjacent\nresidential properties at a height above 6 vertical feet at the property line.\nArticle 13 - Page 1\n",
