This district is defined as very low-density\nresidential areas and additional open areas where similar residential\ndevelopment will be a viable land use. The minimum lot size is 40,000 square\nfeet. The uses permitted in this district are designed to stabilize and protect the\nessential character of the area and prohibit all activities of a commercial nature\nexcept certain home occupations controlled by specific limitations. Mobile homes\non individual lots are permitted. (See Article V for permitted uses and Article VI\nfor specific area and yard requirements.)\nF.\nA-1, Agricultural District. This district is primarily intended to accommodate\nvery low density residential uses as well as associated public and institutional\nuses, low intensity commercial uses, and agricultural-related industrial uses\nwhich are interspersed throughout areas that are principally characterized as\nrural in nature. This district reflects the diverse nature of land uses within\npredominantly rural areas and, therefore, permits a wide array of land uses.\nHowever, those intensive land uses, which could have an adverse impact on the\nrural nature, are not permitted or are allowed only on a special use permit basis\nfollowing a formal review and approval process. The district is specifically\nestablished for the following purposes:\n1.\nTo preserve and encourage the continued use of land for agricultural,\nforestry, and open space purposes;\n2.\nTo encourage small-scale and low intensity commercial uses that primarily\nprovide goods and services to residents of the surrounding rural areas;\n3.\nTo encourage only those industries which are agricultural-related;\n4.\nTo encourage the concentration of more intensive urban land uses in and\naround identified growth areas that have the capacity to accommodate the\nutility and traffic demands of such development, thereby avoiding\npremature conversion of farmland to urban uses; and\n5.\nTo discourage any use which, because of its character, would create\npremature or extraordinary public infrastructure and service demands.\n(See Article V for permitted uses and Article VI for specific area and yard\nrequirements.)\nG.\nB-1, General Business District. This district is defined as certain areas that are\ndesigned to serve both non-residents and residents using the major state and\ncounty roads that run through the areas zoned.

This district is defined as an area where\nmanufacturing establishments may be developed. The purpose of this district is\nto permit the normal operations of almost all industries except those that would\nbe detrimental to adjoining properties.

This district is defined as an area to serve a wide\nrange of assembling, fabricating, manufacturing, warehousing, wholesaling, and\nsupport retail and service uses.

This district is intended for areas that have access to\nmajor\nthoroughfares and the necessary utilities to support such development.\n(See\nArticle V for permitted uses and Article VI for specific area and yard\nrequirements.)\n4.03\nConditional Zoning Districts\nA.\nIn addition to the general use zoning districts established in Section 4.02, a\ncorresponding conditional zoning district, bearing the designation 'CD', may be\nestablished in accordance with the provisions of Section 14.07.
