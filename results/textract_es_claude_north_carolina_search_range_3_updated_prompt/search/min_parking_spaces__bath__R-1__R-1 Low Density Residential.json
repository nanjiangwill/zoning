Specific provision are made for conditional uses\nwhich may be permitted in certain zones and the procedures for application are set out in Article\nIX, Section 9.05 of this ordinance.\nVariance: A variance is a relaxation of the terms of the zoning ordinance where such variance\nwill not be contrary to the public interest and where, owing to conditions peculiar to the property\nand not the result of the actions of the applicant, a literal enforcement of the ordinance would\nresult in unnecessary and undue hardship. In this ordinance a variance is authorized only for\nheight, area, and size of structure or size of yards and open spaces. The establishment or\nexpansion of the use otherwise prohibited shall not be allowed by variance, nor shall a variance\nbe granted because of the presence of non-conformities in the zoning district or uses in an\nadjoining zoning district.\nYard: A required open space other than a court unoccupied and unobstructed by any structure or\nportion of a structure from 50 inches above the general ground level of the grade lot upward,\nprovided however that fences, walls, poles, posts, and other customary yard accessories,\nornaments, and furniture may be permitted in any yard subject to height limitations and\nrequirements limiting obstruction of visibility or any other requirement of this ordinance, and\nfurther provided that customary accessory buildings may be located in any side or rear yard no\ncloser than five (5) feet to any property line and subject to other limitations of this ordinance.\na.\nYard, Front: A yard extending between side lot lines across the front of a lot adjoining\nthe public street. Depth of required front yard shall be measured at right angles to a\nstraight line joining the foremost points of the side lot lines. The foremost point of the\nside lot line, in the case of rounded property corners at street intersections, shall be\nassumed to be the point at which the side and front lot lines would have met without such\nrounding. Front and rear yard lines shall be essentially parallel.\nb. Yard, Rear: A yard extending across the rear of the lot between side lot lines. Depth of a\nrequired rear yard shall be measured in such a manner that the yard established is as trip\nof the minimum width required by district regulations with its inner edge parallel with the\nrear lot lines.\nC.\nYard, Side: A yard extending from the rear line of the required front yard to the rear yard.\nWidth of a required side yard shall be measured in such a manner that the yard\nestablished is a strip of the minimum width required by district regulations with its inner\nedge parallel with the side lot line.\n10\n\nNEW PAGE 15\n11\n\nNEW PAGE 16\nARTICLE IV.
