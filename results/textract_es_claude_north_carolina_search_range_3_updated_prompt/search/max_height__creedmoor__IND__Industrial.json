Digitally changing signs that incorporate continuous or fluid\nmotion of content on the digital sign shall have the motion reasonable enough so as not to\nnegatively impact surrounding persons, distract the drivers of motor vehicles, or be confused with\nany authorized traffic sign, signal, or device.\nF.\nAll streets shall be named, and signs conforming to City standards shall be posted at intersections\nshowing the name of every street. New streets which are obviously in alignment with others already\nexisting and named shall bear the names of the existing streets where practical. In no case shall the\nnames of new streets phonetically resemble existing street names. Streets shall be named in\naccordance with the standards for street naming established by Granville County Addressing & GIS\nand must be approved by Granville County's Address Coordinator. All subdivisions requiring the\ndevelopment of new public roads within the Single Family Residential District (SFR), the Residential /\nMain Street Transitional District, and Agriculture District (AG) must be named. Subdivision names or\nidentification shall not duplicate or closely approximate phonetically the names of existing streets\nand subdivisions in the City of Creedmoor or its area of planning and zoning jurisdiction and must\nbe approved by Granville County's Address Coordinator. The minimum identification requirement\nis that a sign clearly showing the name of a named subdivision be posted at the primary vehicular\nentrance to the subdivision from a major and/or minor thoroughfare(s). Residential subdivisions in all\nother zoning districts may install temporary signage identifying the subdivision until lots are sold.\nArticle 17 - Page 4\n\nNEW PAGE 211\nArticle 17 - Page 5\nCELL (1, 1): \nSign\nType\nCELL (1, 2): \nSign Copy\nArea\nAllowance\n(sq. ft.)\nCELL (1, 3): \nSign Illumination\nCELL (1, 4): \nMinimum Letter Size\nCELL (1, 5): \nMaximum\nNumber\nCELL (1, 6): \nOther Requirements\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nPermanent Attached Signs -
