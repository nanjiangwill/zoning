There is sufficient public park land in proximity to the proposed development based on\na review of the County's adopted policy guidance and information from County staff;\nii. Private common open space resources provided on the subject site will be available for\npublic use and will mitigate park land needs created by the proposed development;\niii. Collected funds could be utilized to further improve an existing park facility in a\nproximate location;\niv. The topography or other natural conditions of the site do not provide adequate\nopportunities for on-site recreation and park areas;\nV. The amount of park land to be dedicated is too small to provide adequate recreation\nand park opportunities or to be efficiently maintained;\nvi. The intended location of the park land is too far from existing recreation and park areas\nto be efficiently maintained; or\nvii.Adequate access is not available to the proposed park land.\n3.
