SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL (R-30) DISTRICT\nA.\nR-30 DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENT\nThe Single- Family Residential (R-30) district has a suburban character typically comprised of single-\nfamily detached residential uses in numerous locations throughout the County's planning jurisdiction.\nAllowable residential densities are around one and one-half units an acre but may be increased based\non design quality or open space provision. Lot sizes are generally larger than in neighborhoods and\nmore urbanized portions of the County and tend to be landscaped or include undisturbed vegetation.\nMost uses are not served by public potable water and sanitary wastewater services, though\nneighborhood-scale water and wastewater facilities may be present. Most buildings are low-rise in\nheight, or between one and three stories tall. Off-street parking is common. Neighborhood-scale or\nlow-intensity nonresidential and institutional uses like schools, religious institutions, parks, and minor\nutility uses are allowed, provided they do not detract from the quiet, residential character of the district.\nIn order to maintain compatibility with surrounding uses and ensure a high quality of development, all\nactivities shall comply with the standards in Article 6.

PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe purpose of this conditional zoning districts section is to establish the applicable standards for\nconditional zoning districts available for establishment in accordance with Section 2.3.5, Conditional\nRezoning. More specifically, these standards are intended to:\nA.\nProvide an alternative to conventional zoning districts when a conventional zoning district may\nallow a range of uses that could have adverse impacts on public facilities or surrounding lands;\nB.\nCreate an adequate amount of flexibility in addressing the standards of this Ordinance to\naccommodate unique site-specific conditions or contexts;\nC.\nAllow a landowner to propose, and the Board of County Commissioners to consider, additional\nconditions or restrictions on the range of allowable uses, use-specific standards, development\nintensities, development standards, and other applicable regulations;\nD.\nAllow a landowner to propose, and the Board of County Commissioners to consider, a\nreduction in some development standards that would otherwise apply, in accordance with\nthese standards;\nE.\nIdentify the range of development standards that may not be reduced or varied as part of a\nconditional rezoning application; and\nF.\nEstablish a legislative means to accommodate desirable development while avoiding or\naddressing anticipated problems that may arise from the proposed development.\n3.3.2. CREATION\nLand shall be classified into a conditional zoning district only in accordance with the procedures and\nrequirements set forth in Section 2.3.5, Conditional Rezoning.\n3.3.3. DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED\nThe conditional zoning districts, each bearing the designation \"C\" after the district name, are\nestablished in Table 3.1.3, Districts Established, based on a corresponding conventional zoning district\nin this Ordinance.\n3.3.4. CONDITIONS, GENERALLY\nApplications for the establishment of a conditional zoning district shall include conditions proposed in\naccordance with the following standards:\nA.\nConditions associated with a conditional zoning district may be proposed by an applicant or the\nBoard of County Commissioners. Regardless of how proposed, only those conditions agreed to\nby both the applicant and the Board of County Commissioners shall be included in the\napproved conditional rezoning.\nB.\nConditions shall be subject to the standards in Section 2.4.8, Conditions of Approval.\nC.\nAll conditions of approval shall be consented to, in writing, by the applicant, prior to issuance of\na zoning compliance permit.\nD.\nConditions associated with a conditional rezoning application may be either more restrictive or\nless restrictive than the standards applicable to the parallel conventional zoning district, subject\nto the provisions in Section 3.3.5, Limitations on Reductions.\nE.\nIn cases where proposed conditions are less restrictive than the applicable requirements for the\nconventional zoning district, the applicant shall provide an explanation as to why the proposed\ncondition(s) is necessary, and the ways in which approval of the less restrictive condition(s) will\nresult in development that is in closer alignment with the provisions in Section $1.7, Purpose\nand Intent, and the County's adopted policy guidance.\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage\n171\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n", "page_number": 169, "page_range": [169, 170, 171], "highlight": ["<em>R</em>-<em>30</em> DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS\nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nLAST AMENDED\nUnified Development Ordinance\nPage\n169\n5.2.22", "Conventional Zoning Districts\n<em>R</em>-<em>30</em> DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS (CONTINUED)\nNOTES:\n[1] Development located", "be increased by one additional dwelling unit per acre for voluntary compliance with Section\n6.2.3, <em>Single</em>-<em>Family</em>", "minimum lot area.\n[6] May be decreased to 17,800 sf per unit for voluntary compliance with Section 6.2.3, <em>Single</em>-<em>Family</em>", "-\n<em>street</em> <em>parking</em> is located on an individual lot."], "score": 12.75236, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Single-Family Residential\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R-30\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R30\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R-30\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking space for each\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 170\nARTICLE 3.

DISTRICTS\n$3.3. Conditional Zoning Districts\n$3.3. CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICTS\n3.3.1. PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe purpose of this conditional zoning districts section is to establish the applicable standards for\nconditional zoning districts available for establishment in accordance with Section 2.3.5, Conditional\nRezoning. More specifically, these standards are intended to:\nA.\nProvide an alternative to conventional zoning districts when a conventional zoning district may\nallow a range of uses that could have adverse impacts on public facilities or surrounding lands;\nB.\nCreate an adequate amount of flexibility in addressing the standards of this Ordinance to\naccommodate unique site-specific conditions or contexts;\nC.\nAllow a landowner to propose, and the Board of County Commissioners to consider, additional\nconditions or restrictions on the range of allowable uses, use-specific standards, development\nintensities, development standards, and other applicable regulations;\nD.\nAllow a landowner to propose, and the Board of County Commissioners to consider, a\nreduction in some development standards that would otherwise apply, in accordance with\nthese standards;\nE.\nIdentify the range of development standards that may not be reduced or varied as part of a\nconditional rezoning application; and\nF.\nEstablish a legislative means to accommodate desirable development while avoiding or\naddressing anticipated problems that may arise from the proposed development.\n3.3.2. CREATION\nLand shall be classified into a conditional zoning district only in accordance with the procedures and\nrequirements set forth in Section 2.3.5, Conditional Rezoning.\n3.3.3. DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED\nThe conditional zoning districts, each bearing the designation \"C\" after the district name, are\nestablished in Table 3.1.3, Districts Established, based on a corresponding conventional zoning district\nin this Ordinance.\n3.3.4. CONDITIONS, GENERALLY\nApplications for the establishment of a conditional zoning district shall include conditions proposed in\naccordance with the following standards:\nA.\nConditions associated with a conditional zoning district may be proposed by an applicant or the\nBoard of County Commissioners. Regardless of how proposed, only those conditions agreed to\nby both the applicant and the Board of County Commissioners shall be included in the\napproved conditional rezoning.\nB.\nConditions shall be subject to the standards in Section 2.4.8, Conditions of Approval.\nC.\nAll conditions of approval shall be consented to, in writing, by the applicant, prior to issuance of\na zoning compliance permit.\nD.\nConditions associated with a conditional rezoning application may be either more restrictive or\nless restrictive than the standards applicable to the parallel conventional zoning district, subject\nto the provisions in Section 3.3.5, Limitations on Reductions.\nE.\nIn cases where proposed conditions are less restrictive than the applicable requirements for the\nconventional zoning district, the applicant shall provide an explanation as to why the proposed\ncondition(s) is necessary, and the ways in which approval of the less restrictive condition(s) will\nresult in development that is in closer alignment with the provisions in Section $1.7, Purpose\nand Intent, and the County's adopted policy guidance.\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage\n171\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n\nNEW PAGE 172\nARTICLE 3. DISTRICTS\n$3.3. Conditional Zoning Districts\nF.\nApplicants are strongly encouraged to provide mitigation for any potential negative impacts\nanticipated to result from proposed conditions that are less restrictive than the parallel\nconventional zoning district requirements.\n3.3.5. LIMITATIONS ON REDUCTIONS\nIn no instance shall any of the following standards in this Ordinance be waived or reduced as part of an\napplication for a conditional rezoning:\nA.\nAny of the applicable overlay district standards in Section $3.4, Overlay Zoning Districts;\nB.\nThe maximum allowable residential density, unless the landowner complies with the applicable\nprovisions in Section 3.1.5, Incentives and Alternatives;\nC.\nAny applicable conservation subdivision standards in Section 2.3.6, Conservation Subdivision;\nD.\nAny applicable design standards or guidelines in Section $6.2, Design Standards and Guidelines;\nor\nE.\nAny applicable standards in Section $6.4, Infrastructure.\n3.3.6. CONCEPT PLAN REQUIRED\nA.\nAll applications to establish a conditional zoning district classification shall include a general\nwritten description of the proposed development configuration and associated conditions and\nbe supplemented with one of the following:\n1. A conceptual plan depicting the generalized location of proposed development and site\nfeatures of sufficient detail to depict the proposed conditions; or\n2.\nA detailed plan meeting the minimum requirements for a site plan (see Section 2.3.19, Site\nPlan) that depicts building placement(s) and size(s) as well as the configuration of all site\nfeatures along with the proposed conditions.\nB.\nDevelopment proposed in a conditional rezoning application that does not include a detailed\nplan described in sub-section (A.2) above shall be subject to the requirements and procedures\nin Section 2.3.19, Site Plan, prior to the issuance of a zoning compliance permit.\nC.\nIn cases where the plan associated with a conditional rezoning is detailed and meets the\nminimum requirements for a site plan in the opinion of the Board of County Commissioners,\nthe applicant shall request, and the Board of County Commissioners may grant an exemption\nfrom subsequent site plan review.\nD.\nReview of a proposed concept or detailed plan shall take place by the Technical Review\nCommittee to ensure technical feasibility of the development proposal prior to review of the\nconditional rezoning application by the Planning Board.\nE.\nIf a site plan review exemption is granted by the Board of County Commissioners, the proposed\ndevelopment shall fully comply with the development configuration depicted in the conditional\nrezoning application. Failure to comply with the plan approved as part the conditional rezoning\nshall require an amendment of the conditional rezoning application in accordance with Section\n2.3.19.F, Amendment.\n3.3.7. COMPLIANCE WITH CONVENTIONAL DISTRICT REQUIREMENTS\nUnless specifically modified in accordance with an approved condition, development in a conditional\nzoning district shall be subject to all the use and development standards and requirements that apply\nto development in the parallel conventional zoning district.\n3.3.8.
