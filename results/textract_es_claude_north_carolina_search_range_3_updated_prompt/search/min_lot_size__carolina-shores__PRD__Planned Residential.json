Detailed use\ntables are provided in \u00a7 91.74 showing the uses allowed in each district. The following describes the processes of each of the categories that\nthe uses are subject to:\n(A) Permitted by right. Administrative review and approval subject to district provisions and other applicable requirements only;\n(B) Permitted with supplemental regulations. Administrative review and approval subject to district provisions, other applicable\nrequirements and supplemental regulations outlined in \u00a7\u00a7 91.80 through 91.104; and\n(C) Special uses. Planning Board review and recommendation, Board of Commissioners review and approval of special use permit subject\nto district provisions, other applicable requirements and conditions of approval as specified in \u00a7 91.56. Some special uses may also be subject\nto supplemental regulations outlined in \u00a7\u00a7 91.80 through 91.104.\n(Ord. eff. 9-6-2012, \u00a7 6.2; Am. Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n91.72 PRIMARY ZONING DISTRICTS.\nFor the purposes of this Unified Development Ordinance, the town is hereby divided into the following primary zoning districts.\n(A) R-15 Residential District. The R-15 Residential District is intended as a single-family residential area with a low to medium population\ndensity. Certain structures and uses of governmental, educational, religious and noncommercial recreational natures are either permitted\noutright or are subject to special conditions intended to preserve and protect the residential character of this district.\n(B) R-12 Residential District. The R-12 Residential District is intended as a single-family residential area with a low to medium population\ndensity. Certain structures and, uses of governmental, educational, religious and noncommercial recreational natures are either permitted\noutright or are subject to special conditions intended to preserve and protect the residential character of this district.\n(C) R-8 Residential District. The R-8 Residential District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for single-family,\ntwo-family and multi-family residences. The regulations of this district are intended to provide areas of the community for those persons\ndesiring residence and multi-family structures in medium density neighborhoods. The regulations are intended to discourage any use which\nbecause of its character would interfere with the residential nature of this district.\n(D) R-6 Residential District. The R-6 Residential District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for single-family,\ntwo-family and multi-family residences. The regulations of this district are intended to provide areas in the community for those persons\ndesiring small residences and multi-family structures in relatively high density neighborhoods. The regulations are intended to discourage any\nuse which because of its character would interfere with the residential nature of this district. The R-6 District was in effect prior to the date of\nadoption of this Unified Development Ordinance and shall continue in effect for those areas following the date of adoption of this Unified\nDevelopment Ordinance. It is the intention of the town that there will be no additional R-6 zoning.\n(E) MFH I Manufactured Home District I. The MFH I Manufactured Home District I is established as a district in which the principal use of\nland is for double-wide manufactured homes Class \"A.\"\n(F) MFH // Manufactured Home District II. The MFH II Manufactured Home District II is established as a district in which the principal use of\nland is for Class \"B\" manufactured homes.\n(G) O/I Office and Institutional District. This district is established primarily for office and institutional uses which cause no offensive noises,\nodors, smoke, fumes, excessive traffic or other objectionable conditions. This district may serve as a buffer between residential and\ncommercial/industrial districts.\n(H) NB Neighborhood Business District. The regulations for this district are designed to permit a concentrated development of permitted\nfacilities which are normally adjacent to non-federal highways and routinely adjacent to residential areas.\n(I) HC Highway Commercial District. The HC Highway Commercial District is established primarily for those businesses that serve the\ntraveling public, require large areas for displays of goods, and are not oriented to the pedestrian shopper.\n(J) ID Industrial District. The ID Industrial District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for industries which can be\noperated in a relatively clean and quiet manner and which will not be obnoxious to adjacent residential or business districts. The regulations\nare designed to prohibit the use of land for heavy industry, which should be properly segregated, and to prohibit any other use that would\nsubstantially interfere with the development of industrial establishments in the district.\n(K) CRD Conservation Recreation District. This district is established as a district intended to preserve Carolina Shores' essential open\nspace areas, by protecting/preserving natural resources such as: floodplain areas, existing and proposed residential areas, recreational\nresources; and limiting impervious surfaces, thereby reducing stormwater runoff. Conservation zoning may be incorporated into surrounding\ndevelopments. Large lot zoning for single-family residential development is conditionally allowed as an effective way to preserve natural and\ncommunity open space resources.\n(L) PRD Planned Residential District. A Planned Residential District (PRD) is planned and developed as an integral unit in a single\n\nNEW PAGE 36\ndevelopment phase or several phases in accord with an initially approved development plan.\n(M) AD Agricultural District. The purpose of this district is to provide for areas where the principal use of land is for low density residential\nand agricultural\npurposes. The regulations of this district are intended to protect the agricultural sections of the community from an influx of uses likely to\nrender them undesirable for farms and future residential development.\n(Ord. eff. 9-6-2012, \u00a7 6.3; Am. Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n\u00a7 91.73 CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICT.\n(A) The large site conditional zoning district (CZD) allows a site to be developed with a mixture of land uses according to an approved\noverall site plan. For example, a large tract may be developed with a mix of single-family and multi-family housing, with part of the site also\ndevoted to commercial and office uses. The CZD allows for greater flexibility in dimensional standards (such as lot sizes and setbacks) upon\napproval of an overall master plan for the entire development. The district does not require a rigid separation of different land uses. Uses are\nlimited to the uses identified in \u00a7 91.74 Table of Permitted/ Special Uses. All of the site-specific standards and conditions, including a site plan,\nare incorporated into the zoning district regulations for the CZD. Approval of the site plan will establish all zoning requirements for the subject\nproperty. A large site CZD district shall not be less than three acres in area. Within the MLK-O overlay district, lots smaller than three acres in\nsize may apply for CZD zoning.\n(B) This negotiated approach to a legislative decision allows maximum flexibility to tailor regulations to a particular site and project. But it\nalso has great potential for abuse - both in terms of impacts on individual landowners seeking approval and their neighbors and on the public\ninterests zoning is supposed to promote. Thus, special restrictions have been placed on conditional zoning. Conditional Zoning Districts may\nonly occur at the owner's request and cannot be imposed without the owner's agreement. The individual conditions and site-specific standards\nthat can be imposed are limited to those that are needed to bring a project into compliance with town ordinances and adopted plans and to\nthose addressing the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by use of the site. The town must assure that all of the factors defining\nreasonable spot zoning are fully considered and that the public hearing record reflects that consideration.\n(C) Conditional zoning provides important opportunities to carefully tailor regulations to address the interest of the landowner, the\nneighbors, and the public. The town may use conditional zoning when it concludes that a particular project should be approved but that the\nstandards in the comparable conventional zoning district(s) are insufficient to protect neighbors or public interests (perhaps because the\nconventional zoning allows other uses not suitable for the site or dimensional standards inadequate to preserve the neighborhood).\nConditional zoning often allows a developer to proceed with a project in a way that addresses site-specific concerns of neighbors and the\nTown of Carolina Shores. The petitioner must consent in writing to all conditions imposed by the conditional zoning.\n(Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n\u00a7 91.74 TABLE OF PERMITTED/SPECIAL USES.\nPS - Permitted Use with

The regulations are intended to discourage any use which\nbecause of its character would interfere with the residential nature of this district.\n(D) R-6 Residential District. The R-6 Residential District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for single-family,\ntwo-family and multi-family residences. The regulations of this district are intended to provide areas in the community for those persons\ndesiring small residences and multi-family structures in relatively high density neighborhoods. The regulations are intended to discourage any\nuse which because of its character would interfere with the residential nature of this district. The R-6 District was in effect prior to the date of\nadoption of this Unified Development Ordinance and shall continue in effect for those areas following the date of adoption of this Unified\nDevelopment Ordinance. It is the intention of the town that there will be no additional R-6 zoning.\n(E) MFH I Manufactured Home District I. The MFH I Manufactured Home District I is established as a district in which the principal use of\nland is for double-wide manufactured homes Class \"A.\"\n(F) MFH // Manufactured Home District II. The MFH II Manufactured Home District II is established as a district in which the principal use of\nland is for Class \"B\" manufactured homes.\n(G) O/I Office and Institutional District. This district is established primarily for office and institutional uses which cause no offensive noises,\nodors, smoke, fumes, excessive traffic or other objectionable conditions. This district may serve as a buffer between residential and\ncommercial/industrial districts.\n(H) NB Neighborhood Business District. The regulations for this district are designed to permit a concentrated development of permitted\nfacilities which are normally adjacent to non-federal highways and routinely adjacent to residential areas.\n(I) HC Highway Commercial District. The HC Highway Commercial District is established primarily for those businesses that serve the\ntraveling public, require large areas for displays of goods, and are not oriented to the pedestrian shopper.\n(J) ID Industrial District. The ID Industrial District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for industries which can be\noperated in a relatively clean and quiet manner and which will not be obnoxious to adjacent residential or business districts. The regulations\nare designed to prohibit the use of land for heavy industry, which should be properly segregated, and to prohibit any other use that would\nsubstantially interfere with the development of industrial establishments in the district.\n(K) CRD Conservation Recreation District. This district is established as a district intended to preserve Carolina Shores' essential open\nspace areas, by protecting/preserving natural resources such as: floodplain areas, existing and proposed residential areas, recreational\nresources; and limiting impervious surfaces, thereby reducing stormwater runoff. Conservation zoning may be incorporated into surrounding\ndevelopments. Large lot zoning for single-family residential development is conditionally allowed as an effective way to preserve natural and\ncommunity open space resources.\n(L) PRD Planned Residential District. A Planned Residential District (PRD) is planned and developed as an integral unit in a single\n\nNEW PAGE 36\ndevelopment phase or several phases in accord with an initially approved development plan.\n(M) AD Agricultural District. The purpose of this district is to provide for areas where the principal use of land is for low density residential\nand agricultural\npurposes. The regulations of this district are intended to protect the agricultural sections of the community from an influx of uses likely to\nrender them undesirable for farms and future residential development.\n(Ord. eff. 9-6-2012, \u00a7 6.3; Am. Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n\u00a7 91.73 CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICT.\n(A) The large site conditional zoning district (CZD) allows a site to be developed with a mixture of land uses according to an approved\noverall site plan. For example, a large tract may be developed with a mix of single-family and multi-family housing, with part of the site also\ndevoted to commercial and office uses. The CZD allows for greater flexibility in dimensional standards (such as lot sizes and setbacks) upon\napproval of an overall master plan for the entire development. The district does not require a rigid separation of different land uses. Uses are\nlimited to the uses identified in \u00a7 91.74 Table of Permitted/ Special Uses. All of the site-specific standards and conditions, including a site plan,\nare incorporated into the zoning district regulations for the CZD. Approval of the site plan will establish all zoning requirements for the subject\nproperty. A large site CZD district shall not be less than three acres in area. Within the MLK-O overlay district, lots smaller than three acres in\nsize may apply for CZD zoning.\n(B) This negotiated approach to a legislative decision allows maximum flexibility to tailor regulations to a particular site and project. But it\nalso has great potential for abuse - both in terms of impacts on individual landowners seeking approval and their neighbors and on the public\ninterests zoning is supposed to promote. Thus, special restrictions have been placed on conditional zoning. Conditional Zoning Districts may\nonly occur at the owner's request and cannot be imposed without the owner's agreement. The individual conditions and site-specific standards\nthat can be imposed are limited to those that are needed to bring a project into compliance with town ordinances and adopted plans and to\nthose addressing the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by use of the site. The town must assure that all of the factors defining\nreasonable spot zoning are fully considered and that the public hearing record reflects that consideration.\n(C) Conditional zoning provides important opportunities to carefully tailor regulations to address the interest of the landowner, the\nneighbors, and the public. The town may use conditional zoning when it concludes that a particular project should be approved but that the\nstandards in the comparable conventional zoning district(s) are insufficient to protect neighbors or public interests (perhaps because the\nconventional zoning allows other uses not suitable for the site or dimensional standards inadequate to preserve the neighborhood).\nConditional zoning often allows a developer to proceed with a project in a way that addresses site-specific concerns of neighbors and the\nTown of Carolina Shores. The petitioner must consent in writing to all conditions imposed by the conditional zoning.\n(Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n\u00a7 91.74 TABLE OF PERMITTED/SPECIAL USES.\nPS - Permitted Use with
