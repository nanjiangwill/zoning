A certificate of occupancy may not be issued until the final plat has been approved and recorded.\n(2) After the effective date of this Unified Development Ordinance, it shall be illegal for any person being the owner or agent of the owner\nof any land located within the territorial jurisdiction of this Unified Development Ordinance, to subdivide his or her land in violation of this\nUnified Development Ordinance or to transfer or sell land by reference to, exhibition of or any other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the\nland before the plat has been properly approved under the terms of this Unified Development Ordinance.\n(3) The description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transferring\nland shall not exempt the transaction from this penalty. The Board of Commissioners, through its attorney or other official so designated, may\nenjoin an illegal subdivision, transfer or sale of land by action for injunction. Further, violators of this Unified Development Ordinance shall be\nsubject, upon conviction, to fine and/or imprisonment as provided by G.S. \u00a7 14-4.

The\ntown is not obligated to accept a street for maintenance.\n(2) Before a request for acceptance by the town is made, the petitioner(s) for street dedication must provide the following to the UDO\nAdministrator:\n(a) Town Engineer's certification that the street(s) have been properly constructed to town specifications;\n(b) As-built drawings of all street, drainage and other improvements;\n(c) All easement agreements;\n(d) Lien waiver executed by all providers of materials and services; and\n(e) Deed for roadway right-of-way conveyance.\n(3) If the town agrees to accept the offer of dedication, it will be obligated to maintain the street. The obligation to maintain the street\ndoes not impose any requirement on the town to immediately make improvements to the street in question. Necessary improvements to the\nstreet in question will be made by the town as funds are available.\n(4) The warranty period shall run for a minimum of one year from the date of acceptance by the Board of Commissioners. Warranty\ninspections will be conducted by the Town Engineer at six months and 12 months after acceptance or at any time that deficiencies are\ndiscovered. All repairs will require an additional one-year warranty.\n(5) Acceptance of roadway dedication will be provided by adoption of a resolution of acceptance by the Town Board of Commissioners.\n(J) School site reservation. If the Board of Commissioners and the Brunswick County Board of Education have jointly determined the\nspecific location and size of any school sites to be reserved in accordance with the town comprehensive plan, staff shall immediately notify\nthe Board of Education in writing whenever a sketch plan for a subdivision is submitted which includes all or part of a school site to be\nreserved. The Board of Education shall promptly decide whether it still wishes the site to be reserved. If the Board of Education does wish to\nreserve the site, the subdivision shall not be approved without such reservation. The Board of Education shall then have 18 months beginning\non the date of final approval of the subdivision within which to acquire the site by purchase or by initiating condemnation proceedings. If the\nBoard of Education has not purchased or begun proceedings to condemn the site within 18 months, the developer may treat the land as freed\nof the reservation.\n(K) Dedication of land for park, recreation and open space. Every subdivider who proposes a subdivision of land for residential purposes\nshall dedicate for public or private use a portion of land or pay a fee in lieu thereof, in accordance with this section, for public park, greenway,\nrecreation and open space sites to serve the recreational needs of the residents of the subdivision or development. The town prefers that\nownership and maintenance of parks, recreation or open space lands be by a private entity, such as a property owners' association.\nDedication of land, or fee in lieu of, must be approved by the Board of Commissioners prior to approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning\nBoard.\n(1) At least one-thirty-fifth of an acre shall be dedicated for each dwelling unit planned or proposed in the subdivision plat or\ndevelopment.\n(2) The minimum amount of land which shall be dedicated for a public park, recreation or open space site shall be no less than two acres\nin size. When the area to be provided is less than two acres, the subdivider may be required to make payment in lieu of the dedication to be\nused for the acquisition or development of recreation, park or open space sites which would serve the needs of the residents of the\nsubdivision.\n(3) Except as otherwise required by the Board of Commissioners, all dedications of land shall meet the following criteria.\n(a) The dedicated land shall form a single parcel of land, except where the Board of Commissioners determines that two or more\nparcels would be in the best interest of the public, given the type and distribution of open spaces needed to adequately serve the proposed\ndevelopment. In these cases, the Board of Commissioners may require that the parcels be connected by a dedicated strip of land at least 30\nfeet in width.\n(b) Two-thirds of the dedicated land shall be usable for active recreation. Furthermore, lakes and other bodies of water may not be\n\nNEW PAGE 34\nincluded in computing any of the dedicated land area. Land dedicated only for greenways need not follow the requirements of this division (J)\n(3)(b).\n(c) The shape of the portion of the dedicated land which is deemed suitable for active recreation shall be sufficiently square or round to\nbe usable for any or all recreational facilities and activities, such as athletic fields and tennis courts, when a sufficient amount of land is\ndedicated to accommodate the facilities. Land dedicated only for greenways need not follow the requirements of this division (J)(3)(c).\n(d) The dedicated land shall be located so as to reasonably serve the recreation and open space needs of residents of the subdivision.\n(e) Public access to the dedicated land shall be provided either by adjoining public street frontage or by a dedicated public easement, at\nleast 30 feet wide, which connects the dedicated land to a public street or right-of-way. Gradients adjacent to existing and proposed streets\nshall allow for reasonable access to the dedicated land. Where the dedicated land is located adjacent to a street, the developer or subdivider\nshall remain responsible for the installation of utilities, sidewalks and other improvements required along that street segment.\n(f) Dedicated parks, recreation and open space areas shall have a sufficient natural or human-made buffer or screen to minimize any\nnegative impacts on adjacent residents.\n(4) The payment of fees, in lieu of the dedication of land, may occur at the request of the subdivider or developer. However, the decision\nto require the dedication of land for recreational purposes, or a payment of a fee in lieu, shall be made by the Board of Commissioners prior to\npreliminary plat approval after having received a recommendation from the Planning Board and having evaluated the proposed dedication and\nthe relationship the dedication would have with the town's overall recreational needs.\n(a) The fees in lieu of dedication shall be paid prior to final plat approval.\n(b) The amount of the payment shall be the product of:\n1. The number of acres to be dedicated, as required by this division (J); and\n2. The assessed value for property tax purposes of the land being subdivided, adjusted to reflect its current fair market value at the\ntime the payment is due to be paid.\n(c) Procedures for determining the amount of the payment are as follows.\n1. An appraisal of the land in the development shall be performed by a professional land appraiser selected by the developer from an\napproved list maintained by the Board of Commissioners. Professional land appraiser refers to a land appraiser who, in the opinion of the\nBoard of Commissioners, has the expertise and/or certification to perform an adequate appraisal.\n2. The appraisal shall not be done prior to submission of the preliminary plat. The cost of the appraisal shall be borne by the\ndeveloper.\n(5) At the time of filing a preliminary plat, the subdivider shall designate thereon the area or areas to be dedicated pursuant to this\nsection. If the subdivider desires to make a payment in lieu of the dedication of land, a letter to that effect shall be submitted with the\npreliminary plat. The Board of Commissioners reserves the right to approve or disapprove dedication of parcels for public park, recreation or\nopen space, or payment in lieu of.\n(6) Where a dedication of land is required, the dedication shall be shown on the final plat when submitted, and the plat shall be\naccompanied by an executed general warranty deed conveying the dedicated land to the town. Where a payment in lieu of dedication is\napproved by the Board of Commissioners, the payment will be made before the final plat is signed and recorded.\n(7) The Board of Commissioners shall have the authority to sell land dedicated pursuant to this section. The proceeds of the sale shall be\nused for the acquisition and/or development of other recreation, park or open space sites, or for sidewalk development serving the subdivision\nor more than one subdivision in the immediate area.\n(8) The town encourages neighborhood or property owner associations or management to construct, operate and maintain private parks\nand recreation. The construction, operation or maintenance of the private facilities shall not, however, diminish or eliminate the responsibility\nand obligations of the subdivider under this section.\n(9) Greenways may be credited against the requirements of this section, provided that the greenways are part of the town's greenway\nplan and dedicated to public use.\n(10) This chapter may not require a power line to be buried if the line existed above ground when the development's plat or development\nplan was initially approved (even if the power line was subsequently relocated) and the power line is located outside the parcel of land\ncontaining the subdivision or development plan.\n(L) Street construction. To provide for the orderly growth and development of the town, and to coordinate the streets and highways within\nproposed subdivisions with existing or planned streets and highways, a subdivider or developer may be required in lieu of required street\nconstruction and as a condition to plat approval, to provide funds which the town may use for the construction of roads to serve the occupants,\nresidents, or invitees of the subdivision or development and these funds may be used for roads which serve more than one subdivision or\ndevelopment within the area. All funds received by the town pursuant to this division shall be used only for development of roads, including\ndesign, land acquisition, and construction. The town may undertake these activities in conjunction with the North Carolina Department of\nTransportation under an agreement between the town and the Department of Transportation. Any formula adopted to determine the amount\nof funds the subdivider or developer is to pay in lieu of required street construction shall be based on the trips generated from the subdivision\nor development. A combination of partial payment of such funds and partial dedication of constructed streets may be required when the Board\nof Commissioners determines that such a combination is in the best interests of the public in the area to be served.\n(Ord. eff. 9-6-2012, \u00a7 5.7; Am.

The R-15 Residential District is intended as a single-family residential area with a low to medium population\ndensity. Certain structures and uses of governmental, educational, religious and noncommercial recreational natures are either permitted\noutright or are subject to special conditions intended to preserve and protect the residential character of this district.\n(B) R-12 Residential District. The R-12 Residential District is intended as a single-family residential area with a low to medium population\ndensity. Certain structures and, uses of governmental, educational, religious and noncommercial recreational natures are either permitted\noutright or are subject to special conditions intended to preserve and protect the residential character of this district.\n(C) R-8 Residential District. The R-8 Residential District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for single-family,\ntwo-family and multi-family residences. The regulations of this district are intended to provide areas of the community for those persons\ndesiring residence and multi-family structures in medium density neighborhoods. The regulations are intended to discourage any use which\nbecause of its character would interfere with the residential nature of this district.\n(D) R-6 Residential District.

The regulations of this district are intended to provide areas in the community for those persons\ndesiring small residences and multi-family structures in relatively high density neighborhoods. The regulations are intended to discourage any\nuse which because of its character would interfere with the residential nature of this district. The R-6 District was in effect prior to the date of\nadoption of this Unified Development Ordinance and shall continue in effect for those areas following the date of adoption of this Unified\nDevelopment Ordinance. It is the intention of the town that there will be no additional R-6 zoning.\n(E) MFH I Manufactured Home District I. The MFH I Manufactured Home District I is established as a district in which the principal use of\nland is for double-wide manufactured homes Class \"A.\"\n(F) MFH // Manufactured Home District II. The MFH II Manufactured Home District II is established as a district in which the principal use of\nland is for Class \"B\" manufactured homes.\n(G) O/I Office and Institutional District. This district is established primarily for office and institutional uses which cause no offensive noises,\nodors, smoke, fumes, excessive traffic or other objectionable conditions. This district may serve as a buffer between residential and\ncommercial/industrial districts.\n(H) NB Neighborhood Business District.
