The\nCZC for the use of any building, structure, or property where off-street parking or loading\nspace is required should be withheld by the Zoning Code Administrator until provisions of\nthis Article are fully met. If at any time such compliance ceases, any CZC which shall have\nbeen issued for the use of the property shall immediately become void and of no effect.\nFlex Space: In order to reduce the burden on property owners regarding the required Parking\nPlan as described in this article, the Zoning Code Administrator may consider non-residential\nproperties (or a collection of non-residential properties) that function as a whole with\nmultiple uses to qualify as a Flex Space property. Flex Space properties are designated\nsolely for the purpose of this provision. The acceptance of a property or multiple properties\nbeing classified as Flex Space will be at the discretion of the Zoning Code Administrator.\nProperties that qualify as Flex Space shall provide one (1) space for every 150 square feet of\ngross floor area, or the property owner may submit a Parking Plan (with the required CZC\napplication) that indicates the amount of square footage for each use listed in the Off-Street\nParking Schedule and provide at least the minimum number of parking spaces that\ncorresponds to those uses. Property owners or developers seeking to classify their property\nas Flex Space shall submit a request to the Zoning Code Administrator in the form of a letter\nthat indicates the proposed amount of square footage for each use listed in the Off-Street\nParking Schedule in order to approve that the proposed uses are indeed a mix of the uses\nlisted in the Off-Street Parking Schedule. The Flex Space property must be built in\naccordance with the Parking Plan, but future changes of use will not be required to submit a\nrevised Parking Plan with the required CZC application for the change of use; however,\napproval of the CZC application for the change of use will be at the discretion of the Zoning\nCode Administrator and depends on whether the change of use has the potential to create a\nparking space deficiency by significantly altering the original Flex Space plan.\nN.

Flex Space properties are designated\nsolely for the purpose of this provision. The acceptance of a property or multiple properties\nbeing classified as Flex Space will be at the discretion of the Zoning Code Administrator.\nProperties that qualify as Flex Space shall provide one (1) space for every 150 square feet of\ngross floor area, or the property owner may submit a Parking Plan (with the required CZC\napplication) that indicates the amount of square footage for each use listed in the Off-Street\nParking Schedule and provide at least the minimum number of parking spaces that\ncorresponds to those uses. Property owners or developers seeking to classify their property\nas Flex Space shall submit a request to the Zoning Code Administrator in the form of a letter\nthat indicates the proposed amount of square footage for each use listed in the Off-Street\nParking Schedule in order to approve that the proposed uses are indeed a mix of the uses\nlisted in the Off-Street Parking Schedule. The Flex Space property must be built in\naccordance with the Parking Plan, but future changes of use will not be required to submit a\nrevised Parking Plan with the required CZC application for the change of use; however,\napproval of the CZC application for the change of use will be at the discretion of the Zoning\nCode Administrator and depends on whether the change of use has the potential to create a\nparking space deficiency by significantly altering the original Flex Space plan.\nN.
