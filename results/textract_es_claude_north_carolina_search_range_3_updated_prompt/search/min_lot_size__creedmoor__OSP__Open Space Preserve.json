The provision and design of agricultural and open space shall\ncomply with the requirements set forth below.\n1.\nCommon agricultural and open space provided by a development shall be conveyed as\nfollows:\na. To the City of Creedmoor and accepted by it for park, open space, agricultural, or\nother specified use or uses, provided that the conveyance is approved by the City\nCouncil; or\nb. To a nonprofit organization whose principal purpose is the conservation of open\nspace, to a corporation or trust owned or to be owned by the owners of lots or\ndwelling units within the development, or to owners of shares within a cooperative\ndevelopment. If such a corporation or trust is used, ownership shall pass with the\nconveyances of the lots or dwelling units. Such corporation or trust shall maintain the\nproperty in use for agricultural purposes and/or as open space.\n2. Where the common agricultural and open space in a development is conveyed pursuant\nto subparagraph 1.b above, a deed restriction enforceable by the City of Creedmoor shall\nbe recorded that provides that the common agricultural and open space shall:\nArticle 8 - Page 13\n\nNEW PAGE 112\na.\nbe maintained in the authorized conditions(s); and\nb.\nnot be developed for principal uses, accessory uses (e.g., parking), or roadways, with\nthe exception that gazebos, tool sheds, barns, shelters, or similar accessory uses and\nstructures may be constructed within the agricultural and common open space upon\napproval of the Planning, Zoning and Subdivision Administrator.\nJ.\nGeneral Standards.\n1.\nThe following shall apply in the Mini Farm Overlay District:\n8.5-3\nSCENIC CORRIDOR OVERLAY (SCO)\nA.\nINTENT. The SCENIC CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT (SCO) is established to protect the pastoral\nscenes and open spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and visitors traveling the\nmajor entrance roads and gateways to the City. The pastoral scenes and undeveloped\nproperty along the entrance roads and gateways contribute significantly to Creedmoor's\ncommunity character and sense of place. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District provides\ndevelopment options for the owners of the property abutting the entrance roads and\ngateways. The goal of this district is to protect the scenic value of the corridors through\ndevelopment standards. These standards will preserve the rural character of the City by\nmaintaining the sense of a rural corridor in an urban environment; provide an aesthetically\nappealing experience for those traveling the corridor; provide multi-modal transportation\noptions for travel; and ensure a safe transportation corridor for motorists, bicyclists, and\npedestrians. The Detached House lot/building type is allowed in this district.\nB.\nTYPES. Three (3) types of scenic corridors are hereby created:\n1. RURAL SCENIC CORRIDOR. A corridor along which development is limited, consisting\nlargely of fields, pastures, and scattered residential uses. The rural scenic corridor evokes\na sense of traveling through an undeveloped area, with pastoral scenes and a sense of\nbeing removed from the urban environment.\n2. GATEWAY SCENIC CORRIDOR. A corridor that serves as an entrance way to a place that is\nunique and different from other communities in the area. The gateway corridor provides\na sense of arrival to a place that is special and different from the typical places. The\ngateway scenic corridor may be more developed than the rural scenic corridor, but the\ncharacter of the development is such that those using the corridor are aware they are in\na special place.\n3.\nBYPASS SCENIC CORRIDOR. A corridor providing for buffering of the bypass to protect the\ntraffic carrying capacity of the road and to provide for a pleasant experience for motorists\nusing the bypass. The bypass scenic corridor requires an undeveloped setback from the\nbypass, ensuring that the bypass through Creedmoor is unique and portrays the character\nof the community while enhancing the safety of motorists using the road.\nC.\nGENERAL REQUIREMENTS\n1.\nDEVELOPMENT PATTERN. Building placement, parking placement, building type, and lot\narrangement shall be controlled by the lot and building type standards (Article 9) for the\nlot and building types permitted in the Scenic Corridor Overlay District.\n2.\nACTIVITIES PERMITTED IN THE SCENIC CORRIDOR. In order to preserve the aesthetic\nquality of the scenic corridors, uses and activities within the designated scenic corridors\nshall be limited to the following:\nArticle 8 - Page 14\nCELL (1, 1):

provides for the completion\nof existing residential neighborhoods in the residential area(s) surrounding the Main Street and\nMain Street Periphery District through in-fill development. The intent of this district is to recognize\nthat most of the area surrounding the core of the downtown developed prior to the adoption of\nstandards such as zoning and subdivision regulations. The gradual transformation of existing\ndevelopment to high quality mixed density residential development is needed to support the\ncentral core of the City. Higher density residential development allows a greater number of\nhouseholds to walk or bike, thus reducing the parking demand and providing environmental and\nhealth benefits. Allowed building/lot types in these districts are the Detached House, Attached\nHouse, Multi-family Building, and Civic Building. Streets in the Residential/Main Street Transitional\nDistrict should be interconnected, with streets and sidewalks providing a connection from\nCreedmoor's downtown to the Single Family Residential districts surrounding these\nneighborhoods. A range of housing types is encouraged.\nThe MAIN STREET PERIPHERY DISTRICT (MSP) provides for the development and maintenance of\na range of uses in areas adjacent to Creedmoor's core downtown area. Allowed building/lot types\nin these districts are Multi-Family, Detached House, Attached House for both residential and/or\nnon-residential permitted uses, and Civic Building. In this district, the development pattern\nintegrates limited service, limited retail, office, civic, educational, religious, and residential uses in\nan environment that is pedestrian friendly while acknowledging the role of the automobile as a\nmeans of transportation. Street and sidewalk networks providing multi-modal transportation\noptions connect the Periphery District to the downtown and to surrounding neighborhoods. The\nPeriphery District provides an area for the expansion of the Main Street District.\nThe MAIN STREET DISTRICT (MS) provides for new development, revitalization, reuse, and infill\ndevelopment in Creedmoor's core downtown. A broad array of uses is permitted to enable the\nneeds of residents and visitors to be met. Allowed building/lot types in this district are Urban\nWorkplace, Shop-front, Detached House, attached House, and Civic Building. The development\npattern seeks to integrate shops, restaurants, services, work places, civic, educational, and\nreligious facilities, and higher density housing in a compact, pedestrian-oriented environment. The\nMain Street District serves as the hub of the surrounding neighborhoods and of the broader\ncommunity. The Main Street District may be expanded over time to meet the needs of the growing\ncommunity for downtown facilities and services. Expansion of the Main Street District shall be\ncontiguous and not separated from the primary district area.\nThe CIVIC DISTRICT (CIV) provides a location for large educational, medical, and public uses in a\ncampus like environment. Large developments in the Civic District are encouraged to provide a\nmaster plan to the City. Institutional uses in the Civic District are required to provide pedestrian\nconnections on their campuses and, to the extent possible, develop an internal street system with\nstructures fronting on the streets. Parking should not be the dominant visible element of the\ncampuses developed for institutional uses.\nThe NC 56 COMMERCIAL DISTRICT (C-56) is established to provide opportunities for compatible\nand sustainable development where the dominant mode of transportation is the automobile. The\nauto-oriented street, lot, and building designs can create uncomfortable pedestrian environments.\nAllowed building/lot types are Highway Commercial, and Civic Building. Dominant uses in this\ndistrict are retail and office. The NC 56 Commercial District is expected to serve Creedmoor\nresidents as well as persons who travel from surrounding communities. The development pattern\nin this district acknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access provided to\nensure safety for the motoring public. Development standards in the NC 56 Commercial District\nensure the creation of a pleasant auto-oriented environment while enabling a compatible\ntransition to uses in adjacent districts.\nThe US 15 COMMERCIAL DISTRICT (C-15) is established to provide opportunities for compatible\nand sustainable development along the US Hwy 15 corridor where future Creedmoor\nArticle 8 - Page 2\n\nNEW PAGE 101\nneighborhoods will interconnect with this Bypass type roadway corridor without negatively\ndissecting the community. Development standards in the US 15 Commercial District acknowledge\nthat the automobile is the primary mode of transportation. Development and design standards\nencourage pedestrian scale development along a secondary street network serving larger projects.\nGoals of the US 15 Commercial District include providing a pleasant environment for motorists, a\nsafe environment for pedestrians along the secondary network of streets and pedestrian facilities;\nensuring the safety of motorists and pedestrians; and preserving the capacity of the Bypass to\naccommodate high traffic volumes at higher speeds. Uses in this district include services,\nemployment, residential and industrial. Allowed building/lot types include Urban Workplace,\nShop-front Commercial, and Civic Building.\nThe INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT (IND) is established to provide locations for industrial uses that, due to\nthe scale of the buildings and/or the nature of the use, cannot be integrated into the community.\nUses within the Industrial District are buffered from adjacent uses. The dominant uses in this\ndistrict are manufacturing and warehouse storage. Small scale manufacturing and storage that is\ncompatible with less intensive uses can and should be located in other non-residential or mixed\nuse districts. The Industrial District is reserved for uses which require very large buildings and/or\nlarge parking and loading facilities. Allowed building and lot types are Highway Commercial and\nCivic Building.\nThe OPEN SPACE PRESERVE DISTRICT (OSP) is established to preserve and protect\nenvironmentally sensitive lands (e.g. floodways, wetlands, undisturbed buffers, slopes in excess\nof 10%), or properties already under public or private ownership otherwise restricted by\nconservation easements. This district is reserved for publicly held lands under permanent\nconservation easements or for privately held lands owned by one or more land trust(s) where\nrecorded conservation easements restrict development potential. [Amended December 6, 2016\nper Ord. 2016-0-22]\nThe MINI FARM OVERLAY DISTRICT (MFO) permits buildings to be grouped on a site, parcel, or\nproperty in order to optimize the use of land and resources for both residential and agricultural\npurposes. By clustering development at a density no greater than one unit per developed acre,\nprojects developed in accordance with these standards preserve unique natural features for\nagricultural use. The Mini Farm Overlay District mandates the dedication of both agricultural land\nand open space. It is the intent of this district to be used for new development in undeveloped\noutlying areas of the City and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. Allowed building/lot type is Detached\nHouse.\nThe SCENIC CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT (SCO) is established to protect the pastoral scenes and\nopen spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and visitors traveling the major entrance\nroads and gateways to the City. The pastoral scenes and undeveloped property along the entrance\nroads and gateways contribute significantly to Creedmoor's community character and sense of\nplace. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District provides development options for the owners of the\nproperty abutting the entrance roads and gateways. The goal of this district is to protect the scenic\nvalue of the corridors through a mix of incentives and development standards. These standards\nwill preserve the rural character of the City by maintaining the sense of a rural corridor in an urban\nenvironment; provide an aesthetically appealing experience for those traveling the corridor;\nprovide multi-modal transportation options for travel; and ensure a safe transportation corridor\nfor motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. The Detached House lot/building type is allowed in this\ndistrict.\nThe HAZARDOUS INDUSTRY OVERLAY DISTRICT (HIO) is established to protect all environments\nfrom the negative impacts of certain activities and types of development. It is the intent of this\nsection to provide and permit certain public and private heavy industrial uses and facilities that\nincorporate hazardous materials and/or scientific technology, including: wholesale, distribution,\nstorage, processing, manufacturing and production. However, it is required that industries in this\nArticle 8 - Page 3\n\nNEW PAGE 102\ndistrict take all necessary actions including but not limited to installation of apparatus and\ntechnological equipment available to prevent negative impacts on the environment and the\ncommunity from the emissions of smoke, dust, fumes, noise and vibrations and other activities\nand/or products resulting from such hazardous industrial activities in accordance with federal,\nstate and local regulations.\n8.4\nZONING DISTRICT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nThe following development standards are established for each of the following primary general use zoning\ndistricts to ensure the orderly development of the City of Creedmoor.\n8.4-1\nAGRICULTURE DISTRICT (AG)\nA.\nINTENT. The AGRICULTURE DISTRICT (AG) is established to protect lands used for agricultural\nproduction, agricultural based businesses and related activities. Farm land is a defining\nelement of Creedmoor's identity and the protection of these lands aids in preserving the\ncharacter of the City. Permitted uses are limited, with an emphasis on uses that are\nagricultural in nature. Development density is very low to encourage preservation of\nagricultural lands. The Agriculture District can also be used to protect open spaces.\nB. PERMITTED USES\nUses permitted by right (P). See Table of Uses (Table 8.1)\nUses permitted with additional standards (AS).
