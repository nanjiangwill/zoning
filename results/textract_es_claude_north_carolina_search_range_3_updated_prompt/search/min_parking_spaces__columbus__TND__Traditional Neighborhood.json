The Mixed-Use District (MU) is established to provide opportunities for compatible and sustainable re-\ndevelopment where underutilized commercial properties already exist. The existing auto-oriented street, lot, and building\ndesigns can create uncomfortable pedestrian environments; however, with careful site planning these areas will allow\na\ngreater number of residents to walk or bike to businesses and services with an interconnected network of streets and\nsidewalks. Dominant uses in this district are residential, retail and office. The Mixed-Use District is expected to serve\nColumbus residents as well as persons who travel from surrounding communities. The development pattern in this district\nacknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access provided to ensure safety for the motoring public.\nDevelopment standards in the Mixed-Use District ensure the creation of a pleasant auto-oriented environment while enabling\na compatible transition to uses in adjacent districts. This District is available for rezoning only with the consent of the\nproperty owner(s).\n(2) Residential density limits.\n(a) Single Family Detached:\n7 unit/acre;\n(b) Single Family Attached: 17 units/acre; and\n(c) Multifamily:\n28 units/acre.\n(3) Dimensional standards.\n(Unless a greater standard is otherwise required)\n(B) Regulations pertaining to Traditional Neighborhood Districts (TND).\n(1) Intent. The Traditional Neighborhood Development District (TND) provides for the development of new\nneighborhoods and the revitalization or extension of existing neighborhoods. These neighborhoods are structured upon a\nfine network of interconnecting pedestrian oriented streets and other public spaces. Traditional Neighborhood Developments\n(TND's) provide a mixture of housing types and prices, prominently sited civic or community building(s),\nstores/offices/workplaces, and churches to provide a balanced mix of activities.

A TND is\nurban in form, is typically an extension of the existing developed area of the Town, and has an overall residential density of\nup to 16 dwelling units per acre. TND districts should have a significant portion of land dedicated to open spaces. This\nDistrict is available for rezoning only with the consent of the property owner(s).\n(2) Residential density limits.\n(a) Single-family detached: seven units/acre;\n(b) Single-family attached: 12 units/acre; and\n(c) Multifamily development standards.\n1. The multi-family development shall not exceed a total of seventy-two (72) dwelling units.\n2. The maximum permitted density for the multi-family development shall be 14 1/2 units per acre.\n3. The permitted building and lot types for the multi-family development in a single-family area shall be the\ndetached house and the attached house building and lot types.\n4. All parking for the multi-family development shall be located behind the building. The parking area shall be\nscreened from adjacent properties and from the street with a screening device.\n5. The buildings in the multi-family development shall be architecturally compatible with single family structures on\nthe street on which the multi-family building is proposed. Elements that shall be incorporated into the design of the multi-\nfamily building to ensure architectural compatibility are:\na. The multi-family building shall be constructed of building materials similar to those used on single family\nstructures on the street.\nb. The roof pitch of the multi-family building shall be the same as that of the single-family structures on the street.\nC. The fenestration of the multi-family building by location and size of windows and doors shall be similar to that of\nthe single-family homes on the street.\nd. Color renderings of the proposed building must be submitted with the application to ensure architectural\ncompatibility.\n6. No multi-family building shall be located closer than 48 feet to an existing multi-family building or development.\nThe distance shall be measured along centerline of streets from the edge of the property proposed for development to the\nclosest edge of the property on which the existing multi-family building or development is located.\n(3) TND general requirements.\n(a) Along existing streets, new buildings shall respect the general spacing of structures, building mass and scale, and\nstreet frontage relationships of existing buildings.\n1. New buildings which adhere to the scale, massing, volume, spacing, and setback of existing buildings along\nfronting streets exhibit demonstrable compatibility.\n2. New buildings which exceed the scale and volume of existing buildings may demonstrate compatibility by varying\nthe massing of buildings to reduce perceived scale and volume.\n(b)\nOn new streets, allowable building and lot types will establish the development pattern.\n(c) A master plan in compliance with Traditional Neighborhood Development standards shall be provided with the\nzoning permit submittal for a general district TND. The master plan shall include a topographic survey and shall show the\nlocation and hierarchy of streets and public open spaces, location of residential, commercial, and civic building lots, street\nsections and/or plans, a master sign program, an outline of any additional regulatory intentions, phasing, and any other\ninformation, including building elevations, which may be required to evaluate the interior pedestrian environment and\nconditions at project edges.\n(d) Minimum Development Size: eight acres.\n(e) Maximum Development Size: none.\n(4) TND design requirements.\n(a) Neighborhood form.\n1. The area of the TND shall be divided into blocks, streets, lots, and open space.\n2. Similar land uses shall generally front across each street. Dissimilar categories shall generally abut at rear lot\nlines. Corner lots which front on streets of dissimilar use shall generally observe the setback established on each fronting\nstreet.\n(b) Streets, alleys and blocks.\n1. Public streets shall provide access to all tracts and lots.\n\nNEW PAGE 22\n2. Streets and alleys shall, wherever practicable, terminate at other streets within the neighborhood and connect to\nexisting and projected streets outside the development.\n3. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 250 feet in length, must be accessed from a street providing internal or external\nconnectivity, shall be permanently terminated by a vehicular turnaround, and are listed only where topography makes a\nstreet connection impracticable\n4. Vehicular turnarounds of various configurations are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately\nprovided.\n5. Pedestrian connections should be provided as extensions of terminating streets where not precluded by\ntopography or other physical constraints.\n6. The average perimeter of all blocks within the TND should not exceed 1,350 feet. No block face should have a\nlength greater than 500 feet without a dedicated alley or pathway providing through access.\n7. A continuous network of rear alleys shall provide vehicular access to lots 49 feet or less in width.\n8. Utilities may run along alleys provided that a permanent public access and utility easement is recorded for the full\nlength of alley being used for utilities or public services such as garbage collection.\n9. TND streets shall be organized according to a hierarchy based on function, size, capacity, and design speed;\nstreets and rights-of-way are therefore expected to differ in dimension. The proposed hierarchy of streets shall be indicated\non the submitted site plan. Each street type in a TND shall be separately detailed. An array of elements that are combined to\nmeet the purposes of TND neighborhood streets: building placement line, optional utility allocation, sidewalk, planting strip,\ncurb and gutter, optional parallel parking, and travel lane(s). Alternative methods of assembling the required street elements\nwill be considered to allow neighborhood street designs that are most appropriate to setting and use.\n10. To prevent the buildup of vehicular speed, disperse traffic flow, and create a sense of visual enclosure, long\nuninterrupted segments of straight streets should be avoided. Methods to achieve this interruption include:\n(i) A street can be interrupted by intersections designed to calm the speed and disperse the flow of traffic and\nterminate vistas with a significant feature (building, park, natural feature);\n(ii) A street can be terminated with a public monument, specifically designed building facade, or a gateway to the\nensuing space;\n(iii) Perceived street length can be reduced by a noticeable street curve where the outside edge of the curve is\nbounded by a building or other vertical elements that hug the curve and deflect the view; and\n(iv) Other traffic calming configurations are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately provided.\n(c) Buildings and lots.\n1. All lots shall share a frontage line with a street or square; lots fronting a square shall be provided rear alley\naccess.\n2. Consistent build-to lines shall be established along all streets and public space frontages; build-to lines determine\nthe width and ratio of enclosure for each public street or space. A minimum percentage build-out at the build-to line shall be\nestablished on the plan along all streets and public square frontages.\n3. Large-scale, single use facilities (conference spaces, theaters, athletic facilities, etc.) shall generally occur behind\nor above smaller scale uses of pedestrian orientation.\n(d) Open space. The provision and design of open space shall comply with the requirements set forth herein.\n(e) Parking, landscaping and buffers shall comply with the requirements set forth herein.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nResidential Density\nCELL (1, 4): \nResidential Density\nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (1, 6): \nMinimum Yard Setback Requirements\n(Feet)\nCELL (1, 7): \nMinimum Yard Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 8): \nMinimum Yard Setback Requirements\nCELL (1, 9): \nCELL (1, 10): \nCELL (2, 1): \nDistrict\nCELL (2, 2): \nMinimum\nLot Area\n(Square\nFeet) (1)\nCELL (2, 3): \nMinimum\nLand\nArea (1)\nPer\nCELL (2, 4): \nMaximum\nNumber\n(4)\nCELL (2, 5): \nMinimum\nLot\nWidth at\nBuilding\nLine\nCELL (2, 6): \nFront Yard\n(whichever is\ngreater)\nCELL (2, 7): \n(whichever is\nCELL (2, 8): \nSideyards\nCELL (2, 9): \nRear\nCELL (2, 10): \nMax.\nHeight\n(Feet)\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (3, 3): \nDwelling\nUnit\n(Square\nFeet)\nCELL (3, 4): \nDwelling\nUnits Per\nAcre\nCELL (3, 5): \n(Feet)\nCELL (3, 6): \nFrom\nRight-\nof-Way\nCELL (3, 7): \nFrom\nCenterline\nCELL (3, 8): \n(2)\nCELL (3, 9): \nYard\nCELL (3, 10): \nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (4, 3): \nResidential Density\nCELL (4, 4): \nResidential Density\nCELL (4, 5): \nCELL (4, 6): \nMinimum Yard Setback Requirements\n(Feet)\nCELL (4, 7): \nMinimum Yard Setback Requirements\nCELL (4, 8): \nMinimum Yard Setback Requirements\nCELL (4, 9): \nCELL (4, 10): \nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nMinimum\nLot Area\nCELL (5, 3): \nMinimum\nLand\nArea (1)\nCELL (5, 4): \nMaximum\nNumber\nCELL (5, 5): \nMinimum\nLot\nWidth at\nCELL (5, 6): \nFront Yard\n(whichever is\ngreater)\nCELL (5, 7): \n(whichever is\nCELL (5, 8): \nCELL (5, 9): \nCELL (5, 10): \nMax.\nCELL (6, 1): \nDistrict\nCELL (6, 2): \n(Square\nFeet) (1)\nCELL (6, 3): \nPer\nDwelling\nCELL (6, 4): \n(4)\nDwelling\nCELL (6, 5): \nBuilding\nLine\nCELL (6, 6): \nCELL (6, 7): \nCELL (6, 8): \nSideyards\n(2)\nCELL (6, 9): \nRear\nYard\nCELL (6, 10): \nHeight\n(Feet)\n", "page_number": 20, "page_range": [20, 21, 22], "highlight": ["(Unless a greater standard is otherwise required)\n(B) Regulations pertaining to <em>Traditional</em> <em>Neighborhood</em>", "The <em>Traditional</em> <em>Neighborhood</em> Development District (<em>TND</em>) provides for the development of new\nneighborhoods", "<em>Traditional</em> <em>Neighborhood</em> Developments\n(TND's) provide a mixture of housing types and prices, prominently", "A <em>Traditional</em> <em>Neighborhood</em> Development\nCELL (1, 1): \nWholesale sales\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL", "CELL (6, 1): \nDistrict\nCELL (6, 2): \n(Square\nFeet) (1)\nCELL (6, 3): \n<em>Per</em>\n<em>Dwelling</em>\nCELL (6, 4): \n(4)\nDwelling"], "score": 15.526546, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Traditional Neighborhood\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"TND\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"TND\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"TND\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking space for each\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 16\n(H) Public Service District (PS);\n(I) Mixed Use District (MU); and\n(J) Traditional Neighborhood District (TND).\n(Ord., Art.

VII, \u00a7 703, passed - -)\n\u00a7 154.064 STATEMENT OF DISTRICT INTENTS.\n(A) Residential Estate (RE). The Residential Estate (RE) district as herein established is intended to be the most\nrestrictive of the residential districts. The intent is to provide for an environment of low density one-family detached dwelling\nunits along with other residentially related facilities which serve the residents in this district. These areas will often be\ndependent on private, individual septic tanks and wells; therefore, requiring larger lot sizes to sustain individual water\nsupplies and sewage disposal facilities. These areas may have soil and topographic constraints that preclude intense urban\ndevelopment.\n(B) Low Density Residential District (R-1). The Low Density Residential District is primarily intended to provide locations\nfor low-density residential development in outlying rural areas that are not likely to have public water and sewer services\navailable and may have soil and topographic constraints that preclude intense urban development. These areas often will be\ndependent upon private, individual septic tanks and wells; therefore, requiring larger lot sizes to sustain individual water\nsupplies and sewage disposal facilities. This district also provides for recreational, community service and institutional uses\nthat will complement the residential development. This district will be applied within those areas designated on the land use\nplan as Low Density Residential areas.\n(C) Community Residential-Medium Density Residential District (R-2). The Community Residential-Medium Density\nResidential District is primarily intended to provide locations for residential uses and supporting recreational and community\nservice uses in area where generally both Town public water and sewer services are available. These are the more urban\nareas of the community and will be primarily within the town limits and in close proximity to public and private services and\nthe town's central business district. This district is intended to protect existing single-family homes and subdivisions within\nthe town. This district will be applied within those areas designated on the land use plan as Medium Density Residential\n\nNEW PAGE 17\nareas.\n(D) Central Business District (CBD). The Central Business District is intended to be the primary retail and service center,\nand focal point of the community. This district provides for the concentration of commercial uses, professional services,\nfinancial services, governmental functions, and related services. The CBD area currently has access to both public water\nand sewer services, and dimensional requirements for this district are intended to encourage concentrated commercial\ndevelopment and to promote convenient pedestrian shopping in pleasant surroundings. This district will be applied to the\nexisting commercial center and to adjacent properties that with commercial development will complement and enhance the\nCBD as the retail and service center of the community. This district will be applied within the commercial areas as\ndesignated on the land use plan.\n(E) I-26 Corridor Overlay Area (I-26 COA). The I-26 Corridor Overlay boundaries are from the concrete right-of-way\nmonument set at the east intersection of Highway 26 and Highway 108, at the corner of Spartan Petroleum Company and\nrunning least 500 feet on Highway 108 to a line parallel to the right-of-way of 1-26, and also at the concrete right-of-way\nmonument set at the west intersection of Highway 26 and Highway 108, at the corner of the McFarland tract and running\nwest 500 feet on Highway 108 to a line parallel to the right of way of 1-26. This overlay area has the same requirements as\nin\nthe Highway Commercial District, but also has additional requirements for tall signs and electronic gaming operations.\n(F) Highway Commercial District (HC). The Highway Commercial District is intended to provide suitable locations for\nclustered groupings of highway commercial development in convenient locations along N.C. 108, to serve local residences\nand persons traveling by automobile. Urban sprawl, congestions, and strip commercial development will be discouraged by\npromoting good design, clustered developments, and by guiding commercial development primarily to areas that have water\nand sewer services and suitable soil and topographic conditions. These areas should provide sufficient space for ample off-\nstreet parking and well designed entrances and exits to avoid traffic congestion and safety hazards. Highway commercial\nareas are intended for commercial enterprises and services that require greater land area and lot dimensions than\nestablishments locating in the Central Business District. This district will be applied within the commercial areas as\ndesignated on the land use plan.\n(G) Industrial District (IND). The Industrial District is intended to provide sites for manufacturing and industrial uses,\nstorage and warehousing, wholesale trade, and other major employment centers. These locations should currently have\nboth public water and sewer services available or be expected to have these services in the future, and have suitable soil\nand topographic conditions to sustain the development. This district includes existing manufacturing areas, and sites suited\nfor future or further industrial development, and area designated on the land use plan as Industrial Centers. Only those\nmanufacturing uses will be allowed which have meet all local, state, and federal environmental standards, and do not involve\nobnoxious noise, vibrations, smoke, gas, fumes, odor, dust, fire hazards or other objectionable conditions which would be\ndetrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the community.\n(H) Public Service District (PS). The Public Service District is intended to be an area containing a concentration of public\nservice activities such as recreation areas, educational facilities, hospitals, emergency services and the like. This district\nis\nintended to preserve existing public service centers and will apply to those areas designated on the land use plan as Public\nService Centers.\n(I) Mixed-Use District (MU). The Mixed-Use District is established to provide opportunities for compatible and sustainable\nre-development where underutilized commercial properties already exist. The existing auto-oriented street, lot and building\ndesigns can create uncomfortable pedestrian environments; however, with careful site planning these areas will allow a\ngreater number of residents to walk or bike to businesses and services with an interconnected network of streets and\nsidewalks. Dominant uses in this district are residential, retail and office. The Mixed-Use District is expected to serve\nColumbus residents as well as persons who travel from the surrounding communities. The development pattern in this\ndistrict acknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access provided to ensure safety for the motoring public.\nDevelopment standards in the Mixed-Use District ensure the creation of a pleasant auto-oriented environment while enabling\na compatible transition to uses in adjacent districts. This District is available for rezoning only with the consent of the\nproperty owner(s).\n(J) Traditional Neighborhood Development District (TND). The Traditional Neighborhood Development District provides\nfor the development of new neighborhoods and the revitalization or extension of existing neighborhoods. These\nneighborhoods are structured upon a fine network of interconnecting pedestrian oriented streets and other public spaces.\nTraditional Neighborhood Developments (TND's) provide a mixture of housing types and prices, prominently sited civic or\ncommunity building(s), stores/offices/workplaces, and churches to provide a balanced mix of activities. A Traditional\nNeighborhood Development (TND) has a recognizable center and clearly defined edges; optimum size is a quarter mile from\ncenter to edge. A TND is urban in form, is typically an extension of the existing developed area of the Town, and has an\noverall residential density of up to 16 dwelling units per acre. TND districts should have a significant portion of land\ndedicated to open spaces. This District is available for rezoning only with the consent of the property owner(s).\n(Ord., Art.

VII, \u00a7 703, passed - -)\n\u00a7 154.064 STATEMENT OF DISTRICT INTENTS.\n(A) Residential Estate (RE). The Residential Estate (RE) district as herein established is intended to be the most\nrestrictive of the residential districts. The intent is to provide for an environment of low density one-family detached dwelling\nunits along with other residentially related facilities which serve the residents in this district. These areas will often be\ndependent on private, individual septic tanks and wells; therefore, requiring larger lot sizes to sustain individual water\nsupplies and sewage disposal facilities. These areas may have soil and topographic constraints that preclude intense urban\ndevelopment.\n(B) Low Density Residential District (R-1). The Low Density Residential District is primarily intended to provide locations\nfor low-density residential development in outlying rural areas that are not likely to have public water and sewer services\navailable and may have soil and topographic constraints that preclude intense urban development. These areas often will be\ndependent upon private, individual septic tanks and wells; therefore, requiring larger lot sizes to sustain individual water\nsupplies and sewage disposal facilities. This district also provides for recreational, community service and institutional uses\nthat will complement the residential development. This district will be applied within those areas designated on the land use\nplan as Low Density Residential areas.\n(C) Community Residential-Medium Density Residential District (R-2). The Community Residential-Medium Density\nResidential District is primarily intended to provide locations for residential uses and supporting recreational and community\nservice uses in area where generally both Town public water and sewer services are available. These are the more urban\nareas of the community and will be primarily within the town limits and in close proximity to public and private services and\nthe town's central business district. This district is intended to protect existing single-family homes and subdivisions within\nthe town. This district will be applied within those areas designated on the land use plan as Medium Density Residential\n\nNEW PAGE 17\nareas.\n(D) Central Business District (CBD). The Central Business District is intended to be the primary retail and service center,\nand focal point of the community. This district provides for the concentration of commercial uses, professional services,\nfinancial services, governmental functions, and related services. The CBD area currently has access to both public water\nand sewer services, and dimensional requirements for this district are intended to encourage concentrated commercial\ndevelopment and to promote convenient pedestrian shopping in pleasant surroundings. This district will be applied to the\nexisting commercial center and to adjacent properties that with commercial development will complement and enhance the\nCBD as the retail and service center of the community. This district will be applied within the commercial areas as\ndesignated on the land use plan.\n(E) I-26 Corridor Overlay Area (I-26 COA). The I-26 Corridor Overlay boundaries are from the concrete right-of-way\nmonument set at the east intersection of Highway 26 and Highway 108, at the corner of Spartan Petroleum Company and\nrunning least 500 feet on Highway 108 to a line parallel to the right-of-way of 1-26, and also at the concrete right-of-way\nmonument set at the west intersection of Highway 26 and Highway 108, at the corner of the McFarland tract and running\nwest 500 feet on Highway 108 to a line parallel to the right of way of 1-26. This overlay area has the same requirements as\nin\nthe Highway Commercial District, but also has additional requirements for tall signs and electronic gaming operations.\n(F) Highway Commercial District (HC). The Highway Commercial District is intended to provide suitable locations for\nclustered groupings of highway commercial development in convenient locations along N.C. 108, to serve local residences\nand persons traveling by automobile. Urban sprawl, congestions, and strip commercial development will be discouraged by\npromoting good design, clustered developments, and by guiding commercial development primarily to areas that have water\nand sewer services and suitable soil and topographic conditions. These areas should provide sufficient space for ample off-\nstreet parking and well designed entrances and exits to avoid traffic congestion and safety hazards. Highway commercial\nareas are intended for commercial enterprises and services that require greater land area and lot dimensions than\nestablishments locating in the Central Business District. This district will be applied within the commercial areas as\ndesignated on the land use plan.\n(G) Industrial District (IND). The Industrial District is intended to provide sites for manufacturing and industrial uses,\nstorage and warehousing, wholesale trade, and other major employment centers. These locations should currently have\nboth public water and sewer services available or be expected to have these services in the future, and have suitable soil\nand topographic conditions to sustain the development. This district includes existing manufacturing areas, and sites suited\nfor future or further industrial development, and area designated on the land use plan as Industrial Centers. Only those\nmanufacturing uses will be allowed which have meet all local, state, and federal environmental standards, and do not involve\nobnoxious noise, vibrations, smoke, gas, fumes, odor, dust, fire hazards or other objectionable conditions which would be\ndetrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the community.\n(H) Public Service District (PS). The Public Service District is intended to be an area containing a concentration of public\nservice activities such as recreation areas, educational facilities, hospitals, emergency services and the like. This district\nis\nintended to preserve existing public service centers and will apply to those areas designated on the land use plan as Public\nService Centers.\n(I) Mixed-Use District (MU). The Mixed-Use District is established to provide opportunities for compatible and sustainable\nre-development where underutilized commercial properties already exist. The existing auto-oriented street, lot and building\ndesigns can create uncomfortable pedestrian environments; however, with careful site planning these areas will allow a\ngreater number of residents to walk or bike to businesses and services with an interconnected network of streets and\nsidewalks. Dominant uses in this district are residential, retail and office. The Mixed-Use District is expected to serve\nColumbus residents as well as persons who travel from the surrounding communities. The development pattern in this\ndistrict acknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access provided to ensure safety for the motoring public.\nDevelopment standards in the Mixed-Use District ensure the creation of a pleasant auto-oriented environment while enabling\na compatible transition to uses in adjacent districts. This District is available for rezoning only with the consent of the\nproperty owner(s).\n(J) Traditional Neighborhood Development District (TND). The Traditional Neighborhood Development District provides\nfor the development of new neighborhoods and the revitalization or extension of existing neighborhoods. These\nneighborhoods are structured upon a fine network of interconnecting pedestrian oriented streets and other public spaces.\nTraditional Neighborhood Developments (TND's) provide a mixture of housing types and prices, prominently sited civic or\ncommunity building(s), stores/offices/workplaces, and churches to provide a balanced mix of activities. A Traditional\nNeighborhood Development (TND) has a recognizable center and clearly defined edges; optimum size is a quarter mile from\ncenter to edge. A TND is urban in form, is typically an extension of the existing developed area of the Town, and has an\noverall residential density of up to 16 dwelling units per acre. TND districts should have a significant portion of land\ndedicated to open spaces. This District is available for rezoning only with the consent of the property owner(s).\n(Ord., Art.

The Highway Commercial District is intended to provide suitable locations for\nclustered groupings of highway commercial development in convenient locations along N.C. 108, to serve local residences\nand persons traveling by automobile. Urban sprawl, congestions, and strip commercial development will be discouraged by\npromoting good design, clustered developments, and by guiding commercial development primarily to areas that have water\nand sewer services and suitable soil and topographic conditions. These areas should provide sufficient space for ample off-\nstreet parking and well designed entrances and exits to avoid traffic congestion and safety hazards. Highway commercial\nareas are intended for commercial enterprises and services that require greater land area and lot dimensions than\nestablishments locating in the Central Business District. This district will be applied within the commercial areas as\ndesignated on the land use plan.\n(G) Industrial District (IND). The Industrial District is intended to provide sites for manufacturing and industrial uses,\nstorage and warehousing, wholesale trade, and other major employment centers. These locations should currently have\nboth public water and sewer services available or be expected to have these services in the future, and have suitable soil\nand topographic conditions to sustain the development. This district includes existing manufacturing areas, and sites suited\nfor future or further industrial development, and area designated on the land use plan as Industrial Centers. Only those\nmanufacturing uses will be allowed which have meet all local, state, and federal environmental standards, and do not involve\nobnoxious noise, vibrations, smoke, gas, fumes, odor, dust, fire hazards or other objectionable conditions which would be\ndetrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the community.\n(H) Public Service District (PS). The Public Service District is intended to be an area containing a concentration of public\nservice activities such as recreation areas, educational facilities, hospitals, emergency services and the like. This district\nis\nintended to preserve existing public service centers and will apply to those areas designated on the land use plan as Public\nService Centers.\n(I) Mixed-Use District (MU). The Mixed-Use District is established to provide opportunities for compatible and sustainable\nre-development where underutilized commercial properties already exist. The existing auto-oriented street, lot and building\ndesigns can create uncomfortable pedestrian environments; however, with careful site planning these areas will allow a\ngreater number of residents to walk or bike to businesses and services with an interconnected network of streets and\nsidewalks. Dominant uses in this district are residential, retail and office. The Mixed-Use District is expected to serve\nColumbus residents as well as persons who travel from the surrounding communities. The development pattern in this\ndistrict acknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access provided to ensure safety for the motoring public.\nDevelopment standards in the Mixed-Use District ensure the creation of a pleasant auto-oriented environment while enabling\na compatible transition to uses in adjacent districts. This District is available for rezoning only with the consent of the\nproperty owner(s).\n(J) Traditional Neighborhood Development District (TND). The Traditional Neighborhood Development District provides\nfor the development of new neighborhoods and the revitalization or extension of existing neighborhoods. These\nneighborhoods are structured upon a fine network of interconnecting pedestrian oriented streets and other public spaces.\nTraditional Neighborhood Developments (TND's) provide a mixture of housing types and prices, prominently sited civic or\ncommunity building(s), stores/offices/workplaces, and churches to provide a balanced mix of activities. A Traditional\nNeighborhood Development (TND) has a recognizable center and clearly defined edges; optimum size is a quarter mile from\ncenter to edge. A TND is urban in form, is typically an extension of the existing developed area of the Town, and has an\noverall residential density of up to 16 dwelling units per acre. TND districts should have a significant portion of land\ndedicated to open spaces. This District is available for rezoning only with the consent of the property owner(s).\n(Ord., Art.

clearly defined edges; optimum size is a quarter mile from center to edge. A TND is\nurban in form, is typically an extension of the existing developed area of the Town, and has an overall residential density of\nup to 16 dwelling units per acre. TND districts should have a significant portion of land dedicated to open spaces. This\nDistrict is available for rezoning only with the consent of the property owner(s).\n(2) Residential density limits.\n(a) Single-family detached: seven units/acre;\n(b) Single-family attached: 12 units/acre; and\n(c) Multifamily development standards.\n1. The multi-family development shall not exceed a total of seventy-two (72) dwelling units.\n2. The maximum permitted density for the multi-family development shall be 14 1/2 units per acre.\n3. The permitted building and lot types for the multi-family development in a single-family area shall be the\ndetached house and the attached house building and lot types.\n4. All parking for the multi-family development shall be located behind the building. The parking area shall be\nscreened from adjacent properties and from the street with a screening device.\n5. The buildings in the multi-family development shall be architecturally compatible with single family structures on\nthe street on which the multi-family building is proposed. Elements that shall be incorporated into the design of the multi-\nfamily building to ensure architectural compatibility are:\na. The multi-family building shall be constructed of building materials similar to those used on single family\nstructures on the street.\nb. The roof pitch of the multi-family building shall be the same as that of the single-family structures on the street.\nC. The fenestration of the multi-family building by location and size of windows and doors shall be similar to that of\nthe single-family homes on the street.\nd. Color renderings of the proposed building must be submitted with the application to ensure architectural\ncompatibility.\n6. No multi-family building shall be located closer than 48 feet to an existing multi-family building or development.\nThe distance shall be measured along centerline of streets from the edge of the property proposed for development to the\nclosest edge of the property on which the existing multi-family building or development is located.\n(3) TND general requirements.\n(a) Along existing streets, new buildings shall respect the general spacing of structures, building mass and scale, and\nstreet frontage relationships of existing buildings.\n1. New buildings which adhere to the scale, massing, volume, spacing, and setback of existing buildings along\nfronting streets exhibit demonstrable compatibility.\n2. New buildings which exceed the scale and volume of existing buildings may demonstrate compatibility by varying\nthe massing of buildings to reduce perceived scale and volume.\n(b)\nOn new streets, allowable building and lot types will establish the development pattern.\n(c) A master plan in compliance with Traditional Neighborhood Development standards shall be provided with the\nzoning permit submittal for a general district TND. The master plan shall include a topographic survey and shall show the\nlocation and hierarchy of streets and public open spaces, location of residential, commercial, and civic building lots, street\nsections and/or plans, a master sign program, an outline of any additional regulatory intentions, phasing, and any other\ninformation, including building elevations, which may be required to evaluate the interior pedestrian environment and\nconditions at project edges.\n(d) Minimum Development Size: eight acres.\n(e) Maximum Development Size: none.\n(4) TND design requirements.\n(a) Neighborhood form.\n1. The area of the TND shall be divided into blocks, streets, lots, and open space.\n2. Similar land uses shall generally front across each street. Dissimilar categories shall generally abut at rear lot\nlines. Corner lots which front on streets of dissimilar use shall generally observe the setback established on each fronting\nstreet.\n(b) Streets, alleys and blocks.\n1. Public streets shall provide access to all tracts and lots.\n\nNEW PAGE 22\n2. Streets and alleys shall, wherever practicable, terminate at other streets within the neighborhood and connect to\nexisting and projected streets outside the development.\n3. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 250 feet in length, must be accessed from a street providing internal or external\nconnectivity, shall be permanently terminated by a vehicular turnaround, and are listed only where topography makes a\nstreet connection impracticable\n4. Vehicular turnarounds of various configurations are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately\nprovided.\n5. Pedestrian connections should be provided as extensions of terminating streets where not precluded by\ntopography or other physical constraints.\n6. The average perimeter of all blocks within the TND should not exceed 1,350 feet. No block face should have a\nlength greater than 500 feet without a dedicated alley or pathway providing through access.\n7. A continuous network of rear alleys shall provide vehicular access to lots 49 feet or less in width.\n8. Utilities may run along alleys provided that a permanent public access and utility easement is recorded for the full\nlength of alley being used for utilities or public services such as garbage collection.\n9. TND streets shall be organized according to a hierarchy based on function, size, capacity, and design speed;\nstreets and rights-of-way are therefore expected to differ in dimension. The proposed hierarchy of streets shall be indicated\non the submitted site plan. Each street type in a TND shall be separately detailed. An array of elements that are combined to\nmeet the purposes of TND neighborhood streets: building placement line, optional utility allocation, sidewalk, planting strip,\ncurb and gutter, optional parallel parking, and travel lane(s). Alternative methods of assembling the required street elements\nwill be considered to allow neighborhood street designs that are most appropriate to setting and use.\n10. To prevent the buildup of vehicular speed, disperse traffic flow, and create a sense of visual enclosure, long\nuninterrupted segments of straight streets should be avoided. Methods to achieve this interruption include:\n(i) A street can be interrupted by intersections designed to calm the speed and disperse the flow of traffic and\nterminate vistas with a significant feature (building, park, natural feature);\n(ii) A street can be terminated with a public monument, specifically designed building facade, or a gateway to the\nensuing space;\n(iii) Perceived street length can be reduced by a noticeable street curve where the outside edge of the curve is\nbounded by a building or other vertical elements that hug the curve and deflect the view; and\n(iv) Other traffic calming configurations are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately provided.\n(c) Buildings and lots.\n1. All lots shall share a frontage line with a street or square; lots fronting a square shall be provided rear alley\naccess.\n2. Consistent build-to lines shall be established along all streets and public space frontages; build-to lines determine\nthe width and ratio of enclosure for each public street or space. A minimum percentage build-out at the build-to line shall be\nestablished on the plan along all streets and public square frontages.\n3. Large-scale, single use facilities (conference spaces, theaters, athletic facilities, etc.) shall generally occur behind\nor above smaller scale uses of pedestrian orientation.\n(d) Open space. The provision and design of open space shall comply with the requirements set forth herein.\n(e) Parking, landscaping and buffers shall comply with the requirements set forth herein.\nCELL (1, 1):
