Slope\ngradients should also be shown.\n7. Top elevation of all storm and sanitary sewer manholes and other appurtenances.\n8. Lawn and earth grades can be shown by proposed contours and by spot elevations\nwhere necessary.\n9. The proposed location of stockpiled topsoil for future use in landscaped areas. To\navoid root compaction, the stockpile should be located outside root zones of the\nsignificant vegetation to be preserved.\n10. The storage locations of construction materials outside the root zones of significant\nvegetation to be preserved to avoid root compaction.\n11.
