SOLAR ENERGY CONVERSION\nA.\nPURPOSE\n1. The purpose of these standards is to facilitate the construction, installation, and operation\nof solar energy conversion uses in Edgecombe County in a manner that promotes economic\ndevelopment and ensures the protection of health, safety, and welfare while also avoiding\nadverse impacts to important areas such as agricultural lands, endangered species habitats,\nconservation lands, and other sensitive lands.\n2. It is the intent of these standards to encourage the development of solar energy conversion\nuses that reduce reliance on foreign and out-of-state energy resources, bolster local\neconomic development and job creation, support the diversification of the State's energy\nportfolio, strengthen energy and grid security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce\nlocal air and water pollution, and aid North Carolina in meeting its Renewable Portfolio\nStandard.\n3.\nThese standards are not intended to abridge safety, health, or environmental requirements\ncontained in other applicable codes, standards, or ordinances. These provisions shall not\nnullify any local, State, or federal laws.\nB.\nAPPLICABILITY\n1. The standards in this section apply to the construction of any new level 2 or level 3 solar\nenergy conversion use established after November 1, 2021.\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage\n271\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n\nNEW PAGE 272\nARTICLE 4.
