The standards are further intended to:\n1. Provide for adequate off-street parking, off-street loading, and safe movement of vehicles into, out\nof, and through parking areas;\n2. Allow for flexibility to accommodate alternative solutions to off-street parking and loading needs,\nwhere such flexibility is consistent with the City's adopted policy guidance;\n3.\nReduce the aesthetic impact of surface parking lots in gateway corridors, downtown, and mixed-use\nareas through standards addressing on-site parking lot locations;\n4.\nAvoid excessive paved surface areas and the resulting problems associated with stormwater runoff\nand urban heat islands; and\n5. Protecting compatibility between adjacent uses of land and historic resources.\nB. APPLICABILITY\nThe standards in this section shall apply to all development in the City's jurisdiction, unless exempted in\naccordance with Section 5.1.C, Exemptions.\n1. Generally\nWhenever a building is constructed, an open-air use of land is conducted, or a principal or accessory\nuse is established, the development shall meet the requirements of this section.\n2. Additions and Expansions\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\nWhenever an existing building, open air use of land, or principal or accessory use is enlarged or\nincreased in capacity after November 1, 2019, the development shall comply with the requirements in\nSection 9.6, Nonconforming Site Features.\n3. Changes in Use\na. If the principal use changes, then the new principal use shall meet the requirements of this section,\nexcept that if the use change results in an increase of less than five percent in the required number\nof parking spaces, or less than two additional parking spaces, no additional parking spaces are\nrequired.\nb.

CENTRAL BUSINESS (CBD) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Central Business (CBD) District is established and intended to\nserve as the commercial and cultural heart of the City's jurisdiction.\nDevelopment in the CBD includes the highest average densities and\nbuilding heights in the City. Development is configured for an urban\ncontext, with buildings built to the street, ground floor uses that\nsupport pedestrian travel, and numerous civic gathering spaces and\ncultural attractions. The district is intended to accommodate a well-\nbalanced mix of uses (e.g., office, retail, service, high-density\nresidential, and entertainment), promote a strong pedestrian-\noriented environment (with a reduced need for off-street parking),\nand preserve and protect the downtown's historical and architectural\nscale and character. The district requires urban-style open space\n(greens, seating areas, plazas, pocket parks, roof gardens, etc.) to\nbe included as a part of new development. Low density residential\nlike single-family detached homes and most forms of industrial\ndevelopment are prohibited in the CBD district. New commercial,\nmixed-use, and multi-family developments in the district are subject\nto the design standards in CHAPTER 5. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.\nB.

DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Central Business (CBD) District is established and intended to\nserve as the commercial and cultural heart of the City's jurisdiction.\nDevelopment in the CBD includes the highest average densities and\nbuilding heights in the City. Development is configured for an urban\ncontext, with buildings built to the street, ground floor uses that\nsupport pedestrian travel, and numerous civic gathering spaces and\ncultural attractions. The district is intended to accommodate a well-\nbalanced mix of uses (e.g., office, retail, service, high-density\nresidential, and entertainment), promote a strong pedestrian-\noriented environment (with a reduced need for off-street parking),\nand preserve and protect the downtown's historical and architectural\nscale and character. The district requires urban-style open space\n(greens, seating areas, plazas, pocket parks, roof gardens, etc.) to\nbe included as a part of new development. Low density residential\nlike single-family detached homes and most forms of industrial\ndevelopment are prohibited in the CBD district. New commercial,\nmixed-use, and multi-family developments in the district are subject\nto the design standards in CHAPTER 5. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.\nB.
