Exemptions. Uses in the C-1 district are exempt from the minimum parking requirements of this Section.\n2. Tree Preservation.\na. The minimum number of parking spaces required shall be adjusted by the Administrator when it has\nbeen determined that the reductions are necessary to preserve a healthy tree or trees by establishing\na Tree Save Area (with a 12-inch or greater diameter at breast height) from being damaged or\nremoved, and where the site plan provides for the retention of said tree or trees. Up to 25% or five\n(5) spaces (whichever is greater) of the required parking may be reduced in this fashion.\nb.\nMinimum Dimensional Requirements of Tree Save Area: The extent of the Critical Root Zone (CRZ)\nof the tree or trees at the outer edges of the tree save area shall constitute the limits of construction\nfor the purposes of this sub-section. The CRZ is the circular area of ground surrounding a tree\nextending from the center of tree to the greater of:\n1.5 feet per caliper inch DBH (diameter at breast height) of the tree,\nThe dripline (furthest extent of tree canopy) of the tree, or\n3. 6 feet.\nC. Available Parking Reduction: The actual demand for parking on a particular site may vary based\non the development's context. In these cases, the Administrator may determine that the context\nis\nappropriate to reduce parking requirements. Examples of such cases are:\nA mixed-use development with uses that have peak occupancy at different\ntimes such that one parking space can be demonstrated to handle some parking\nneeds of multiple uses.\nCounting on-street parking spaces directly adjacent to the establishment.\nShared parking in a nearby lot that has empty spaces.\nA commitment to providing valet parking services.\nDemonstrating a likelihood that all required parking may not be needed and\ndeferring construction on a percentage of the parking spaces until after the\ndevelopment is complete, when it becomes clear whether or not the additional\ndeferred spaces are needed.\nThe following are the criteria the Administrator must use when determining the applicable parking\nreductions.\nCITY OF DUNN, NC\n6-10\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nADOPTION DATE: 04.11.2023\n\nNEW PAGE 99\nARTICLE 6\nGENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nE.\nSATELLITE & COMBINATION PARKING\nIf the off-street parking spaces required by this Section cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on\nwhich the principal use is located, such space may be provided on any land within 500 feet.
