It is the community's commercial,\ncivic, cultural, and transportation hub. The Village Center should include places for\npublic gatherings, civic and cultural events, and public art. Infill development must\ncomplement the traditional built environment and encourage small, independent\nretailers. New development in the Village Center Planning Area should be multi-story,\nmulti-use, and transit supportive.\nB.
