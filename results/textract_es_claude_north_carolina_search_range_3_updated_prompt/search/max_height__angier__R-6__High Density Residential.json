Overlay districts.\nOverlay zoning districts are established to provide land use regulations in addition to those created by the\nbase zoning districts herein. These overlay districts are implemented when necessary due to special circumstances.\nThere are two overlay zoning districts in Angier that provide for the protection of special environmental features of\nthe town, as follows:\n3.6.1 Watershed Protection Overlay (WP-O). The following regulations were adopted April 2005 in\naccordance with the state model ordinance:\n3.6.1.1 Intent.\nA.\nThe purpose of the Watershed Protection Overlay District is to prevent significant future water quality\ndeterioration in existing or potential future drinking water reservoirs and rivers that receive\nstormwater runoff form land within the Town of Angier. Protection of all water supplies within the\nstate, in accordance with minimum standards, was mandated by the Water Supply Watershed\nProtection Act passed by the General Assembly in 1989. The quality of water in drinking water\nreservoirs and rivers can be affected by human activities including farming, obstruction of highways\nand streets, subdivision development, industrial development, and other land disturbing activities.\nTypes of water pollutants resulting from these activities include sediment, bacterial contamination,\nheavy metals, synthetic organic compounds, and low-level radioactivity.\nB.\nThe intent of the Watershed Protection Overlay District is to apply a set of regulations involving land\nuse and, in some cases, structural Best Management Practices (BMP's) that protect the watersheds by\nreducing the pollution from future development that enters the drinking water supplies. Land use\nmanagement practices involve minimum lot sizes, maximum allowed density, and built-upon area\nrestrictions, since built-upon areas such as streets, rooftops, and driveways are a major source of\npollution. Structural Best Management Practices allow for more intensive land uses by providing for\ntemporary detention of stormwater runoff so that pollutants may settle.\nC.\nThe Watershed Protection Overlay District as hereby established overlay other zoning districts\nestablished in this ordinance. The new use of any land or new structure within the Watershed\nProtection Overlay District shall comply with the use regulations applicable to the underlying zoning\ndistrict as well as the requirements of the Watershed Protection Overlay District.\nCreated: 2023-08-11 10:27:33 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 11, Update 1)\nPage 21 of 221\nCELL (1, 1): \nWP-O\nCELL (1, 2): \nWatershed Protection Overlay\nCELL (2, 1): \nFDP-O\nCELL (2, 2): \nFlood Damage Prevention Overlay\n", "page_number": 19, "page_range": [19, 20, 21], "highlight": ["<em>Dimensional</em> <em>requirements</em>.\n3.4.1 General provisions.\nA.", "(<em>feet</em>)\nCELL (1, 6): \nSide\nSetback\n(<em>feet</em>)\nCELL (1, 7): \nRear\nSetback\n(<em>feet</em>)\nCELL (1, 8): \n<em>Maximum</em>\n<em>Height</em>", "<em>6</em>\nCELL (6, 2): \n6,000\nCELL (6, 3): \n50\nCELL (6, 4): \n15 (alley\nloaded)\n20 (front\nloaded)\nCELL (6, 5):", "All buildings that exceed 35 <em>feet</em> in <em>height</em> shall be equipped with an automatic sprinkler system\ninstalled", "<em>6</em>\nCELL (5, 2): \nConditional Zoning <em>High</em> <em>Density</em> <em>Residential</em>\nCELL (6, 1): \nCZ O&I\nCELL (6, 2): \nConditional"], "score": 15.626527, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"High Density Residential\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R-6\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R6\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R-6\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [18, 19, 20, 21, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51]}
