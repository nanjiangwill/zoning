PLANNED DEVELOPMENT (PD) DISTRICTS\nA. PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Planned Development (PD) and the Planned Development Downtown (PDD) districts are established\nand intended to encourage innovative land planning and site design concepts that support a high quality\nof life and achieve a high quality of development, environmental sensitivity, energy efficiency, and other\nCity goals and objectives by:\n1. Reducing or diminishing the inflexibility or uniform design that sometimes results from strict application\nof zoning and development standards designed primarily for individual lots;\n2.\nAllowing greater freedom in selecting the means of providing access, open space, and design\namenities;\n3. Allowing greater freedom in providing a well-integrated mix of residential and non-residential land\nuses in the same development, including a mix of housing types, lot sizes, and densities;\n4. Creating a system of incentives for redevelopment and infill in order to revitalize the downtown area;\n5. Promoting a vibrant public realm in the lands around downtown by placing increased emphasis on\nactive ground floor uses, pedestrian-oriented building fa\u00e7ade design, intensive use of sidewalks, and\nestablishment of public gathering areas;\n6.\nProviding for efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets and thereby\nlowering development and housing costs; and\n7.\nPromoting quality design and environmentally sensitive development that respects surrounding\nestablished land use character and respects and takes advantage of a site's natural and man-made\nfeatures, such as trees, estuaries, shorelines, special flood hazard area, and historic features.\nB. GENERAL STANDARDS FOR ALL PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS\n1. How Established\nA planned development is established in a manner similar to the establishment of a conditional zoning\ndistrict in accordance with the procedures and requirements in Section 2.4.M, Planned Development,\nand Section 3.19, Planned Development (PD) Districts.\n2. Districts Distinguished\n(AMENDED 12.3.19 UDOTA-01-20)\nThis Ordinance establishes the following two types of planned development district:\na. The basic Planned Development (PD) district, which is available to all lands in the City's jurisdiction\noutside of the area eligible for the Planned Development Downtown (PDD) district; and\nb. The Planned Development Downtown (PDD) district, which is available solely to the lands around\nthe downtown area located within the PDD-Eligibility Boundary depicted on the Official Zoning\nMap. Application for the rezoning of lands within the PDD-Eligibility Boundary to the PDD district\nshall be reviewed in accordance with the standards in this section. Applications to rezone land\nwithin the PDD-Eligibility Boundary to a zoning district other than the PDD district are hereby\ndeclared inconsistent with the City's adopted policy guidance and this Ordinance, and may not be\napproved by the City Council.\nC.\nIn cases where a portion of a lot is within the PDD eligibility boundary, the entire lot shall be\nconsidered to be within the PDD eligibility boundary.\n3. Master Plan Required\nAll development configured as a PD or PDD shall be subject to a master plan submitted and approved\nas part of the application to establish the district. The master plan shall:\na. Include a statement of planning objectives for the district;\nb. Describe the specific ways in which any modifications to the generally applicable standards in this\nOrdinance will result in a development of higher quality than would have otherwise resulted if the\ndevelopment was established without any proposed modifications to the standards in this\nOrdinance;\nC.\nIdentify the general location of individual development areas, identified by land use(s) and/or\ndevelopment density or intensity;\nd.\nDepict the general configuration and relationship of the principal elements of the proposed\ndevelopment, including general building types;\ne.\nIdentify for the entire district and each development area the acreage, types and mix of land uses,\nnumber of residential units (by use type), non-residential floor area (by use type), residential\ndensity, and non-residential intensity (floor area);\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \n3-54\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n\nNEW PAGE 177\nCHAPTER 3 ZONING DISTRICTS\nSection 3.19 Planned Development (PD) Districts\nf.
