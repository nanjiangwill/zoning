The performance standards for\nthis zone are less restrictive than those in the M-1 district.\n(2)\nThere is also established a watershed light industrial (WM-3) zoning district. The\npurpose of this district is to allow areas within the University Lake Watershed that have been zoned\nM-1 prior to the effective date of this subdivision to continue to be used and developed for light\nindustrial and related purposes, subject to certain restrictions designed to protect the watershed.\nConsistent with the purpose of this zone, this district shall be confined to that area zoned M-1 on the\neffective date of this subsection (12/7/1983); this area shall not be expanded and no new WM-3 areas\nshall be designated. For the purposes of this section, changes to make WM-3 zoning uniform on lots\nthat were depicted as entirely within the M-1 zoning at the time of its establishment, but that were\nlater depicted as being bisected by the zoning boundary, will not be considered an expansion of the\ndistrict or the creation of new WM-3 areas. (AMENDED 12/7/83; 06/27/17)\n(3)\nThere is also established a Planned Industrial Development (PID) zoning district. The\npurpose of this district is to provide for the possibility of well-planned and tightly controlled industrial\ndevelopment in areas that are suitable for such development but that are not deemed appropriate for\nM-1 or M-2 zoning because of the less restricted types of development that may occur in such zones.\n(AMENDED 6/22/82; 12/7/83)\n(a)\nNo area less than twenty contiguous acres may be zoned as a Planned\nIndustrial Development district, and then only upon a request submitted by or\non behalf of the owner or owners of all the property intended to be covered by\nsuch zone.\nPage #7\n\nNEW PAGE 8\nArt. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\n(b)\nAs indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses (Section 15-146) a planned\nindustrial development (use classification 30.000) is the only permissible use\nin a PID zone.\n(c)\nSubject to subdivision (2) of this subsection, and consistent with the\nrestrictions contained in the definition of a planned industrial development\n[see Subdivision 15-15], land within a PID zone may be used in a manner that\nwould be permissible if the land were zoned M-1, except that (i) the only\npermissible uses are those described in the 2.130 and 4.100 classifications and\n(ii) the performance standards (Article XI, Part I) applicable to 4.100 uses in\nbusiness zones shall govern uses in a planned industrial development.\nSection 15-138 Public Facilities District Established.\nThere is hereby created a Public Facilities (P-F) zoning district. Within this district, those\nuses indicated as permissible in the Table of Permissible Uses may be developed, but only if such\ndevelopments are owned and operated by the United States, the State of North Carolina, Orange\nCounty, the Town of Carrboro, or any agency, department, or subdivision of the foregoing\ngovernments.\nSection 15-139 Planned Unit Development District Established.\n(1)\nThere are hereby established sixty different Planned Unit Development (PUD) zoning\ndistricts as described in this section. Each PUD zoning district is designed to combine the\ncharacteristics of at least two and possibly three zoning districts. (AMENDED 2/24/87)\n(a)\nOne element of each PUD district shall be the residential element. Here there\nare six possibilities, each one corresponding to one of the following residential\ndistricts identified in Section 15-135: R-20, R-15, R-10, R-7.5, R-3, or\nR- S.I.R. Within that portion of the PUD zone that is developed for purposes\npermissible in a residential district, all development must be in accordance\nwith the regulations applicable to the residential zoning district to which the\nparticular PUD zoning district corresponds.\n(b)\nA second element of each PUD district shall be the commercial element. Here\nthere are five possibilities, each one corresponding to either the B-1(g), B-2,\nB-3, O, or O/A zoning districts established by Section 15-136. Within that\nportion of a PUD district that is developed for purposes permissible in a\ncommercial district, all development must be in accordance with the\nregulations applicable to the commercial district to which the PUD district\ncorresponds. (AMENDED 2/04/97)\n(c)\nA manufacturing/processing element may be a third element of any PUD\ndistrict. Here there are two alternatives. The first is that uses permitted within\nthe M-1 district would be permitted within the PUD district. The second\nalternative is that uses permitted only within the M-1 or M-2 zoning districts\nPage #8\n\nNEW PAGE 9\nArt. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\nwould not be permitted. If an M-1 element is included, then within that portion\nof the PUD district that is developed for purposes permissible in an M-1\ndistrict, all development must be in accordance with the regulations applicable\nto the M-1 district.\nThe sixty different PUD zoning districts are derived from the various combinations of possible\nalternatives within each of the three elements -- residential, commercial, manufacturing/processing.\nFor example, there is an R-20/B-1(g)/M-1 district, an R-20/B-2/M-1 district, an R-20/B-2 district, an\nR-15/B-1(g)/M-1 district, etc. (AMENDED 2/04/97)\n(2)\nNo area of less than twenty-five contiguous acres may be zoned as a Planned Unit\nDevelopment district, and then only upon the request of the owner or owners of all of the property\nintended to be covered by such zone.\n(3)\nAs indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses (Section 15-146), a planned unit\ndevelopment (use classification 28.000) is the only permissible use in a PUD zone, and planned unit\ndevelopments are permissible only in such zones.\nSection 15-140 Residential High Density and Commercial Overlay District. (AMENDED\n2/4/86)\nThere is hereby created a Residential High Density and Commercial Overlay (RHDC) zoning\ndistrict. The purpose of this district is to provide for the redevelopment of deteriorating commercial\nand manufacturing areas in a manner that is consistent with commercial development goals of the\ntown, namely, for compact, compressed town center growth, for a substantial increase in residential\nopportunities near the town center, and for mixed use development in the downtown. Property that\nlies within this overlay district may be developed in accordance with either the regulations applicable\nto the underlying district or the following regulations:\n(1)\nTo take advantage of provisions applicable to the RHDC overlay district, lots must\ncontain at least one and one half acres of contiguous land under single ownership.\n(2)\nUses permissible shall be those permissible within either the R-2 district or the B-1(c)\ndistrict, or both, except that subdivisions other than architecturally integrated\nsubdivisions shall not be allowed.\n(3)\nResidential density shall be determined as if the property were zoned R-2.\n(4)\nTwenty percent of the lot area shall remain as usable open space (see Section 15-198),\nexcept that where the development seeks to provide interior open space or indoor hard\ncourt, pool, or other active recreation facilities in excess of the basic requirement set\nforth in Article XIII, the permit-issuing authority may reduce the open space\nrequirement to reflect the quality and amount of such facilities. The developer may\nsubstitute grassed areas, lawn, gardens, and shrubbed space for wooded space in\nmeeting the requirements of 15-198(b)(3).\nPage #9\n", "page_number": 7, "page_range": [7, 8, 9],
