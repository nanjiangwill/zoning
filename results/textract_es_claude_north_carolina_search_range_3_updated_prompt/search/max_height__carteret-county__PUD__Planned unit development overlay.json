For residential uses, this should include the number of units and an outline of the area where the structures will be\nlocated. For non-residential uses, this should include the approximate square footage of all structures and an outline of the area where the structures\nwill be located; and\n.05 Traffic, parking, and circulation plans, showing the proposed locations and arrangement of parking spaces and access points to adjacent streets.\n3202.2. Additional requirements. It may be necessary to request additional information in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding\narea. Therefore, the planning commission and/or board of county commissioners may request additional information as they deem necessary. This information may\ninclude, but is not limited to, the items listed below:\n.01 Proposed screening, including walls, fences, or planting areas as well as treatment of any existing natural features;\n.02 Delineation of areas within the regulatory flood zone, as shown on the official FEMA flood zone maps for Carteret County;\n.03 Existing and proposed topography at 2-foot contour intervals or less;\n.04 Generalized information on the number, height, size, and the location of structures;\n.05 Proposed number and location of signs;\n.06 Proposed phasing, if any, and approximate completion time of the project.\nThe application for [the establishment of] a conditional zoning district must contain information and/or site plans which indicate all of the principal and accessory\nuses which are proposed to be developed on the site. Subsequent to the approval of a conditional zoning district, only those principal and accessory uses indicated on\nthe approved plan may be constructed on the site. Any substantial modifications to an approved plan, including any changes in the permitted principal or accessory\nuses, must comply with the provisions of section 3202.5.\n(Res. 6-21-21)\n3202.3. Review and approval. In considering an application for the establishment of a conditional zoning district, the board of county commissioners may attach\nreasonable and appropriate conditions to the location, nature, and extent of the proposed use. Any conditions should relate to the relationship of the proposed use to\nsurrounding property, proposed support facilities such as parking, screening and buffer areas, the timing of development and other matters that the board may find\nappropriate or the petitioner may propose. The conditions may not include architectural review or controls. The petitioner will have a reasonable opportunity to\nconsider and respond to any such additional requirements prior to final action by the board of county commissioners. If any conditions are included as part of the\nrezoning, the petitioner shall agree in writing to all applicable conditions within 30 (thirty) days of the decision. The conditional zoning district approval will not become\neffective until such written agreement is recorded in the Carteret County Register of Deeds. If the petitioner does not agree to the conditions in writing within 30 (thirty)\ndays following the date of the decision, the conditional zoning district will be deemed null and void.\nIn evaluating an application for the establishment of a conditional zoning district, it is appropriate for the board of county commissioners to consider the following:\n.01 The policies and objectives of the Carteret County Land Use Plan, particularly in relation to the use, proposed site, and surrounding area;\n.02\nThe potential adverse impacts to the surrounding area, of, but not limited, to traffic, storm water drainage, land values, and compatibility of land use\nactivities.\nIn the review and approval of a conditional zoning district, emphasis will be given to evaluation of the characteristics of the specific use proposed in relationship to\nsurrounding properties.\n3202.4. Effect of approval. If an application is approved, the conditional zoning district that is established and all conditions which may have been attached to the\napproval are binding on the property. All subsequent development and use of the property must be in accordance with the approved plan and conditions.\nThe intent of this type of zoning is to provide an alternative procedure for specific development proposals. It is intended that all property be rezoned only in\naccordance with firm plans to develop.\n3202.5. Alterations to an approved conditional zoning district. Changes to approved plans and conditions of development will be treated the same as changes to the\nzoning map and will be processed as an amendment as provided for in section 1300. However, minor changes in the detail of the approved plan which will not alter the\nbasic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property, which will not alter the uses permitted or increase the density of development, and which will not\ndecrease the off-street parking ratio or reduce the yards provided at the boundary of the site may be approved by the planning director without going through the\namendment process. The planning director, at his (her) discretion, may elect not to allow any proposal as a minor change and will, in that event, forward the detailed\napplication for changes to the planning commission and/or board of county commissioners for their consideration.

(Res. of\n3207.1. The planned unit development district is established to foster the blending of various land uses including, but not limited to, residential, light commercial,\noffice and recreational structures, which would not otherwise be possible under general district requirements. The purpose of this district is to promote economical\nand efficient patterns of land use which are sensitive to natural features and site amenities and allow for the accumulation of large areas of open space with the\nflexibility in design not afforded in other residential zoning districts. The planned unit development district is intended to provide flexibility within the constraints of the\ncounty's land use plan in situations where the owners of the property present a development plan which is found to be in the public interest and which provides\nnecessary urban services and improvements required by this ordinance and the county's policies for growth and development.\nThe planned unit development may focus on resort amenities, such as golf, tennis, swimming, boating, with occasional club buildings and supporting commercial\nestablishments for the PUD residents and their guests. All structures must be similar in design and structure to allow for a blending among land uses.

This provision is not to be used for occupancy when a home is in disrepair. In the case of a non-residential use\ndamaged by fire, flood, hurricane, tornado, or the like, a commercial modular with approved occupancy, as per North Carolina State Building Code may be used.\nAny temporary structure must meet setbacks for that zoning district and all other applicable regulations (CAMA, FEMA, Environmental Health, etc.). In the event the\ntemporary structure cannot meet the required setbacks, a variance must be first secured from the Zoning Board of Adjustment prior to the temporary structure being\nlocated on the property.\nThe temporary provision shall be allowed for a maximum of 180 days after the damage occurs. The owner may submit a written request to the director of planning\nand development prior to the expiration of 180 days for an extension to the time limit for circumstances when 180 days is not sufficient. The director is authorized to\ngrant an extension not to exceed 365 days from the initial date of the damage.\nTemporary provisions shall also be allowed in the event repair or replacement is being made pursuant to a governmental grant or program. However, any\ntemporary structure shall be removed within 180 days or 30 days after the issuance of an occupancy permit for the dwelling or the installation of the manufactured\nhome, whichever comes first.\nThis provision is not intended to allow extension of a nonconforming use.\n(Ord. of 7-16-12(5))\n3200. - CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICTS\nFootnotes:\n(4)\nEditor's note- Res. of 6-21-21 amended the title of Section 3200 to read as set out herein. Formerly, Section 3200 had been titled \"Conditional Use Districts.\"\n3201. Purpose.\n3201.1. Conditional zoning district. This ordinance contains regulations which establish zoning districts and assign land uses to one or more of these districts. The\nordinance also provides standards for development which regulate lot size, yards, parking and open space. There are, however, certain circumstances which often arise\nwhen a general zoning district designation would not be appropriate for a certain property, but a specific use or uses permitted under the district would be consistent\nwith the objectives of this ordinance. In order to accommodate this situation, this section establishes the conditional zoning district process.\nThe conditional zoning district process is established to address those situations involving a rezoning when a particular use or uses may be acceptable but the\ngeneral classification which would allow that use would not be acceptable. It allows the board of county commissioners to approve a rezoning proposal for a specific\nuse with reasonable conditions to assure the compatibility of the use with surrounding properties. This is a voluntary procedure which is intended for firm\ndevelopment proposals. It is not intended or suited for securing early zoning for tentative proposals which may not be undertaken for some time.\n(Res. 6-21-21)\n3202. - Application and review process.\nThe following process applies to the conditional zoning district:\n3202.1. Application. Rezoning petitions to establish a conditional zoning district must be submitted to the Carteret County Planning Department and will be\nprocessed in accordance with the procedure for zoning amendments described in Chapter 1300, as well as the provisions of this section. A conditional zoning district\nclassification will be considered only if the application is made by the owner of the property or his/her authorized agent. All applications must include a schematic plan\ndrawn to scale and any supporting text for the ordinance amendment. The applicant should include at least the items listed below: (Amended 10-19-09)\n(Res. 6-21-21)\n.01 A boundary survey showing the total acreage, present zoning classification(s), date, and North arrow;\n66 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\n\nNEW PAGE 67\nCarteret County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blar\n.02 The owners' names, addresses, and the tax parcel numbers of all abutting properties as shown on the tax records of Carteret County;\n.03 All existing easements, reservations, and rights-of-way and all yards required for the zoning district requested;\n.04 Proposed use of land and structures. For residential uses, this should include the number of units and an outline of the area where the structures will be\nlocated. For non-residential uses, this should include the approximate square footage of all structures and an outline of the area where the structures\nwill be located; and\n.05 Traffic, parking, and circulation plans, showing the proposed locations and arrangement of parking spaces and access points to adjacent streets.\n3202.2. Additional requirements. It may be necessary to request additional information in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding\narea. Therefore, the planning commission and/or board of county commissioners may request additional information as they deem necessary. This information may\ninclude, but is not limited to, the items listed below:\n.01 Proposed screening, including walls, fences, or planting areas as well as treatment of any existing natural features;\n.02 Delineation of areas within the regulatory flood zone, as shown on the official FEMA flood zone maps for Carteret County;\n.03 Existing and proposed topography at 2-foot contour intervals or less;\n.04 Generalized information on the number, height, size, and the location of structures;\n.05 Proposed number and location of signs;\n.06 Proposed phasing, if any, and approximate completion time of the project.\nThe application for [the establishment of] a conditional zoning district must contain information and/or site plans which indicate all of the principal and accessory\nuses which are proposed to be developed on the site. Subsequent to the approval of a conditional zoning district, only those principal and accessory uses indicated on\nthe approved plan may be constructed on the site. Any substantial modifications to an approved plan, including any changes in the permitted principal or accessory\nuses, must comply with the provisions of section 3202.5.\n(Res. 6-21-21)\n3202.3. Review and approval. In considering an application for the establishment of a conditional zoning district, the board of county commissioners may attach\nreasonable and appropriate conditions to the location, nature, and extent of the proposed use. Any conditions should relate to the relationship of the proposed use to\nsurrounding property, proposed support facilities such as parking, screening and buffer areas, the timing of development and other matters that the board may find\nappropriate or the petitioner may propose. The conditions may not include architectural review or controls. The petitioner will have a reasonable opportunity to\nconsider and respond to any such additional requirements prior to final action by the board of county commissioners. If any conditions are included as part of the\nrezoning, the petitioner shall agree in writing to all applicable conditions within 30 (thirty) days of the decision. The conditional zoning district approval will not become\neffective until such written agreement is recorded in the Carteret County Register of Deeds. If the petitioner does not agree to the conditions in writing within 30 (thirty)\ndays following the date of the decision, the conditional zoning district will be deemed null and void.\nIn evaluating an application for the establishment of a conditional zoning district, it is appropriate for the board of county commissioners to consider the following:\n.01 The policies and objectives of the Carteret County Land Use Plan, particularly in relation to the use, proposed site, and surrounding area;\n.02\nThe potential adverse impacts to the surrounding area, of, but not limited, to traffic, storm water drainage, land values, and compatibility of land use\nactivities.\nIn the review and approval of a conditional zoning district, emphasis will be given to evaluation of the characteristics of the specific use proposed in relationship to\nsurrounding properties.\n3202.4. Effect of approval. If an application is approved, the conditional zoning district that is established and all conditions which may have been attached to the\napproval are binding on the property. All subsequent development and use of the property must be in accordance with the approved plan and conditions.\nThe intent of this type of zoning is to provide an alternative procedure for specific development proposals. It is intended that all property be rezoned only in\naccordance with firm plans to develop.\n3202.5. Alterations to an approved conditional zoning district. Changes to approved plans and conditions of development will be treated the same as changes to the\nzoning map and will be processed as an amendment as provided for in section 1300. However, minor changes in the detail of the approved plan which will not alter the\nbasic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property, which will not alter the uses permitted or increase the density of development, and which will not\ndecrease the off-street parking ratio or reduce the yards provided at the boundary of the site may be approved by the planning director without going through the\namendment process. The planning director, at his (her) discretion, may elect not to allow any proposal as a minor change and will, in that event, forward the detailed\napplication for changes to the planning commission and/or board of county commissioners for their consideration. (Amended 7-19-10)\n(Res. 6-21-21 )\n3203. Reserved.\nEditor's note- Res. of 6-21-21 repealed \u00a7 3203, which pertained to permitted/special uses and development requirements.\n3204. Zoning map designation.\nFollowing board of county commissioners' approval of a conditional district, the property so zoned will be identified on the zoning maps by the appropriate parallel\n67 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\n\nNEW PAGE 68\nCarteret County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nzoning district designation.

Any conditional\nuse permits issued concurrently with the establishment of those conditional-use districts are converted automatically to special-use permits.\n(Res. 6-21-21 )\n3206. Flexible planned unit development.\nCertain large parcels may require additional flexibility in design than is allowed under the conditional zoning PUD overlay district standards. This flexibility may be\nnecessary to maximize environmental protection, encourage open space dedication and to group complementary land uses. Parcels containing acceptable acreage\nmay request the flexible PUD. A mix of commercial, single-family and group housing shall be allowed within the flexible PUD tract but the following criteria must be\nmet: (Res. 6-21-21)\n.1 The overall density of single-family and multifamily units shall not exceed 2.9 units per acre for the project's net acreage. The net acreage shall mean the\nentire tract, minus ten percent for necessary infrastructure. Commercial land uses shall not be included within the tract net acreage;\n.2 The total number of units (single-family or multifamily) shall not exceed eight in number for any single designated acre within the project;\n.3 No residential units shall exceed 50' in height. All other structures shall not exceed 60' in height from its finished grade;\n.4 Planned amenities including marinas and drystack boat storage facilities (including repair and maintenance facilities) shall be utilized primarily by the\nresidents within the PUD and only incidentally by transients. None of these facilities shall be permitted adjacent to any surface waters under current\nnomination or designated as outstanding resource waters by the State of North Carolina. Any data which supports the use of these amenities or\nrecreational facilities solely by flexible PUD residents shall be made available to the zoning enforcement officer upon request;\n.5 A centralized water and sewer system shall be provided to serve all the residents or the buildings in the total acreage designated as a flexible PUD;\n.6 A master plan and schedule for future development shall be provided at the time of preliminary approval. Each section or phase of the master plan shall\nbe recorded in Carteret County Register of Deeds after final approval by Carteret County Planning Commission and Carteret County Board of\nCommissioners; and\n.7 Table of permitted and special uses appropriate to other districts shall not apply to the flexible PUD district.\n3206.1. Application for a flexible planned unit development. Application for a project as a flexible PUD shall be submitted and reviewed in accordance with the\nCarteret County Subdivision Regulations. The planning commission shall subsequently make advisory recommendations to the board of county commissioners, which,\nfollowing a public hearing held pursuant to proper notice, shall make the final decision as to whether the application and plat will be approved or disapproved.\nThe following shall be shown on the plat:\n(Amd. of 11-3-04)\n3207. - Conditional planned unit development overlay. (Res. of\n3207.1. The planned unit development district is established to foster the blending of various land uses including, but not limited to, residential, light commercial,\noffice and recreational structures, which would not otherwise be possible under general district requirements. The purpose of this district is to promote economical\nand efficient patterns of land use which are sensitive to natural features and site amenities and allow for the accumulation of large areas of open space with the\nflexibility in design not afforded in other residential zoning districts. The planned unit development district is intended to provide flexibility within the constraints of the\ncounty's land use plan in situations where the owners of the property present a development plan which is found to be in the public interest and which provides\nnecessary urban services and improvements required by this ordinance and the county's policies for growth and development.\nThe planned unit development may focus on resort amenities, such as golf, tennis, swimming, boating, with occasional club buildings and supporting commercial\nestablishments for the PUD residents and their guests. All structures must be similar in design and structure to allow for a blending among land uses. The dedication of\ncommon open space shall be utilized as a tool to create a resort atmosphere as well as enhance the visual character of the development.\n68 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\nCELL (1, 1): \n.1 Proposed primary traffic circulation pattern.\nCELL (1, 2): \n.1 Proposed primary traffic circulation pattern.\na) All 404 wetland areas on the tract.\nb) Proposed means of compliance with division of environmental management stormwater regulations.\nCELL (2, 1): \n.2 Proposed parks, tennis courts, swimming pools, beaches, golf course, boating docks, playgrounds, community buildings, common open space, etc.;\nCELL (2, 2): \n.2 Proposed parks, tennis courts, swimming pools, beaches, golf course, boating docks, playgrounds, community buildings, common open space, etc.;\nCELL (3, 1): \n.3 Proposed means of dedication of common open space areas and facilities, and the organizational arrangements for the ownership, maintenance, and\nCELL (3, 2): \n.3 Proposed means of dedication of common open space areas and facilities, and the organizational arrangements for the ownership, maintenance, and\npreservation of common open space, wetlands and stormwater management facilities;\nCELL (4, 1): \n.4 Delineation of the sections, units or phases to be constructed in progression or sequence in a master plan concept which will be the basis for approval\nCELL (4, 2): \n.4 Delineation of the sections, units or phases to be constructed in progression or sequence in a master plan concept which will be the basis for approval\nsubject to accepted and approved changes by the Carteret County Planning Commission and the Carteret County Board of Commissioners;\nCELL (5, 1): \n.5 When required by the planning department, planning commission, or the board of county commissioners, an environmental impact statement will be\nCELL (5, 2): \n.5 When required by the planning department, planning commission, or the board of county commissioners, an environmental impact statement will be\nsubmitted.

The submission of such a master plan, and the acceptance thereof by\nCarteret County, shall not be deemed a waiver of any required subdivision, group housing or other specific requirement contained within any ordinance of\nCarteret County, but rather the submission of such plan shall only be effective as a waiver of the requirement for approval of a master plan. To the extent\nthat the master plan as submitted fails to meet any substantive requirements of density or otherwise of the revised zoning ordinance, the submission of said\nplan shall grant no rights to construct or subdivide in accordance with said plan, except to the extent that valid permits for construction are or have been\nissued prior to the effective date of the revised zoning ordinance.\n.3\nAny property designated a \"Flexible PUD\" prior to the adoption of the revised zoning ordinance shall retain all master plan approvals given prior to the date\nof adoption of the revised zoning ordinance, and all procedural prerequisites to the designation of a property as a \"Flexible PUD\" as set out in the revised\nzoning ordinance shall be waived as to such predesignated \"Flexible PUDs.\"\nThis Zoning Map of Carteret County shall be effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the 18th day of June, 1990.\n(Res. of 6-21-21 )\n1005. Jurisdiction.\nThese regulations govern the development and use of land and structures in all of the unincorporated areas of Carteret County, not to include the areas regulated\nby the Down East Conservation Ordinance (DECO) or any other governmental unit. These regulations do not apply to bona fide farms, except that non-farms may be\nregulated as per section 1007.\n(Res. of 5-18-15)\n1006. Interpretation of zoning maps.\nWhere uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various districts shown on the maps cited in section 1004, the following rules will be used to interpret\nthe maps:\n1006.1 In cases where a boundary line is located within a street or alley right-of-way, railroad or utility right-of-way or easement, canal, navigable or unnavigable\nwater body, it will be considered to be in the center of the street or alley right-of-way, railroad or utility easement, canal or water body. If the actual location of such\nright-of-way, easement, canal or water body varies slightly from the location as shown on the map, then the actual location will control.\n1006.2 Where a district boundary is shown to approximately coincide with a property line or city limit line, the property line or city limit line will be considered to be\nthe district boundary, unless otherwise indicated.\n1006.3 In cases where a district boundary does not coincide or approximately coincide with any street or alley, railroad, water body or canal, or property line, and no\ndimensions are shown, the location of the boundary will be determined by the use of the scale appearing on the map.\n1007. Bona fide farms exempt.\n2 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\n\nNEW PAGE 3\nCarteret County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nThis ordinance shall in no way regulate, restrict, prohibit or otherwise deter any bona fide farm and its related uses. Nonfarm uses on a farm shall be subject to this\nordinance.\n1008. Zoning districts.\nFor the purposes of this ordinance, a portion of the unincorporated territory of Carteret County as set forth in the accompanying zoning maps is divided into the\nfollowing districts.\nThe hierarchy of zoning districts established by this ordinance is classified from highest to lowest in the order listed below:\nA. RA (rural agricultural district). This district encompasses those lands that are primarily suited for agriculture, agriculturally-related uses, very low density\nresidential, and/or woodlands.\nB.

A district suited for the location of manufacturing and other related uses which would be incompatible with\nbusiness and residential areas.\n(Amend. of 9-15-98(6); Amend. of 12-13-05(1); Amend. of 3-6-06(1); Amend. of 9-17-12(1))\n1009. Zoning affects every building and use.\nNo building, structure or land may be used or occupied, and no building, structure or part thereof may be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, enlarged, or\nstructurally altered unless in conformity with all the regulations of this ordinance for the district in which it is located, except as otherwise provided by this ordinance.\nHowever, the regulations in this ordinance do not apply to bona fide farms as defined in section 1100.\n1010. Rounding off fractions.\nWhen any requirement of this ordinance results in a fraction of a unit, a fraction of one-half or more will be rounded off and considered a whole unit. Fractions of\nless than one-half will be rounded off to the nearest lower number of units. For example, when the determination of the number of dwelling units permitted on a lot\nresults in a fraction of a dwelling unit, a fraction of one-half or more will be considered a dwelling unit and a fraction of less than one-half will be disregarded.\n1011. Lots divided by zoning district boundaries.\nDividing a lot by zoning district boundaries, also known as split zoning, is prohibited. All existing lots divided by zoning district boundaries shall be rezoned, which\nmay include Conditional rezoning, or subdivided per code requirements prior to development.\n(Res of 6-21-21)\n3 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\n\nNEW PAGE 4\nCarteret County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nFor the purposes of this section, development shall mean any construction on a vacant parcel, any improvements requiring a building permit that result in at least a\nfifty (50) percent increase in the gross floor area on the parcel, any improvements requiring a building permit that result in at least a fifty (50) percent increase in the\ntax assessed value of all improvements on the property, or any new earth disturbance activity (except for a bona fide agricultural activity) that totals at least one (1)\nacre at that time.\n(Amend. of 10-15-07(2))\n1012. Reduction of lot area prohibited.\nNo lot existing at the time of adoption of this ordinance may be reduced in its dimensions or area below the minimum requirements of this ordinance for the district\nin which it is located unless specifically authorized by other provisions of this ordinance.\n1013. Every lot must abut a street.\nNo building, structure or use of land for any purpose except agriculture may be placed on a lot which does not abut a street. The following sections list exceptions to\nthis rule.\n1013.1 A single-family detached dwelling may be constructed on a lot that does not abut a street, provided that the lot meets the terms of the Carteret County\nSubdivision Regulations or is a lot of record.\n1013.2 Any structure approved under the group housing ordinance is exempt from this section.\n1014. - Interpretation and application of these regulations.\nIn the interpretation and application of this ordinance, the provisions of the ordinance will be construed to be the minimum requirements adopted to promote the\npublic health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare.\n1015. - Relation of this ordinance to other ordinances.\nIt is not intended that this ordinance will in any way repeal, annul or interfere with the existing provisions of any law or ordinance except the zoning ordinance which\nthis ordinance replaces. In addition it is not intended that this ordinance will in any way repeal, annul or interfere with any rules, regulations or zoning permits which\nwere legally adopted or issued under previous ordinances for the use or development of land or structures.\n1016. Zoning boundaries over surface waters.\nSince 160D-702, as amended, permits a county to regulate development over estuarine waters and over lands covered by navigable waters owned by the state\npursuant to G.S. 146-12, within the bounds of that county, the zoning boundaries for waterfront parcels shall be extended linearly 400 feet waterward of the mean\nhigh-water mark. This water surface zoning shall not unreasonably infringe on the right to navigation protected by the federal government or on other rights, such as\nshellfishing rights, allowed by state government.\n(Res. of 6-21-21 )\n1017. Zoning district changes affecting the zoning maps.\nUpon the effective date of this ordinance, the R-50 (single-family residential district) zone shall be changed in name to RA (rural agricultural), and the C-I (planned\nmobile home and camp park district) zone shall be changed in name to MC (planned mobile home and camp park district).
