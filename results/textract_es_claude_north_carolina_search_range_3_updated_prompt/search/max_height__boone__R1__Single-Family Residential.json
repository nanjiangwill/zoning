A \"family\" means individuals related by blood, marriage, domestic partnership, or\nadoption occupying a premise and living as a single, non-profit housekeeping unit,\nwhich may include live-in help but does not include roomers or boarders. A \"single,\nnon-profit housekeeping unit\" means individuals who live and cook together, as with\nor similar to a traditional family, on a single lease if renting the premises. The following\nindividuals may constitute a family: a single person or a couple that is married or are\ndomestic partners; that person's or persons' children, parents, siblings, grandparents,\ngreat-grandparents, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren; and the spouses of any of\nthe foregoing persons. \"Domestic partners\" means two persons who are both at least\n18 years of age, are each other's sole domestic partner, have a common residence, and\nintend to maintain a common residence together indefinitely. \"Child\" and \"children\"\nshall for these purposes include a biological, foster, step- or adopted child, legal ward\nor other legal dependent, or other person who is or has been in a child-parent\nrelationship with an adult in the family. The term \"family\" shall not be construed to\ninclude a fraternity or sorority, club, rooming house, group of students rooming\ntogether, institutional group or the like.\nB. \"Unrelated\" individuals are persons who are not members of the same family as\ndefined above. For clarification, cousins are deemed \"unrelated\" for purposes of these\noccupancy regulations unless part of a single housekeeping unit that includes a parent,\ngrandparent or great-grandparent of one of the cousins.\nC.

To clarify, occupancy violations arising after the effective date of this ordinance (January\n1, 2014) cannot give rise to a legal nonconformity; and\nB. With respect to any current, continuing occupancy violation proven by the property\nowner to pre-date the 2014 ordinance, such violation must be remedied within two\nyears from the date that written notification of the violation is made by the\nAdministrator to the record owner of the dwelling unit. To the extent practicable, all\noccupants of such dwelling units, as of the date of notification of the record owner, shall\nalso be provided written notice of the nonconformity and the deadline for bringing the\ndwelling unit into compliance.

Where no street right-of-way exists or if the right-of-way is only inclusive of the\nstreet pavement the street setback shall be measured from an assumed right-of-\nway that is parallel to the edge of pavement and setback a minimum of ten feet\n(10') from the edge of pavement. This calculation is for setback calculation\npurposes only and does not represent any expressed or implied taking of property.\n2. As used herein, the term \"interior lot line\" refers to lot boundaries other than those\nthat abut streets.\n3. As used herein, the term \"building\" includes any substantial structure which by\nnature of its size, scale, dimensions, bulk, or use tends to constitute a visual\nobstruction or generate activity similar to that usually associated with a building.\nWithout limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following structures shall be\ndeemed to fall within this description:\na. Gas pumps and overhead canopies or roofs.\nb. Fences running along lot boundary adjacent to public street rights-of-way if\nsuch fences exceed nine feet (9') in height and are substantially opaque.\nC. Retaining walls which exceed four feet (4') in height.\nB. Whenever a lot in a nonresidential district has a common boundary line with a lot in a\nresidential district, and the interior setback requirement applicable to the residential\nlot is greater than that applicable to the nonresidential lot, then the lot in the\nnonresidential district shall be required to observe the interior setback requirement\napplicable to the adjoining residential lot.\nC. Setback distances shall be measured from the property line or street right-of-way line\nto a point on the lot that is directly below the nearest extension of any part of the\nbuilding that is substantially a part of the building itself and not a mere appendage to\nit (such as a flagpole, etc.).\nD.

No accessory structure may be further forward to the street setback than the front\nmost point of the principal structure.\n3. The maximum lot coverage of the accessory structure shall not exceed twenty\npercent (20%) of the lot.\n4. An accessory structure must be clearly subordinate to the principal structure in all\ndimensional aspects.\n5. An accessory structure shall not be located in an easement unless expressly\nallowed.\n14.03.07\nBuilding Height\nA. The height of a building shall be the vertical distance measured from the average\nelevation of the finished grade at the primary fa\u00e7ade of the building to the highest point\nof the building except as provided herein.\nB. \"Stories\" as used herein refers to the number of heated, habitable floors above grade\nat the primary facade. Where both stories and heights are listed, the building can have\nno more than the listed number of stories, and also may not exceed the specified height\nin feet.\nC. Secondary Height: If expressly allowed, the height limitation may range between the\nprimary height limitation to the secondary height limitation (which is the maximum for\nthe district), subject to the provisions below:\n1. For each foot the height of the structure exceeds the primary height limitation, the\nboundary lot setback applicable to the entire structure shall increase by one foot\n(1').\n2. For each story which exceeds the primary height limitation, the boundary lot\nsetback applicable to the entire structure shall increase by 11 feet (11').\n3.\nIn no case shall the height of a structure exceed the secondary height limitation\nestablished for the district.\nD. In all nonresidential zones and the R3 zone, all structures located within 100 feet of an\nR1 zoned property shall not exceed forty feet (40') in height.\nE. Where a multi-unit or nonresidential structure has a height in excess of twenty feet\n(20') and adjoins a low-density residential district, the structure shall meet an\nadditional setback of one-and one-half feet (1 1/2') for each foot in height above twenty\nfeet (20').\n14-10\n\nNEW PAGE 161\nTown of Boone\nUnified Development Ordinance\nArticle 14 Zoning Districts Regulations\nF. If a structure is located at an elevation of 3000 feet above mean sea level and 500 feet\nabove the valley floor, in no case shall the height of such structure exceed forty feet\n(40') above the mean natural grade.\nG. The following features are not included in calculating the height of a structure for the\npurposes of applying the district height limitations set forth in this Article, except that\non a corner lot in any residential district no planting, structures, fence, wall or\nobstruction to vision more than three feet (3') in height measured from the street\ncenter line shall be placed or maintained within the triangular area formed by the\nintersection street lines and a straight line connecting points on said street lines each\nif which is twenty-five feet (25') from the point of intersection.\n1.

Except as provided at Subsection 14.19.04(F)(7)(b), parapets which do not exceed\nfive feet (5') past the maximum building height; by way of clarification, the height\nof parapets above 5' shall be counted toward the building height for purposes of\napplying building height; and\n4. Elevator and mechanical equipment and penthouses; and\n5. Utility transmission poles and cables; and\n6. Limited structures to enable recreation uses of open rooftops (Accessory Use A-\n27). As used in this provision, \"limited structure\" does not include areas that are\nsimply decking to be used for standing or sitting.\n7. The features listed above are exempt from the height limitations subject to the\nfollowing requirements:\na. Not more than one-third (1/3) of the total roof area may be consumed by\nsuch features.\nb. The features must be set back from the edge of the roof at primary and\nsecondary facades a minimum of one foot for every foot which such features\nextend above the roof surface to which they are attached.\n(Ord.
