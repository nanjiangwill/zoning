MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL (R-10) DISTRICT\nA.\nR-10 DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENT\nThe Multi-Family Residential (R-10) district is the most dense of the residential districts and allows a\nbroad range of residential use types. The R-10 district is typically configured as a single development\non one or two lots, though are also some examples of multiple lot developments throughout the\nCounty. Multi-family development is typically more dense than its immediate surroundings, and can\nalso serve as an effective transition between single-family detached development and adjacent\ncommercial or employment uses. Buildings in the R-10 district tend to have shared site access, shared\nbuilding access, common site features (like recreation space) owned in common, and centralized\nservice functions. Residential densities are slightly higher for most forms of allowable residential\ndevelopment than is permitted in the other residential districts, though multi-family density is double\nthat in the other residential districts. Uses that are potentially detrimental to residential development\nare generally discouraged in the R-10 district. In order to maintain compatibility with surrounding uses\nand ensure a high quality of development, all activities shall comply with the standards in Article 6.\nStandards.\nB.\nR 10 EXAMPLE DEVELOPMENT\nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nLAST AMENDED\nUnified Development Ordinance\nPage 157\n5.2.22\n\nNEW PAGE 158\nARTICLE 3.

DISTRICTS\n$3.2. Conventional Zoning Districts\n3.2.6. MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL (R-10) DISTRICT\nA.\nR-10 DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENT\nThe Multi-Family Residential (R-10) district is the most dense of the residential districts and allows a\nbroad range of residential use types. The R-10 district is typically configured as a single development\non one or two lots, though are also some examples of multiple lot developments throughout the\nCounty. Multi-family development is typically more dense than its immediate surroundings, and can\nalso serve as an effective transition between single-family detached development and adjacent\ncommercial or employment uses. Buildings in the R-10 district tend to have shared site access, shared\nbuilding access, common site features (like recreation space) owned in common, and centralized\nservice functions. Residential densities are slightly higher for most forms of allowable residential\ndevelopment than is permitted in the other residential districts, though multi-family density is double\nthat in the other residential districts. Uses that are potentially detrimental to residential development\nare generally discouraged in the R-10 district. In order to maintain compatibility with surrounding uses\nand ensure a high quality of development, all activities shall comply with the standards in Article 6.\nStandards.\nB.\nR 10 EXAMPLE DEVELOPMENT\nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nLAST AMENDED\nUnified Development Ordinance\nPage 157\n5.2.22\n", "page_number": 155, "page_range": [155, 156, 157], "highlight": ["Conventional Zoning Districts\nR-20 <em>DIMENSIONAL</em> <em>REQUIREMENTS</em> (CONTINUED)\nNOTES:\n[1] Development located", "<em>Building</em> <em>Height</em> (<em>feet</em>)\nCELL (24, 2): \nCELL (24, 3): \nCELL (25, 1): \nResidential Development\nCELL (25", "Conventional Zoning Districts\nR-20 <em>DIMENSIONAL</em> <em>REQUIREMENTS</em> NOTES (continued):\n[11] Lot widths may be", "<em>MULTI</em>-<em>FAMILY</em> <em>RESIDENTIAL</em> (<em>R</em>-<em>10</em>) DISTRICT\nA.", "<em>R</em>-<em>10</em> DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENT\nThe <em>Multi</em>-<em>Family</em> <em>Residential</em> (<em>R</em>-<em>10</em>) district is the most dense of the"], "score": 23.012226, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Multi-Family Residential\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R-10\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R10\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R-10\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [137, 138, 139, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160]}
