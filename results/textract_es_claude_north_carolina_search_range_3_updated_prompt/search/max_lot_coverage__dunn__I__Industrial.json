The provisions set out in this section shall govern the location of all towers, and the\ninstallation of all antennas, governed by this ordinance.\nii.\nTowers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or be subject to any applicable\nstandards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.\niii. At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall to the extent\npossible use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the\ntower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.\niv.\nIf an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting\nelectrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to or\nclosely compatible with the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna\nand related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.\nV.\nTowers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by the FAA or other applicable\nauthority. If lighting is required, the Board of Adjustment may review the available lighting\nalternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the\nsurrounding views.\n6.\nFederal Requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA,\nthe FCC and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and\nantennas. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the towers and antennas\ngoverned by this ordinance shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised\nstandards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and\nregulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal\nagency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and\nregulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense.\n7. Building Codes; Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers the owner of a tower\nshall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable state and local\nbuilding codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries\nAssociation, as amended from time to time. If upon inspection by the City of Dunn Planning\nDepartment, it is concluded that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes\na danger to person or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the City of\nDunn shall revoke or not issue a certificate of occupancy and either not permit power to such facility or\ndiscontinue power to the facility until such time as the deficiencies are deemed corrected.\n8.\nCoverage Need. Need of coverage shall be demonstrated by the wireless provider.\n9.\nLand Form Preservation. Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be\npreserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded\nlots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer.

Provided\nhowever, no tree may be trimmed or removed on property owned by the City of Dunn without a review\nby the City of Dunn.\n10. Existing Vegetation. Existing vegetation on a tower facility site may be used in lieu of required\nlandscaping where approved by the Administrator.\n11. Replacing Existing Tower. An existing tower can be replaced subject to Article 9 - Nonconformities of\nthis ordinance.\n12. Minimum Site Disturbance. Grading for the new Wireless Communication Facility shall be minimized\nand limited only to the area necessary for the new facility.\n13. Signs. No signs or logos, for which sign permits are required by this ordinance shall be allowed on any\ntower, antenna or related device.\n14. Parking.

Any Wireless Communication Facility that is not\noperated as a commercial wireless communication site or by a government agency or by an\nemergency service provider for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned and\nthe owner of such facility shall remove same within 60 days of the notice thereof. Applicants to\nconstruct any such facility shall provide a performance bond for the cost of the removal of such facility\nin favor of the City of Dunn. The bond shall be in the amount of 125 percent of the estimated cost of\nremoving the facility. The applicant shall submit an estimate from a qualified demolition firm for the\npurpose of determining the amount of the performance bond.\nD. UTILITIES (ALL CLASSES)\n1.
