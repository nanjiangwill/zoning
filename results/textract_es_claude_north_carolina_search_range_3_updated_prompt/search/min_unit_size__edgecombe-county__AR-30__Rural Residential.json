The purpose of this section is to allow a broad range of secondary uses\nand structures, provided they comply with the standards set forth in this section in order to reduce\npotentially adverse impacts on surrounding lands.\n4.5.2. ORGANIZATION OF THESE STANDARDS\nThese provisions set out the configuration standards and allowable locations for secondary uses and\nstructures in the County's planning jurisdiction, and are generally organized into the following\nstructure:\nA.\nThe procedure for establishing a secondary use or structure;\nB.\nThe general standards applicable to all secondary uses and structures under this Ordinance;\nC.\nA summary table of common secondary uses and the zoning districts where they are permitted;\nand\nD.\nAdditional standards applied to specific secondary use types, where identified in the summary\ntable.\n4.5.3. PROCEDURE FOR ESTABLISHMENT\nA.\nSecondary uses or structures may be approved in conjunction with the approval of the principal\nuse or subsequently following the establishment of the principal use through the approval of\na\nzoning compliance permit or special use permit, as appropriate. Except as permitted in the AR-\n30 zoning district, no secondary use or structure shall be approved, established, or constructed\nbefore a principal use is approved in accordance with this Ordinance.\nB.\nApplications to establish a planned development district shall be supplemented by a site plan\nshowing proposed secondary uses or by a written list of proposed secondary uses included in\nthe terms and conditions documents.\nC.\nTable 4.5.5, Common Secondary Use Table, may not be inclusive of all possible secondary uses,\nand in the event a secondary use is proposed that is not listed in the table, the Zoning\nAdministrator shall consult Table 4.2.1, Principal Use Table, to determine if the proposed\nsecondary use corresponds to a listed principal use. Any permitted principal use in a zoning\ndistrict is also permitted as secondary use. In no instance shall a secondary use be permitted in\na zoning district where it is prohibited as a principal use.\nD.\nIn the event a proposed secondary use is not listed in Table 4.5.5, Common Secondary Use\nTable, and there is no corresponding principal use, the Zoning Administrator shall determine\nhow to treat the secondary use in accordance with Section $4.7, Unlisted Uses.\n4.5.4. GENERAL STANDARDS FOR ALL SECONDARY USES, STRUCTURES, AND\nOPEN AIR USES OF LAND\nA.\nPERMITTED SECONDARY USES, STRUCTURES, AND OPEN AIR USES OF\nLAND\nPermitted secondary uses, structures, and open air uses of land shall comply with the following:\n1. Are clearly incidental to an allowed principal use or structure;\n2. Are subordinate to and serve an allowed principal use or structure;\n3. Are subordinate in area, extent, and purpose to the principal use or structure;\n4.

COUNTY\nLAST AMENDED\nUnified Development Ordinance\nPage 5\n5.2.22\nCELL (1, 1): \nQUESTION\nCELL (1, 2): \nANSWER\nCELL (2, 1): \nWhat permits do I need\nto build a house?\nCELL (2, 2): \nAll single-family detached dwellings require prior approval of a Zoning\nCompliance Permit and a Building Permit issued from Edgecombe County.\nIn cases where the home is on its own well or septic system, the dwelling\nalso requires a prior approval from Edgecombe County Environmental\nHealth to ensure the lot has a potable water supply and a method for\ndealing with sewage. Dwellings located in a floodplain or flood prone area\nalso require issuance of a Floodplain Development Permit. During\nconstruction, the building must be inspected by County Building Inspectors\nas required by State law, and a Certificate of Occupancy must be issued\nbefore the home may be occupied. Applicants seeking to place a mobile or\nmanufactured home may be required to obtain a permit, and should\ncontact the County's Planning, Inspections, and E-911 Addressing\nDepartment at 252.641.7802 for more information.\nCELL (3, 1): \nDo I need permits to\nhave a home business?\nCELL (3, 2): \nYes, operating a home-based business (also called a \"home occupation\")\nrequires approval of a Zoning Compliance Permit issued by the County. The\nbusiness may not exceed 1,000 square feet in floor area and employ no\nmore than 2 people who do not already live in the home.\nCELL (4, 1): \nHow do I create a lot for\na family member?\nCELL (4, 2): \nLots may be transferred among family members using the Transfer Plat\nprocedure in the UDO. A subdivision of land creating lots for family\nmembers must be signed by County personnel and recorded in the Office of\nthe Edgecombe County Register of Deeds at 201 Saint Andrews Street in\nTarboro. Failure to record a transfer plat is a violation of the law and will\ninterfere with the ability to obtain a building permit to build a structure on\nthe lot.\nCELL (5, 1): \nDo I need a permit for a\nsign?\nCELL (5, 2): \nMost forms of signage require approval of a Sign Permit by the County.\nSome signs, like political (election) signs, do not require a sign permit, but\nare subject to the rules for signage in the UDO.\nCELL (6, 1): \nWhat is the process for\nrezoning my land?\nCELL (6, 2): \nChanging the zoning district designation of your land requires a Zoning Map\nAmendment to be approved by the Edgecombe County Board of\nCommissioners. The procedure for zoning map amendments is included in\nthe UDO. Landowners considering a request to change their zoning should\ntalk with the Edgecombe County's Planning, and Inspections, and E-911\nAddressing Department staff at 252.641.7802 before filing an application.\n\nNEW PAGE 6\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nLAST AMENDED\nUnified Development Ordinance\nPage 6\n5.2.22\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \nQUESTION\nCELL (2, 2): \nANSWER\nCELL (3, 1): \nWho makes decisions on\napplications?\nCELL (3, 2): \nDevelopment applications are decided by the Planning Director, the Building\nInspector, the Planning Board, the Board of Adjustment, or the Board of\nCommissioners, based on the type of application. The UDO includes a\nsummary table in Article 2, Applications, that identifies who decides which\nkinds of applications.\nCELL (4, 1): \nHow can I appeal a\ndecision?\nCELL (4, 2): \nAny decision by a County staff member (like the Planning Director) may be\nappealed to the Board of Adjustment. Decisions from decision-making\nbodies like the Board of Adjustment may be appealed to the Superior Court\nfor Edgecombe County. There are specific deadlines from the date a\ndecision is made within which an appeal may be filed\nCELL (5, 1): \nWhat's the best way to\nlearn more about\nsubmitting an\napplication for\ndevelopment?\nCELL (5, 2): \nEdgecombe County Planning and Inspections staff conducts free pre-\napplication conferences with potential applicants. Some types of\napplications require a pre-application conference to be conducted. More\ninformation on pre-application conferences is in the UDO.\nCELL (6, 1): \nWho can I call about\nflooding or other\nnuisances?\nCELL (6, 2): \nPersons with questions about flooding, nuisances, or
