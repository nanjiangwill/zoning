(AMENDED 5/27/08; REWRITTEN\n6/22/21)\n(a)\nConditional zoning districts are zoning districts in which the development and use\nof the property SO zoned are governed by the regulations applicable to one of the conventional use\nzoning districts listed in the Table of Permissible Uses, as modified by the conditions and\nrestrictions imposed as part of the legislative decision creating the district and applying it to the\nparticular property. Accordingly, the following conditional zoning districts may be established:\nR-20-CZ, R-15-CZ, R-10-CZ, R-7.5-CZ, R-3-CZ, R-2-CZ, R-R-CZ, R-S.I.R.-CZ, and\nR-S.I.R.-2-CZ\nB-1(C)-CZ, B-1(G)-CZ, B-2-CZ, B-3-CZ, B-3-T-CZ, B-4-CZ, CT-CZ, O-CZ, O/A-CZ,\nM-1-CZ, M-2-CZ, M-3-CZ (AMENDED 4/27/10; 6/23/15; 10/23/18)\nThere may also be established a HR-CC-CZ zoning district, pursuant to the purpose\nstatement and criteria described in Section 15-136.1.\n(b)\nThe conditional zoning districts authorized by this section may be applied to\nproperty only in response to a petition signed by all the owners of the property to be included\nwithin such district.\n(c)\nSubject to the provisions of subsections (k), (1), and (n), the uses permissible\nwithin a conditional zoning district authorized by this section, and the regulations applicable to\nproperty within such a district, shall be those uses that are permissible within and those\nregulations that are applicable to the conventional use zoning district to which the conditional\ndistrict corresponds, except as those uses and regulations are limited by conditions imposed\npursuant to subsection (f) of this section. For example, property that is rezoned to a B-2-CZ\ndistrict may be developed in the same manner as property that is zoned B-2, subject to any\nconditions imposed pursuant to subsection (d). (AMENDED 10/23/18)\n(1)\nProperty that is zoned B-4-CZ may be developed for use classifications\n1.231 (duplex, maximum 20% units > 3 bedrooms/dwelling unit), 1.241\n(two family apartment, maximum 20% units > 3 bedrooms/dwelling unit),\n1.321 (multi-family residences, maximum 20% units > bedrooms/dwelling\nunit and 1.331 (multi-family, maximum 20% units > 3 bedrooms/dwelling\nunit) 1 in addition to other uses permissible in the B-4 district, subject to a\nspecial use permit-A, and the following: (i) not more than 25% of the total\nland area covered in this district may be developed for such uses; and (ii)\nthe area developed for such uses shall have a minimum of 1,500 square\nfeet per dwelling unit (except that applicable density bonuses shall\napply).\nPage #17\n\nNEW PAGE 18\nArt. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\n(2)\nExcept as otherwise provided in this section, the uses that are permissible\nwithin a M-3-CZ district, and the regulations applicable to property within\nsuch a district shall be those uses and those regulations that would be\napplicable to any property zone M-1-CZ (i.e. excluding specific conditions\nmade applicable to any property zoned M-1-CZ) with the addition of use\n3.230.\n(3)\nProperty that is zoned O/A-CZ shall be subject to all regulations applicable\nto the O/A district (including but not limited to the performance standards\nset forth in part I of Article XI), except as follows:\na.\nNo area less than four contiguous acres and no more than a total of\ntwenty-five (25) acres may be rezoned to the O/A-CZ.\nb.\nUses within the O/A-CZ district shall be limited to those where\nloading and unloading occurs during daylight hours only.\nC.\nBuildings within the O/A-CZ district shall comply with the\nfollowing standards:\n1.\nExterior walls shall be constructed of materials commonly\nused on the exterior walls of single-family residences (such as\nbrick, stone, wood or fabricated residential lap siding made of\nhardboard or vinyl).\n2.\nThe pitch of the roof shall have a minimum vertical rise of one\nfoot for every two feet of horizontal run.\n3.\nWindows shall be of a scale and proportion typically of single-\nfamily residences.\n(d)\nWhen a rezoning petition for a conditional zoning district is submitted (in\naccordance with Article XX of this chapter), the application shall include a list of proposed\nconditions (which may be in the form of written statements, graphic illustrations, or any\ncombination thereof) to be incorporated into the ordinance that rezones the property to the\nrequested conditional zoning district. The rezoning petition for a VMU district, described in\nsubsection 15-141.2(g)(1), shall include a master plan as a condition of the approval.\n(AMENDED 10/25/16)\n(e)\nA rezoning petition may be submitted to allow use classification 3.260 Social\nService Provider with Dining within a building of more than two stories or 35 feet in height.\n(AMENDED 10/25/16)\n(1)\nThe petition shall include information that demonstrates that, if the project\nis completed as proposed, it:\nPage #18\n\nNEW PAGE 19\nArt.

The manner\nin which a project is designed to accommodate additional building\nheight including, but not limited to, scale, architectural detailing,\ncompatibility with the existing built environment and with adopted\npolicy statements in support of vibrant and economically successful and\nsustainable, mixed-use, core commercial districts shall be among the\nissues that may be considered to make a finding that a project is or is\nnot in harmony with the area in which it is to be located. The applicant\nmay use a variety of graphic and descriptive means to illustrate these\nfindings; and\nC.\nWill be in general conformity with the Comprehensive Plan, Land Use\nPlan, long range transportation plans, and other plans officially adopted\nby the Council.
