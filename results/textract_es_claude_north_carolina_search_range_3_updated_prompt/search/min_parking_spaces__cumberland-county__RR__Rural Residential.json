To minimize encroachment of\nwheelchair ramps into the required yard, turning platforms are encouraged.\nB. Determination of Front Yard Setback. The front yard requirements of this\nordinance shall not apply on lots where the average depth of existing front yards on\ndeveloped lots, located within 100 feet on each side of a lot, within the same block and\nzoning district as such lot, is greater or lesser than the minimum required front lot\ndepth. In such cases, the depth of the front yard on such lot shall not be less than the\naverage front yard depth on such developed lots. This provision shall not require a\nstructure to be set back from the street or road a greater distance than the distance set\nforth in this ordinance or the setback line observed by the closer of the two existing\nprincipal structures on immediately adjoining lots. In no case, however, shall any\nresidential structure be placed closer than 50 feet from the centerline of a street on\nwhich it faces or within 40 feet from the centerline of a side street. The location of a\nresidential structure with respect to the street line in any commercial or industrial\ndistrict shall not be used as a factor in determining the required setback from the street\nline for any new structure to be erected in such districts.\n((Amd. 01-19-10)\nC. Fences and Walls. The setback requirements of this ordinance shall not apply to\nany retaining wall. Open fences and walls may be erected to any height. Solid fences and\nwalls shall be limited to three feet in height when projecting into or enclosing a\nminimum front yard and shall be limited to seven feet in height when projecting into or\nenclosing a minimum side and/or rear yard. When a corner lot follows two front yard\nsetbacks, as determined by the Coordinator, a solid fence or wall greater than three feet\nin height, but not exceeding seven feet in height, may not be erected within 20 feet of\nthe right-of-way on the street deemed the secondary front yard by the Coordinator. The\nstreet on which the house is addressed is usually considered the primary street on\nwhich the house must follow the full front yard setback unless otherwise determined by\nthe Coordinator. Exceptions to location criteria are as follows:\n1. Fences or walls that are within or enclose the minimum side and/or rear yard\nof a subdivision lot which is situated on a peripheral boundary of a subdivision in which\nit is a part;\n2. Rear yards on through lots may have a privacy fence erected up to the rear\nproperty line, as determined by a platted \"no access easement\" or up to 20 feet from\nthat line in the absence of a \"no access easement\";\n127\nJune 20, 2005 County Zoning Ordinance\nw/ Amendments through January 16, 2024\n", "page_number": 137, "page_range": [137, 138, 139], "highlight": ["dimensions are not\nreduced below the minimums specified in this ordinance by more than 17 percent in the\n<em>RR</em>", ", R15, R7.5, R6, R6A and R5 residential districts; or below the dimensional\nrequirements of the <em>RR</em> <em>Rural</em>", "<em>Residential</em> District in the A1 Agricultural District.", "marquees shall not be solid and shall not interfere with the free movement of traffic,\nthe required <em>off</em>-<em>street</em>", "<em>parking</em>, and the sight view of adjacent properties.\n126\nJune 20, 2005 County Zoning Ordinance\nw/ Amendments"], "score": 12.167765, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Rural Residential\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RR\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RR\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RR\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking space for each\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 3\nJune 20, 2005 County Zoning Ordinance\nii\nw/ Amendments through January 16, 2024\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nPage\nCELL (2, 1): \nSection 304 Residential Districts\nCELL (2, 2): \n36\nCELL (3, 1): \nA.
