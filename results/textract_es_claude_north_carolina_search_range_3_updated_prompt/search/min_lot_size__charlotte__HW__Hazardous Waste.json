This district provides for a variety of neighborhood-\noriented retail and service uses intermixed with high density residential uses.

Emphasis in the district is\nplaced upon creating a pedestrian scale urban environment with strong linkages to the\nneighborhood and access to transit.\nSection 11.502.
