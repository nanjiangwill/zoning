The Zoning Code Administrator shall\nreview this study and any other traffic engineering and planning data relevant to the\nestablishment of an appropriate off-street parking standard for the proposed use. A parking\nstudy must include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute\nof Traffic Engineers (ITE) and/or other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of\nuses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be\ndetermined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study must\ndocument the source of data used to develop the recommendations.
