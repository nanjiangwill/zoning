This will be achieved\nby ensuring safe, convenient, and comfortable trails, sidewalks, and pathways which provide\nopportunities for exercise, help people meet and socialize, and give children and others who\ndo not drive mobility options.\nB) Applicability.\nBicycle and pedestrian facilities shall be installed prior to the issuance of a certificate of\noccupancy permit unless an owner or developer is eligible for an agreement or is exempted\nby subsections D and E of this section. All new residential and commercial developments\nwithin the Town and extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) limits shall comply with the following:\n1) All the applicable requirements of the Town of Beaufort's Manual for Design and\nConstruction of Streets;\n2) Carteret County's Comprehensive Transportation Plan;\n3) The Town of Beaufort, NC Comprehensive Bicycle Plan;\n4) AASHTO Bicycle and Pedestrian Guidelines;\n5) NCDOT guidelines;\n6) The standards of this Ordinance; and\n7) Any/all other adopted Town policies and plans.\nC) Configuration.\nBicycle and pedestrian facilities shall be configured using the following standards:\n1) Bicycle facilities shall be at least eight feet (8') wide and shall be constructed of concrete,\nasphalt, brick, textured pavers, or a combination of these materials; and\n2) Pedestrian facility street crossings at all intersections may be raised above adjacent street\nlevels as a traffic calming measure. When used, pedestrian crossings may be raised above\nthe pavement and shall be of a different contrasting material or be striped for safety; and\n3) Bicycle and pedestrian facilities shall connect with existing or planned facilities at\nproperty boundaries; and\n4)\nNew nonresidential mixed use and multi-family developments shall provide at least one\nimproved on-site connection between the new development and the existing adjacent\npublic bicycle and pedestrian system; and,\n5) Except in areas where asphalt, brick, or pavers are used, all public bicycle and pedestrian\nfacilities shall maintain a brushed concrete finish for safety.\nD) Flexibility in Administration Required.\nThe Town Board of Commissioners (BOC) recognizes as a result of the particularities of any\ngiven development, the inflexible application of subsection C of this section may result in a\ndevelopment with either insufficient facilities or one who cannot reasonably comply with the\nstandards herein. In addition there may be other suitable construction methods or materials\navailable as technology advances. Therefore the planning director, after consultation with\nthe director of the Town's Public Works Department, may accept or require alternate designs,\nconstruction methods, and materials not specifically prescribed herein. Whenever such\n170\n\nNEW PAGE 195\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\nflexibility is utilized, the reasons and specific conditions which are imposed shall be\ndocumented. In addition the Town's Planning Director may impose specific conditions when\ngranting flexibility.\nE) Exemptions.\nBicycle facilities shall not be required when:\n1) The planning director determines an existing adjacent greenway or multi-purpose trail\nprovides a superior level of pedestrian connectivity; and/or,\n2)\nConstruction of a lot which was a part of a subdivision previously approved by Carteret\nCounty prior to expansion of the ETJ and which was not designed to accommodate\nbicycle facilities due to road ditches or other such situations.\n171\n\nNEW PAGE 196\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\nSECTION 18\nSite Plan Standards for Commercial & Residential\nStructures with over 5,000 square feet\nA) Purpose.\nIt is the intent of this section to promote the public health, safety, and welfare of the\ncommunity by reviewing development proposals.\nB) Site Plan Review Required.\n1) Staff Review.\nSubmission of a site plan shall be required for the following developments:\nIn all zoning districts, any use or combination of uses which:\na) Involves the new construction or placement of a building or structure of five thousand\nsquare feet (5,000 ft2) or more in gross floor area; or\nb)\nEntails a twenty percent (20%) or greater increase in gross floor area and results in a\nbuilding or combination of buildings of five thousand square feet (5,000 ft2 or more\nin gross floor area.\n2) Planning Board and Board of Commissioners Review.\nSubmission of a site plan to be reviewed by the planning board and the Board of\nCommissioners (BOC) shall be required for the following types of developments:\na) Any use for which a vested right is sought.\nb) Any special use as may be required in this Ordinance.\nc) Any commercial use which results in a structure or building of five thousand\nsquare feet (5,000 ft2) or more in gross floor area.\nd) Any commercial use involving the construction, reconstruction, replacement, or\nre-development of a commercial dock, or a pending application for a major\nCAMA permit.\nC) Site Plan Submission.\nPlans and applications shall be submitted for review along with a reasonable fee as set in the\nfee schedule adopted by the BOC.

Beaufort\nSECTION 13\nParking Requirements\nA) Intent.\nThese regulations are intended to provide off-street parking, stacking, and loading facilities\nin proportion to the need created by each use. These regulations are intended to provide for\naccommodation vehicles in a functionally and aesthetically satisfactory manner and to\nminimize external effects on adjacent land uses.\nB) Number of Parking Spaces Required.\n1) Limitations.\nAll developments in all zoning districts other than the Historic Business District and the\nHistoric Waterfront Business District (H-BD & H-WBD) shall provide a sufficient\nnumber of parking spaces to accommodate the number of vehicles which ordinarily are\nlikely to be attracted to the development in question. For any mixed-use development\ncreated after the adoption of this Ordinance who cannot meet the residential off-street\nparking requirement for their proposed development, the owner/developer shall be\nrequired to contribute $10,000 per parking space needed into a parking fund which will\nbe used by the Town to acquire property as it becomes available for off-street parking for\nthese residential purposes.\n2) Presumptions.\nThe presumptions established by this section are established in all other zoning districts:\na) A development must comply with the parking standards set forth in subsection B-4\nof this section to satisfy the requirement stated in subsection B-1 lof this section; and,\nb) Any development which meets these standards is in compliance. However, Table 13-\n1 of this section is only intended to establish a presumption of parking demand and\nshould be flexibly administered, as provided in subsection C of this section.\n3) Standards.\nStandards set forth in Table 13-1 of this section are indicated by the respective land uses\nassociated within the development. When a determination of the number of parking\nspaces required by this table results in a fractional parking space, any fraction of one-half\nor less may be disregarded, while a fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one\nadditional parking space.\n4) Table of Parking Requirements.\nTable 13-1 of this section shall prescribe the number of parking spaces required for the\nrespective uses when the existing or proposed development is less than twenty-five\nthousand square feet (25,000 ft2). For all existing, proposed, or combination thereof\nof\ndevelopment which is twenty-five thousand square feet (25,000 ft2) or more, there shall\nbe a corresponding twenty percent (20%) decrease in the number of parking spaces\nrequired for this actual use. Table 13-1of this section cannot and does not cover every\npossible situation which may arise. Therefore, in cases not specifically covered, the\npermit issuing authority is authorized to determine the parking requirements using the\nfollowing table as a guide.\n136\n\nNEW PAGE 161\nLand

citizens to use their\nresidence for limited nonresidential activities. However, the Town believes the need to\nprotect the integrity of residential areas is of paramount concern. A \"home occupation\"\nzoning provision, therefore, should protect residential areas from adverse impacts resulting\nfrom activities associated with home occupations. It is important to allow but to also to\nregulate some nonresidential activities in the Town's residential districts. In essence, a \"home\noccupation\" is a limited commercial-type activity in a residential area to an extent no\nneighbors or passersby will be aware, by outward appearance, of the activity. In practice, a\n\"home occupation\" gives the resident the legal right to use ones' residence for limited\nbusiness activities but not to the extent significant pedestrian and vehicular traffic is\ngenerated.\nB) Performance Criteria.\nA home occupation shall meet the following minimum conditions:\n1) The activity shall not be inconsistent with the use of the premises as dwelling.\n2) Only residents of the dwelling unit shall work there.\n3) There shall be no exterior evidence of the conduct of a home occupation, except as\nspecified in subsection C of this section. Thus, there may be no display of products visible\nin any manner from the outside of the home.\n4) A home occupation shall be conducted in an enclosed area of a primary or accessory\nstructure. It shall not occupy over twenty-five percent (25%) of the combined floor space\nof the primary and accessory structures. No portion of a home occupation shall be\nconducted outside the primary residence or accessory structure.\n5) Electrical or mechanical equipment which creates electromagnetic interference or causes\nfluctuations in line voltage outside the dwelling unit or creates noise not normally\nassociated with residential uses shall be prohibited.\n6) On-site sale of goods or services not produced on the premises shall be prohibited.\n7)\nA home occupation shall not create a significant increase, as determined by the zoning\nadministrator, in vehicular or pedestrian traffic to the residence.\n8)\nA home occupation shall not require additional off-street parking spaces for clients or\ncustomers of the home occupation.\n9) No home occupation shall result in garbage disposal exceeding standard residential use.\n10) No equipment or process shall be used in a home occupation which creates noise,\nvibration, glare, fumes, or odor detectable to the normal senses off the property.\nC) Permitted Signs.\nMore information on signs can be found in section 16 of this Ordinance. An indirectly lighted\nname plate or professional sign not over one square foot (1 ft2 in area and attached flat against\nthe building shall be permitted in connection with an incidental home occupation.\nD) Inspections.\nAn inspector shall have the right at any time, upon reasonable request and with the consent\nof the property owner, to enter and inspect the premises for safety and compliance purposes.\n135\n\nNEW PAGE 160\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\nSECTION 13\nParking Requirements\nA) Intent.\nThese regulations are intended to provide off-street parking, stacking, and loading facilities\nin proportion to the need created by each use. These regulations are intended to provide for\naccommodation vehicles in a functionally and aesthetically satisfactory manner and to\nminimize external effects on adjacent land uses.\nB) Number of Parking Spaces Required.\n1) Limitations.\nAll developments in all zoning districts other than the Historic Business District and the\nHistoric Waterfront Business District (H-BD & H-WBD) shall provide a sufficient\nnumber of parking spaces to accommodate the number of vehicles which ordinarily are\nlikely to be attracted to the development in question. For any mixed-use development\ncreated after the adoption of this Ordinance who cannot meet the residential off-street\nparking requirement for their proposed development, the owner/developer shall be\nrequired to contribute $10,000 per parking space needed into a parking fund which will\nbe used by the Town to acquire property as it becomes available for off-street parking for\nthese residential purposes.\n2) Presumptions.\nThe presumptions established by this section are established in all other zoning districts:\na) A development must comply with the parking standards set forth in subsection B-4\nof this section to satisfy the requirement stated in subsection B-1 lof this section; and,\nb) Any development which meets these standards is in compliance. However, Table 13-\n1 of this section is only intended to establish a presumption of parking demand and\nshould be flexibly administered, as provided in subsection C of this section.\n3) Standards.\nStandards set forth in Table 13-1 of this section are indicated by the respective land uses\nassociated within the development. When a determination of the number of parking\nspaces required by this table results in a fractional parking space, any fraction of one-half\nor less may be disregarded, while a fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one\nadditional parking space.\n4) Table of Parking Requirements.\nTable 13-1 of this section shall prescribe the number of parking spaces required for the\nrespective uses when the existing or proposed development is less than twenty-five\nthousand square feet (25,000 ft2). For all existing, proposed, or combination thereof\nof\ndevelopment which is twenty-five thousand square feet (25,000 ft2) or more, there shall\nbe a corresponding twenty percent (20%) decrease in the number of parking spaces\nrequired for this actual use. Table 13-1of this section cannot and does not cover every\npossible situation which may arise. Therefore, in cases not specifically covered, the\npermit issuing authority is authorized to determine the parking requirements using the\nfollowing table as a guide.\n136\n\nNEW PAGE 161\nLand
