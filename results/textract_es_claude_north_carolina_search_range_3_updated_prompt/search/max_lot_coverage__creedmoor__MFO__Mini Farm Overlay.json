With the exception of Natural and Agricultural Open Space, open\nspace shall be planned and improved, accessible and usable by persons living nearby. Improved shall\nmean cleared of underbrush and debris and shall contain landscaped areas designated for both active\nand passive recreational pursuits. At least 25% of the improved open space land shall be dedicated to\nactive recreation purposes such as playgrounds, tennis courts, ball fields, volleyball courts, etc. The\nbalance of the open space park area may be designed for passive recreation.\n21.2-4 DESIGN AND LOCATION. In major subdivisions and multi-building developments in all zoning districts\nexcept Agricultural, open space shall be integrated into the design of the site. In subdivisions where\n50% or more of the lots are less than 0.75 acre in size, open space shall be located within 1/4 mile of at\nleast 90% of the building lots, as measured along the rights-of-way of streets providing access between\nthe two. In subdivisions where 50% or more of the lots are 0.75 acre or more in size, open space shall\nbe located within 1/2 mile of at least 90% of the building lots, as measured along the rights-of-way of\nstreets providing access between the two.\n21.2-5 FOCAL POINT. Open space features should provide focal points for the neighborhood. A central square\nor green, for example, may comprise a majority of the open space. There should be a hierarchy of open\nspace within new neighborhoods so that open space serves the needs of multiple age groups.\n21.2-6 TYPES OF OPEN SPACE. Open space types include Squares, Parks, Forecourts, Plazas, Greenways, and\nNatural and Agricultural. Standards for these open space types are set forth below.\nA. SQUARES\nSquares are areas for passive recreational use. Squares shall be bounded by streets on a minimum of\nthree sides or 75% of their perimeter.\nSquares should be used in tight urban environments where residents have little yard space. Squares\nare used to bring a more natural landscape into an urban environment. As such, not more than 25%\nof a square should be impervious surface coverage. Hardscaping should be decorative (example brick\npavers instead of asphalt for walkways).\nMin size: 500 sq. feet\nMax Size: 2 acres\nB. PARKS\nParks are areas for passive or active recreational use. Parks should be bounded by streets on a\nminimum of two sides or 50% of their perimeter.\nMinimum Size: 6,500 square feet\nArticle 21 - Page 2\n\nNEW PAGE 281\nMaximum Size: 8 Acres. Maximum size may exceed eight acres if the park serves multiple\nneighborhoods or preserves environmental features.\nParks should be areas where passive and active recreation occur simultaneously (example: park\nbenches for elderly and a tot-lot for young children), encouraging intergenerational interactions among\npark users.\nC. FORECOURT\nForecourts are open spaces that act as buffers between residential buildings and streets or non-\nresidential buildings. Forecourts are entirely bounded by buildings or streets. It is recommended that\nforecourts be planted parallel to all street right-of-ways.\nMinimum Size: 500 sq. feet\nMaximum Size: 1.5 acre\nD. PLAZA\nA plaza is an open area adjacent to a civic or commercial building. Plazas should be planted with\ndeciduous trees to provide shade in the summer (example: the NC State Capital Building lawn in\nRaleigh, NC). Plazas function as gathering places and may incorporate a variety of non-permanent\nactivities such as outdoor farmers markets or craft fairs. Limited parking is permissible on plazas.\nPlazas should match the architectural style of the buildings that they are adjacent to regarding\nmaterials and design. Plazas shall be level or gently sloping.\nMinimum Size: none\nMaximum Size: none\nE. GREENWAYS\nGreenways are spaces designed to incorporate natural settings such as creeks and significant stands of\ntrees within a neighborhood. Greenways shall have streets or pedestrian ROWs parallel to or\nintegrated into at least 75% of their length. Greenways are used for walking, jogging, biking, and they\nare used as wildlife corridors. Greenways may have infrequent small-scale active recreational facilities\nArticle 21 - Page 3\n\nNEW PAGE 282\nsuch as playgrounds, although the majority of greenways shall be for passive, pedestrian and/or bicycle\nrecreation.\nF.\nNATURAL AND AGRICULTURAL OPEN SPACE\nNatural and Agricultural Open Space preserves agricultural lands, environmentally sensitive areas,\nscenic views, cultural features, and rural character that would likely be lost through conventional\ndevelopment approaches. To accomplish this goal, the City of Creedmoor encourages creativity and\nallows for greater flexibility in the design of developments through use of the Mini-Farm Overlay\nDistrict and conditional zoning districts (Article 8).\nNatural and Agricultural Open Space shall be placed in preserves, which may adjoin housing areas that\nhave been designed more compactly to create larger areas that may be enjoyed equally by all residents\nof the neighborhood.\n21.2-7 OPEN SPACE OWNERSHIP AND CONSERVATION EASEMENT. Open space shall be owned or\nadministered by one or a combination of the following methods: fee simple ownership by a private\nnon-profit land conservancy; owned by a homeowners association; or by individual private ownership\nsuch as a farmer, developer or other private entity that maintains the open space (i.e. farming,\nequestrian facility, etc.)\nAll lands within areas required to be maintained as open space shall be protected by a permanent\nconservation easement, prohibiting further development, and setting other standards safeguarding the\nsite's special resources from negative changes.\nPublic use of the open space may be limited to residents of the development, except for land used for\npublic sidewalks and multi-use trails, provided that such open space is held in private or association\nownership.\n21.2-8 MAINTENANCE. The owner or lessee of the property designated as the open space shall be responsible\nfor the maintenance of the open space area. Landscaped areas shall be maintained in good condition\nand the entire area shall be kept clear of debris. Failure to maintain the area shall constitute a violation\nof this ordinance and subject the violator to the penalty provisions of Article 23 if not corrected within\n30 days of notification. Alternatively, if acceptable to the City, as applicable, the land may be dedicated\nto the City for public use and thereafter maintained by the City.\n21.2-9 LAND ACCEPTABLE FOR OPEN SPACE DESIGNATION. The classes of land enumerated below may be\nutilized to meet the requirements of this section.\nA. Open water, wetlands, utility transmission right-of-ways, and undisturbed floodplains may account\nfor up to twenty percent (20%) of the area requirement.\nB. Land used for public sidewalks significantly in excess of standard sidewalk requirements,\nstreetscape and hardscape areas accessible to the public including sidewalk cafe areas, areas\ncontaining public art, and similar urban open space amenities.\nC.\nLand on which locally or nationally designated historic structures are located and determined to\nbe contributing to the designation.\nD. Land which exceeds a 10 percent slope may be used to provide up to 50 percent (50%) of the\nrequired open space if existing slopes and vegetation so designated remain undisturbed.\nE. Land used for stormwater retention, provided such land is natural in appearance and is not\nseparately fenced, may be used for up to ten percent (10%) of the required open space.\nF. Reserved.\nG.\nLand that is suitable for agriculture, land that has environmentally sensitive areas (ex. mature\nArticle 21 - Page 4\n", "page_number": 280, "page_range": [280, 281, 282], "highlight": ["As such, not more than 25%\nof a square should be impervious surface <em>coverage</em>.", "encourages creativity and\nallows for greater flexibility in the design of developments through use of the <em>Mini</em>-<em>Farm</em>", "<em>Overlay</em>\nDistrict and conditional zoning districts (Article 8).", "Land which exceeds a 10 <em>percent</em> slope may be used to provide up to 50 <em>percent</em> (50%) of the\nrequired open", "provided such land is natural in appearance and is not\nseparately fenced, may be used for up to ten <em>percent</em>"], "score": 12.141484, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Mini Farm Overlay\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MFO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MFO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"MFO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building area as % of lot\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"pervious surface\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"percent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"%\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per cent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ratio\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [151, 152, 153, 280, 281, 282]}
