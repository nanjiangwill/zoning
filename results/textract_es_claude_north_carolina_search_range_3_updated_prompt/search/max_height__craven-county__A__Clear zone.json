The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of 5,000 feet radii for all runways designated utility or\nvisual and 10,000 feet for all others from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the\nadjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.\n(f) Conical zone. The conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends\noutward from the horizontal zone at a slope of 20 to one for a distance of 4,000 feet.\n(3) Airport height zone restrictions. Except as otherwise provided in this division, no structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained\nin\nany zone created by this division, to a height in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for such zone. Such\n34 of 47\n4/22/24, 19:19\n\nNEW PAGE 35\nCraven County, NC Code of Ordinances\napplicable height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows:\n(a) Utility runway visual approach zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same\nelevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.\n(b) Non-precision instrument approach zone. Slopes 34 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the\nsame elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway\ncenterline.\n(c) Precision instrument runway approach zone. Slopes 50 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the\nsame elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway\ncenterline; thence slopes outward 40 feet horizontally for each foot vertically to an additional horizontal distance of 40,000 feet\nalong the extended runway centerline.\n(d) Transitional zone. Slopes seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the\nprimary surface and the approach surface and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation, which is 19.0 feet\nabove mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot\nupward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface and extending to where they intersect the\nconical surface. Where the precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are established\nheight limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the\napproach surface and extending a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90-degree angles to the extended runway\ncenterline.\n(e) Horizontal zone. Established at 150 feet above the airport elevation or at a height of 169.0 feet above mean sea level.\n(f) Conical zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet\nabove the airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation, 369.0 feet above mean sea level.\n(g) Excepted height limitations. Nothing in this division shall be construed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any\nstructure to a height up to 50 feet above the surface of the land. This exception would only apply to construction or\nmaintenance of structures outside of the approach surface.\n(4) Airport zoning and height control zones.

Such zones are shown on the Craven County Zoning and Height Control Map consisting of one sheet, prepared by Holland\nConsulting Planners, Inc., and The LPA Group of North Carolina, P.A., and dated July 1, 2006, which is by reference made a part of\nthis division. A lot located in more than one zoning and height control zone is considered to be only in the zone with the more\nrestrictive limitation; the airport zone is more restrictive than the airport development - mixed-use zone. The various zoning and\nheight control zones are hereby established and defined as follows:\n(a) Airport zone. This zone is intended to be applied to properties which lie within the runway protection zones (RPZ), building\nrestriction line, and all property owned by the airport. The zone is intended to regulate the development of land uses which are\nincompatible with safe airport operation.\n(b)\nAirport development-Mixed-use zone. This zone allows the development of mixed land uses which will not be hazardous or in\nany way detrimental to safe airport operation. The purpose of the zone is to protect the safety and welfare of the airport and\nthe residents of Craven County.\n(5) Airport zoning and height control zone restrictions. Airport and airport development-mixed use zones shall allow permitted uses as\ndefined by this section. All uses not specifically allowed as permitted uses are prohibited unless allowed as a special use as\nspecified in subsection (a)(2) of this subsection.\n(a) Airport zone.\n1. Airport zone permitted uses. The following uses are permitted by right unless the use would violate the height limitations\nas defined in subsection (4):\na. All agricultural uses including the commercial raising of animals or fowl which would not adversely affect safe airport\noperations.\nb. Landscape nursery, cemetery, and low intensity or open recreation areas, which do not include buildings or structures.\nC. Roadways, parking areas, and storage yards when located in such a manner that vehicle lights will not make it difficult\nfor pilots to distinguish between landing lights and vehicle lights, result in glare, or in any other way impair visibility in\nthe vicinity of the landing approach.\nd. Game preserve or reservation.\ne. Pipeline.\nf.\n36 of 47\n4/22/24, 19:19\n\nNEW PAGE 37\nCraven County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nUnderground utility wire.\ng. Airports and accessory uses.\nh. Government uses.\n2. Airport zone special uses. In addition to the permitted uses, all uses permitted by right in the airport development - mixed-\nuse zone shall be allowed as special uses within the airport zone except for multi-family dwellings, manufactured home\nparks, single-family dwelling units, or gatherings not accessory to airport use or function. All special uses shall be\ncompatible with future expansion of airport infrastructure and safe airport operations and ensure that it does not violate\nthe height limitations as defined in subsection (4). A special use permit may be approved or denied by the board of\ncommissioners based on these criteria. Section 41-254 provides the procedures and requirements for special use approval.\n3. Additional airport zone use limitations. The following limitations shall apply to all uses within the airport zone:\na.\nNo glare-producing materials shall be used on the exterior of any building or structure located within the airport zone.\nb. The requirements of this subsection shall not be construed to require a property owner to remove, lower, or make\nother changes or alterations of any structure which legally existed prior to the effective date of this division. However,\nsuch structure shall be considered nonconforming if such structure is in conflict with these regulations.\nC. The Coastal Carolina Regional Airport Manager shall have the opportunity to review applications for rezoning,\nsubdivision, or site plan approval prior to a decision by the approving authority. In approving such applications for\nrezoning, subdivision, or site plan approval, the approving authority may consider recommendations from the airport\nmanager.\nd. Nonconforming uses may be continued subject to the regulations found elsewhere in this division. However, no\nbuilding permit shall be issued which would allow a greater hazard (for example: more units, or brighter lighting) to\nairport safety than existed at the time of adoption of this division.\ne. The following lighting is specifically prohibited:\n(i) Any moving, pulsating, flashing, rotating, or oscillating light, which may interfere with air traffic other than\nnavigational markings or lights marking potential obstructions in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration\nrequirements.\n(ii) Flood lights, spotlights, or other lighting devices which are not shielded so as to prevent illumination in an upward\n37 of 47\n4/22/24, 19:19\n", "page_number": 35, "page_range": [35, 36, 37], "highlight": ["the\nprimary surface and the approach surface and extending to <em>a</em> <em>height</em> of 150 <em>feet</em> above the airport", "In addition to the foregoing, there are established <em>height</em> limits sloping seven <em>feet</em> outward for each", "Established at 150 <em>feet</em> above the airport elevation or at <em>a</em> <em>height</em> of 169.0 <em>feet</em> above mean sea level", "150 <em>feet</em>\nabove the airport elevation and extending to <em>a</em> <em>height</em> of 350 <em>feet</em> above the airport elevation", "<em>height</em> up to 50 <em>feet</em> above the surface of the land."], "score": 3.1135705, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Clear zone\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"A\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"A\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"A\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [10, 11, 12, 19, 20, 21, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]}
