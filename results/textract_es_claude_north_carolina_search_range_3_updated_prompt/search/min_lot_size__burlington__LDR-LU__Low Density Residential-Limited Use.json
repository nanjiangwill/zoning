Land in any conventional, conditional, or limited use zoning district may also be classified into one or\nmore \"overlay\" zoning districts.\n3. In cases where land is within an overlay zoning district, the standards in the overlay district apply in\naddition to the standards governing development in the underlying conventional, conditional, or limited\nuse zoning district.\n4.

DETERMINATION OF OFFICIAL ZONING MAP BOUNDARIES\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\nThe Planning Director shall be responsible for determination of boundaries on the Official Zoning Map in\naccordance with the standards in Section 2.4.F, Determination, and the following standards:\n1. Boundaries shown as approximately following a utility line or a street, alley, railroad, or other public\naccessway shall be interpreted as following the centerline of the right-of-way or easement for\nthe\nutility line or accessway.\n2. If a street, alley, railroad, or utility easement forming the boundary between two separate zoning\ndistricts is abandoned or removed from dedication, the district boundaries shall be construed as\nfollowing the centerline of the abandoned or vacated roadbed or utility easement.\n3. Boundaries shown as approximately following a lot line shall be interpreted as following the lot line as\nit existed when the boundary was established. If a subsequent minor adjustment (such as from\nsettlement of a boundary dispute or overlap) results in the lot line moving 10 feet or less, the zoning\nboundary shall be interpreted as moving with the lot line.\n4. Boundaries shown as approximately following a river, stream, canal, lake, or other watercourse shall\nbe interpreted as following the centerline of the watercourse as it actually exists, and as moving with\nthat centerline to the extent the watercourse moves as a result of natural processes (flooding, erosion,\nsedimentation, etc.).\n5. Boundaries shown parallel to or as extensions of features indicated in this subsection shall be\ninterpreted as such.\n6. Boundaries shown as following the boundary of the City limits shall be interpreted as following the\nboundary of municipal incorporation.\n7. Wherever a single lot is located within two or more different zoning districts, each portion of the lot\nshall be subject to all the regulations applicable to the zoning district where it is located.\n8.\nIf the specific location of a depicted boundary cannot be determined from application of the above\nstandards, it shall be determined by using the Official Zoning Map's scale to determine the boundary's\ndistance from other features shown on the map.\n9. Where the actual location of existing physical or natural features vary from that shown on the Official\nZoning Map, or in other circumstances that are not covered by this subsection, the Planning Director\nshall have the authority to determine the district boundaries.\nCity of Burlington\n3-7\nUnified Development Ordinance\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\n", "page_number": 127,
