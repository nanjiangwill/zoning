IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\nSection 15-137 Manufacturing Districts Established. (AMENDED 6/22/82; 2/4/86)\n(1)\nThe M-1 and M-2 districts are hereby created to accomplish the purposes and serve\nthe objectives set forth in this subsection. Part of Article XI contains performance standards that place\nlimitations on the characteristics of uses located in the districts created by this section.\n(a)\nM-1 LIGHT MANUFACTURING This zone is designed to accommodate a\nlimited range of industrial activities and a wide range of commercial uses\nincluding wholesaling, storage, mail-order, auto related, and office and retail\nin conjunction with industrial or wholesaling uses. Permitted industrial uses\ninclude enterprises engaged in manufacturing, processing, creating, repairing,\nrenovating, painting, cleaning and assembly where all operations are\ncontained inside a fully enclosed building. The performance standards for the\nM-1 zone located in Part I of Article XI are more restrictive than those in the\nM-2 district.\n(b)\nM-2 GENERAL MANUFACTURING This district is designed to accommodate\nthe widest range of industrial uses. Business operations may be conducted\nwithin and outside a fully enclosed building. The performance standards for\nthis zone are less restrictive than those in the M-1 district.\n(2)\nThere is also established a watershed light industrial (WM-3) zoning district. The\npurpose of this district is to allow areas within the University Lake Watershed that have been zoned\nM-1 prior to the effective date of this subdivision to continue to be used and developed for light\nindustrial and related purposes, subject to certain restrictions designed to protect the watershed.\nConsistent with the purpose of this zone, this district shall be confined to that area zoned M-1 on the\neffective date of this subsection (12/7/1983); this area shall not be expanded and no new WM-3 areas\nshall be designated. For the purposes of this section, changes to make WM-3 zoning uniform on lots\nthat were depicted as entirely within the M-1 zoning at the time of its establishment, but that were\nlater depicted as being bisected by the zoning boundary, will not be considered an expansion of the\ndistrict or the creation of new WM-3 areas. (AMENDED 12/7/83; 06/27/17)\n(3)\nThere is also established a Planned Industrial Development (PID) zoning district. The\npurpose of this district is to provide for the possibility of well-planned and tightly controlled industrial\ndevelopment in areas that are suitable for such development but that are not deemed appropriate for\nM-1 or M-2 zoning because of the less restricted types of development that may occur in such zones.\n(AMENDED 6/22/82; 12/7/83)\n(a)\nNo area less than twenty contiguous acres may be zoned as a Planned\nIndustrial Development district, and then only upon a request submitted by or\non behalf of the owner or owners of all the property intended to be covered by\nsuch zone.\nPage #7\n\nNEW PAGE 8\nArt. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\n(b)\nAs indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses (Section 15-146) a planned\nindustrial development (use classification 30.000) is the only permissible use\nin a PID zone.\n(c)\nSubject to subdivision (2) of this subsection, and consistent with the\nrestrictions contained in the definition of a planned industrial development\n[see Subdivision 15-15], land within a PID zone may be used in a manner that\nwould be permissible if the land were zoned M-1, except that (i) the only\npermissible uses are those described in the 2.130 and 4.100 classifications and\n(ii) the performance standards (Article XI, Part I) applicable to 4.100 uses in\nbusiness zones shall govern uses in a planned industrial development.\nSection 15-138 Public Facilities District Established.\nThere is hereby created a Public Facilities (P-F) zoning district. Within this district, those\nuses indicated as permissible in the Table of Permissible Uses may be developed, but only if such\ndevelopments are owned and operated by the United States, the State of North Carolina, Orange\nCounty, the Town of Carrboro, or any agency, department, or subdivision of the foregoing\ngovernments.\nSection 15-139 Planned Unit Development District Established.\n(1)\nThere are hereby established sixty different Planned Unit Development (PUD) zoning\ndistricts as described in this section. Each PUD zoning district is designed to combine the\ncharacteristics of at least two and possibly three zoning districts. (AMENDED 2/24/87)\n(a)\nOne element of each PUD district shall be the residential element. Here there\nare six possibilities, each one corresponding to one of the following residential\ndistricts identified in Section 15-135: R-20, R-15, R-10, R-7.5, R-3, or\nR- S.I.R. Within that portion of the PUD zone that is developed for purposes\npermissible in a residential district, all development must be in accordance\nwith the regulations applicable to the residential zoning district to which the\nparticular PUD zoning district corresponds.\n(b)\nA second element of each PUD district shall be the commercial element. Here\nthere are five possibilities, each one corresponding to either the B-1(g), B-2,\nB-3, O, or O/A zoning districts established by Section 15-136. Within that\nportion of a PUD district that is developed for purposes permissible in a\ncommercial district, all development must be in accordance with the\nregulations applicable to the commercial district to which the PUD district\ncorresponds. (AMENDED 2/04/97)\n(c)\nA manufacturing/processing element may be a third element of any PUD\ndistrict. Here there are two alternatives. The first is that uses permitted within\nthe M-1 district would be permitted within the PUD district. The second\nalternative is that uses permitted only within the M-1 or M-2 zoning districts\nPage #8\n", "page_number": 6, "page_range": [6, 7, 8], "highlight": ["zoning district is designed to protect

(AMENDED 6/21/16)\n(a)\nA site specific, flexible zoning district (FLX) may be established in accordance\nwith the provisions of this section. The purpose of such a district is to establish detailed standards\nfor alternative possibilities for the development of a specific tract of land, thereby facilitating the\ndevelopment of that property according to the demands of the market, but in a way that is consistent\nwith sound planning and the promotion of the public health, safety, and welfare.\n(b)\nTo be considered for FLX zoning, a tract must (i) be at least twenty-five acres in\nsize, (ii) be, as a whole, owned by or under control or option to be purchased by one or more\nindividuals or entities, (iii) be located adjacent to a major arterial such that, when developed, the\nprincipal entrance to such development will be from that arterial, (iv) have been the subject of a\nsite specific planning study by the Town to determine the most appropriate potential development\noptions for such tract. As used herein, the term \"site specific planning study\" shall mean a\ncollaborative programmatic and design study for the site performed either by, or with the\nparticipation of the Town and input from one or more workshops, which shall result in a narrative\nreport and conceptual master plan describing in general terms how the site might be developed and\nhow the conceptual master plan corresponds to and addresses applicable components of all town\nplans for the area, and applicable conditions, and (v) be located in an area that is subject to an\nadopted small area plan.\n(1)\nIf the Town receives a request for FLX zoning for a tract that has not been\nthe subject of a site specific planning study as described in Subsection\n(b)(iv) above, the Planning Director shall present to the Town Council a\nproposal for undertaking such a study before accepting a formal application\nfor the rezoning. If the Town Council accepts the proposal, the site specific\nplanning study shall proceed as described in the following subsections, or\nas otherwise directed by the Council.\na. The site specific planning study shall be structured as a charrette of a\nminimum of one day in duration, or more as determined by the Council.\nb. The Town shall contract a design professional, with no ties to the\napplicant, to conduct the charrette. The Town may also contract with a\nqualified facilitator to oversee the charrette process and final reports\nprepared from the charrette process.\nC.\nParticipation shall include representatives from advisory boards,\nneighbors, and members of the public.\nd. Notice of the date of the charrette will be mailed to residents and\nproperty owners within 1000 feet of the subject property, published in\nthe newspaper as well and any other means the Town deems suitable.\n(2)\nFindings from the site specific planning study report, or narrative, and site\nplan(s) shall be presented to the Town Council. Subsequent requests for\nPage #26\n\nNEW PAGE 27\nArt. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\nFLX zoning shall demonstrate compliance with the findings from the site\nspecific planning study.\n(3)\nIf more than five years have elapsed since the findings from the site specific\nplanning study were presented to the Council and the circumstances relating\nto the study have substantially changed, the Council may request an update\nto the study before accepting a request for FLX zoning. Examples of\nsubstantial changes in circumstances include but are not limited to:\nannexation, some or all of the tracts has been subject to a rezoning, unrelated\nto the FLX district, that increases residential density or changes the types of\nuses, (i.e. residential to commercial), development on surrounding\nproperties has changed the character or capacity of existing infrastructure.\n(c)\nA FLX zoning district shall address the following:\n(1)\nThe types of uses that are permissible within the FLX district, along with a\nmaximum (and if applicable, a minimum) percentage of the gross land area\nthat will be devoted to each such use. The description of uses may be in\nreference to the use classification numbers set forth in the Table of\nPermissible Uses, or the uses may otherwise be described. The district\nregulations may also establish density or intensity limitations (expressed in\nterms of a maximum and/or, if applicable, a minimum number of dwelling\nunits or square feet of building floor area, and applicable ratios, if any if\ndifferent types of uses within the district).\n(2)\nThe dimensional restrictions (building height, minimum lot size, setbacks)\nthat shall apply throughout the district. Different restrictions may apply to\ndifferent portions of the district, depending on the uses located therein. The\ndimensional restrictions may be described by reference to those applicable\nwithin particular zoning districts, or otherwise.\n(3)\nAny limitations on the areas within the district where particular types of\nuses may be allowed.\n(4)\nAny architectural standards that will apply to all or designated portions of\nthe district.\n(5)\nAny limitations on the timing or sequence of development of various\nportions of the district.\n(6)\nThe location of entrances to and exits from the tract zoned FLX.\n(7)\nThe manner in which the development of the property will comply with the\nstormwater requirements set forth in Article XVI, Part II. All developed lots\nwithin the district shall be subject to these standards, regardless of the\namount of land disturbance, but the FLX district may allow the necessary\nPage #27\n\nNEW PAGE 28\nArt.

In the case of conflict, the provisions of this ordinance or of the specific\nFLX district ordinance for the tract shall apply.\n(f)\nA text amendment establishing a FLX district as well as a map amendment applying\nsuch district to a particular tract shall be initiated and processed in accordance with the following\nprovisions:\n(1)\nThe owner of property who wishes to have such property zoned FLX shall\nsubmit a written request to the Town Council, identifying the subject\nproperty and explaining why the property is a good candidate for FLX\nzoning. This written request shall include or attach (i) relevant documents\n(i.e. narrative, and site plan(s) and a list of proposed conditions which may\nbe in the form of written statements, graphic illustrations, or any\ncombination thereof) that describe the results of the site specific planning\nprocess referred to in subsection (b)(iv) above, and (ii) an explanation as to\nwhy and how the proposed district is consistent with the Northern Study\nArea Plan, or if the property is not located within the Northern Study Area,\nsuch other plans or policies as may be applicable.

(AMENDED 6/21/16)\n(a)\nA site specific, flexible zoning district (FLX) may be established in accordance\nwith the provisions of this section. The purpose of such a district is to establish detailed standards\nfor alternative possibilities for the development of a specific tract of land, thereby facilitating the\ndevelopment of that property according to the demands of the market, but in a way that is consistent\nwith sound planning and the promotion of the public health, safety, and welfare.\n(b)\nTo be considered for FLX zoning, a tract must (i) be at least twenty-five acres in\nsize, (ii) be, as a whole, owned by or under control or option to be purchased by one or more\nindividuals or entities, (iii) be located adjacent to a major arterial such that, when developed, the\nprincipal entrance to such development will be from that arterial, (iv) have been the subject of a\nsite specific planning study by the Town to determine the most appropriate potential development\noptions for such tract. As used herein, the term \"site specific planning study\" shall mean a\ncollaborative programmatic and design study for the site performed either by, or with the\nparticipation of the Town and input from one or more workshops, which shall result in a narrative\nreport and conceptual master plan describing in general terms how the site might be developed and\nhow the conceptual master plan corresponds to and addresses applicable components of all town\nplans for the area, and applicable conditions, and (v) be located in an area that is subject to an\nadopted small area plan.\n(1)\nIf the Town receives a request for FLX zoning for a tract that has not been\nthe subject of a site specific planning study as described in Subsection\n(b)(iv) above, the Planning Director shall present to the Town Council a\nproposal for undertaking such a study before accepting a formal application\nfor the rezoning. If the Town Council accepts the proposal, the site specific\nplanning study shall proceed as described in the following subsections, or\nas otherwise directed by the Council.\na. The site specific planning study shall be structured as a charrette of a\nminimum of one day in duration, or more as determined by the Council.\nb. The Town shall contract a design professional, with no ties to the\napplicant, to conduct the charrette. The Town may also contract with a\nqualified facilitator to oversee the charrette process and final reports\nprepared from the charrette process.\nC.\nParticipation shall include representatives from advisory boards,\nneighbors, and members of the public.\nd. Notice of the date of the charrette will be mailed to residents and\nproperty owners within 1000 feet of the subject property, published in\nthe newspaper as well and any other means the Town deems suitable.\n(2)\nFindings from the site specific planning study report, or narrative, and site\nplan(s) shall be presented to the Town Council. Subsequent requests for\nPage #26\n\nNEW PAGE 27\nArt. IX ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\nFLX zoning shall demonstrate compliance with the findings from the site\nspecific planning study.\n(3)\nIf more than five years have elapsed since the findings from the site specific\nplanning study were presented to the Council and the circumstances relating\nto the study have substantially changed, the Council may request an update\nto the study before accepting a request for FLX zoning. Examples of\nsubstantial changes in circumstances include but are not limited to:\nannexation, some or all of the tracts has been subject to a rezoning, unrelated\nto the FLX district, that increases residential density or changes the types of\nuses, (i.e. residential to commercial), development on surrounding\nproperties has changed the character or capacity of existing infrastructure.\n(c)\nA FLX zoning district shall address the following:\n(1)\nThe types of uses that are permissible within the FLX district, along with a\nmaximum (and if applicable, a minimum) percentage of the gross land area\nthat will be devoted to each such use. The description of uses may be in\nreference to the use classification numbers set forth in the Table of\nPermissible Uses, or the uses may otherwise be described. The district\nregulations may also establish density or intensity limitations (expressed in\nterms of a maximum and/or, if applicable, a minimum number of dwelling\nunits or square feet of building floor area, and applicable ratios, if any if\ndifferent types of uses within the district).\n(2)\nThe dimensional restrictions (building height, minimum lot size, setbacks)\nthat shall apply throughout the district. Different restrictions may apply to\ndifferent portions of the district, depending on the uses located therein. The\ndimensional restrictions may be described by reference to those applicable\nwithin particular zoning districts, or otherwise.\n(3)\nAny limitations on the areas within the district where particular types of\nuses may be allowed.\n(4)\nAny architectural standards that will apply to all or designated portions of\nthe district.\n(5)\nAny limitations on the timing or sequence of development of various\nportions of the district.\n(6)\nThe location of entrances to and exits from the tract zoned FLX.\n(7)\nThe manner in which the development of the property will comply with the\nstormwater requirements set forth in Article XVI, Part II. All developed lots\nwithin the district shall be subject to these standards, regardless of the\namount of land disturbance, but the FLX district may allow the necessary\nPage #27\n", "page_number":
