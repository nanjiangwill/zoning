DESCRIPTION\nThe Lakeshore Planning Area is located at the entrance to Davidson from I-77, within\neasy walking and bicycling distance to large employment centers and downtown\nDavidson, and with ample access and vistas to Lake Norman, Lake Davidson, and\nLake Cornelius. The Lakeshore Planning Area contains opportunities for high density\nresidential development integrated within corporate, commercial and retail mixed-\nuse development. This planning area is within the state-mandated watershed overlay\ndistrict; thus the development should be higher and denser development with a smaller\nfootprint. Shorelines must be preserved for public use and aesthetic character.\nB. PERMITTED USES\nThe following table establishes the permitted uses for the Lakeshore Planning Area.

Where the watershed district boundary lies at a scaled distance of more than 25 feet from\nan adjoining lot line, the location of the watershed district boundary shall be determined\nby use of the scale appearing on the map.\n4. Where the watershed district boundaries lie at a scaled distance of twenty-five (25)\nfeet or less from any parallel lot line, the location of watershed area boundaries shall be\nconstrued to be the lot line.\n5. Where other uncertainty exists, the Planning Director shall interpret the Davidson\nWatershed Map to determine the location of such boundaries. This decision may be\nappealed to the Board of Adjustment.\n17.6 EXCEPTIONS TO APPLICABILITY\nNothing contained herein shall repeal, modify, or amend any Federal or State law or regulation,\nor any ordinance or regulation pertaining thereto except any ordinance which these regulations\nspecifically replace; nor restrict any provisions of the Davidson Planning Ordinance; however, the\nadoption of the Watershed Protection Ordinance shall and does amend any and all ordinances,\nresolutions, and regulations in effect within the planning jurisdiction of the Town of Davidson (as\ndepicted in the Davidson Planning Areas map) at the time of the adoption of the ordinance that\nmay be construed to impair or reduce the effectiveness of this ordinance or to conflict with any\nof its provisions.\nIt is not intended that these regulations interfere with any easement, covenant or other\nagreements between parties. However, if the provisions of these regulations impose greater\nrestrictions or higher standards for the use of a building or land, then the provisions of these\nregulations shall control. Nonconformitie shall follow the requirements of Section 12 of the\nDavidson Planning Ordinance.\n17.6.1 EXISTING DEVELOPMENT\nExisting development, as defined in this ordinance, is not subject to the requirements of this\nsection. Expansions to structures classified as existing development on any lot other than a lot\ncontaining a single-family residence as the principle use must meet the requirements of this\nordinance; however, the built-upon area of existing development is not required to be included\nin the impervious calculations (i.e. the maximum built-upon area). If structures classified as\nexisting development are removed, the parcel's built-upon-area must comply with the standards\nof this ordinance.\n17.6.2 PRE-EXISTING LOTS\nAn existing lot of record owned by an individual prior to the effective date of these regulations,\nregardless of whether or not a vested right has been established, may be developed or used\nfor single-family residential purposes without being subject to these regulations. However, this\nshall not be applicable to multiple contiguous lots under single ownership that do not meet the\nrequirements of the underlying planning area.\nTown of Davidson, NC\nDAVIDSON PLANNING ORDINANCE\n17- 5\n\nNEW PAGE 380\nWatershed Protection Overlay District 17.7 Watershed Areas EstablishED\n17.7 WATERSHED AREAS ESTABLISHED\nThe purpose of this section is to list and describe the various watershed subareas herein created.\nThe following subareas shall be in place and are depicted on the Davidson Watershed Map:\na) Critical Area: The Critical Area is defined as the land area which begins at the normal\npool elevation of Lake Norman and extends one-half mile inland or to the ridgeline,\nwhichever is closest, as shown more specifically on the Town of Davidson watershe map.\nb) Protected Area: There is no Lake Norman Protected Area located within the\njurisdiction of the Town of Davidson.\n17.7.1 CRITICAL AREA\nThe intent of these regulations is to require higher standards in the Critical Area of the Lake\nNorman Watershed because of the greater risk of degradation of the drinking water supply from\npollution. All uses permitted in the Critical Area are subject to the standards of the both the\nwatershed subarea and underlying zoning district. In every case the more restrictive standard\ncontrols.\n17.7.1.1 ALLOWED USES (ONLY IF PERMITTED IN THE UNDERLYING PLANNING AREA)\nA. Agriculture subject to the provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985 and the Food,\nAgriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990. Agricultural activities conducted after\nJanuary 1, 1993 shall maintain a minimum ten foot vegetative buffer, or equivalent control\nas determined by the Soil and Water Conservation Commission, along all perennial waters\nindicated on the most recent versions of U.S.G.S. 1:24,000 (7.5 minute) scale topographic\nmaps. Animal operations with greater than 100 animal units shall employ Best Management\nPractices by July 1, 1994 as recommended by the Soil and Water Conservation Commission.\n(Note: The Soil and Water Conservation Commission is the designated management agency\nresponsible for implementing the provisions of Section 16 relating to agricultural activities.)\nB.\nSilviculture, subject to the provisions of the Forest Practices Guidelines Related to Water\nQuality (15 NCAC 11.6101-0209).\nC. Residential uses (Single-family, manufactured homes, manufactured home parks, two-family,\nmulti-family and cluster developments).\nD. Non-residential development (i.e. commercial, institutional, or industrial development)\nexcluding: (i) the storage of toxic and hazardous materials unless a spill containment plan is\nimplemented; (ii) landfills; and (iii) sites for land application of sludge/residuals or petroleum\ncontaminated soils.\n17.7.1.2 BUILT-UPON AREA LIMITS\nAll development must comply with the built-upon area limits of either the Low Density or High\nDensity Option as described below. When calculating the built-upon area, total project area shall\ninclude total contiguous acreage of the adjacent or adjoining tract(s) on which the project is\nto be developed. Note: For the purposes of the watershed ordinance, the terms Low and High\nDensity describe a site's built-upon area (i.e. land coverage); they do not describe units per acre.\nA.
