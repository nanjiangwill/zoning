Merely proving that\nthe variance would permit to be made from the property will not be considered adequate\nto justify the BOA in granting a variance. Moreover, the BOA shall consider whether the\nvariance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of this Ordinance that will make\npossible the reasonable use of his or her property.\n2.\nThe hardship results from the application of the Ordinance to the property rather than from\nother factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship.\n3.\nThe hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such as its size,\nshape, or topography, which is different from that of neighboring property.\n4.\nThe hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly\nviolates this Ordinance, or who purchases the property after the effective date of the\nOrdinance, and then comes to the BOA for relief.\nCamden County\n2-63\nLast Updated:\nUnified Development Ordinance\nFebruary 4, 2019\n", "page_number": 80, "page_range": [80, 81, 82], "highlight": ["allow certain deviations from the dimensional standards of this Ordinance (such as\nheight, setback, <em>lot</em>", "<em>Protection</em> <em>Overlay</em> (<em>WPO</em>).", "<em>Protection</em> <em>Overlay</em> (<em>WPO</em>).", "<em>Protection</em> <em>Overlay</em> (<em>WPO</em>), in accordance with the procedure in\nthis section.", "<em>Watershed</em> <em>Protection</em> <em>Overlay</em>\n(<em>WPO</em>), in accordance with Section 2.3.26.C.7.b, Procedure.\nB."], "score": 24.858377, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Watershed Protection Overlay\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"WPO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"WPO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"WPO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building area as % of lot\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"pervious surface\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"percent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"%\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per cent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ratio\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [79, 80, 81, 82]}
