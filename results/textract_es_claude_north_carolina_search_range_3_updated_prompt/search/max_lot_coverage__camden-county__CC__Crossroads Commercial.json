Ground-level retail and personal services\nthat promote pedestrian activity along the street are highly encouraged and\nlarge, monolithic, automobile-oriented developments are prohibited. New\nVillage\ndevelopment in the district is located close to the street, provides passers-by\nwith clear views into the building's ground floor, and fosters sidewalk dining,\noutdoor seating, and interaction among pedestrians. The district requires\nurban-style open space (greens, seating areas, plazas, pocket parks, roof\nCommercial\ngardens, etc.) to be included as a part of new development. In addition to\ncommercial uses, the district allows a variety of moderate-density residential\ndevelopment. New commercial, mixed-use, and multi-family developments\nin the district are subject to the design standards in ARTICLE 151.5\nDEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.\nNOTES:\n[1] Maximum residential density may be increased to 4.35 units per acre on lots served by public sewer.\n[2] Minimum lot area per unit may be reduced to 10,000 square feet on lots served by public sewer.\nCamden County\n3-40\nLast Updated:\nUnified Development Ordinance\nAugust 1, 2022\nCELL (1, 1): \nB.\nCELL (1, 2): \nDimensional Requirements\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nREQUIREMENT\nCELL (2, 5): \nCELL (3, 1): \n#\nCELL (3, 2): \nSTANDARD TYPE\nCELL (3, 3): \nRESIDENTIAL\nDEVELOPMENT\nCELL (3, 4): \nMIXED-USE\nDEVELOPMENT\nCELL (3, 5): \nNONRESIDENTIAL\nDEVELOPMENT\nCELL (4, 1): \nA\nCELL (4, 2): \nMaximum Residential Density (units/acre)\nCELL (4, 3): \n2.17 [1]\nCELL (4, 4): \n4.35\nCELL (4, 5): \nN/A\nCELL (5, 1): \nB\nCELL (5, 2): \nMinimum Lot Area (square feet)\nCELL (5, 3): \n20,000 per unit\n[2]\nCELL (5, 4): \n40,000\nCELL (5, 5): \nCELL (6, 1): \nC\nCELL (6, 2): \nMinimum Lot Width (feet)\nCELL (6, 3): \n100 [3] [4] [5]\nCELL (6, 4): \n100 [3] [6]\nCELL (6, 5): \n100 [3] [6]\nCELL (7, 1): \nD\nCELL (7, 2): \nMaximum Lot Coverage (% of lot area) [7]\nCELL (7, 3): \n24 [8]\nCELL (7, 4): \n24\nCELL (7, 5): \nCELL (8, 1): \nE\nCELL (8, 2): \nMinimum Open Space (% of development area)\nCELL (8, 3): \nCELL (8, 4): \n15\nCELL (8, 5): \nCELL (9, 1): \nF\nCELL (9, 2): \nMinimum Front Setback (feet) [10]\nCELL (9, 3): \n10 [11]\nCELL (9, 4): \nNone\nCELL (9, 5): \nNone\nCELL (10, 1): \nG\nCELL (10, 2): \nMaximum Front Setback (feet)\nCELL (10, 3): \nNone\nCELL (10, 4): \n35\nCELL (10, 5): \n35 [9]\nCELL (11, 1): \nH\nCELL (11, 2): \nMinimum Corner Side Setback (feet) [10]\nCELL (11, 3): \n10\nCELL (11, 4): \n15\nCELL (11, 5): \n15\nCELL (12, 1): \nI\nCELL (12, 2): \nMinimum Interior Side Setback (feet) [11] [12]\nCELL (12, 3): \n10\nCELL (12, 4): \n5; 10 from residential development\nCELL (12, 5): \n5; 10 from residential development\nCELL (13, 1): \nJ\nCELL (13, 2): \nMinimum Rear Setback (feet)\nCELL (13, 3): \n10 [11]\nCELL (13, 4): \n10\nCELL (13, 5): \nCELL (14, 1): \nK\nCELL (14, 2): \nMin.
