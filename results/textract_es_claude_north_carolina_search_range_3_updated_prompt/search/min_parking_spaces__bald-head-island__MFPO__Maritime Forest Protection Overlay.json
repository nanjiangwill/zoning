The provisions of this district shall, to the extent permitted by the law, apply to those areas within the\ncorporate limits of the village that may be, from time to time, designated on the official map or maps designating certain\nareas thereon as maritime forest protection overlay district adopted by the village. This overlay district is intended to provide\nadditional protection to the maritime forest, while allowing all uses contained in the PD district, in which the overlay occurs,\nto be allowed. The golf course from the fairways, tees, and greens to adjacent rights-of-way or lot lines are expected from\nthis overlay district.\n(2) Performance standards. The following performance standards apply to all uses within the maritime forest protection\noverlay district. These performance standards are in addition to or over and above the requirements of the applicable zoning\ndistrict.\na. Prestaking or preconstruction lot clearing. Some clearing of understory trees and shrubs may be required to prepare\na site for sale or survey or to stake the proposed building site. Permission to clear such understory, trees and shrubs shall\nnot be required by the building inspector, but shall be limited to such vegetation with a three-inch caliper at four feet above\ngrade.\nb. Lot alteration. No alteration of a lot or building site shall occur prior to the issuance of a building permit. Trees shall\nnot be removed except as necessary for the construction of the principal structure, accessory use, parking area, driveway\naccess and septic tank/nitrification field system. Soil disturbing activities and site alteration shall not exceed the minimum\nnecessary to provide for the location of the principal use structure, any accessory use improvements, driveway access, and\nutility service improvements. No specimen tree (a 24-inch diameter trunk at four feet above ground level) shall be removed\nunless construction is impractical without the removal of such tree.\nC. Construction containment. The area of construction shall be limited to five feet outside of the perimeter of structure\nconstruction and two feet outside of a driveway referred to in this chapter as \"limit of construction.\" A lay down yard for\nconstruction material must be shown on plans submitted for approval as well as the limits of construction. Both of these\nareas shall be surrounded by a construction fence which shall be maintained until all construction is completed. Movement\nof construction equipment or placement of material outside of this containment is prohibited.\nd. Wetland buffer. Natural wetlands and ponds shall not be filled. No paved area or any part of a ground absorption\nwastewater treatment system shall be located within 20 feet of any stream, pond, or wetland. Pilings for a residence may be\nplaced in the wetlands boundary as long as no fill is placed in the wetlands. For lots platted before April 1, 1991, fill is\nallowed to the extent permitted by applicable regulatory agency, only if the property is unbuildable or unaccessible without\nthe fill permit. Open decking or boardwalks may be built over wetlands where approved by the local GAMA permit officers\nand division of coastal management or other appropriate governmental agency or authority.\ne. Off-street parking, driveways and carports. Parking areas on a lot shall be located under the principal structure\nwhenever possible. All off-street parking improvements and driveways shall be designed to minimize impervious lot\ncoverage. Driveway widths shall be limited to ten feet.\nf. Clearing and pavement width for roads, streets, and culs-de-sac.\n1. The total combined width of paved area within a right-of-way for a road or street shall not exceed 22 feet.\n2. The total width of paved area within a cul-de-sac at the end of a road or street shall not exceed 30 feet; nor more\nthan 30 feet of any road or street right-of-way, regardless of the total width of such right-of-way shall be cleared of plant or\ntree growth. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the width of paved area and the width of cleared right-of-way for\nintersections of streets or roads and culs-de-sac may exceed the permitted limits set out hereinabove to accommodate an\nappropriate turning radius, as determined by the village council, for vehicular traffic, including without limitation, emergency\nvehicles, fire protection and fighting equipment or vehicles and construction vehicles.\ng. Plant material installation. There shall not be planted on any lot any shrubbery, trees, herbs, grasses or other flora\nunless same appears on the list of permissible shrubbery, trees, herbs, grasses or other flora to ensure that no plant\nmaterial foreign to the natural ecology of the maritime forest protection overlay district which may be harmful to such\necology will be introduced into the maritime forest protection overlay district. Bald Head Island design guidelines\nrecommendations and standards for development will be helpful to property owners in planning the installation of plant\nmaterial.\n(3) Technical regulations. Within the maritime forest district the following dimensional, setback, height, and other\nrequirements shall be in effect.\na. Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall be applicable:\nCELL (1, 1): \nSingle-family Lots of or over 9,000 square feet\nCELL (1, 2): \nSingle-family Lots of or over 9,000 square feet\nCELL (2, 1): \nFront yard\nCELL (2, 2): \n35 feet minimum\nCELL (3, 1): \nSide yard\nCELL (3, 2): \n10 feet minimum\nCELL (4, 1): \nRear yard\nCELL (4, 2): \n10 feet minimum\nCELL (5, 1): \nSide yard corner lot\nCELL (5, 2): \n15 feet minimum\n\nNEW PAGE 23\n(h) PD-3C-1 lighthouse-chapel overlay district. The specifications and standards of this district are established in order to\npermit development that is compatible with the pastoral environment of this district.\n(i) NC neighborhood commercial district. The neighborhood commercial district (NC) is primarily intended to\naccommodate very low intensity office, and personal service uses within residential areas. The district is established to\nprovide convenient locations for businesses, which serve the needs of island residents and visitors without disrupting the\ncharacter of the neighborhood. The neighborhood commercial district is a transitional land use zoning district in which the\nprincipal use of land is residential with some office and service uses allowed to serve the surrounding residential districts\nand in which traffic and parking congestion can be reduced to a minimum in order to preserve residential values and\npromote the general welfare of the surrounding residential districts.\n(1) Buffer requirements. Nonresidential uses which abut undeveloped lots or lots utilized for residential purposes shall\nmaintain a ten-foot undisturbed vegetative buffer along rear and side property boundaries.\n(2) Parking and driveway requirements.\na. Minimum number of required off-street parking spaces, by land use.\nb. Location and design of parking areas and driveways.\n1. All parking areas shall be located and designed so as to avoid undue interference with the use of public streets and\nalleys.\n2. There shall be a maximum of one driveway per lot. In the case that adjacent lots are under single ownership,\nshared driveways shall be utilized in an attempt to provide the minimum number of access points possible.\n(3) Maximum floor area ratio.
