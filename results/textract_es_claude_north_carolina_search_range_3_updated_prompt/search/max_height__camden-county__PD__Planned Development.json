These standards may be modified by other applicable sections of this Ordinance.\n10.2.2.\nMEASUREMENTS, GENERALLY\nA.\nStraight Lines\nUnless otherwise stated in this Ordinance, distances specified in this Ordinance are to be measured as the length of\nan imaginary straight line joining two points.\nB.\nRounding\nAll calculations that result in a fractional unit or part of a whole number, the number shall be rounded up to the next\nhighest whole number, unless otherwise provided in this section or elsewhere in this Ordinance.\nC.\nIrregular Shapes\nIn cases where an irregular shape complicates the application of these standards, the UDO Administrator shall\ndetermine the applicable dimensional, setback, or bulk standards.\nD.\nSeparation\n1.\nLot to Lot\nWhen the provisions of this Ordinance require separation between two or more lots, or a lot and another\nfeature, separation shall be measured by drawing straight lines from the nearest point of one lot line to the\nnearest point of the lot line subject to the separation requirement (see Figure 10.2.2.D: Separation).\n2.\nUse Type to Use Type\nWhen the provisions of this Ordinance require one use type to be separated from another use type,\nseparation shall be measured by drawing straight lines from the nearest point of the wall of the existing or\nproposed principal structure to the nearest point of the wall of the existing or proposed structure subject to\nthe separation requirement.\nFIGURE 10.2.2.D: SEPARATION\nA\nLEGEND\nA\nLot-to-Lot Separation\nB Use Type-to-Use\nType Separation\nB\nLot Line\nCELL (1, 1): \nCamden County\nCELL (1, 2): \n10-5\nCELL (1, 3): \nLast Updated\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nFebruary 4, 2019\n", "page_number": 389, "page_range": [389, 390, 391], "highlight": ["CRC\nCELL (18, 2): \nCoastal Resources Commission\nCELL (19, 1): \nDBH\nCELL (19, 2): \nDiameter at Breast <em>Height</em>", "OZM\nCELL (10, 2): \nOfficial Zoning Map\nCELL (11, 1): \nPB\nCELL (11, 2): \nPlanning Board\nCELL (12, 1): \n<em>PD</em>", "CELL (12, 2): \n<em>Planned</em> <em>Development</em>\nCELL (13, 1): \nPUD\nCELL (13, 2): \nPlanned Unit Development\nCELL (", "2): \nRight-of-Way\nCELL (15, 1): \nRR\nCELL (15, 2): \nRural Residential\nCELL (16, 1): \nSF or sf or\nsq. <em>ft</em>", "CELL (16, 2): \nSquare <em>Feet</em>\nCELL (17, 1): \nSFHA\nCELL (17, 2): \nSpecial Flood Hazard Area Overlay District"], "score": 20.762482, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Planned Development\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"PD\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"PD\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"PD\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 153\nARTICLE 151.3 Zoning Districts\nSection 3.7 Planned Development (PD) District\n3.7.2 General Standards for All Planned Development Districts\nD.\nDevelopment Standards\n1.\nAll development in a PD district shall comply with the development standards of ARTICLE 151.5,\nDevelopment Standards, the subdivision and infrastructure design standards of ARTICLE 151.6, Subdivision\nRequirements, and the environmental protection standards in ARTICLE 151.7, Environmental Provisions,\nunless modified in accordance with this section.\n2.\nIn no instance shall a planned development district seek to modify, waive, or reduce any of the following\nstandards:\na.\nSection 3.8.3, Special Flood Hazard Area Overlay (SFHA);\nb.\nSection 7.1, Stormwater Management;\nC.\nSection 5.14, Signage;
