Nonconforming Uses of Open Land\nA nonconforming use of open land consists of open lots used for storage yards, car lots, auto\nwrecking, junkyards, and similar uses where the only buildings on the lot are incidental and\naccessory to the open use of the lot and where the use is not permitted inthe zoning district\nwhere it is located.\nSuch nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was\noccupied by that use when it became nonconforming. Fencing or other screening of the use\ndoes not change its status as a nonconforming use of open land.\nSection 10-3. Nonconforming Uses of Structures\nA nonconforming use of a structure is a function or purpose, occurring in the particular\nstructure, that is not permitted in the zoning district in which the structure is located.\nE. Enlargement of Structures That Are a Nonconforming Use is Prohibited: Use of a structure\nfor purpose that has been made nonconforming by adoption of this ordinance or by\nrezoning may not be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity.\nF. Maintenance and Repair: Normal maintenance and repair of a structure used for a\nnonconforming purpose is permitted and encouraged, provided it does not extend the\nnonconformity.\nC.\nChange to Conforming Use: Any nonconforming use of a structure may be changed to a\nconforming use, or, with the approval of the Board of Adjustment, a nonconforming use\nmay be changed to a use more in character with the uses permitted in the district as long as\nthere is no structural enlargement.\nD.
