At the conference the applicant shall submit a\nsketch development plan and a brief description of the proposed development strategy. The\napplicant shall also submit proposed design specifications for proposed commercial buildings. The\nconference is designed to inform the applicant of the local government's regulations and policies\nconcerning development alternatives and to inform the local government of the applicant's\nintentions, enough to be able to give him or her some informal, nonbinding feedback on the\nacceptability of his or her plan. The greater the level of common understanding between the\napplicant and the local government that can be achieved at the conference stage, the smoother the\nremaining steps of the review and approval process will be. At the conference a date for a public\nhearing shall be determined.\n1\n(C) Notice of hearing. The Board of Adjustment shall give public notice of the hearing in a\nnewspaper having general circulation in Beech Mountain published at least five days prior to the\ndate of the hearing. The Board shall mail notices of the hearing to the affected parties, to members\nof the Planning Board, and to such other persons as the Zoning Administrator shall direct at least\nseven days prior to the hearing. Such notice shall state the location of the building or lot, the\ngeneral nature of the applicant's request, and the time and place of the hearing. 2\n(D) Copies of final development plan to be submitted. At least ten days prior to the date set for\nthe hearing, the applicant shall submit three copies of the final development plan to the Zoning\nAdministrator.

Due to above-ground utilities, the\ntown may require the use of ornamental trees in place of large shade trees.\nb. Inclusion of existing trees in the landscape design is encouraged. Shrubbery, ground\ncover, and other planting materials shall be used to compliment the tree planting. No area of the\nstreet yard may be exposed soil, but instead shall be covered with vegetation, whether grass or\nshrubbery. The only area that shall remain uncovered is the six-foot radius surrounding the trunk of\nany tree; however, this area shall be mulched.\n(2) Existing vegetation. Existing trees and vegetation, other than exotic, non-native species,\nmay count toward meeting the requirements of this section, when such vegetation is in good\ncondition, is properly protected during development, and helps to further the purpose of the district.\nExisting vegetation that is used to meet the standards of this section shall be maintained or\nreplaced if it dies during the first year after the completion of the development.\n(3) New plant material. Regionally grown and native species of plants are preferred. Any plant\nlisted with the Agricultural Extension Office as a native plant shall be considered to be a native\nplant for these purposes. New plant material shall complement existing site vegetation, should be\nmixed with it and should be integrated with all other natural site features.\n(I) Parking lots; parking lot yards. The purpose of this section is to ensure that the Commercial\nThoroughfare Overlay District of Beech Mountain is an attractive and appealing place for residents\nand visitors. This often means that a higher priority must be placed upon being an attractive and\nfunctional place for people than being convenient for automobiles.\n(1) Parking location. Parking is encouraged to be located to the rear or sides of buildings, with\nthe building fronting on the public way. However, nothing in this section is to prevent the\nestablishment of parking in front of a building so long as the project adheres to all other relevant\nregulations. When parking is to be established in front of buildings, it is recommended that the\napplicant create and utilize on-street parking if such is approved by the NCDOT and/or the town.\n(For the purposes of this section, ON-STREET PARKING is defined as a parking area without a\ndivider between the street and the parking area, in which automobiles directly access the parking\nspaces from the road. On-street parking may be parallel, angled or straight in, as approved by the\nNCDOT and the town.)\n(J) Buffer yards. The purpose of the buffer yard is to provide a transitional area between uses\nthat may differ in development intensity and density. A BUFFER YARD is defined as a planting yard\nthat serves as a visual separation between uses and should be densely planted. No buildings,\nparking areas or other development may encroach within the buffer yard, with the exception of\ntown-approved public walkways or sidewalks. Refer to \u00a7 154.165 for the standards for buffer yards.\n(Ord. 2014-05, passed 12-9-2014; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\u00a7 154.130 ZONING AFFECTS EVERY BUILDING AND USE.\nNo building or land shall hereafter be used and no building or part thereof shall be erected,\nmoved or altered except in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district in which\nit\nis located, except as provided in this chapter.\n(1989 Code, Title V, Ch. 51, Art.
