Permanent\nstructures shall be located, to the maximum extent feasible, as far from the watercourse, and as close to the outer boundary of the resource conservation district, as is practical. Permanent\nstructures shall be clustered as much as practical, to minimize land disturbance, to maximize undeveloped open space, and to maximize retention of natural vegetation and buffers. Integrated\nmanagement practices, as described in section 5.4, shall accompany all development within the resource conservation district.\n(5) Water supply, sanitary sewer, and on-site waste disposal systems shall be designed to:\nA. Prevent the infiltration of flood waters into the system(s),\nB. Prevent discharges from the system(s) into flood waters and,\nC. Avoid impairment during flooding to minimize flood damage. Finished floor elevations to be served by sanitary sewer shall be at or above the rim elevation of the nearest upstream\nmanhole cover or be otherwise approved by the town manager.
