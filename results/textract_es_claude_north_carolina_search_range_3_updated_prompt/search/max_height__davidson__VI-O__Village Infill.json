See Section 9\nfor landscape screening requirements. Note: Natural screening alternatives must be\napproved by the Planning Director in consultation with the Arborist.\n3. Screening is not required for electronic vehicle charging stations.\n4. Off-street parking shall not be located forward of the front fa\u00e7ade of the building\nunless on a corner lot. On a corner lot, parking may not be located in front of the\nfacade on the primary street.

Building sites should be clustered in order to minimize their impact on the landscape\nand preserve views and historical features.\nH. Public Spaces\nPublic spaces are required or encouraged in mixed-use, commercial, or employment nodes\nbased upon the requirements of the specific planning area. The design and location of urban\nopen space on a site is important factor in a successful pedestrian environment. To ensure\nthat the open space is well-used, it is essential to locate and design it carefully in accordance\nwith the following general standards:\nUrban open spaces shall be fronted by streets and buildings to encourage its use\nand its safety.\nThe space shall be located where it is visible and easily accessible from homes and\npublic areas (building entrances, streets, sidewalks).\nThe space should be located to take views and sun exposure into account.\nThe space shall be well-buffered from moving cars so that users can enjoy and relax\nin the space.\nThe space shall be visible from streets or internal drives, but should not be wholly\nexposed to them.\nThe space shall be partially enclosed with building walls, freestanding walls,\nlandscaping, raised planters, or on-street parking to help buffer it and create a\ncomfortable \"outdoor room.\"\nSee Section 7, Parks and Open Space, for additional information.\nI. Exceptions\nExceptions from the site and building design standards established in this section may be\napproved by the Planning Director to preserve mature trees and natural features.\n4.3.2 GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPMENT OR REDEVELOPMENT IN EXISTING BUILDINGS\nThis section is intended to ensure the compatibility of infill development and redevelopment\nto surrounding neighborhoods and shall apply to new construction and the expansion of\nexisting buildings. As a means to provide guidance for the design of buildings that integrate\nwell into the context of Davidson, this section identifies the following key features necessary\nto ensure compatibility. When developing in the Village Infill Planning Area, in addition to\nthe standards below, see Section 2 for development in the Village Infill Overlay District.\nD. Street Frontage: Street trees should be preserved.\nE.\nRhythm of Development along the Street: Established building rhythms along\nstreet frontages should be continued. Larger buildings can be integrated into\nsmaller-scale neighbohrhoods by creating repetitive bays with facade articulation.\nF. Building Orientation: Main entrances, and other primary building fa\u00e7ade elements\nshould be oriented toward the street. Courtyard buildings should orient main\nentrances toward courtyards that open to the street and serve as a semi-public\nextension of the public realm.\nG. Front Setback Patterns: Established building setback patterns should be continued\nTown of Davidson, NC\nDAVIDSON PLANNING ORDINANCE\n4-5\n\nNEW PAGE 129\nSite\n&\nBuilding\nDesign Standards | 4.4 General Building Design Requirements\nas practical. Deep front setbacks can compromise the pedestrian realm.\nH. Building Form: Massing, proportion, scale, setbacks, spaces between buildings, and\ntheir relative positions should be used to integrate new development into existing\nstreetscapes.\nI.\nDensity: Density should increase closer to mixed use and commercial nodes.\nJ.\nBuilding Design: Buildings should be designed to respect the existing built\nenvironment, but not be explicit reproduction of past historical styles.\n4.4 GENERAL BUILDING DESIGN REQUIREMENTS\nThis section shall apply to all buildings, excluding the detached house, and accessory\nstructure building types. For requirements for these building types see Specific Building Type\nRequirements, Section 4.5.\n4.4.1 STANDARDS\nThe design of buildings should be complementary with prevalent architectural features\nof the surrounding neighborhood, especially in areas where patterns established by\nrecurring architectural features are well-documented and valued.\nA. Building Height\n1. Building height, as established in each respective planning area in Section 2, is\nmeasured as the number of stories in a building. A story is a habitable level in a\nbuilding.\n2. The following elements shall not be calculated as stories:\na. Under-roof areas less than seven feet clear height with dormers.\nb. Unoccupied residential attics less than seven feet above the leaves.\nC.\nRaised basements less than four feet exposed at the lowest grade at the front\nfa\u00e7ade.\nd. Mezzanines\n3.\nBuilding height is measured from the finished floor elevation of the fa\u00e7ade facing the\nstreet to the ridgeline or the highest point of the roof (where there is no ridgeline),\nexcluding chimneys and basements, excepting raised basements described above.\nUnless specifically stated elsewhere in this ordinance, the height requirements\nestablished in this ordinance shall not apply to:\na.\nBuilding elements (such as church spires, belfries, cupolas, domes, parapets, etc.)\nwhich are not intended for human occupancy;\nb. Mechanical penthouses which are set back at least 20 feet from the front\nelevation of the building.\n4.\nThis ordinance requires buildings, excluding detached and attached house building\ntypes, to be at least two stories.

The town's historic\ncore cannot remain static, but its existing character is worth preserving. It is acceptable\nfor new houses to be larger than older ones, but not so much larger as to threaten\nneighborhood character.

DESCRIPTION\nThe Village Infill Planning Area comprises Davidson's traditional, residential\nneighborhoods and provides for infill development surrounding the historic town\ncenter. Streets, sidewalks and greenways in the Village Infill Planning Area must be\ninterconnected. A range of housing types is encouraged: For Master Plan projects on\nlots over three acres a mix of at least two different building types is encouraged.\nAdditionally, small retail establishments are permitted on corner lots, with restrictions.\nThis encourages the provision of small-scale retail and service uses for surrounding\nresidential areas. Buildings are restricted in size to promote a local orientation, to be\npedestrian-oriented, to be compatible with the scale of surrounding residences, and to\nlimit any adverse impacts on residential development.\nB.
