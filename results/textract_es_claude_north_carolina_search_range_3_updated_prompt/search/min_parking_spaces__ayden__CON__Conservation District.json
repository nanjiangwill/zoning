The minimum front setback required may be reduced by the\nAdministrator for any lot where the average established front yard setback on developed lots\nlocated within 300 feet on each side of such lot, and fronting on the same street as such lot,\nis less than the minimum required yard setback. In such cases, the minimum front or street\nyard setback may be less than that required but not less than the average of the existing\nfront yard setbacks on the developed lots within 300 feet of each side. In addition, for new\nlots created from existing larger lots, the lot width at the frontage line and the side yard\nsetbacks shall be consistent with the immediately adjacent neighboring parcels on the same\nside of the street.\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-3\nADOPTION DATE: JANUARY 13, 2020\n\nNEW PAGE 59\nGENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\n3.\nDriveways.

No portion of any building, excluding leaves, decks, patios, steps and\nuncovered porches may be located on any lot closer to any lot line or to the street right-of-\nway line than is authorized in Article 3 - Zoning Districts of this ordinance. All setbacks are\nexpressed in feet and are minimum setbacks unless otherwise noted. Additional setbacks\nmay be required to meet parking, landscaping, buffers or other standards specified in this\nArticle, the specific use standards of Article 4 - Individual Use Standards of this UDO.\n2.\nAllowed Setback Encroachments. A step, stoop, open porch, lawnings or other\nappurtenances may extend up to five (5) feet into the front setback, provided such features\ndo not impede pedestrian circulation or extend more than twenty-five (25) percent into the\nminimum setback. Attached and detached carports are permitted in the front yard setback\nand must meet the front setback requirements of the underlying zoning district and have an\nimproved driveway surface.

Setback Measurement\na.\nSetback distances shall be measured from the property line or street right-of-way line to\na point on the lot that is directly below the nearest extension of any part of the building\nthat is substantially a part of the building itself and not a mere appendage to it (such as a\nflagpole, etc.).\nb. If the street right-of-way line is readily determinable (by reference to a recorded map, set\nirons, or other means), the setback shall be measured at a right angle to such right-of-\nway line. If the right-of-way line is not so determinable, the setback shall be measured\nfrom the street centerline.\nC. All setbacks are subject to compliance with adopted applicable fire code provisions.\nC. Relationship of Building to Lot\nIn no case shall there be more than one principal building and its customary accessory buildings\non a lot except in the case of a designed complex of professional, residential or commercial\nbuildings in an appropriate zoning district.\nD. Street Access\nNo building shall be erected on a lot which does not abut a street or have access to a street,\nprovided that in a planned development, a building may be erected adjoining a parking area or\ndedicated open space which has access to a street used in common with other lots.\nE. Infill Development Standards\nInfill development is any new development on land that has been previously developed or vacant\nland where development has occurred around the vacant land.\n1.\nStreet Frontages. New structures should orient windows, main entrances, and other\nprimary building fa\u00e7ade elements toward the street. Care should be taken to avoid the\nappearance of buildings turning their backs or sides toward the street.\n2.\nFront Setback Pattern. The minimum front setback required may be reduced by the\nAdministrator for any lot where the average established front yard setback on developed lots\nlocated within 300 feet on each side of such lot, and fronting on the same street as such lot,\nis less than the minimum required yard setback. In such cases, the minimum front or street\nyard setback may be less than that required but not less than the average of the existing\nfront yard setbacks on the developed lots within 300 feet of each side. In addition, for new\nlots created from existing larger lots, the lot width at the frontage line and the side yard\nsetbacks shall be consistent with the immediately adjacent neighboring parcels on the same\nside of the street.\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-3\nADOPTION DATE: JANUARY 13, 2020\n\nNEW PAGE 59\nGENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\n3.\nDriveways. On lots less than 50 feet in width, only one driveway of no more than 12 feet in\nwidth may be used to provide access to garages or off-street parking areas.\n4. Rhythm of Development. Garages or off-street parking areas shall be located in the side or\nrear setback area only.\nF. Irregular Lot Setbacks\nThe location of required front, side and rear yard setbacks on irregularly shaped lots shall be\ndetermined by the Administrator. The determination will be based on the intent and purpose of\nthis ordinance to achieve an appropriate spacing and location of buildings and buildings on\nindividual lots. Where questions arise as to appropriateness, the subdivider may be requested to\nprovide additional design information.\n510.030 Fences & Walls\nAll fences and walls shall comply with the requirements of this Section unless specifically approved\nas part of a Conditional District, Special Use Permit or Variance.\nA. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, fences that are no taller than six (6) feet may be\nbuilt along interior side and rear property lines.\nB. Exterior side yard fences that are no taller than six (6) feet shall be at least five (5) from the right-\nof-way.\nC. Fences in front yards are discouraged, but must be:\n1. Located least two (2) feet from the right-of-way and no closer than two (2) feet from the\ninside edge of the sidewalk;\n2. Less than sixty (60) percent opaque; and\n3. Not exceed four (4) feet in height, except that wrought iron and split rail style fences may be\nup to five (5) feet tall.\nD. No fence shall obstruct any traffic safety visibility zone.\nE. Barbed wire, razor wire or other fence materials designed to cut or puncture are prohibited in all\ndistricts, except in the B-2, LI, HI and CON districts.\nF. Deer fences may be erected around gardens provided that the fences are located at least ten\n(10) feet from the nearest property line.\n510.040 Parking and Loading\nA. Purpose and Intent\nThis Section establishes the minimum requirements for the number of spaces and the design of\nparking areas in the Town of Ayden. This Section provides administrative flexibility for the\nAdministrator to adjust the number of required spaces and the design of spaces to provide for\nadequate parking, accommodate unique site conditions and capitalize on the benefits of parking\nopportunities on-street or in shared parking areas.\nB. Applicability\nThe requirements of this Section shall be applicable to all new development and changes of use\nthat create the need for parking or increase existing parking demands.\nC. Parking Space Requirements\nPermanent off-street parking (including on-street parking in accordance with the requirements\nbelow) is required subject to the table below.
