diverse mix of uses on lands well\nserved by public sewer and located within the core portions of the\nCounty's designated village centers. The district is intended to foster\nfunctional neighborhoods where County residents and visitors can live,\nwork, shop, and recreate without travelling large distances between\ndiffering uses. Buildings are built close to the sidewalk and one another\nMX\nand served by public gathering areas that create places for people to\ncongregate and interact. Off-street parking and service areas are located\nto the sides and rears of buildings to help ensure a continuity of building\nfacades along street edges and to avoid areas that are unsafe or\nundesirable for pedestrians. The district encourages a fine-grained\nMixed Use\nnetwork of streets and pedestrian ways that allow a wide freedom of\nmovement and choices in transportation mode. Uses are located in close\nproximity to one another and rely on design techniques to maintain\ncompatibility instead of large yards, deep setbacks, and suburban-style\nvegetative buffers. The district allows a wide variety of housing types to\npromote population density and to support nearby retail, dining, and\nentertainment establishments.

The district is intended to foster\nfunctional neighborhoods where County residents and visitors can live,\nwork, shop, and recreate without travelling large distances between\ndiffering uses. Buildings are built close to the sidewalk and one another\nMX\nand served by public gathering areas that create places for people to\ncongregate and interact. Off-street parking and service areas are located\nto the sides and rears of buildings to help ensure a continuity of building\nfacades along street edges and to avoid areas that are unsafe or\nundesirable for pedestrians. The district encourages a fine-grained\nMixed Use\nnetwork of streets and pedestrian ways that allow a wide freedom of\nmovement and choices in transportation mode. Uses are located in close\nproximity to one another and rely on design techniques to maintain\ncompatibility instead of large yards, deep setbacks, and suburban-style\nvegetative buffers. The district allows a wide variety of housing types to\npromote population density and to support nearby retail, dining, and\nentertainment establishments. The district discourages the establishment\nof single-use, monolithic, and automobile-oriented forms of development\nthat require large areas of off-street parking, large floorplates, or that fail\nto cater to pedestrians.\nCamden County\n3-44\nLast Updated:\nUnified Development Ordinance\nAugust 1, 2022\nCELL (1, 1): \nB.\nCELL (1, 2): \nDimensional Requirements\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nREQUIREMENT\nCELL (2, 5): \nCELL (3, 1): \n#\nCELL (3, 2): \nSTANDARD TYPE\nCELL (3, 3): \nRESIDENTIAL\nDEVELOPMENT\nCELL (3, 4): \nMIXED-USE\nDEVELOPMENT\nCELL (3, 5): \nNONRESIDENTIAL\nDEVELOPMENT\nCELL (4, 1): \nA\nCELL (4, 2): \nMaximum Residential Density (units/acre)\nCELL (4, 3): \n4.35\nCELL (4, 4): \n5.44\nCELL (4, 5): \nN/A\nCELL (5, 1): \nB\nCELL (5, 2): \nMinimum Lot Area (square feet)\nCELL (5, 3): \n10,000 per unit\nCELL (5, 4): \nCELL (5, 5): \n40,000\nCELL (6, 1): \nC\nCELL (6, 2): \nMinimum Lot Width (feet)\nCELL (6, 3): \n60 [1]\nCELL (6, 4): \n50\nCELL (6, 5): \n75\nCELL (7, 1): \nD\nCELL (7, 2): \nMaximum Lot Coverage (% of lot area) [2]\nCELL (7, 3): \n24\nCELL (7, 4): \n40\nCELL (7, 5): \n24\nCELL (8, 1): \nE\nCELL (8, 2): \nMinimum Open Space (% of development area)\nCELL (8, 3): \nCELL (8, 4): \n15\nCELL (8, 5): \nCELL (9, 1): \nF\nCELL (9, 2): \nMinimum Front Setback (feet) [3]\nCELL (9, 3): \n10 [4]\nCELL (9, 4): \nNone\nCELL (9, 5): \nNone\nCELL (10, 1): \nG\nCELL (10, 2): \nMaximum Front Setback (feet) [3]\nCELL (10, 3): \n20\nCELL (10, 4): \n10\nCELL (10, 5): \n20\nCELL (11, 1): \nH\nCELL (11, 2): \nMinimum Corner Side Setback (feet) [3]\nCELL (11, 3): \n15\nCELL (11, 4): \n10\nCELL (11, 5): \n10\nCELL (12, 1): \nI\nCELL (12, 2): \nMinimum Interior Side Setback (feet) [5]\nCELL (12, 3): \n10\nCELL (12, 4): \n5; 10 from residential development\nCELL (12, 5): \n5; 10 from residential development\nCELL (13, 1): \nCELL (13, 2): \nMinimum Rear Setback (feet)\nCELL (13, 3): \nCELL (13, 4): \n10\nCELL (13, 5): \nCELL (14, 1): \nK\nCELL (14, 2): \nMin.
