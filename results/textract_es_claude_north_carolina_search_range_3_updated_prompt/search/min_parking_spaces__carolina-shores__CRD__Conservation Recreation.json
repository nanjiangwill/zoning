Where a payment in lieu of dedication is\napproved by the Board of Commissioners, the payment will be made before the final plat is signed and recorded.\n(7) The Board of Commissioners shall have the authority to sell land dedicated pursuant to this section. The proceeds of the sale shall be\nused for the acquisition and/or development of other recreation, park or open space sites, or for sidewalk development serving the subdivision\nor more than one subdivision in the immediate area.\n(8) The town encourages neighborhood or property owner associations or management to construct, operate and maintain private parks\nand recreation. The construction, operation or maintenance of the private facilities shall not, however, diminish or eliminate the responsibility\nand obligations of the subdivider under this section.\n(9) Greenways may be credited against the requirements of this section, provided that the greenways are part of the town's greenway\nplan and dedicated to public use.\n(10) This chapter may not require a power line to be buried if the line existed above ground when the development's plat or development\nplan was initially approved (even if the power line was subsequently relocated) and the power line is located outside the parcel of land\ncontaining the subdivision or development plan.\n(L) Street construction. To provide for the orderly growth and development of the town, and to coordinate the streets and highways within\nproposed subdivisions with existing or planned streets and highways, a subdivider or developer may be required in lieu of required street\nconstruction and as a condition to plat approval, to provide funds which the town may use for the construction of roads to serve the occupants,\nresidents, or invitees of the subdivision or development and these funds may be used for roads which serve more than one subdivision or\ndevelopment within the area. All funds received by the town pursuant to this division shall be used only for development of roads, including\ndesign, land acquisition, and construction. The town may undertake these activities in conjunction with the North Carolina Department of\nTransportation under an agreement between the town and the Department of Transportation. Any formula adopted to determine the amount\nof funds the subdivider or developer is to pay in lieu of required street construction shall be based on the trips generated from the subdivision\nor development. A combination of partial payment of such funds and partial dedication of constructed streets may be required when the Board\nof Commissioners determines that such a combination is in the best interests of the public in the area to be served.\n(Ord. eff. 9-6-2012, \u00a7 5.7; Am.

Electric vehicle charging station(s) shall be permitted in a single-family garage designed to service the occupants of the home. Accessory\nsingle-family charging stations shall not exceed residential Building Code electrical limitations. Whereas, charging station(s) installed in a\nparking lot for non single-family residential use are expected to have intensive use and will be permitted to have multiple \"rapid charging\nstations\" to serve expected demand.\n(D) Battery exchange station: exchange stations are permitted in any commercial or industrial zoning district, provided, however, all other\nrequirements for the building or space the use occupies can be satisfied, such as design review, Fire Code and Building Code requirements.\nThis use is specifically prohibited in exclusively residential or conservation/recreation zoning districts.\n(E) Design criteria for commercial and multi-family development, the following criteria shall be applied to electric charging facilities.\n(1) Number required. This is an optional improvement. No minimum number of stalls applies. However, if electric vehicle stalls are\nreserved for electric vehicles, care should be taken to ensure enough spots are available for all of a site's parking needs.\n(2) Generally. Location and provision of electric vehicle parking will vary based on the design and use of the primary parking lot, keeping\nin mind flexibility will be needed in various parking lot layout options.\n(3) Signage to identify. Each charging station space should be posted with signage indicating the space is only for electric vehicle\ncharging purposes. Days and hours of operations should be included if time limits or tow away provisions are to be enforced by the owner.\n(4) Maintenance. Charging station equipment should be maintained in all respects, including the functioning of the charging equipment.\n(5) Accessibility. Where charging station equipment is provided within an adjacent pedestrian circulation area, such as a sidewalk or\naccessible route to the building entrance, charging equipment should be located so as to not interfere with accessibility.\n(6) Lighting. Where charging station equipment is installed, adequate site lighting should also be provided unless charging is for daytime\npurposes only.\n(7) Notification of station specifics. Information on the charging station identifying voltage and amperage levels and any time of use, fees\nor safety information.\n\nNEW PAGE 52\n(8) Avoid the most convenient parking spaces Stalls should not be located in the most convenient spots because this would encourage\nuse by non electric vehicles.\n(9) Avoid conflict with handicap spots. Stalls should generally not be located adjacent to handicap spots unless designed for\nhandicapped use.\n(10) Design for compatibility. Design should be appropriate to the location and use. Facilities should be able to be readily identified by\nelectric cars but blended into the surrounding landscape/ architecture for compatibility with the character and use of the site.\n(Ord. eff. 9-6-2012, \u00a7 7.5; Am.

Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n\u00a7 91.87 MIXED USE.\n(A) Mixed use defined. The MIXED USE OPTION is provided to allow flexibility in development requirements such as setbacks, density,\npermitted uses and the like, to accommodate the unique physical, economic, design or other characteristics of a development without\ncompromising the essential standards needed for the protection of the public interest. Mixed use developments require a special use permit,\nas specified in \u00a7 91.56, in which the primary use of land is a mix of residential and small-scale commercial uses such as retail, office, service\nand entertainment establishments. A mix of permitted uses is allowed within the same building or on the same lot or as separate uses on\nindividual parcels. This development pattern is characterized by overlapping patterns of use and activities, and clearly defined, human scale\nexternal spaces, where citizens can live, conduct business and meet freely with others. Development within the mixed use conditional use\nshall be in accordance with the standards set forth herein.\n(B) Performance standards. The UDO Administrator, Planning Board and Board of Commissioners will work cooperatively with the\napplicant in determining the appropriate performance standards for mixed use developments. The standards of the zoning district, or districts,\nin which the mixed use is located, provide general guidance in determining the standards, with consideration given to the specific\ncharacteristics and needs of the individual project. Ultimately, all performance standards such as density, permitted uses, parcel dimensional\nrequirements, lighting, landscaping, parking, signage and the like, shall be established by the Board of Commissioners upon recommendation\nof the Planning Board through issuance of the conditional use permit. The conditions specified by the conditional use permit shall be\ncompatible with the surrounding area and the objectives of this UDO. Creative design concepts are encouraged to minimize impacts on\ninfrastructure and to support environmental protection. The mixed use shall comply with \u00a7\u00a7 91.240 through 91.261, 91.270 and 91.280,\nEnvironmental Regulations and \u00a7\u00a7 91.210 through 91.229, Subdivisions.\n(C) Permitted uses.

All building design shall encourage that consideration be\ngiven to the following.\n(1) Special attention shall be given to entrances; they may be set back from the primary facade as long as they are clearly visible from\nthe street. Building entrances and exits shall be well lit to provide visibility and promote safety. Buildings that occur at the intersection of\nroadways shall angle the entrance toward the corner of the street whenever possible.\n(2) All roof- and wall-mounted mechanical, electrical, communications and service equipment, including satellite dishes and vent pipes,\nshall be screened from public view by parapets, walls, fences, dense evergreen foliage or by other suitable means.\n(3) Architectural ornaments along the roof line, such as molding cornices, ornamental bands or sculptures, are required.\n(4) Street furniture, outdoor eating areas and sitting areas shall be incorporated at the ground floor.\n(E) School site reservation. If the Board of Commissioners and the Brunswick County Board of Education have jointly determined the\nspecific location and size of any school sites to be reserved in accordance with the Town Comprehensive Plan, staff shall immediately notify\nthe Board of Education in writing whenever a development approval is sought or submitted which includes all or part of a school site to be\nreserved. The Board of Education shall promptly decide whether it still wishes the site to be reserved. If the Board of Education does wish to\nreserve the site, the subdivision shall not be approved without such reservation. The Board of Education shall then have 18 months beginning\non the date of final approval of the subdivision within which to acquire the site by purchase or by initiating condemnation proceedings. If the\nBoard of Education has not purchased or begun proceedings to condemn the site within 18 months, the developer may treat the land as freed\nof the reservation.\n(F) Dedication of land for park, recreation and open space. Every developer who proposes a mixed use project of land with a residential\ncomponent shall dedicate for public or private use a portion of land or pay a fee in lieu thereof, in accordance with this section, for public park,\ngreenway, recreation and open space sites to serve the recreational needs of the residents of the subdivision or development. The town\nprefers that ownership and maintenance of parks, recreation or open space lands be by a private entity, such as a property owners'\nassociation. Dedication of land, or fee in lieu of, must be approved by the Board of Commissioners prior to approval of the preliminary plat by\nthe Planning Board.\n(1) At least one-thirty-fifth of an acre shall be dedicated for each dwelling unit planned or proposed in the development.\n(2) The minimum amount of land which shall be dedicated for a public park, recreation or open space site shall be no less than two acres\nin size. When the area to be provided is less than two acres, the developer may be required to make payment in lieu of the dedication to be\nused for the acquisition or development of recreation, park or open space sites which would serve the needs of the residents of the\ndevelopment.\n(3) Except as otherwise required by the Board of Commissioners, all dedications of land shall meet the following criteria.\n(a) The dedicated land shall form a single parcel of land, except where the Board of Commissioners determines that two or more\nparcels would be in the best interest of the public, given the type and distribution of open spaces needed to adequately serve the proposed\ndevelopment. In these cases, the Board of Commissioners may require that the parcels be connected by a dedicated strip of land at least 30\nfeet in width.\n(b) Two-thirds of the dedicated land shall be usable for active recreation. Furthermore, lakes and other bodies of water may not be\nincluded in computing any of the dedicated land area.
