With the exception of Natural and Agricultural Open Space, open\nspace shall be planned and improved, accessible and usable by persons living nearby.

At least 25% of the improved open space land shall be dedicated to\nactive recreation purposes such as playgrounds, tennis courts, ball fields, volleyball courts, etc. The\nbalance of the open space park area may be designed for passive recreation.\n21.2-4 DESIGN AND LOCATION. In major subdivisions and multi-building developments in all zoning districts\nexcept Agricultural, open space shall be integrated into the design of the site. In subdivisions where\n50% or more of the lots are less than 0.75 acre in size, open space shall be located within 1/4 mile of at\nleast 90% of the building lots, as measured along the rights-of-way of streets providing access between\nthe two.

Open space features should provide focal points for the neighborhood. A central square\nor green, for example, may comprise a majority of the open space. There should be a hierarchy of open\nspace within new neighborhoods so that open space serves the needs of multiple age groups.\n21.2-6 TYPES OF OPEN SPACE. Open space types include Squares, Parks, Forecourts, Plazas, Greenways, and\nNatural and Agricultural. Standards for these open space types are set forth below.\nA. SQUARES\nSquares are areas for passive recreational use. Squares shall be bounded by streets on a minimum of\nthree sides or 75% of their perimeter.\nSquares should be used in tight urban environments where residents have little yard space. Squares\nare used to bring a more natural landscape into an urban environment. As such, not more than 25%\nof a square should be impervious surface coverage. Hardscaping should be decorative (example brick\npavers instead of asphalt for walkways).\nMin size: 500 sq. feet\nMax Size: 2 acres\nB. PARKS\nParks are areas for passive or active recreational use. Parks should be bounded by streets on a\nminimum of two sides or 50% of their perimeter.\nMinimum Size: 6,500 square feet\nArticle 21 - Page 2\n\nNEW PAGE 281\nMaximum Size: 8 Acres.

FORECOURT\nForecourts are open spaces that act as buffers between residential buildings and streets or non-\nresidential buildings. Forecourts are entirely bounded by buildings or streets. It is recommended that\nforecourts be planted parallel to all street right-of-ways.\nMinimum Size: 500 sq. feet\nMaximum Size: 1.5 acre\nD. PLAZA\nA plaza is an open area adjacent to a civic or commercial building.

Plazas function as gathering places and may incorporate a variety of non-permanent\nactivities such as outdoor farmers markets or craft fairs. Limited parking is permissible on plazas.\nPlazas should match the architectural style of the buildings that they are adjacent to regarding\nmaterials and design. Plazas shall be level or gently sloping.\nMinimum Size: none\nMaximum Size: none\nE.

Land used for public sidewalks significantly in excess of standard sidewalk requirements,\nstreetscape and hardscape areas accessible to the public including sidewalk cafe areas, areas\ncontaining public art, and similar urban open space amenities.\nC.\nLand on which locally or nationally designated historic structures are located and determined to\nbe contributing to the designation.\nD. Land which exceeds a 10 percent slope may be used to provide up to 50 percent (50%) of the\nrequired open space if existing slopes and vegetation so designated remain undisturbed.\nE. Land used for stormwater retention, provided such land is natural in appearance and is not\nseparately fenced, may be used for up to ten percent (10%) of the required open space.\nF.

This area may be\ncounted toward the total amount of open space required for the development.\nIf the total amount of land required proposed as future open space or greenway is less than the total\namount of open space required for the development by the above table, then the developer shall\nprovide additional open space to meet the requirement of the above table. If the amount of land\ndesignated as future open space or greenway exceeds the total amount of open space required by the\nabove table, then the developer must still provide the open space designated in the official adopted\nplan.\n21.2-3 MINIMUM OPEN SPACE AREA.
