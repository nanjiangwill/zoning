In the event individual\nseptic tanks and wells are used the lot size shall be a minimum of 10,500 square feet, or 175 feet by 60 feet.\nAdditional space requirements may be needed to meet setback or space requirements.\n(c) Each manufactured home shall have a minimum five foot setback from the boundary of its\nindividual manufactured home lot as established in division (G)(2)(b) above and each manufactured home must\nbe at least 20 feet from any other manufactured home side-to-side, side-to-end or end-to-end. Setback\nrequirements are measured from the outside edge of the exterior of entrance stoops, porches, steps, decks and\nthe like.\n\nNEW PAGE 24\n114\nBethel - Land Usage\n(d) No individual manufactured home lot shall be located within 25 feet of any exterior street or\nany exterior boundary line of the manufactured home park site.\n(e) All manufactured home spaces shall abut upon an interior street of no less than 20 feet in\nwidth, which shall have unobstructed access to a public street or highway. It is the intent of this section that each\nindividual manufactured home space shall not access directly onto a public street or highway except through an\ninterior street. Maintenance and repair of the streets shall be provided by the owner of the park. The streets shall\nbe maintained SO as to provide all-weather access to all manufactured home spaces at all times. The Zoning\nAdministrator shall make the determination as to whether a manufactured home park is in compliance with this\nstreet maintenance. If a park has five or more manufactured home spaces, the interior streets shall be paved.\nWhen a park size is increased beyond four spaces the entire park shall have paved streets. If two adjacent parks\nare connected both parks, which are now one, shall have paved streets if total spaces exceed four. If a park has\nfour or fewer spaces, numbers which do not require that the streets be paved, the streets shall be graded and\nmaintained SO that they are passable in all weather.\n(f) Dead-end streets shall not exceed 600 feet in length. Any interior street designed to be\npermanently closed shall have a turnaround of at least 80 feet in diameter at the closed end.\n(g) Interior streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no drive shall intersect\nat less than 75 degrees. Where a drive intersects at a public street or highway, the design standards of the state\ndepartment of transportation shall apply.\n(h) Suitable vehicular access for firefighting and emergency equipment, delivery of fuel, removal\nof refuse, parking and removal of manufactured homes and for other necessary services shall be provided.\n(i) Each manufactured home park with five or more manufactured home spaces shall have one\nor more recreation areas with a minimum size of 2,500 square feet which shall be easily accessible to all park\nresidents. Each addition of five manufactured home spaces shall require an additional 2,500 square feet\nof\nrecreational space. Recreation areas shall be located to be free of traffic hazards and should, where topography\npermits, be centrally located.\n(j) Parking space sufficient to accommodate at least two automobiles shall be located on each\nmanufactured home space.\n(k) No manufactured home park shall be located on ground that is subject to flooding. The park\nshall be graded so as to prevent any water from pending or accumulation on the premises. All ditch banks shall\nbe sloped and seeded to prevent erosion or vegetated buffer strips shall be maintained in their natural state to\nprevent erosion.\n(1) The manufactured home park shall have a fence buffer on three sides between the park and\nany adjacent residential uses other than manufactured homes unless the park is adjacent to a vacant lot or the\nadjacent lot contains natural features, such as a stream which would lend itself as a natural buffer. The fence shall\nbe a seven-foot wooden fence constructed in a manner so as to make the fence opaque.\n(m) The area of each individual manufactured home space shall be improved to provide an\nadequate foundation for the placement of the manufactured home as required by the State Building Code.\n(n) Each manufactured home shall be securely anchored in accordance with the State Building\nCode standards.\n\nNEW PAGE 25\nZoning Code\n115\n(H) General sanitation. In each manufactured home park, the permittee or duly authorized attendant or\ncaretaker shall be in charge at all times to keep the manufactured home park, its facilities, and equipment in a\nclean, orderly, safe and sanitary condition.\n(I) Park identification. Each manufactured home park shall have its park name on a sign clearly visible at\nthe park entrance.\n(1) Manufactured home park identification shall be limited to one sign per park entrance. No sign shall\nexceed 36 square feet in area.\n(2) Each manufactured home lot shall be numbered and clearly marked SO as to be clearly visible for\nemergency vehicle response.\n(J) Existing manufactured home parks. Manufactured home parks existing at the time of the adoption of\nthe ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be allowed to continue, but shall not be allowed to expand\nor increase through (including but not limited to) acquisition of additional land or development of any\nmanufactured home site or placement of any manufactured home in said manufactured home park, unless such\nexpansion fully meets the requirements set forth in this chapter. If a manufactured home park existing before the\nadoption date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived should lose its operating permit, then it shall\nbe subject to the regulations and requirements of this chapter in the reapplication for an operating license.\n(K) Manufactured home standards.\n(1) Manufactured homes permitted within the Manufactured Home Zone shall be at a minimum Class\nB homes.\n(2) Additionally, such manufactured homes shall meet the following requirements:\n(a) The manufactured home shall be occupied only as a single-family dwelling.\n(b) The manufactured home shall have a minimum width of 16 feet for a single wide home and\ntwenty-four feet for a double wide home.\n(c) The manufactured home shall have a length not exceeding four times its width, with length\nmeasured along the longest axis and width measured perpendicular to the longest axis at the narrowest part.\n(d) The towing apparatus, wheels, axles, and transporting lights shall be removed and shall not\nbe included in length and width measurements.\n(e) The longest axis of the manufactured home shall be oriented parallel or within a ten degree\ndeflection of being parallel to the lot frontage, unless other orientation is permitted by the Board of Adjustment\nfollowing a public hearing.\n(f) The manufactured home shall be set up in accordance with the standards established by the\nNorth Carolina Department of Insurance.
