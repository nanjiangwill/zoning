Building Rooflines\nIn order to create visual continuity within commercial districts, roofs shall be compatible with neighboring buildings'\narchitectural styles.

The appearance of a flat roof is prohibited and monolithic expanses of roof on large scale buildings\nshall be avoided through the use of elements such as gables and parapets. Rooftop mechanical and electrical equipment\nshall be screened from public view. See graphic, Section 802\nSection 809. Building Height\nThe vertical distance from the average grade elevation taken at the fronting street side of a structure to the top of any\nparapet structure or roofline of a flat roof, the midpoint from the leaves to the ridgeline of a pitched roof, or the top of a\nmansard roof.

As a general rule, front facades in the C-1 district should be at least 80 percent\nbrick and stone. Side facades should be at least 50 percent brick and stone. Rear facades do not have a\nminimum requirement for primary materials and where appropriate may consist entirely of secondary materials\n(e.g., stucco). Tertiary materials (i.e., wood and metal) should be used for decorative elements and trim only.\n2. Exterior building materials on the primary structure shall not include smooth-faced concrete block, tilt-up\nconcrete panels, or prefabricated steel panels.\n3.\nThe following types of building materials shall not be used: highly reflective, shiny, or mirror-like materials; mill-\nfinish (non-colored) aluminum metal windows or door frames; exposed, unfinished foundation walls; exposed\nplywood or particle board; and un-plastered, exposed concrete masonry blocks.\n4. Material or color changes generally should occur at a change of plane. Piecemeal embellishment and frequent\nchanges in material should be avoided.\n5.\nA horizontal accent stripe (e.g., a foot wide stripe of different color) may be used to help reduce the appearance\nof monotonous colors and break up the appearance of large building walls.\n6. Facade colors shall be low reflectance, and subtle, neutral, or earth-tone colors. High-intensity colors, metallic\ncolors, black, or fluorescent colors shall not be used. Building trim and accent areas may feature brighter colors,\nprovided that the width of the trim shall not exceed four feet.\n7. Building colors shall be carefully chosen so that each building color complements that of its neighbors. Colors\nare classified as the \"base\" color (used on the majority of the building surface), \"trim\" color (used on the\nwindow trim, fascia, balustrades, and posts), and \"accent\" color (used on signs, awnings, and doors). The base\ncolor should consist of more subdued earth tones or brick shades. Trim colors should have contrasting lighter or\ndarker shade than the base color. If natural brick is used, it should not be painted.\nSection 811. Awnings\n1.\nThe use of awnings on buildings is recommended to provide protection from sun, wind, and rain, and to improve\nthe aesthetics of building exteriors.\n2. It is recommended that awnings be constructed with a durable frame, covered by a canvas material. Awnings\nthat are backlit through translucent materials may be acceptable but are not particularly encouraged.\nAluminum and other metal canopies are acceptable in most instances, particularly when integrated into\nshopping center designs. Flameproof vinyl, canvas or metal awnings and canopies may be permitted.\n3. Solid colors are preferred over striped lawnings, but striping may be permitted if colors complement the\ncharacter of the structure or group of buildings.\n4. Awnings are encouraged for first floor retail uses to provide architectural interest and to encourage pedestrian\nactivity. Where awnings are used, they should be designed to coordinate with the design of the building and\nany other awnings along the same block.\n38\n\nNEW PAGE 39\nSection 812. Exterior Lighting\n1. Exterior lighting should be architecturally compatible with the building style, material, and colors. Galleria style\nand shoebox styles (cutoff fixtures) shall be used rather than cobra type light fixtures and directional floodlights.\n2. Exterior lighting of the building and site should be designed so that light is not directed off the site, and the light\nsource is shielded from direct offsite viewing. All outdoor light fixtures should be fully shielded or be designed\nor provided with light angle cut-offs, so as to eliminate up-lighting, spill light, and glare.\n3. Excessive illumination of signage, building, or site shall be prohibited. Roof lighting, down-lighting washing the\nbuilding walls, and illuminated awnings are all prohibited.\n4. Fixture mounting height should be appropriate for the project and the setting. The mounting height of fixtures in\nparking lots or service areas shall not exceed 20 feet, and lower mounting heights are encouraged, particularly\nwhere adjacent to residential areas or other sensitive land uses. Uses of low, bollard-type fixtures three to four\nfeet in height, are encouraged as pedestrian area lighting.\nSection 813. Parking\n1. Parking Plan Required\nBefore any building permit is issued; the proposed parking lot layout and area must be found to be in\ncompliance with all requirements of this Ordinance. A parking plan, for all but detached single-family uses, shall\nbe submitted for approval by the Zoning Administrator. Occupancy of the land or use of a building shall not\noccur until the Zoning Administrator determines that parking facilities are available in accordance with the\napproved plan.\nAll new or newly expanded developments subject to design review shall comply with the minimum parking\nrequirements of this Ordinance. Additionally, developments not in the C-1 Zoning District are subject to the\nrequirements Section 1213 of this ordinance\n2. Location of Off-Street Parking Areas\nAll parking spaces required by this ordinance shall be provided on the same lot with the main building or use\nthat it serves, and to the sides and rear of the primary building wherever practical, with the following\nexceptions:\na. Upon demonstration that the parking spaces required are not available and cannot reasonably be\nprovided on the same lot as the building, structure or use it serves, the required parking spaces may be\nprovided on a lot of which a substantial portion is within 400 feet of such building, structure, or use. This\nprovision shall require submittal of evidence of ownership or valid agreement to lease the off-site\nparking area that is intended to be used to comply with this article.\nb. A property owner may provide a portion of the required off-street parking spaces on a parcel directly\nadjacent to the subject parcel provided the peak usage times for such parking do not coincide, and\nprovided a legally-binding agreement for such shared parking exists between the adjacent property\nowners.\nC.\nOff-street parking is not required in the C-1 Zoning district.\n3. Parking Spaces\nThe standard parking space (stall) size for 90-degree parking lots is 9'x18', with 24' wide driving aisles. Four\npercent (4%) of all spaces provided shall meet Federal ADA standards for disabled parking. Up to fifteen percent\n(15%) of all parking spaces may be sized for compact car parking, with a minimum stall dimension of 8'x 16'.\n39\n", "page_number": 37, "page_range": [37, 38, 39], "highlight": ["<em>requirements</em> of this Ordinance.", "Location of <em>Off</em>-<em>Street</em> <em>Parking</em> Areas\nAll <em>parking</em> <em>spaces</em> <em>required</em> by this ordinance shall be provided", "Upon demonstration that the <em>parking</em> <em>spaces</em> <em>required</em> are not available and cannot reasonably be\nprovided", "A property owner may provide a portion of the required <em>off</em>-<em>street</em> <em>parking</em> spaces on a parcel directly", "<em>Off</em>-<em>street</em> <em>parking</em> is not required in the C-1 Zoning district.\n3."], "score": 9.917057, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Residential\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R-10\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R10\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R-10\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking space for each\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 89\nPLANNING BOARD'S WRITTEN RECOMMENDATION and CONSISTENCY STATEMENT TO THE TOWN\nCOUNCIL TO APPROVE THE TEXT AMENDMENTS PRESENTED TO THE PLANNING BOARD ON July 12,\n2022 REGULAR MEETING\nWHEREAS, the Zoning Administrator introduced the proposed text amendments which are as follows:\n1.\nArticle 4 Section 401-Definitions: The following definition shall be added as section 401.52.1\nLight Industrial- The indoor manufacturing, processing, fabrication, assembly, treatment,\nand packaging of products, and incidental storage, sales and distribution of such products,\nwhich does not produce noise, odors, vibration, hazardous waste materials, or particulate\nthat will disturb or endanger neighboring properties.\n2.\nArticle 6 Section 601-Table of Uses.
