GENERAL INDUSTRIAL (M-2) DISTRICT\nA.\nM-2 DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENT\nThe General Industrial (M-2) district is established to accommodate heavy manufacturing, assembly,\nfabrication, processing, distribution, storage, and research and development. It is typically located in\nareas with good access to surface transportation by trucks and rail. Development takes place on larger\nlots and is often enclosed by security fencing. The district accommodates large-scale industrial uses\nincluding outdoor operations or storage with extensive movement of vehicles, materials, and goods,\ntruck traffic and greater potential for adverse environmental and visual impacts on neighboring lands.\nThe district also allows limited forms of heavier commercial use types, but residential development is\nprohibited (except for caretaker quarters as an accessory use). District standards are intended to\nprevent the establishment of any use types that would interrupt industrial operations. Development\nshall comply with all applicable standards in Article 6.

LIGHT BUSINESS (B-1) DISTRICT\nA.\nB-1 DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENT\nThe mixed-use Light Business (B-1) district is intended for low intensity, neighborhood-serving commercial and\nneighborhoods. The B-1 district provides employment, shopping, personal service, and entertainment\ndevelopment around significant roadway intersections located along the edges of\nuses for the benefit of nearby residents in a compact context. The district allows offices, personal\nservices, and small-scale retail and a variety of institutional uses. As a means of providing additional\nfloor housing options, the district allows two-family, multi-family, and upper story residential over ground-\nnon-residential uses. Non-residential buildings are small-scale, with small footprints, and with\nis building heights around two stories. Buildings are proximate to the street edge and off-street parking\nwell-screened from lower intensity uses. Industrial development and higher density residential\ntheir are not permitted. District regulations discourage uses that are too intense or that draw the majority uses of\npatrons from outside the immediate area.

MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL (R-10) DISTRICT\nA.\nR-10 DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENT\nThe Multi-Family Residential (R-10) district is the most dense of the residential districts and allows a\nbroad range of residential use types. The R-10 district is typically configured as a single development\non one or two lots, though are also some examples of multiple lot developments throughout the\nCounty. Multi-family development is typically more dense than its immediate surroundings, and can\nalso serve as an effective transition between single-family detached development and adjacent\ncommercial or employment uses. Buildings in the R-10 district tend to have shared site access, shared\nbuilding access, common site features (like recreation space) owned in common, and centralized\nservice functions. Residential densities are slightly higher for most forms of allowable residential\ndevelopment than is permitted in the other residential districts, though multi-family density is double\nthat in the other residential districts. Uses that are potentially detrimental to residential development\nare generally discouraged in the R-10 district.
