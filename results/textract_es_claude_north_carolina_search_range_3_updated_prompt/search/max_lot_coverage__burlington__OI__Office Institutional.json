HEAVY INDUSTRIAL (HI) DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Heavy Industrial (HI) district is established to\naccommodate heavy manufacturing, assembly, fabrication,\nprocessing, distribution, storage, and research and\ndevelopment. The district accommodates large-scale\nindustrial uses including outdoor operations or storage with\nextensive movement of vehicles, materials, and goods, truck\ntraffic and greater potential for adverse environmental and\nvisual impacts on neighboring lands. The district also allows\nlimited forms of heavier commercial use types but residential\ndevelopment is prohibited (except for caretaker quarters as an\naccessory use). District standards are intended to prevent the\nestablishment of any use types that would interrupt industrial\noperations. District standards require that no land or structure\nbe used for any purpose that causes noxious or offensive\nodors, gas fumes, smoke, dust, vibration, or noise that\nsubstantially interferes with other nearby uses.\nB.
