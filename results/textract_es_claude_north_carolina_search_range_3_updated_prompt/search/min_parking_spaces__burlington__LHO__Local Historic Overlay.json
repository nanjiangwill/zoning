OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING\nA. PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe purpose of this section is to ensure provision of off-street parking and loading facilities in proportion\nto the generalized parking, loading, and transportation demand of the different uses allowed by this\nOrdinance. The standards are further intended to:\n1. Provide for adequate off-street parking, off-street loading, and safe movement of vehicles into, out\nof, and through parking areas;\n2. Allow for flexibility to accommodate alternative solutions to off-street parking and loading needs,\nwhere such flexibility is consistent with the City's adopted policy guidance;\n3.\nReduce the aesthetic impact of surface parking lots in gateway corridors, downtown, and mixed-use\nareas through standards addressing on-site parking lot locations;\n4.\nAvoid excessive paved surface areas and the resulting problems associated with stormwater runoff\nand urban heat islands; and\n5. Protecting compatibility between adjacent uses of land and historic resources.\nB. APPLICABILITY\nThe standards in this section shall apply to all development in the City's jurisdiction, unless exempted in\naccordance with Section 5.1.C, Exemptions.\n1.

In cases where the development, lot, or site has existing\noff-street parking spaces that do not comply with these standards, those spaces are subject to Section\n5.1.B.5, Pre-Existing Nonconforming Development. Driveways, aisles, or maneuvering areas serving\nnew off-street parking spaces or connecting new off-street parking spaces to the existing parking\nspaces established prior to November 1, 2019 shall also comply with the requirements in this section.\nNothing shall preclude the use of an administrative adjustment or alternative parking plan as needed\nto ensure continuity and practical connection between different parking areas.\n5. Pre-Existing Nonconforming Development\nLawfully-established off-street parking and loading areas established prior to November 1, 2019, that\ndo not comply with these standards shall be subject to the applicable standards in CHAPTER 9.\nINONCONFORMITIES.\nC. EXEMPTIONS\n1. The following forms of development are exempt from the requirements of this section:\na.
