development. The gross density of new multi-family development within this district is\nlimited to 12 dwelling units per acre. However, maximum heights may exceed 35 feet and\nmaximum density may exceed 12 dwelling units per acre when located in a conditional zoning\ndistrict with an approved concept plan that is consistent with the town's adopted comprehensive\nand/or small area plans.\n6.2.3 Nonresidential Districts.\n(A) Office and Institutional District (OI). The Office and Institutional District (OI) is established\nto accommodate a wide range of low to moderate intensity professional, civic, educational, public,\nand governmental uses. Typically, this district will serve as a transitional district between lower\nintensity residential uses and higher intensity commercial uses.\n(B) Neighborhood Business District (NB). The Neighborhood Business District (NB) is\nestablished to accommodate low to moderate intensity commercial establishments and\nprofessional offices which provide goods and services to residents of an adjacent, or nearby,\nresidential neighborhood.\n(C) Central Business District (CB). The Central Business District (CB) is established to\naccommodate moderate intensity commercial development in the core commercial area of the\ntown.\n(D) Highway Business District (HB). The Highway Business District is established to\naccommodate moderate to high intensity commercial development along major roadways serving\nthe town.\n(E) Light Industrial District (LI). The Light Industrial District (LI) is established to accommodate\nlow to moderate intensity manufacturing, transportation, logistics, and wholesaling uses in areas of\nthe town's jurisdiction where such uses can be operated in a manner which does not infringe on the\nuse or enjoyment of nearby residential or commercial areas. Uses in this district are limited to those\nwhich do not create any off-site environmental impacts or nuisances such as light, dust, odor,\nnoise, or emit any airborne pollutants.\n(F) Heavy Industrial District (HI). The Heavy Industrial District (HI) is established to\naccommodate moderate to high intensity manufacturing facilities and other complementary uses in\nareas of the town's jurisdiction where the establishment of such uses engaged in higher intensity\nmanufacturing processes would not cause detrimental effects to nearby residential or commercial\nareas.\n(Ord. A.23.04, passed 4-6-2023)\n\u00a7 6.3 CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICTS.\nAmerican Legal\nPublishing\nPublisher's Note: This Section has been AMENDED by new legislation (Ord. LDOTA.24.05,\nadopted 6-6-2024). The text of the amendment will be incorporated below when the ordinance is codified.\n6.3.1 Purpose and intent. The Conditional Zoning District classification allows the Town\nCouncil to consider proposed uses and tailor the zoning to accommodate those uses while\naddressing anticipated problems that may arise from the establishment of the proposed uses. This\nsection sets forth the types of Conditional Zoning Districts and explains their relationship to the\nBase Zoning Districts\n3 of 28\n7/3/2024, 12:56 PM\n\nNEW PAGE 4\nFirefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cf7024e7-0dae-4e00-83.\n6.3.2 Designation. Conditional Zoning Districts shall be designated only in accordance with the\nprocedures set forth in division 3.2.3, Conditional Zoning District Classification, and may not\ncontain conditions which are less restrictive than this ordinance, other town requirements, or other\napplicable state or federal laws.\n6.3.3 Allowable uses. No use shall be permitted within a Conditional Zoning District except\npursuant to the conditions imposed as part of the approval. The permitted uses shall be limited to\nthose permitted in the corresponding Base Zoning District unless otherwise restricted in the\nconditions set forth in the approval of the Conditional Zoning District classification. Any use allowed\nin one Gateway District may be approved as a Conditional District in any other Gateway District.\n6.3.4 Applicable standards.\n(A) Base Zoning District standards apply. All standards and requirements that apply to the\ncorresponding Base Zoning District shall also apply to the Conditional Zoning District, except where\nallowed in division 6.3.6(B) and \u00a7 6.5.\n(B) No less restrictive than base district. Conditions imposed on a Conditional Zoning District\nmay be no less restrictive than the standards that apply to the corresponding Base Zoning District,\nexcept where allowed in division 6.3.6(B) and 6.5.\n(C) Stricter standards adopted. Existing conditions or limitations associated with an approved\nConditional Zoning District classification shall become null and void if future amendments to this\nordinance require stricter standards than those imposed under the Conditional Zoning District\nclassification.\n(D) Application of conditions. In cases where the ability to implement an approved Conditional\nZoning District condition is impossible or impractical (e.g., a condition requiring trees to be\npreserved when the trees have subsequently died due to natural causes), the Ordinance\nAdministrator shall enforce the condition in a way that most closely meets the condition's original\nintent.\n6.3.5 Parallel Conditional Districts established. Each Base Zoning District shall have a\ncorresponding \"parallel\" Conditional Zoning District. Conditional Zoning District classifications shall\nbe indicated on the Official Zoning Map by the suffix \"CD\" in front of the associated Base Zoning\nDistrict.\n6.3.6 Planned Unit Development District (CD-PUD).\n(A) General. The Planned Unit Development District (CD-PUD) is a special purpose\nConditional Zoning District that is established in order to accommodate a diverse mix of residential\nand nonresidential uses and structures that function as a cohesive, integrated, and unified\ndevelopment. This district encourages innovative development patterns by allowing flexibility in\npermitted uses, design, and layout requirements in conjunction with a concept plan. This district\nmay only be established through the process set forth in division 3.2.3, Conditional Zoning District\nClassification.\n(B) Planned unit development standards.\n(1) Minimum size. The minimum size for an application for Conditional Zoning District\nclassification to a CD-PUD district is 25 acres.\n(2) Permitted uses. Planned Unit Developments may contain any use allowed in the RP,\nRR, RS, RT, RMF, OI, NB, CB, CX, SI, NI, CW, and CE Districts except for agricultural uses.\n(3) Preservation of environmentally sensitive areas. All areas of wetlands as defined by\n4 of 28\n7/3/2024, 12:56\n\nNEW PAGE 5\nFirefox\nhtps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cf7024e7-0dae-4e00-83.\nstate and federal agencies, steep slopes of 15% and greater, floodways as delineated by the North\nCarolina Division of Emergency Management or its successor, and sites listed in the most recent\nNatural Heritage Inventory shall be preserved as open space.\n(4) Protection of open space corridors. Open space connections must be retained in a\nnatural condition, with the exception of greenways that comply with the town's adopted standards,\nwhich are still allowed in these areas.\n(5) Density. The overall residential density of the PUD is established by the concept plan as\npart of the Conditional Zoning District classification.\n(6) Minimum lot size. Minimum lot sizes in each area of the PUD are established by the\nconcept plan as part of the Conditional Zoning District classification.\n(7) Minimum interior setbacks. Setback requirements within the PUD are established by\nthe concept plan as part of the Conditional Zoning District classification. While no minimum setback\nis required, if one is provided it must be at least five feet in width.\n(8) Minimum street setbacks. Minimum street (front yard) setbacks within the PUD are\nestablished by the concept plan as part of the Conditional Zoning District classification.\n(9) Maximum height. Within single-family residential portions of a PUD, the maximum\nheight limit is 35 feet. In nonresidential or mixed-use portions of a PUD, the maximum height limit is\ndetermined by the concept plan.\n(10) Open space and recreation facilities. A minimum of 20% of the gross area of the\nPUD must be dedicated to open space. No more than 50% of the dedicated open space may be\nused for active recreation purposes (i.e., soccer fields, tennis courts) and the like. At least 50% of\nthe passive recreation/natural areas must be usable and accessible (i.e., not wetlands, steep\nslopes, or other marginal lands).\n(11) Nonresidential areas. Nonresidential areas and adjacent residential areas must be\narranged in such a manner that convenient pedestrian access is provided between and within\nthose areas.\n(12) Parking and loading. Off-street parking and loading areas must be provided in\naccordance with Article 13.\n(13) Street design. Streets must be designed and located so that they are integrated into\nand provide continuation of the surrounding street network. A minimum street connectivity index\nscore of 1.5, as outlined in division 14.3.4(B), shall be maintained throughout the development.\n(14) Signs.\n(i) A common signage plan must be included as part of the concept plan. This common\nsignage plan shall specify the size, type, height, setback, location, design, illumination, and number\nof signs to be allowed in the PUD. All signs included in the common signage plan shall utilize the\nsame coordinated colors, styles, and lettering schemes throughout the development.\n(ii) Signs allowed in residential portions of the PUD may be no less restrictive than the\nstandards set forth for signs in the RT District.\n(iii) Signs allowed in nonresidential portions of the PUD may be no less restrictive than the\nstandards set forth for signs in the CB District.\n(15) Landscaping. Landscaping standards for the PUD are established by the concept plan\n5 of 28\n7/3/2024, 12:56\n", "page_number": 3, "page_range": [3, 4, 5], "highlight": ["However, maximum heights may exceed 35
