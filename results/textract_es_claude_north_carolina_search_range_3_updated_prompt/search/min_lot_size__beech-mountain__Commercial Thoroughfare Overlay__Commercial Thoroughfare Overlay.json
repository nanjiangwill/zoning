WS II is an overlay district as shown on\nthe official Zoning Map primarily intended to maintain a predominantly undeveloped land use\nintensity pattern. Single-family uses, where permitted, shall be allowed at a maximum of one\ndwelling unit per acre on a project by project basis. All other residential and non-residential\ndevelopment shall be allowed a maximum of 12% built-upon area, where permitted. In addition,\ncommercial uses may occupy 5% of the balance of the watershed with a 70% built-upon area when\napproved as a special, non-residential intensity allocation (SNIA). The Zoning Administrator\nis\nauthorized to approve SNIA's consistent with the provisions of this chapter. Projects must minimize\nbuilt-upon surface area, direct storm water away from surface waters and incorporate Best\nManagement Practices to minimize water quality impacts.\n1\nLandfills and sites for the land\napplication of residuals or petroleum-contaminated soils are prohibited in the district. No activity,\nsituation, structure or land use shall be allowed within the WS-II and WS-II-C water supply\nwatersheds which poses a threat to water quality or the public health, safety and welfare. Such\nconditions may arise from (for example) inadequate on-site sewage systems, inadequate\nsedimentation and erosion control measures, the improper storage or disposal of junk, trash or\nother refuse within a buffer area, the improper management of storm water runoff or any other\nsituation found to pose a threat to water quality.\n2\n(2) Buckeye Creek Water Supply Watershed Critical Area WS // C. WS II C is an overlay\ndistrict as shown on the official Zoning Map intended to maintain a predominantly undeveloped land\nuse pattern.

In determining the value of work in\nregard to this section, the value of multiple projects within the most recent two-year period shall be\naggregated. For the purposes of this section, bringing an existing site into compliance shall not be\nconstrued to require the relocation of any existing structure or portion of a structure.\n(Ord. 2014-05, passed 12-9-2014; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 154.121 PROCEDURE.\n(A) Whenever it is determined that development is within the scope of the Commercial\nThoroughfare Overlay District architectural standards, review by the Architectural Review\nCommittee is required. A permit issued by such Architectural Review Committee is required prior to\nobtaining building and zoning permits for construction. The Architectural Review Committee shall\nhave 45 days after the first consideration of the application within which to: 1) approve, 2) deny, or\n3) approve with conditions, any properly submitted application.\n(B) After an approved project is reviewed for building permit purposes, a copy of the final\n79 of 198\n4/30/24, 21:02\n\nNEW PAGE 80\nFirefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/2050bacc-5248-438d-91...\napproved plans shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator prior to permit issuance. The Zoning\nAdministrator shall ensure that no significant changes have been made to the plans that were\napproved by the Architectural Review Committee during the building permit process. If the Zoning\nAdministrator determines that significant changes have occurred, the plans shall be returned to the\nArchitectural Review Committee for re-evaluation prior to permit issuance.\n(C) A properly submitted application shall contain two full size sets of plans and one set of\nplans, sized 11\" X 17\", drawn to scale, one of which shall be returned to the applicant upon\napproval. The applicant shall also submit one electronic copy of plans in pdf format. The plans\nshall contain the following:\n(1) A recent survey, showing the shape, dimensions, contours and acreage of the lot on which\nthe proposed building is to be erected;\n(2) The location of the lot with respect to adjacent rights-of-way and driveways;\n(3) The shape, dimensions and location on the lot of all buildings, existing and proposed, and\nrequired setbacks;\n(4) The nature of the proposed use of the building or land, including the extent and location of\nthe use;\n(5) The location and dimensions of parking and loading space and means of ingress and\negress;\n(6) The square feet and percentage of the lot as-built-upon area if the lot is located in a\nwatershed;\n(7) The location of all required buffers and setbacks;\n(8) A landscape plan that includes the location and number of trees to be removed, and trees\nand other vegetation to be planted. The landscaping plan shall include (but is not limited to) the\nfollowing:\n(a) The location, species and height of new trees and shrubbery;\n(b) The location and dimensions of planting areas;\n(c) The dimensions of the entire parking or paved area;\n(d) The location and height of fences or walls;\n(e) The number, location, species and size of existing trees between the principal building\nand the public street right-of-way, which are to be maintained and preserved for credit. The size of\nexisting trees is to be measured by taking its diameter of the tree at approximately four feet above\nthe grade (dbh);\n(f) The location and description of any barriers to be erected to protect any vegetation from\ndamage both during and after construction;\n(g) Clear edging shall be provided between landscaped areas and pedestrian/vehicle areas;\n(9) The location and dimensions of any outdoor activity areas or assembly areas, outdoor\ndisplay areas, storage areas, sidewalks or walkways;\n(10) An architectural rendering of the elevation view of all sides of the proposed building or\n80 of 198\n4/30/24, 21:02\n\nNEW PAGE 81\nFirefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/2050bacc-5248-438d-91..\nbuildings to be constructed that includes the materials and colors to be used and provides sufficient\ndetails to comprehend the appearance of the building once constructed;\n(11) A grading plan that includes the current and proposed topography of the site and any\ndistinct natural features such as streams, rocky outcrops, and the like;\n(12) A sedimentation and erosion control plan (if applicable); and\n(13) All proposed stormwater drainage structures and systems.\n(Ord. 2014-05, passed 12-9-2014 ; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 154.122 DESIGN STANDARDS.\n(A) Site aspects.\n(1) Relationship of a building to its site.\n(a) Building design shall be fitted to the natural contours of the site. Natural features of the\nsite, such as rock outcroppings or natural drainage ways, shall be preserved.\n(b) On wooded sites, buildings shall be carefully situated to take advantage of the shade and\nenergy conservation provided by the trees.\n(c) The impression of buildings tucked into, rather than superimposed on, the natural\nlandscape shall be created.\n(d) The view of the building from the street and surrounding areas shall be as important as\nthe view available to the building's occupants.\n(e) Buildings shall be located according to the natural characteristics of the site. In hilly\nterrain, clustering of buildings is encouraged as a strategy to avoid destroying sensitive natural\nareas.\n(f) Buildings shall be designed to harmonize with the existing topography, thereby minimizing\nland disruption.\n(g) Grading shall be held to a minimum and should complement natural land forms (such as\nsmooth gradations or terracing).\n(2) Relationships of the project to adjoining area.\n(a) Building projects shall not be designed as isolated units, but instead shall reflect the\ncontext of the adjoining properties.\n(b) Grading shall blend gently with contours of adjacent properties.\n(c) Buildings at the ends of streets, or at street corners, shall serve as visual \"terminals,\"\nserving to both unify and conclude the architectural statement made on the street.\n(d) Proposed recreation areas or uses shall complement nearby existing uses. The\nextension of existing parks or recreation areas into a proposed development is a highly desirable\ndesign feature.\n(e) Buildings or projects located near or adjacent to a greenway shall provide

Every building shall have a well-defined entrance visible from the main\nthoroughfare on which the parcel is situated (e.g., If the parcel on which the building is situated has\nfrontage on Beech Mountain Parkway, the entrance shall be visible from Beech Mountain\nParkway). These entrances may be covered porches or other architectural amenities that convey\nan impression of welcome and openness.\n(G) Color.

Due to above-ground utilities, the\ntown may require the use of ornamental trees in place of large shade trees.\nb. Inclusion of existing trees in the landscape design is encouraged. Shrubbery, ground\ncover, and other planting materials shall be used to compliment the tree planting. No area of the\nstreet yard may be exposed soil, but instead shall be covered with vegetation, whether grass or\nshrubbery. The only area that shall remain uncovered is the six-foot radius surrounding the trunk of\nany tree; however, this area shall be mulched.\n(2) Existing vegetation. Existing trees and vegetation, other than exotic, non-native species,\nmay count toward meeting the requirements of this section, when such vegetation is in good\ncondition, is properly protected during development, and helps to further the purpose of the district.\nExisting vegetation that is used to meet the standards of this section shall be maintained or\nreplaced if it dies during the first year after the completion of the development.\n(3) New plant material. Regionally grown and native species of plants are preferred. Any plant\nlisted with the Agricultural Extension Office as a native plant shall be considered to be a native\nplant for these purposes. New plant material shall complement existing site vegetation, should be\nmixed with it and should be integrated with all other natural site features.\n(I) Parking lots; parking lot yards. The purpose of this section is to ensure that the Commercial\nThoroughfare Overlay District of Beech Mountain is an attractive and appealing place for residents\nand visitors. This often means that a higher priority must be placed upon being an attractive and\nfunctional place for people than being convenient for automobiles.\n(1) Parking location. Parking is encouraged to be located to the rear or sides of buildings, with\nthe building fronting on the public way. However, nothing in this section is to prevent the\nestablishment of parking in front of a building so long as the project adheres to all other relevant\nregulations. When parking is to be established in front of buildings, it is recommended that the\napplicant create and utilize on-street parking if such is approved by the NCDOT and/or the town.\n(For the purposes of this section, ON-STREET PARKING is defined as a parking area without a\ndivider between the street and the parking area, in which automobiles directly access the parking\nspaces from the road. On-street parking may be parallel, angled or straight in, as approved by the\nNCDOT and the town.)\n(J) Buffer yards. The purpose of the buffer yard is to provide a transitional area between uses\nthat may differ in development intensity and density. A BUFFER YARD is defined as a planting yard\nthat serves as a visual separation between uses and should be densely planted. No buildings,\nparking areas or other development may encroach within the buffer yard, with the exception of\ntown-approved public walkways or sidewalks. Refer to \u00a7 154.165 for the standards for buffer yards.\n(Ord. 2014-05, passed 12-9-2014; Ord. 2021-03, passed 6-8-2021)\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\u00a7 154.130 ZONING AFFECTS EVERY BUILDING AND USE.\nNo building or land shall hereafter be used and no building or part thereof shall be erected,\nmoved or altered except in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district in which\nit\nis located, except as provided in this chapter.\n(1989 Code, Title V, Ch. 51, Art.

This category of nonconformance consists of vacant lots for\nwhich plats or deeds have been recorded in the Register of Deeds office of Watauga or Avery\nCounty, which at the time of the adoption of this chapter fail to comply with the minimum area or\nwidth requirements of the districts in which they are located. Any such nonconforming lot may be\nused for any of the uses permitted in the district in which it is located provided that:\n(1) Where the lot area is not more than 20% below the minimum specified in this chapter, and\nother dimensional requirements are otherwise complied with, the Zoning Administrator is\nauthorized to issue a Certificate of Zoning Compliance; and\n(2) Where the lot area is more than 20% below the minimum specified in this chapter or other\ndimensional requirements cannot be met, the Board of Adjustment is authorized to approve as a\nvariance such dimensions as shall conform as closely as possible to the required dimensions.\n(B) Nonconforming occupied lots. This category of nonconformance consists of lots, occupied\nby buildings or structures at the time of the adoption of this chapter, that fail to comply with the\nminimum requirements for area, width, yard and setbacks for the district in which they are located.\nThese lots may continue to be used.\n(C) Nonconforming open uses of land. This category of nonconformance consists of lots used\nfor storage yards, used car lots, auto wrecking, junkyards, and similar open spaces where the only\nbuildings on the lot are incidental and accessory to the open use of the lot and where such use of\nthe land is not permitted to be established hereafter, under this chapter, in the district in which it is\nlocated. A legally established nonconforming open use of land may be continued except as follows.\n(1) When a nonconforming open use of land has been changed to a conforming use, it shall\nnot thereafter revert to any nonconforming use.\n(2) Nonconforming open use of land shall be changed only to conforming uses.\n(3) A nonconforming open use of land shall not be enlarged to cover more land than was\noccupied by that use when it became nonconforming.\n(4) When any nonconforming open use of land is discontinued for a period in excess of 180\ndays, any future use of the land shall be limited to those uses permitted in the district in which the\nland is located. Vacancy and/or non-use of the land, regardless of the intent of the owner or tenant,\nshall constitute discontinuance under this provision.\n(D) Nonconforming uses of structures. This category of nonconformance consists of buildings or\nstructures used at the time of enactment of this chapter for purposes of use not permitted in the\ndistrict in which they are located. Such uses may be continued as follows:\n(1) An existing nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use of a higher\nclassification, provided that the other conditions in this section are complied with. For the purpose\nof this chapter, the rank order of uses from higher to lower shall be: 1) residential, 2) private-public\nservice, and 3) commercial service.\n88 of 198\n4/30/24,\n", "page_number":
