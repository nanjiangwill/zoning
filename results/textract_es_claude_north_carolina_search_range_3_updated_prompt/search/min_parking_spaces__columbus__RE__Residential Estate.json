VII, \u00a7 703, passed - -)\n\u00a7 154.064 STATEMENT OF DISTRICT INTENTS.\n(A) Residential Estate (RE). The Residential Estate (RE) district as herein established is intended to be the most\nrestrictive of the residential districts. The intent is to provide for an environment of low density one-family detached dwelling\nunits along with other residentially related facilities which serve the residents in this district. These areas will often be\ndependent on private, individual septic tanks and wells; therefore, requiring larger lot sizes to sustain individual water\nsupplies and sewage disposal facilities. These areas may have soil and topographic constraints that preclude intense urban\ndevelopment.\n(B) Low Density Residential District (R-1). The Low Density Residential District is primarily intended to provide locations\nfor low-density residential development in outlying rural areas that are not likely to have public water and sewer services\navailable and may have soil and topographic constraints that preclude intense urban development. These areas often will be\ndependent upon private, individual septic tanks and wells; therefore, requiring larger lot sizes to sustain individual water\nsupplies and sewage disposal facilities. This district also provides for recreational, community service and institutional uses\nthat will complement the residential development. This district will be applied within those areas designated on the land use\nplan as Low Density Residential areas.\n(C) Community Residential-Medium Density Residential District (R-2). The Community Residential-Medium Density\nResidential District is primarily intended to provide locations for residential uses and supporting recreational and community\nservice uses in area where generally both Town public water and sewer services are available. These are the more urban\nareas of the community and will be primarily within the town limits and in close proximity to public and private services and\nthe town's central business district. This district is intended to protect existing single-family homes and subdivisions within\nthe town. This district will be applied within those areas designated on the land use plan as Medium Density Residential\n\nNEW PAGE 17\nareas.\n(D) Central Business District (CBD). The Central Business District is intended to be the primary retail and service center,\nand focal point of the community. This district provides for the concentration of commercial uses, professional services,\nfinancial services, governmental functions, and related services. The CBD area currently has access to both public water\nand sewer services, and dimensional requirements for this district are intended to encourage concentrated commercial\ndevelopment and to promote convenient pedestrian shopping in pleasant surroundings. This district will be applied to the\nexisting commercial center and to adjacent properties that with commercial development will complement and enhance the\nCBD as the retail and service center of the community. This district will be applied within the commercial areas as\ndesignated on the land use plan.\n(E) I-26 Corridor Overlay Area (I-26 COA). The I-26 Corridor Overlay boundaries are from the concrete right-of-way\nmonument set at the east intersection of Highway 26 and Highway 108, at the corner of Spartan Petroleum Company and\nrunning least 500 feet on Highway 108 to a line parallel to the right-of-way of 1-26, and also at the concrete right-of-way\nmonument set at the west intersection of Highway 26 and Highway 108, at the corner of the McFarland tract and running\nwest 500 feet on Highway 108 to a line parallel to the right of way of 1-26. This overlay area has the same requirements as\nin\nthe Highway Commercial District, but also has additional requirements for tall signs and electronic gaming operations.\n(F) Highway Commercial District (HC). The Highway Commercial District is intended to provide suitable locations for\nclustered groupings of highway commercial development in convenient locations along N.C. 108, to serve local residences\nand persons traveling by automobile. Urban sprawl, congestions, and strip commercial development will be discouraged by\npromoting good design, clustered developments, and by guiding commercial development primarily to areas that have water\nand sewer services and suitable soil and topographic conditions. These areas should provide sufficient space for ample off-\nstreet parking and well designed entrances and exits to avoid traffic congestion and safety hazards. Highway commercial\nareas are intended for commercial enterprises and services that require greater land area and lot dimensions than\nestablishments locating in the Central Business District. This district will be applied within the commercial areas as\ndesignated on the land use plan.\n(G) Industrial District (IND). The Industrial District is intended to provide sites for manufacturing and industrial uses,\nstorage and warehousing, wholesale trade, and other major employment centers. These locations should currently have\nboth public water and sewer services available or be expected to have these services in the future, and have suitable soil\nand topographic conditions to sustain the development. This district includes existing manufacturing areas, and sites suited\nfor future or further industrial development, and area designated on the land use plan as Industrial Centers. Only those\nmanufacturing uses will be allowed which have meet all local, state, and federal environmental standards, and do not involve\nobnoxious noise, vibrations, smoke, gas, fumes, odor, dust, fire hazards or other objectionable conditions which would be\ndetrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the community.\n(H) Public Service District (PS). The Public Service District is intended to be an area containing a concentration of public\nservice activities such as recreation areas, educational facilities, hospitals, emergency services and the like. This district\nis\nintended to preserve existing public service centers and will apply to those areas designated on the land use plan as Public\nService Centers.\n(I) Mixed-Use District (MU). The Mixed-Use District is established to provide opportunities for compatible and sustainable\nre-development where underutilized commercial properties already exist. The existing auto-oriented street, lot and building\ndesigns can create uncomfortable pedestrian environments; however, with careful site planning these areas will allow a\ngreater number of residents to walk or bike to businesses and services with an interconnected network of streets and\nsidewalks. Dominant uses in this district are residential, retail and office. The Mixed-Use District is expected to serve\nColumbus residents as well as persons who travel from the surrounding communities. The development pattern in this\ndistrict acknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access provided to ensure safety for the motoring public.\nDevelopment standards in the Mixed-Use District ensure the creation of a pleasant auto-oriented environment while enabling\na compatible transition to uses in adjacent districts. This District is available for rezoning only with the consent of the\nproperty owner(s).\n(J) Traditional Neighborhood Development District (TND). The Traditional Neighborhood Development District provides\nfor the development of new neighborhoods and the revitalization or extension of existing neighborhoods. These\nneighborhoods are structured upon a fine network of interconnecting pedestrian oriented streets and other public spaces.\nTraditional Neighborhood Developments (TND's) provide a mixture of housing types and prices, prominently sited civic or\ncommunity building(s), stores/offices/workplaces, and churches to provide a balanced mix of activities. A Traditional\nNeighborhood Development (TND) has a recognizable center and clearly defined edges; optimum size is a quarter mile from\ncenter to edge. A TND is urban in form, is typically an extension of the existing developed area of the Town, and has an\noverall residential density of up to 16 dwelling units per acre. TND districts should have a significant portion of land\ndedicated to open spaces. This District is available for rezoning only with the consent of the property owner(s).\n(Ord., Art.

In addition to\nthese uses, the ordinance allows some uses on a special basis subject to the issuance of a special use permit by the Zoning\nBoard of Adjustment. The reason for making the uses \"special\" is to ensure that they are compatible with surrounding\ndevelopment and in keeping with the purposes of the general zoning district in which they are located. Those uses, shown\nas \"special\" in the permitted use table in \u00a7 154.065, shall be subject to the requirements and review process in this section.\n(B) Approval process. The hearing for a special use permit shall be processed and considered in a quasi-judicial manner\nby the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The Board may, in its review, suggest reasonable conditions for the location, nature and\nextent of the proposed use and its relationship to surrounding properties, parking areas, driveways, pedestrian and vehicular\ncirculation systems, and screening and landscaping, and may address timing of development and any other appropriate\nconditions. Those conditions may include dedication of any rights-of-way or easements for streets, water, sewer or other\npublic utilities necessary to serve the proposed development. An application shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator and\nshall be accompanied by a site specific plan meeting the requirements as set forth in \u00a7 154.081(B) above. Additional\ninformation may be required by the Zoning Board of Adjustment in order to evaluate the impact of the proposed\ndevelopment. The Board may waive a particular requirement if, in its opinion, the inclusion is not essential to a proper\ndecision on the application.\n(C) Conditions, evidence and findings of fact\n(1) In approving an application for a special use permit, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may attach fair and reasonable\nconditions to the approval. The petitioner will have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any additional\nrequirements prior to approval or denial by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.\n(2) The Board shall issue a special use permit if it has evaluated an application and determined that the proposed use\nsatisfies the following standards:\n(a) The use requested is among those listed as an eligible special use in the district in which the subject property is\nlocated;\n(b) The special use will not materially endanger the public health or safety if located where proposed and developed\naccording to the plan as proposed;\n(c) The special use meets all required conditions and specifications;\n(d) The special use will not substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property, or that the use is a public\nnecessity; and\n(e) The location and character of the special use if developed according to the plan as proposed will be in harmony\nwith the area in which it is to be located and in general conformity with the plan of development of the town.\n(D) Decisions and judicial review. The provisions of 154.046(E)(1) Voting, (2) Quasi-judicial decisions, (4) Public record\nof decisions, and (5) Judicial review, shall apply to the Zoning Board of Adjustment's consideration of special use permits.\n(E) Effect of approval and expiration of approval\n(1) Any special use permit shall be perpetually binding upon the property included in the permit unless subsequently\nchanged or amended by the Zoning Board of Adjustment, as provided for in division (F) below.

Before issuing a special use permit, the Board of Adjustment\nshall find that all standards for specific uses listed in these sections as well as all standards and requirements listed in \u00a7\n154.082 above have been met.\n(A) Planned unit development.\n(1) Purpose. The purpose of this division (A) is to encourage and provide for flexibility and innovation in the design and\nlocation of structures and land development, to provide for mixtures of housing types and land use, to provide for the most\nefficient use of land resources, and to provide and opportunity to develop land areas in a manner different from the standard\narrangement of one principal building on one lot. Residential densities are calculated on a project basis, thus allowing the\nclustering of buildings in order to create useful open spaces and preserve natural site features. It is further intended that a\nplanned unit development will be in harmony with the character of the district in which it is located.\n(2) Planned unit development defined. In this chapter a planned unit development means a group residential\ndevelopment or a group commercial development where more than one principal building or use is proposed to be\nconstructed on a single tract; or any building with a gross floor area of 10,000 square feet or more; or a residential complex\nof five or more units with more than one principal building, shall be deemed a planned unit development (PUD). Residential\nunits within a planned unit development may include single-family detached or attached units, townhouse developments,\ngarden apartments, patio homes, condominiums and other type residential units excluding mobile homes and mobile home\nparks.\n(3) Land development standards. The following land development standards shall apply for all planned unit\ndevelopments. There shall be two types of PUD, a residential PUD and a commercial PUD. These planned unit\ndevelopments may be located only in certain specified districts as special uses, subject to a finding by the Board of\nAdjustment that the following conditions be met:\n(a) Ownership control. The land in a planned unit development shall be under single ownership or management by\nthe applicant before final approval and/or construction, or proper assurances (legal title or execution of a binding sales\nagreement) shall be provided that the development can be successfully completed by the applicant.\n", "page_number": 27, "page_range": [27, 28, 29], "highlight": ["of any non-residential use by the lesser of 10% or 10,000 square feet; and\n(c) Will not decrease the <em>off</em>-<em>street</em>", "(G) <em>Re</em>-application following denial.\n(1) If a request for conditional use permit is denied by the Town", "by right in each general zoning\ndistrict subject to the use meeting certain area, height, yard and <em>off</em>-<em>street</em>", "<em>parking</em> <em>and</em> <em>loading</em> <em>requirements</em>.", "of any non-residential use by the lesser of 10% or 10,000 square feet; and\n(c) Will not decrease the <em>off</em>-<em>street</em>"], "score": 8.281607, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Residential Estate\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RE\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RE\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RE\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking space for each\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 28\n(2) Minor changes may be made with the approval of the Zoning Administrator on a one-time basis only.

X, \u00a7 1002, passed - -; Am. Ord. passed 4-17-2014)\n\u00a7 154.083 SPECIAL USE STANDARDS.\nThe following standards are applied to specific special uses. Before issuing a special use permit, the Board of Adjustment\nshall find that all standards for specific uses listed in these sections as well as all standards and requirements listed in \u00a7\n154.082 above have been met.\n(A) Planned unit development.\n(1) Purpose. The purpose of this division (A) is to encourage and provide for flexibility and innovation in the design and\nlocation of structures and land development, to provide for mixtures of housing types and land use, to provide for the most\nefficient use of land resources, and to provide and opportunity to develop land areas in a manner different from the standard\narrangement of one principal building on one lot. Residential densities are calculated on a project basis, thus allowing the\nclustering of buildings in order to create useful open spaces and preserve natural site features. It is further intended that a\nplanned unit development will be in harmony with the character of the district in which it is located.\n(2) Planned unit development defined. In this chapter a planned unit development means a group residential\ndevelopment or a group commercial development where more than one principal building or use is proposed to be\nconstructed on a single tract; or any building with a gross floor area of 10,000 square feet or more; or a residential complex\nof five or more units with more than one principal building, shall be deemed a planned unit development (PUD). Residential\nunits within a planned unit development may include single-family detached or attached units, townhouse developments,\ngarden apartments, patio homes, condominiums and other type residential units excluding mobile homes and mobile home\nparks.\n(3) Land development standards. The following land development standards shall apply for all planned unit\ndevelopments. There shall be two types of PUD, a residential PUD and a commercial PUD. These planned unit\ndevelopments may be located only in certain specified districts as special uses, subject to a finding by the Board of\nAdjustment that the following conditions be met:\n(a) Ownership control. The land in a planned unit development shall be under single ownership or management by\nthe applicant before final approval and/or construction, or proper assurances (legal title or execution of a binding sales\nagreement) shall be provided that the development can be successfully completed by the applicant.\n\nNEW PAGE 30\n(b) Land uses permitted and location of PUDs. Those land uses normally permitted in the district within which a PUD\nis located shall be permitted in the PUD, including multi-family residential units in residential planned unit developments, and\na variety of commercial uses in commercial planned unit developments. Residential PUDs shall be permitted in the central\nbusiness district and the highway business district; and commercial PUDs shall be permitted in the central business district\nand highway business district. All PUDs must be compatible with and not violate the intent of the zoning district.\n(c) Density requirements. There are no density requirements for non-residential uses as long as the proposed project\ndoes not violate the intent of the district in which it is located. The proposed residential density of a residentially planned unit\ndevelopment (dwelling units per acre as shown in \u00a7\u00a7 154.066 through 154.068 above) shall conform to that permitted in the\ndistrict in which the development is located. If the planned unit development lies in more than one district, the number of\nallowable dwelling units must be separately calculated for each portion of the planned unit development that is in a separate\ndistrict, and must then be combined to determine the number of dwelling units allowable in the entire planned unit\ndevelopment.\n(d) Frontage requirements. Planned unit developments shall have access to a highway or road suitable for the scale\nand density of development being proposed.\n(e) Minimum requirements.\n1. The normal minimum lot size, setbacks and frontage requirements are hereby waived for the planned unit\ndevelopment, provided that the spirit and intent of this section are complied with in the total development plan, as\ndetermined by the Board of Adjustment. The Board of Adjustment shall exercise ultimate discretion as to whether the total\ndevelopment plan does comply with the spirit and intent of this section.\n2. No building or structure shall exceed the height limitations of the district in which it is located.\n3. The minimum distance between buildings shall be 20 feet or as otherwise specified by the Board of Adjustment\nto ensure adequate air, light, privacy and space for emergency vehicles.\n(f) Privacy. Each development shall provide reasonable visual and acoustical privacy for all dwelling units. Fences,\ninsulation, walks, barriers and landscaping shall be used, as appropriate, for the protection and aesthetic enhancement of\nproperty and the privacy of its occupants, screening of objectionable views or uses, and reduction of noise. Multi-level\nbuildings shall be located within a planned unit development in such a way as to dissipate any adverse impact on adjoining\nlow-rise buildings and shall not invade the privacy of the occupants of the low-rise buildings.\n(g) Perimeter requirements.\n1. Structures located on the perimeter of the development must be setback from property lines and right-of-way of\nabutting streets in accordance with the provisions of the zoning ordinance controlling the district within which the property is\nsituated; and\n2. Structures other than single-family detached units, located on the perimeter of the development may require\nscreening in a manner, which is approved by the Board of Adjustment.\n(h) Plans and accompanying documentation. Plans and accompanying documentation to ensure that the water and\nsewer systems proposed for the planned unit development have been approved by the appropriate local and state agencies\nand submitted as part of the application.\n(i) Preliminary plans. Preliminary plans shall include parking provisions for all proposed uses within the planned unit\ndevelopments in accordance with \u00a7 154.106 below.\n(j) Pedestrian and bicycle path circulation system. Any pedestrian and bicycle path circulation system and its related\nwalkways shall be designed to minimize conflicts between vehicle and pedestrian traffic.\n(k) Layout of parking areas and the like Layout of parking areas, service areas, entrances, exits, yards, courts and\nlandscaping, and control of signs, lighting, noise and other potentially adverse influences shall be such as to protect the\ncharacter of the district and desirable character in any adjoining district.\n(I)\nConveyance and maintenance. Conveyance and maintenance of open space, recreational areas and communally\nowned facilities shall be in accordance with the Unit Ownership Act (G.S. Chapter 47A) and/or any other appropriate\nmechanisms acceptable to the Board of Adjustment.\n(B) Mobile home parks.\n(1) Purpose. The purpose of this division (B) is to eliminate and prevent health and safety hazards and to promote the\neconomical and orderly development and utilization of land by providing for the planning and operation of mobile home\nparks, and by providing for the standards and regulations necessary to accomplish these purposes.\n(2) Definitions.\n(a) Mobile home. A portable manufactured housing unit designated for transportation on its own chassis and\nplacement on a temporary or semi permanent foundation having a measurement of over 32 feet in length and over eight feet\nin width. As used in this subchapter, MOBILE also means a double-wide home which is two or more portable manufacturing\nhousing units designed for transportation on their own chassis, which connect on site for placement on a temporary or semi\npermanent foundation, having a measurement of over 32 feet in length and over eight feet in width.\n", "page_number": 28, "page_range": [28, 29, 30], "highlight": ["(G) <em>Re</em>-application following denial.\n(1) If a request for conditional use permit is denied by the Town", "by right in each general zoning\ndistrict subject to the use meeting certain area, height, yard and <em>off</em>-<em>street</em>", "<em>parking</em> <em>and</em> <em>loading</em> <em>requirements</em>.", "of any non-residential use by the lesser of 10% or 10,000 square feet; and\n(c) Will not decrease the <em>off</em>-<em>street</em>", "<em>parking</em> ratio or reduce the yards provided at the periphery of the site by greater\nthan five feet.\n("], "score": 8.064758, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Residential Estate\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RE\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RE\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RE\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking space for each\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 26\n(Ord., Art.
