Beaufort\nSECTION 12\nHome Occupations\nA) Intent and Purpose.\nThe Town of Beaufort recognizes the desire and/or need for some citizens to use their\nresidence for limited nonresidential activities. However, the Town believes the need to\nprotect the integrity of residential areas is of paramount concern. A \"home occupation\"\nzoning provision, therefore, should protect residential areas from adverse impacts resulting\nfrom activities associated with home occupations. It is important to allow but to also to\nregulate some nonresidential activities in the Town's residential districts. In essence, a \"home\noccupation\" is a limited commercial-type activity in a residential area to an extent no\nneighbors or passersby will be aware, by outward appearance, of the activity. In practice, a\n\"home occupation\" gives the resident the legal right to use ones' residence for limited\nbusiness activities but not to the extent significant pedestrian and vehicular traffic is\ngenerated.\nB) Performance Criteria.\nA home occupation shall meet the following minimum conditions:\n1) The activity shall not be inconsistent with the use of the premises as dwelling.\n2) Only residents of the dwelling unit shall work there.\n3) There shall be no exterior evidence of the conduct of a home occupation, except as\nspecified in subsection C of this section. Thus, there may be no display of products visible\nin any manner from the outside of the home.\n4) A home occupation shall be conducted in an enclosed area of a primary or accessory\nstructure. It shall not occupy over twenty-five percent (25%) of the combined floor space\nof the primary and accessory structures. No portion of a home occupation shall be\nconducted outside the primary residence or accessory structure.\n5) Electrical or mechanical equipment which creates electromagnetic interference or causes\nfluctuations in line voltage outside the dwelling unit or creates noise not normally\nassociated with residential uses shall be prohibited.\n6) On-site sale of goods or services not produced on the premises shall be prohibited.\n7)\nA home occupation shall not create a significant increase, as determined by the zoning\nadministrator, in vehicular or pedestrian traffic to the residence.\n8)\nA home occupation shall not require additional off-street parking spaces for clients or\ncustomers of the home occupation.\n9) No home occupation shall result in garbage disposal exceeding standard residential use.\n10) No equipment or process shall be used in a home occupation which creates noise,\nvibration, glare, fumes, or odor detectable to the normal senses off the property.\nC) Permitted Signs.\nMore information on signs can be found in section 16 of this Ordinance. An indirectly lighted\nname plate or professional sign not over one square foot (1 ft2 in area and attached flat against\nthe building shall be permitted in connection with an incidental home occupation.\nD) Inspections.\nAn inspector shall have the right at any time, upon reasonable request and with the consent\nof the property owner, to enter and inspect the premises for safety and compliance purposes.\n135\n\nNEW PAGE 160\nLand Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\nSECTION 13\nParking Requirements\nA) Intent.\nThese regulations are intended to provide off-street parking, stacking, and loading facilities\nin proportion to the need created by each use. These regulations are intended to provide for\naccommodation vehicles in a functionally and aesthetically satisfactory manner and to\nminimize external effects on adjacent land uses.\nB) Number of Parking Spaces Required.\n1) Limitations.\nAll developments in all zoning districts other than the Historic Business District and the\nHistoric Waterfront Business District (H-BD & H-WBD) shall provide a sufficient\nnumber of parking spaces to accommodate the number of vehicles which ordinarily are\nlikely to be attracted to the development in question. For any mixed-use development\ncreated after the adoption of this Ordinance who cannot meet the residential off-street\nparking requirement for their proposed development, the owner/developer shall be\nrequired to contribute $10,000 per parking space needed into a parking fund which will\nbe used by the Town to acquire property as it becomes available for off-street parking for\nthese residential purposes.\n2) Presumptions.\nThe presumptions established by this section are established in all other zoning districts:\na) A development must comply with the parking standards set forth in subsection B-4\nof this section to satisfy the requirement stated in subsection B-1 lof this section; and,\nb) Any development which meets these standards is in compliance. However, Table 13-\n1 of this section is only intended to establish a presumption of parking demand and\nshould be flexibly administered, as provided in subsection C of this section.\n3) Standards.\nStandards set forth in Table 13-1 of this section are indicated by the respective land uses\nassociated within the development. When a determination of the number of parking\nspaces required by this table results in a fractional parking space, any fraction of one-half\nor less may be disregarded, while a fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one\nadditional parking space.\n4) Table of Parking Requirements.\nTable 13-1 of this section shall prescribe the number of parking spaces required for the\nrespective uses when the existing or proposed development is less than twenty-five\nthousand square feet (25,000 ft2). For all existing, proposed, or combination thereof\nof\ndevelopment which is twenty-five thousand square feet (25,000 ft2) or more, there shall\nbe a corresponding twenty percent (20%) decrease in the number of parking spaces\nrequired for this actual use.
