CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION\nA. PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe purpose and intent of this section is to provide landowners in the rural and suburban portions of the\nCity a development option that provides additional development flexibility to build on smaller lots when\nadditional open space set-asides are provided, and the development is designed and located in a way that\nprotects rural character, agricultural activities, or natural and historic features on the site. This is done in\norder to:\n1.\nConserve open land, including those areas containing productive agricultural soils, unique and sensitive\nnatural features such as floodplains, wetlands, river and stream corridors, areas with mature deciduous\ntrees, and watersheds;\n2. Promote existing rural character particularly in areas visible from major roadways in the City;\n3. Retain and protect existing environmental, natural, and cultural resources;\n4. Create a linked network of open lands; and\n5. Provide reasonable economic use of the land.\nB. APPLICABILITY\n1. Type of Development\nThis conservation subdivision option shall be limited to development of single-family detached\nresidential dwellings on individual lots in subdivisions of more than five lots. The conservation\nsubdivision option shall not be available for any other form of development or use type.\n2. Where Allowed\nSingle-family detached residential subdivisions of more than five lots in the LDR, MDR, and PD districts\nmay be developed as a conservation subdivision, in accordance with the standards in this section.\n3. Where Prohibited\nThe conservation subdivision option is not available for use in the HDR, RMH, PDD or business, special,\nor other conditional districts.\nC. PROCEDURE\nDevelopment utilizing the conservation subdivision option shall be approved as a preliminary plat in\naccordance with the procedures and standards in Section 2.4.N, Preliminary Plat, after approval of a\nconservation and development plan in accordance with this section.\n1.

Minimum Project Size\nConservation subdivisions shall be at least 10 acres in area.\n3. Required Conservation Area\na. The required conservation area shall occupy at least 40 percent of the total acreage of the\nconservation subdivision site, but nothing shall limit it from occupying more than 40 percent of a\nconservation subdivision site.\nb. The conservation area shall be considered open space set-aside subject to the applicable standards\nin Section 7.1, Open Space Set-Aside.\n4. Maximum Residential Density\nA conservation subdivision shall be limited to the maximum density for a conservation subdivision in\nthe zoning district in which it is located. Nothing shall prevent a conservation subdivision from\nincreasing the maximum allowable residential density in accordance with Section 7.6, Sustainability\nIncentives.\n5. Dimensional Requirements\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\na. Conservation subdivision lots in the LDR and MDR districts shall comply with the dimensional\nstandards for a conservation subdivision in the zoning district where located.\nb.
