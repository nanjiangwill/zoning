LIMITED USE ZONING DISTRICTS\n(AMENDED 1.4.22 UDOTA-1-22)\nA. PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe purpose of limited use zoning districts is to allow an applicant to request a zoning district that is similar\nto a corresponding conventional zoning district but that has a reduced range of allowable principal and\naccessory use types. More specifically, these standards are intended to:\n1. Provide an alternative to conventional zoning districts when a conventional zoning district may allow\na wider range of use types than that desired by the applicant; and\n2. Allow a landowner to propose, and the City Council to consider, a reduction in the range of allowable\nuses permitted in a particular zoning district.\nB. CLASSIFICATION\nLands shall be classified into one of the limited use zoning districts identified in this section only in\naccordance with the standards in Section 2.4.P, Rezoning.\nC. APPLICATION\n(AMENDED 12.6.22 UDOTA-05-22)\n1. Applicants for the establishment of a limited use zoning district shall file a rezoning application that is\nconsistent with Section 2.4.P.5.c, Additional Requirements for Limited Use Rezoning Applications.\n2. Applications for a limited use zoning district shall not include a conceptual plan or site plan depicting\nproposed development.\nD. DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED\nThe limited use zoning districts are established in accordance with Table 3.1.C, Zoning Districts\nEstablished.\nE. CONDITIONS\n(AMENDED 12.6.22 UDOTA-05-22)\n1. The list of the use types the applicant wishes to be permitted in the limited use zoning district shall\namount to a condition placed upon the land as part of the approval of the rezoning application.\n2. Applicants are strongly encouraged to keep the list of permitted use types as short as possible. The\nPlanning and Zoning Commission or City Council may suggest conditions that further reduce the range\nof proposed permitted use types during consideration of the application.\n3. No conditions, other than the list of proposed permitted uses, may be included with an application for\na limited use zoning district.\n4. The list of permitted uses shall be agreed to by both the applicant and the City Council.\n5.

Reducing or diminishing the inflexibility or uniform design that sometimes results from strict application\nof zoning and development standards designed primarily for individual lots;\n2.\nAllowing greater freedom in selecting the means of providing access, open space, and design\namenities;\n3. Allowing greater freedom in providing a well-integrated mix of residential and non-residential land\nuses in the same development, including a mix of housing types, lot sizes, and densities;\n4. Creating a system of incentives for redevelopment and infill in order to revitalize the downtown area;\n5. Promoting a vibrant public realm in the lands around downtown by placing increased emphasis on\nactive ground floor uses, pedestrian-oriented building fa\u00e7ade design, intensive use of sidewalks, and\nestablishment of public gathering areas;\n6.\nProviding for efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets and thereby\nlowering development and housing costs; and\n7.\nPromoting quality design and environmentally sensitive development that respects surrounding\nestablished land use character and respects and takes advantage of a site's natural and man-made\nfeatures, such as trees, estuaries, shorelines, special flood hazard area, and historic features.\nB.

Determination of complementary character shall be based\non densities/intensities, lot size and dimensions, building height, building mass and scale, hours\nof operation, exterior lighting, siting of service areas, or other aspects identified by the City\nCouncil.\nb. The standards in this subsection shall only apply to lands along the edge of the PDD Eligibility\nBoundary when applied to development in the PDD district.\n9. Development Phasing Plan\nIf development in the PD or PDD district is proposed to be phased, the master plan shall include a\ndevelopment phasing plan that identifies the general sequence or phases in which the district is\nproposed to be developed, including how residential and non-residential development will be timed,\nhow infrastructure (public and private) and open space will be provided and timed, and how\ndevelopment will be coordinated with the City's capital improvements program.\n10. Conversion Schedule\na. The planned development application may include a conversion schedule that identifies the extent\nto which one type of residential use may be converted to another type of residential use or one\ntype of non-residential use may be converted to another type of non-residential use (i.e.,\nresidential to residential, or non-residential to non-residential). These conversions may occur\nwithin development areas and between development areas, as long as they occur within the same\ndevelopment phase, as identified by the approved development phasing plan, and are consistent\nwith established extents of conversion set down in the conversion schedule.\nb.\nIn the event an applicant seeks to revise the development in accordance with an approved\nconversion schedule, the applicant shall provide a revised site plan depicting the proposed\nconversions to the Technical Review Committee for review and approval prior to commencing any\nconversions.\nCELL (1, 1): \ni.
