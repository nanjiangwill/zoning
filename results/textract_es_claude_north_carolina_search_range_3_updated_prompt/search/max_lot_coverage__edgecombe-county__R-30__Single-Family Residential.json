Buildings\nhave a wide range of sizes and heights, based on their function. The district also accommodates the\nancillary service uses necessary to support the predominant office and institutional development but is\nnot intended as a retail district. Retail, personal service, and other commercial uses permitted as\naccessory to an office or institutional use should not occupy more than ten percent of the floor area\nand should be configured to minimize visibility from off-site areas. The OI district also serves as a\ntransition area between higher intensity commercial uses and nearby lower density single-family\nresidential neighborhoods. In order to maintain compatibility with surrounding uses and ensure a high\nquality of development, all activities shall comply with the standards in Article 6.

An application for the establishment of a solar energy conversion use shall include a map\nshowing a radius of five nautical miles from the center of the use with any airport\noperations highlighted.\n2. Written notification of the intention to request a solar energy conversion use permit shall\nbe provided by the applicant to North Carolina Commanders Council for consideration of\npotential impacts to low altitude military flight paths. Notice shall be provided at 30 days\nprior to the hearing for a special use permit or 45 days prior to construction in cases where\na special use permit is not required. Notification shall include the location of the use (i.e., a\nmap, coordinates, address, or parcel ID), the proposed technology (i.e., roof-mounted PV,\nground-mounted fixed PV, tracked PV, solar thermal, etc.), and the size of the use in acres.\nProof of delivery of notification and date of delivery shall be submitted with permit\napplication.\nG.\nSOLAR GLARE HAZARD TO AVIATION ANALYSIS\n1. The applicant shall prepare an analysis of the glare hazard from the solar energy conversion\nuse in accordance with the latest version of the Solar Glare Hazard Analysis Tool (SGHAT).\n2.\nThe full report for each flight path and observation point, as well as the contact information\nfor the Zoning Administrator, shall be sent to the following authorities by the applicant at\nleast 30 days prior to the hearing for a special use permit or 45 days prior to construction in\ncases where a special use permit is not required:\ni. The appropriate airport operations official at the airport in the National Plan of\nIntegrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) within five nautical miles of the proposed solar\nenergy conversion use;\nii. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Airport District Office (ADO) with oversight\nof North Carolina; and\niii. The appropriate airport operations official at any airport not in the NPIAS, including\nmilitary airports, within five nautical miles within five nautical miles of the proposed\nsolar energy conversion use.\n3. Proof of delivery of notification and date of delivery shall be submitted with permit\napplication.\n4. Any applicable design changes (e.g., module tilt, module reflectivity, etc.) after initial\nsubmittal shall be rerun in the SGHAT tool and a new report shall be sent without undue\ndelay to the parties identified above for accurate records of the as-built system.\nH.\nSOLAR ENERGY CONVERSION USE REQUIREMENTS\nThese requirements are in addition to height, setback, aviation notification and applicable\ndistrict standards.\n1. SITE PLAN\nA site plan shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator demonstrating compliance with:\ni. All applicable setback and height limitations;\nii. Applicable zoning district requirements such as lot coverage;\niii. Applicable solar requirements in these standards; and\niv. Notification of intent to relevant utility.\n2. VISIBILITY\ni. A solar energy conversion use shall be surrounded by a type C opaque buffer regardless\nof the district it is located in.\nii. Signage shall be limited solely to security and safety signage.\niii. Any exterior lighting shall be limited to security lighting and shall be motion sensor\ncontrolled.\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage\n273\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n", "page_number": 271, "page_range": [271, 272, 273], "highlight": ["Single-family detached development may comply with applicable design guidelines in Section\n6.2.3, <em>Single</em>-<em>Family</em>", "No more than 50 <em>percent</em> of the total site may be occupied by buildings.\nC.", "SETBACK\n(FEET)\nCELL (3, 1): \nAR-30\nCELL (3, 2): \n30\nCELL (3, 3): \n12\nCELL (3, 4): \n25\nCELL (4, 1): \n<em>R</em>-", "<em>30</em>\nCELL (4, 2): \n50\nCELL (4, 3): \n50\nCELL (4, 4): \n50\nCELL (5, 1): \nR-20\nCELL (5, 2): \nIn Accordance", "Applicable zoning district requirements such as <em>lot</em> <em>coverage</em>;\niii."], "score": 14.0414505, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Single-Family Residential\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R-30\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R30\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"R-30\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"building area as % of lot\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. lot coverage\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"pervious surface\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"percent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"%\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per cent\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ratio\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}], "entire_search_page_range": [160, 161, 162, 163, 245, 246, 247, 248, 271, 272, 273]}
