Height of freestanding signs shall be measured from the elevation of the ground at\nthe point of contact with the sign provided that the grade of the site is not artificially\naltered to increase the allowable height of the sign. For sloping sites, the applicable\npoint of contact shall be the point having the highest elevation.\n(D.) One sign per approved Home Occupation within the Single Family Residential\n(SFR), Residential Main Street Transition (RMST), Mixed Use (MU), and Main\nStreet (MS) districts, not to exceed four (4) square feet in area.\n(E.)
