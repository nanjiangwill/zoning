The district encourages a fine-grained\nMixed Use\nnetwork of streets and pedestrian ways that allow a wide freedom of\nmovement and choices in transportation mode. Uses are located in close\nproximity to one another and rely on design techniques to maintain\ncompatibility instead of large yards, deep setbacks, and suburban-style\nvegetative buffers.
