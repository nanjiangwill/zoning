On the following page is a chart showing the proposed\nconversions.\nThrough the conversion, existing zoning districts are being changed to the most closely\ncomparable zoning district (i.e., a district allowing similar uses, restrictions, densities, etc.) in the\nnew zoning ordinance. However, all existing conditional zoning districts (including those\ndistricts which previously were described variously as conditional district, conditional use\ndistrict, parallel conditional district, and parallel conditional use district) and special use permits\nwith approved site plans will continue to exist with their adopted site plans controlling\ndevelopment on those properties except that the streetscape requirements for a pedestrian overlay\ndistrict will be required. The one existing district, which is not convertible, is the R-1.0MF. The\nPlanning Department will initiate a rezoning to change properties in this district to a suitable\ndistrict under the new zoning ordinance.\n(Petition No. 2012-020, 05/14/2012)\nNewly created zoning districts, such as the NS and O-3, will not be applied as part of the\nconversion. These districts will be placed on the ground either through public initiated rezonings\nthrough the area planning process or private initiated rezoning petitions.\nA-1\n\nNEW PAGE 835\nZONING MAPS CONVERSION\nA-2\nCELL (1, 1): \nExisting Districts\nCELL (1, 2): \nNew Districts\nCELL (2, 1): \nRU\nCELL (2, 2): \nR-3\nCELL (3, 1): \nR-15\nCELL (3, 2): \nR-3\nCELL (4, 1): \nR-12\nCELL (4, 2): \nR-3\nCELL (5, 1): \nR-9\nCELL (5, 2): \nR-4\nCELL (6, 1): \n---\nR-6\nCELL (6, 2): \n---\nR-5\nCELL (7, 1): \n---\nCELL (7, 2): \nR-6\nCELL (8, 1): \n---\nCELL (8, 2): \nR-8\nCELL (9, 1): \nR-R\nCELL (9, 2): \nR-5\nCELL (10, 1): \nR-20MF wo/Site Plans\nCELL (10, 2): \nR-8MF\nCELL (11, 1): \nR-15MF\nCELL (11, 2): \nR-12MF\nCELL (12, 1): \nR-12MF\nCELL (12, 2): \nR-17MF\nCELL (13, 1): \nR-9MF\nCELL (13, 2): \nR-17MF\nCELL (14, 1): \nR-6MF\nCELL (14, 2): \nR-22MF\nCELL (15, 1): \nR-6MFH\nCELL (15, 2): \nR-43MF\nCELL (16, 1): \nRE-1\nCELL (16, 2): \nRE-1\nCELL (17, 1): \nRE-2\nCELL (17, 2): \nRE-2\nCELL (18, 1): \nInst\nCELL (18, 2): \nInst\nCELL (19, 1): \nO-15\nCELL (19, 2): \nO-1\nCELL (20, 1): \nO-9\nCELL (20, 2): \nO-2\nCELL (21, 1): \nO-6\nCELL (21, 2): \nO-2\nCELL (22, 1): \n---\nCELL (22, 2): \nO-3\nCELL (23, 1): \nB-1\nCELL (23, 2): \nB-1\nCELL (24, 1): \nB-2\nCELL (24, 2): \nB-2\nCELL (25, 1): \nB-D\nCELL (25, 2): \nB-D\nCELL (26, 1): \nUI\nCELL (26, 2): \nUI\nCELL (27, 1): \nI-1\nCELL (27, 2): \nI-1\nCELL (28, 1): \nI-2\nCELL (28, 2): \nI-2\nCELL (29, 1): \nI-3\nCELL (29, 2): \nI-2\nCELL (30, 1): \nHD\nCELL (30, 2): \nHD-O (Historic District)\nCELL (31, 1): \n---\nCELL (31, 2): \nA-O (Airport)\nCELL (32, 1): \n---\nCELL (32, 2): \nC-O (Corridor)\nCELL (33, 1): \n---\nCELL (33, 2): \nMH-O (Manufactured Home)\nCELL (34, 1): \n---\nCELL (34, 2): \nMX-1\nCELL (35, 1): \n---\nCELL (35, 2): \nMX-2\nCELL (36, 1): \n---\nCELL (36, 2): \nMX-3\nCELL (37, 1): \n---\nCELL (37, 2): \nR-MH\nCELL (38, 1): \n---\nCELL (38, 2): \nCC\nCELL (39, 1): \nBP\nCELL (39, 2): \nBP\nCELL (40, 1): \n---\nCELL (40, 2): \nNS\nCELL (41, 1): \n---\nCELL (41, 2): \nHW\nCELL (42, 1): \nUDC-V\nCELL (42, 2): \n---\nCELL (43, 1): \nR-MH\nCELL (43, 2): \nContinue * (Also, See Special Purpose Districts)\nCELL (44, 1): \nR-20MF Innovative\nCELL (44, 2): \nContinue *\nCELL (45, 1): \nR-20MF w/Site Plans\nCELL (45, 2): \nContinue *\nCELL (46, 1): \nR-I\nCELL (46, 2): \nContinue *\nCELL (47, 1): \nR-PUD\nCELL (47, 2): \nContinue *\n", "page_number": 833, "page_range": [833, 834, 835], "highlight": ["The area inside the building within four <em>feet</em> from\nZoning Administrator.", "Pedestrian eye level is measured as the area\nbetween four <em>feet</em> and eight <em>feet</em> in <em>height</em> above\nthe adjacent", "1): \nI-2\nCELL (28, 2): \nI-2\nCELL (29, 1): \nI-3\nCELL (29, 2): \nI-2\nCELL (30, 1): \nHD\nCELL (30, 2): \n<em>HD</em>-<em>O</em>", "(<em>Historic</em> District)\nCELL (31, 1): \n---\nCELL (31, 2): \nA-O (Airport)\nCELL (32, 1): \n---\nCELL (32, 2):"], "score": 18.405363, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Historic\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"HD-O\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"HDO\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"HD-O\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area and bulk requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"area requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"dimensional requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"lot and building requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. building height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Maximum height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Max. height\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"stories\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"story\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}, {\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"feet\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"ft.\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 447\nCHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 8: PEDESTRIAN OVERLAY DISTRICT\nThe following use, which is not permitted in the underlying district, shall be permitted:\n(1)\nResidential uses in an underlying industrial district, subject to the standards of this\noverlay district.\nSection 10.812.
