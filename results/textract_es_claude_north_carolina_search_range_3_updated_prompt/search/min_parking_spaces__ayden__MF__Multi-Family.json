If the appraisals differ by more than 15%, the value will be based on the\naverage of the two appraisals.\n3. Where a combination of land dedication and payments in lieu are approved, the\nsubdivider shall be given a credit equivalent to the appraised value per acre of land\ndedicated for recreation purposes. The credit amount shall be determined by\nmultiplying the number of acres to be dedicated by the appraised value per acre. If\nthe total payment in lieu as determined above is larger than the credit amount, the\nsubdivider shall pay the difference between the two amounts. If the credit amount\nis larger than the total payment in lieu as determined above, no additional payment\nin lieu is required. However, the subdivider may not transfer the excess credit from\none subdivision to another.\n4. Upon approval by the Board of Commissioners, payment in lieu of dedication shall\nbe made at the time of final subdivision plat approval. All monies received by the\nTown of Ayden pursuant to these requirements shall be used only for the acquisition\nand development of recreation, park, and open space sites to serve the residents of\nthe development and the residents of the immediate neighborhood within which the\ndevelopment is located. The Board of Commissioners shall also have the authority to\nsell land dedicated pursuant to these provisions with the proceeds of any such sale\nused solely for the acquisition of other recreation, park, or open space sites within the\nimmediate neighborhood within which the development is located.\nM. Ownership & Maintenance\nThe designated common open space and common facilities are outlined in Article 7 -\nSubdivisions and Infrastructure of this ordinance.\n510.080 Landscaping and Buffering\nA. Findings and Purpose\nThe standards established in this ordinance are intended to preserve, protect, restore and\nenhance the aesthetic appeal and scenic beauty of this town; provide adequate buffering\nbetween land uses; reduce noise and air pollution; reduce stormwater run-off; filter and reduce\nglare from artificial light sources; provide shaded areas along streets, sidewalks and in parking\nlots; provide a continuity of vegetation throughout the town; encourage the preservation of\nexisting trees and vegetation; safeguard and enhance property values; and protect the public\nhealth, safety and general welfare.\nB. Applicability\nThe landscaping and buffering standards of this section shall apply to the following:\n1. All new developments (except for infill single-family detached) shall be designed in\naccordance with the requirements of this Article.\n2. Pre-existing development\na. Non-conforming preexisting development is subject to these standards as follows:\n(1) A change in type of occupancy, as set forth in the North Carolina Building Code;\n(2) A change in land use which requires an increase in the number of off-street parking\nspaces or the provision of a buffer yard;\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-30\nADOPTION DATE: APRIL 12, 2021\n\nNEW PAGE 86\nARTICLE 5\n(3) Additions or expansions which singularly or collectively exceed 25% of the land area\nor gross building floor area existing at the effective date of this ordinance.\nb. The Town of Ayden recognizes that designing preexisting development to meet new\nregulations is more difficult and expensive than applying these standards to\nundeveloped properties. Therefore, greater flexibility will be afforded preexisting\ndevelopment in meeting the requirements of this section, in that:\n(1) A modification of up to 25% percent may be granted by the Administrator for planting\narea and dimension requirements where compliance presents hardships due to\nbuilding location, lot size, or vehicular area configuration;\n(2) A credit for reducing required off-street parking by 1 space shall be given for the\nconstruction of each landscape island.\nC. Street Trees\n1. Street trees are an essential part of the town streetscape. The Town seeks to maintain\nexisting trees where possible and to encourage the planting and continuance of the\nestablished street tree patterns.\n2. To accomplish this objective, the following shall apply:\na.\nAll subdivisions and developments subject to site plan approval shall provide street\ntrees along their frontage with adjacent public streets.\nb.\nStreet trees shall be selected from the list of large trees, or, where power lines are\nlocated, small trees included in Appendix A - Official Planting List.\nC. Planting strips shall be a minimum of six (6) feet wide.\nd. Planting location shall take into consideration planned roadway widening, public safety,\nstandard drainage requirements and maintenance of sight distances for traffic safety.\nStreet trees may be planted within the right-of-way, within planting strip abutting the\nright-of-way or other location approved by the Administrator.\n3. Street trees, unless subject to overhead power lines, shall be planted at the rate of one (1)\ntwo-inch caliper tree per thirty (30) feet of property line abutting a public street, excluding\ndriveways and traffic visibility zones. This rate may be varied based upon existing trees and\nthe crowns of planted trees.\n4. Trees used to meet buffer and vehicle use area requirements, may be used to meet the\nstreet requirements to the extent that the trees are located within twenty-five (25) feet of a\nstreet.\nD. Buffer Yard Requirements\nBuffers provide compatible transitions between differing land uses, reduce the visual impacts of\ndevelopment and retain existing plant materials.\n1. Buffers are required along the common property lines between developments in different\nzoning districts or between developments of different uses as established in this Section.\n2. Buffer requirements shall not apply when a public street or railroad right-of-way separates\napplicable zoning districts or uses accept where new lots created by a Major Subdivision\nPreliminary Plat abuts but has no access to Major or Minor Thoroughfare. When this\noccurs, a streetyard buffer meeting the Type A Buffer criteria standards shall be provided\nadjacent to the thoroughfare right-of-way. The preservation of existing healthy vegetation\nin the streetyard buffer is strongly encouraged.\n3.
