Any such\nnonconforming lot may be used for any of the uses permitted in the district in which it is located provided that:\na. Where the lot area is not more than twenty (20) percent below the minimum specified in this ordinance,\nand other dimensional requirements are otherwise complied with, the Zoning Administrator is\nauthorized to issue a zoning compliance permit.\nb. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever two (2) or more adjoining vacant lots of record are in single\nownership at any time after the adoption of this ordinance and such lots individually have less area or\nwidth than the minimum requirements of the district in which such lots are located, such lots shall be\nconsidered as a single lot or several lots which meet the minimum requirements of this ordinance for\nthe district in which such lots are located.\n2.

When a nonconforming open use of land has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter\nrevert to any nonconforming use.\nb.\nNonconforming open uses of land shall be changed only to conforming uses.\n63\n\nNEW PAGE 64\nC.\nA nonconforming open use of land shall not be enlarged to cover more land than was occupied by that\nuse when it became nonconforming.\nd. When any nonconforming open use of land is discontinued for a period in excess of one hundred eighty\n(180) days, any future use of the land shall be limited to those uses permitted in the district in which the\nland is located. Vacancy and/or non-use of the land, regardless of the intent of the owner or tenant,\nshall constitute discontinuance under this provision.\n4. Nonconforming Uses of Structures\nThis category of nonconformance consists of buildings or structures used at the time of enactment of this\nordinance for purposes of use not permitted in the district in which they are located. Such uses may be\ncontinued as follows:\na. An existing nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or higher\nclassification, provided that the other conditions in this section are complied with.

Structural alterations as required by law or ordinance to secure the safety of the structure are\npermissible.\nii. Maintenance and repair necessary to keep a structure containing a nonconforming use in sound\ncondition are permissible.\niii. Expansion of a nonconforming use of a building or structure into portions of the structure\nwhich, at the use became nonconforming, where already erected and arranged or designed for\nsuch nonconforming use is permissible.\nd. When any nonconforming use of a building or structure is discontinued for a period in excess of one\nhundred eighty (180) days, the building or structure shall not thereafter be used except in conformance\nwith the regulations of the district in which it is located.\n5. Reconstruction of Damaged Buildings or Structures\nAny nonconforming use, which has been damaged by fire, wind, flood or other causes, may be repaired and\nused as before provided:\na. Repairs are initiated within twelve (12) months and completed within two (2) years of such damage.\nb.
