The following special districts are defined below: mixed use\ndistricts, office/institutional-4 district, traditional neighborhood development district, and transit oriented development district.\n3.5.1 Mixed Use Districts.\nPurpose statement: The mixed use districts are intended to provide for the coordinated development of office, commercial, and residential uses and their necessary support functions in the vicinity of\nkey highway intersections and transit corridors in Chapel Hill. They are designed to facilitate stated public policies to encourage design which emphasizes lively, people oriented environments and\ncompatible, visually interesting development. This district provides areas where moderate scale mixed use centers can locate with an emphasis on development of a balance of residential, office and\ncommercial uses.\nIt is further intended that the mixed use districts shall encourage development within which mutually supporting residential, commercial and office uses are scaled, balanced and located to reduce\ngeneral traffic congestion by providing housing close to principal destinations, and convenient pedestrian and bicycle circulation systems and mass transit to further reduce the need for private\nautomobile usage. Mixed use districts are intended to encourage development that allows multiple destinations to be achieved with a single trip. These standards encourage a design such that uses\nwithin a mixed use district are arranged in a manner that encourages internal vehicular trip capture and the development patterns that encourage walking, transit and bicycling as alternatives to\nautomotive travel.\nWhen such districts adjoin residential development or residential zoning districts, it is intended that arrangement of buildings, uses, open space, and vehicular or pedestrian and bicycle access shall be\nsuch as to provide appropriate transition and reduce potentially adverse effects.\n(a) Establishment and intent of mixed use districts.\nThree mixed use (MU) districts are hereby established. The boundaries of the mixed use districts are as shown on the official zoning atlas. The districts are identified as Mixed Use-OI-1 (MU-OI-1),\nMixed Use-R-1 (MU-R-1), and Mixed Use-Village (MU-V).\nIt is the intent of the Town of Chapel Hill to reserve the MU-OI-1 and MU-R-1 designations and regulations for areas already so zoned as of September 2002 and to reserve MU-V for areas already so\nzoned as of October 2020. The policy of the town is to grant no further rezonings to MU-OI-1, MU-R-1, or to MU-V and to reserve future mixed-use village zoning designations for MU-V-CZD.\n(b) Permitted uses and development intensities-Mixed Use-Village (MU-V).\n(1) The uses permitted in the MU-V districts include the following:\nA. Vertical mixed use buildings, or\nB. Uses listed in subsection (2), below, which are mixed horizontally. Uses are considered to be \"mixed horizontally' where:\n1. Such uses comprise not less than the minimum, and not more than the maximum, percentage of floor area prescribed in subsection (b)(2)A, below; and\n2. Uses within a land use category set forth below, are located not further than eight hundred (800) feet from the uses located within another land use category; and\n3. The uses within separate land use categories, as set forth below, are linked by a continuous system of sidewalks or trails. Sidewalks or trails shall be considered \"continuous\" if they are\ninterrupted only by street intersections, but shall not be considered \"continuous\" if interrupted by natural or man-made barriers to pedestrian and bicycle movement or by a street\nconsisting of more than two (2) lanes of traffic, unless a pedestrian and bicycle island is provided.\n(2) Land use categories.\nA. An MU-V shall include office, commercial, and residential uses as described below. The mix of floor area within a proposed development shall contain at least twenty-five (25) percent of\nthe floor area devoted to residential uses and at least twenty-five (25) percent of the floor area devoted to office/commercial uses.\nB. For purposes of this section:\n1. Uses within the \"Residential\" land use category include the following:\nDwelling units, single-family,\nDwelling units, two-family with accessory apartments,\nDwelling units, duplex,\nDwelling units, multifamily, three to seven dwelling units,\nDwelling units, multifamily, over seven dwelling units,\n2.

No. 2020-10-28/0-10, \u00a7 8)\n3.5.2 Office/Institutional-4\n(a) Purpose and intent.\nThe purpose and intent of the office/institutional-4 district (OI-4) is to establish procedural and substantive standards for the town council's review and approval of development on large tracts of land\nwhere the predominant use is to be college, university, hospital, clinics, public cultural facilities, and related functions.\nThe objective of this section and the OI-4 district is to allow for growth and development while protecting the larger community, nearby neighborhoods, and the environment from impacts accompanying\nmajor new development. A key feature of this district is the preparation of a development plan that would allow the property owner, immediate neighbors, and the larger community to understand\nspecifically what levels of development are being proposed, and what impacts would likely accompany the development, so that mitigation measures can be designed and implemented.\n(b) Overview of Development Review Procedures.\nProcedures in this zoning district are designed to facilitate:\nArticulation of development plans that involve multiple buildings in multiple locations over an extended time period on a given tract of land, as defined in a development plan;\nIdentification of total infrastructure needs for such proposed development as specified in a development plan and cumulative impacts resulting from full development as specified in a\n10 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n\nNEW PAGE 11\nChapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\ndevelopment plan; and\nProvision of measures to mitigate the negative impacts, including off-site construction of parking decks as described in subsection (d)(2), phased in a manner appropriate with the pace of\nconstruction.\nTo this end, owners of property zoned OI-4 are encouraged to prepare detailed development plans, as described below, for review and approval by the town council. For buildings that are included in an\napproved development plan, site development permits for individual buildings are to be issued by the town manager, following a determination by the town manager that such individual building plans are\ngenerally consistent with the town council-approved development plan.\nFor development proposed within an OI-4 zoning district that is not included in a town council-approved development plan, but is a minor modification according to the provisions of subsection (j) of this\nsection, the town manager may approve a change to the development plan and issue a site development permit. For development proposed within an OI-4 zoning district that is not included in a town\ncouncil-approved development plan and that cannot be considered a minor modification to the plan according to subsection (j) of this section, such development shall be considered to be a special use, and\nsubject to the special use permit procedural requirements of section 4.5 of this appendix. In the alternative, the applicant may apply to the town council for an amendment to the development plan.\nOnce a property is zoned office/institutional-4, all regulations, standards, and procedures prescribed for the previously-applicable zoning district shall apply until (1) a development plan is approved; or\n(2) six (6) months have elapsed, whichever comes first.\n(c) Concept plan review. Prior to submittal of a development plan or modification of development plan, a concept plan review shall be conducted by the Town Council. It is the intent of the\nconceptual development plan process to provide an opportunity for the Town Council, Town Manager and citizens to review and evaluate the impact of the proposed development on the\ncharacter of the area in which it is proposed to be located.\n(1) Submittal requirements. Applications for conceptual development plan review shall be filed with the Town Manager. The Town Manager shall prescribe the form(s) on which information shall\nbe submitted. Application submittal requirements shall include the following:\nA. Descriptions of proposed development with building locations, building sizes, parking arrangements, and description of building heights with consideration of impact on adjacent areas.\n(d) Development Plan.\nA development plan shall address issues such as general location and size of new facilities, parking, utilities, stormwater management, impervious surface, and access/circulation. A development plan\nshall identify the general location, size, and proposed uses of buildings. A development plan shall project anticipated impacts on streets, water and sewer facilities, stormwater runoff, air quality, noise, and\nlighting.\n(1) Submittal requirements. Application submittal requirements shall include the following:\nA. Specific descriptions of proposed development with building locations, building sizes, parking arrangements, and description of building heights with consideration of impact on adjacent\nareas.\nB. Analysis of impacts resulting from proposed development, along with options to mitigate impacts relating to:\nTransportation management (traffic, transit, parking, bikes, pedestrians, air quality);\nStormwater management analysis (quantity and quality); and\nNoise and lighting analysis.\nIndividual effects must be evaluated in the context of the whole development plan and not in isolation. Impacts shall be evaluated in accordance with guidelines endorsed for use by the town\ncouncil.\nC. Preliminary timetable and sequencing schedule for building construction and for related mitigation measures.\n(2) Off-site components. Mitigation measures involving construction of parking decks may need to be developed outside the boundaries of the development plan. Notwithstanding any other\nprovision of this Land Use Management Ordinance, a parking deck proposed to mitigate impacts of a development plan, and approved by the town council as part of a development plan, may\nbe located on a site not within the boundaries of an OI-4 zoning district. Any such facility shall be reviewed as a site development permit according to the provisions of subsection (i)(2) of this\nsection.\n(e) Permitted uses and development intensities.\nPermitted uses shall be identical with uses listed in the use matrix (section 3.7) as being permitted in OI-3, except that place of assembly shall be considered to be a permitted use and not a special use.\nThe maximum floor area allowed shall be as provided in a development plan that is approved by the town council. Special restrictions apply in perimeter transition areas (see subsection (g)).\nFor purposes of calculating compliance with a specified maximum floor area, the following land uses shall not be counted as floor area: new residential development (including Dwellings and residence\nhalls), and new public cultural facilities.\n(f) Standards.\nDevelopment in the OI-4 zoning district shall be designed in a manner that provides a mix of uses which are integrated, interrelated and linked by pedestrian ways, bikeways, and other transportation\nsystems. Development plans shall, as practical and consistent with applicable laws and regulations, include measures to encourage reduction of automobile use and promote alternative modes of\ntransportation; to mitigate adverse environmental impacts; to promote conservation of non-renewable energy resources; and to achieve visual continuity in the siting and scale of buildings. Specifically, a\ndevelopment plan shall address the following:\n(1) Noise: Noise levels from development proposed in the development plan shall not exceed those allowed by the Town of Chapel Hill Noise Ordinance.\n(2) Environment: Development proposed in the development plan shall minimize impacts on natural site features, and be accompanied by measures to mitigate those impacts.\n(3) Transportation: Development proposed in the development plan shall be accompanied by measures to mitigate transportation impacts that are caused by the development.\n(4) Stormwater management: Development proposed in the development plan shall be accompanied by measures to mitigate stormwater impacts (quantity and quality) that are caused by the\ndevelopment.\n(5) Public utilities: There shall be a general demonstration that water, sewer, and other needed utilities can be made available to accommodate development proposed in the development plan.\n(6) Historic districts: The provisions of section 3.6.2 of this appendix shall apply to any development proposed within one of Chapel Hill's Historic Districts.\n(g) Perimeter transition areas.\nA development plan shall designate a perimeter transition area establishing appropriate standards at borders of the development plan, necessary to minimize impacts of development proposed in\nthe development plan on adjacent property, to be approved by the town council as part of the development plan.

The following special districts are defined below: mixed use\ndistricts, office/institutional-4 district, traditional neighborhood development district, and transit oriented development district.\n3.5.1 Mixed Use Districts.\nPurpose statement: The mixed use districts are intended to provide for the coordinated development of office, commercial, and residential uses and their necessary support functions in the vicinity of\nkey highway intersections and transit corridors in Chapel Hill. They are designed to facilitate stated public policies to encourage design which emphasizes lively, people oriented environments and\ncompatible, visually interesting development. This district provides areas where moderate scale mixed use centers can locate with an emphasis on development of a balance of residential, office and\ncommercial uses.\nIt is further intended that the mixed use districts shall encourage development within which mutually supporting residential, commercial and office uses are scaled, balanced and located to reduce\ngeneral traffic congestion by providing housing close to principal destinations, and convenient pedestrian and bicycle circulation systems and mass transit to further reduce the need for private\nautomobile usage. Mixed use districts are intended to encourage development that allows multiple destinations to be achieved with a single trip. These standards encourage a design such that uses\nwithin a mixed use district are arranged in a manner that encourages internal vehicular trip capture and the development patterns that encourage walking, transit and bicycling as alternatives to\nautomotive travel.\nWhen such districts adjoin residential development or residential zoning districts, it is intended that arrangement of buildings, uses, open space, and vehicular or pedestrian and bicycle access shall be\nsuch as to provide appropriate transition and reduce potentially adverse effects.\n(a) Establishment and intent of mixed use districts.\nThree mixed use (MU) districts are hereby established. The boundaries of the mixed use districts are as shown on the official zoning atlas. The districts are identified as Mixed Use-OI-1 (MU-OI-1),\nMixed Use-R-1 (MU-R-1), and Mixed Use-Village (MU-V).\nIt is the intent of the Town of Chapel Hill to reserve the MU-OI-1 and MU-R-1 designations and regulations for areas already so zoned as of September 2002 and to reserve MU-V for areas already so\nzoned as of October 2020. The policy of the town is to grant no further rezonings to MU-OI-1, MU-R-1, or to MU-V and to reserve future mixed-use village zoning designations for MU-V-CZD.\n(b) Permitted uses and development intensities-Mixed Use-Village (MU-V).\n(1) The uses permitted in the MU-V districts include the following:\nA.

Uses within a land use category set forth below, are located not further than eight hundred (800) feet from the uses located within another land use category; and\n3. The uses within separate land use categories, as set forth below, are linked by a continuous system of sidewalks or trails. Sidewalks or trails shall be considered \"continuous\" if they are\ninterrupted only by street intersections, but shall not be considered \"continuous\" if interrupted by natural or man-made barriers to pedestrian and bicycle movement or by a street\nconsisting of more than two (2) lanes of traffic, unless a pedestrian and bicycle island is provided.\n(2) Land use categories.\nA. An MU-V shall include office, commercial, and residential uses as described below. The mix of floor area within a proposed development shall contain at least twenty-five (25) percent of\nthe floor area devoted to residential uses and at least twenty-five (25) percent of the floor area devoted to office/commercial uses.\nB.
