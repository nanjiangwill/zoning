An\naccessory structure is smaller in area, extent, or purpose than the principal use or\nprincipal structure. Accessory structures are permitted as established in the respective\nplanning areas in Section 2 provided they meet the specific standards set forth in this\nsection. Lots within the Rural Planning Area that are part of an approved master plan are\nsubject to all applicable ordinance requirements and are not eligible for the exceptions\ngranted to individually-developed lots located within the Rural Planning Area.\nFor the purposes of this ordinance, the establishment or construction of an accessory\nstructure on an existing lot shall be considered an expansion of an existing use and/or\nstructure and shall be subject to the approval procedures found in Section 14.\nA. Number of Accessory Structures\n1. In the Rural Reserve and Rural Planning Areas, on lots over two acres where the\nproposed accessory structure is located more than 150 feet from the right-of-way\nor is not otherwise visible from the right-of-way, accessory structures may include a\ndetached garage and two other accessory structures.\n2.\nIn all other situations, the number of accessory structures on a lot may include\na detached garage (if there is not an existing attached garage) and one other\naccessory structure.
