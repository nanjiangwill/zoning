When developing in the Village Infill Planning Area, in addition to\nthe standards below, see Section 2 for development in the Village Infill Overlay District.\nD. Street Frontage: Street trees should be preserved.\nE.\nRhythm of Development along the Street: Established building rhythms along\nstreet frontages should be continued. Larger buildings can be integrated into\nsmaller-scale neighbohrhoods by creating repetitive bays with facade articulation.\nF. Building Orientation: Main entrances, and other primary building fa\u00e7ade elements\nshould be oriented toward the street.

Unoccupied residential attics less than seven feet above the leaves.\nC.\nRaised basements less than four feet exposed at the lowest grade at the front\nfa\u00e7ade.\nd.
