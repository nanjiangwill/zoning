Allowed building/lot types are\nHighway Commercial, Urban Workplace, Shop-front, Detached House, Attached\nHouse, and Multi-family. Dominant uses in this district are residential, retail and\noffice. The Mixed-Use Districts are expected to serve Chadbourn residents as well\nas persons who travel from surrounding communities. The development pattern in\nthis district acknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access\nprovided to promote safety for the motoring public.

Intent. The Mixed-Use Districts (MU-1 and MU-2) are established to provide\nopportunities for both compatible and sustainable re-development where\nunderutilized commercial properties already exist as well as infill sites where site\nspecific land planning of new development creates opportunities for businesses\nand various housing designs sharing community amenities and enhancements.\nExisting auto-oriented street, lot, and building designs can create uncomfortable\npedestrian environments; however, with careful site planning these areas will allow\na greater number of residents to walk or bike to businesses and services with an\ninterconnected network of streets and sidewalks. Allowed building/lot types are\nHighway Commercial, Urban Workplace, Shop-front, Detached House, Attached\nHouse, and Multi-family. Dominant uses in this district are residential, retail and\noffice. The Mixed-Use Districts are expected to serve Chadbourn residents as well\nas persons who travel from surrounding communities. The development pattern in\nthis district acknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access\nprovided to promote safety for the motoring public. Development standards in the\nMixed-Use Districts promote the creation of a pleasant pedestrian-friendly auto-\noriented environment while enabling a compatible transition to uses in adjacent\ndistricts.\n(B.) A Development Agreement, established pursuant to Section 7.15 of this\nOrdinance, shall be required as part of all Mixed Use (MU-1 and MU-2) District\napplications and shall apply to all projects within the MU-1 and MU-2 Districts.\n(C.)
