The district has a one-acre minimum lot area\nrequirement, which is the basic threshold size for lots with on-\nsite wastewater systems. Use of the conservation subdivision\nSuburban\nconfiguration is optional for residential subdivisions. While the\ndistrict allows single-family detached homes, mobile homes on\nindividual lots are prohibited. Nonconforming mobile homes\nmay remain but may not be expanded or replaced with another\nmobile home. The district accommodates equestrian uses,\nResidential\nutilities, as well as various neighborhood-supporting\ninstitutional uses such as parks, schools, and public safety\nfacilities. District regulations discourage uses that interfere\nwith the development of residential neighborhoods or that are\ndetrimental to the suburban nature of the district.\nB.\nDimensional

The district is\nintended to accommodate single-family detached\nhomes in a neighborhood setting at moderate\ndensities. Mobile and manufactured homes on\nindividual lots, conservation subdivisions, and\nNeighborhood\nagricultural uses are limited in order to preserve the\ndistrict's neighborhood character. Manufactured\nhomes are not allowed on lots within 5,280 linear feet\nof a village center boundary. The district's 40,000-\nResidential\nsquare-foot minimum lot area may be reduced when\nlots are within one mile of a designated village center\nboundary and served by public sewer. District\nregulations discourage uses that interfere with the\ndevelopment of residential neighborhoods or that are\ndetrimental to the district's single-family detached\nneighborhood character.\nNOTES:\n[1] Maximum residential density may be increased to 1.45 units per acre on lots served by public sewer and within 5,280 linear feet of a\ndesignated village center.\nCamden
