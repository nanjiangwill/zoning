CP - Conservation and Protection\nA. Intent\nThe Conservation and Protection District (CP) is intended to be used for the permanent protection and preservation of environmentally sensitive\nlands, and historical, cultural, and archeological areas of Brunswick County. Generally, activities within a CP district are limited to very low\nintensity uses, agricultural and silvicultural activities, parks, open space and natural habitat preservation, and very limited residential uses.\nConstruction and land disturbing activities should be limited in nature and scope and should have a very low impact on the environment and the\nsurrounding setting. Public or community water or wastewater facilities are generally discouraged in order to deter development pressure.\nB. Permitted Uses\nOnly uses specifically listed in the use table in Section 5.2 as a permitted use (\"P\"), permitted subject to limited use standards (\"L\"), or permitted\nsubject to special use permit (\"SUP\") shall be allowed in a CP District.\nC. Standards\n1. Applicability\ni. The following standards shall apply to all development within a CP district with the exception of bona fide farms. However, bona fide\nfarms are encouraged to comply with these requirements to the extent possible to ensure that impacts on the land and the surrounding\nenvironment are minimal.\nii. In addition to the standards contained in this Section. All other provisions in this Ordinance and all other applicable laws shall apply,\nexcept those that are incompatible with the provisions contained herein.\n2. Dimensional Standards\nProjects shall meet the following standards.\nNotes:\n1\nAdditional Building Height above 40 feet up to a maximum height of 75 feet is allowed at the following rates:\nNon-Viewshed Protection Overlay areas at a rate of one additional foot of height for every one foot of additional yard depth (front, rear,\nand sides);\nViewshed Protection Overlay (see Section 4.12.6.) areas at a rate of one additional foot of height for every two feet of additional yard\ndepth (front, rear, and sides).\nNorth Carolina Building Codes apply.\n3. Development Standards\nIn order to reduce the impact of development on the existing natural environment, the following standards apply to all land disturbing\nactivities within a CP district:\ni. With the exception of a pedestrian trail or a fence, no land disturbing activities may occur within a required yard or within 100 feet of:\n(a) All lands located within a 100-year floodway;\n(b) All site area under the jurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) or the North Carolina Department of Natural\nResources, Division of Water Quality (DWQ);\n(c) All lands located within a CAMA shoreline buffer;\n55 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\nCELL (1, 1): \nMinimum Lot\nArea\nCELL (1, 2): \nMinimum Lot\nWidth\nCELL (1, 3): \nMinimum\nFront Yard\nCELL (1, 4): \nMinimum\nSide Yard\nCELL (1, 5): \nMinimum\nRear Yard\nCELL (1, 6): \nMaximum\nHeight\nCELL (2, 1): \n5 Acres\nCELL (2, 2): \n300 feet\nCELL (2, 3): \n50 feet\nCELL (2, 4): \n100 feet\nCELL (2, 5): \n50 feet\nCELL (2, 6): \n40\n", "page_number": 53, "page_range": [53, 54, 55], "highlight": ["In addition to the required <em>off</em>-<em>street</em> <em>parking</em> for the principal use, two <em>off</em>-<em>street</em> <em>parking</em> spaces shall", "<em>RU</em>-<em>I</em>: <em>Industrial</em>-<em>Rural</em>\n1.", "standards:\n53 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\nCELL (1, 1): \nIndustrial Districts\nCELL (1, 2): \nI-G\nCELL (1, 3): \n<em>RU</em>-<em>I</em>", "<em>RU</em>-<em>I</em> District\n1.", "addition to the requirements for rezoning listed in Section 3.8, an application for a rezoning to the <em>RU</em>-<em>I</em>"], "score": 14.251305, "query": "{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"Industrial-Rural\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RU-I\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RUI\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": {\"query\": \"RU-I\", \"boost\": 1.0}}}], \"must\": [{\"bool\": {\"should\": [{\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Minimum parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"Min. parking spaces\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"offstreet parking & loading\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"off street parking\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking and loading requirements\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking spaces required\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per dwelling\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"per family dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"for each dwelling unit\"}}, {\"match_phrase\": {\"Text\": \"parking space for each\"}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}], \"minimum_should_match\": 1}}"}, {"text": "\nNEW PAGE 51\nBrunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nNotes:\n1\nIn cases where a Street Side Yard is required, the minimum interior side yard is equal to the One Yard dimension.\n2 Structures exceeding 30 feet or three stories in height shall provide at least three means of fire apparatus access.

Also, this District is intended to be applied only on lands not anticipated to become urban or suburban by the Land Use Plan, and\nwhich are not wetlands or environmentally sensitive lands. This District is intended to provide areas for uses of open air or extensive rather\nthan intensive character such as:\ni. Agricultural industry;\nii.\nRepositories for waste products whose composition and features require they be removed from other Zoning Districts;\niii.\nChemical extraction or energy generation from crops or woods or the wastes of same, or conversion of crops, woods, and animals to\nvarious products of use to society; and\niv. Animal slaughtering and processing operations and even incineration of animal remains.\n2. This District is intended to be used in an extremely limited manner sufficient only to meet proven needs for such generally adverse uses.\n3. Such land uses require restriction of other uses such as residential, institutional, commercial, and manufacturing where there are\nconcentrations of persons likely at any given time.\nCommentary: The Sunny Point Military Ocean Terminal's buffer zone is an illustration of how man would be expected to be limited in\naccessibility or closeness to uses in this District.\nB.

Brunswick County has numerous waterways, marshes, Carolina Bays, pocosins, and other water courses that contribute to the County's\nscenic character and serve as a reminder of the important place these water courses hold in the County's history.\n2. The water courses are also an important natural resource and amenity to residents of and visitors to Brunswick County, and the scenic views\nassociated with these watercourses are an important attraction to residents and visitors to Brunswick County, which in large part is\neconomically dependent upon tourism.\n3.\nThe intent of the Viewshed Protection Overlay is to protect and enhance the scenic character of Brunswick County's riparian areas and water\ncourses, with the broader goal of ensuring the preservation of views from within these scenic areas as well as views of these areas from\nadjacent lands.\nB. Designation of Viewshed Protection Overlay\n1. A Viewshed Protection Overlay may only be established as a zoning map change in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.8,\nRezoning.\n2. The ordinance adopting the overlay district shall clearly designate the name and geographic limits of the watercourse to be protected (i.e.\ncan't just say Intercoastal Waterway, it must specify the extents of the district along the length of the watercourse).\n3.
