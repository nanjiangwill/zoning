Setbacks and landscaping are variable.\nBuildings are generally connected by hardscaping or pedestrian paths.\nb.\nTransect Zone B - Also known as the Urban Zone, this zone is generally a\ntransition zone with medium density and intensity and with building types\n5\n\nNEW PAGE 108\naccommodating retail, commercial, residential, row houses and mixed-use\nuses, and generally bordering a secondary street grid and public spaces with\ncivic buildings and spaces connected by cross block passages.\nC.
