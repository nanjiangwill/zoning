Approval of a\nspecial use permit is made the duty of the Board of Commissioners subject to recommendations\nof the Planning Board.\nThe uses for which special use permits are required are listed in the chart accompanying\nthis section, along with a detailed description of the procedures which must be followed in the\napproval of each such permit.

At the quasi-judicial evidentiary hearing, the\napplicant, the local government, and any person who would have standing to appeal the decision\nunder NC General Statute 160D-1402(c) shall have the right to participate as a party at the\nevidentiary hearing.

Objective\nThe governing body, Planning & Zoning Board, and Board of Adjustment of the Town of\nCalabash recognizes the importance of the contribution made to the community by the\nabundance of tree's and vegetation. In fact, the present character of Calabash is dependent\nlargely upon the existing trees and plantings in both publicly and privately owned properties. It is\nthis vegetation that gives the Town an aesthetic appeal that contributes to its growth and\neconomic prosperity. As economic growth occurs, the removal of this valued vegetation\nsometimes results, contributing to a depletion of a most valuable resource. The Town feels it is\nnecessary to both conserve and restore those valuable assets and declares the objective of this\nOrdinance to be as follows:\n(A)\nTo encourage the conservation of existing trees and vegetation, when practicable;\n(B)\nTo provide visual and spatial buffering between adjoining and competing uses;\n(C)\nTo enhance the beautification of the Town;\n(D)\nTo enhance property values and protect public and private investment;\n(E)\nTo preserve the identity and environment of the Town;\n(F)\nTo provide a habitat for living things that might not otherwise occur in an urban\nenvironment;\n(G)\nTo ensure that planting areas are distributed within developing sites in a manner\nwhich will provide shade, buffer noise, and filter glare.\nSection 16-2.

Purpose\nThe purpose of this Article shall be to set forth the regulatory and licensing requirements\nfor adult and sexually oriented establishments located within the Town of Calabash. Adult and\nsexually oriented establishments, because of their very nature, are recognized as having serious\nobjectionable operational characteristics. Studies and experiences that are relevant to North\nCarolina have shown that lower property values and increased crime rates tend to accompany\nand are brought about by adult and sexually oriented business establishments. The Board of\nCommissioners finds that regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse\nsecondary effects do not contribute to the blighting of surrounding neighborhoods, and to\nregulate acts, omissions, or conditions detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare and the peace\nand dignity of the Town. Regulation to achieve these purposes can be accomplished by the\nprocedures set forth hereinafter.\nThe provisions of this Article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation\nor restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented\nmaterials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this Ordinance to restrict or deny access by\nadults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the\ndistributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. This\nArticle represents a balancing of the legitimate ends of the community by imposing an\nincidental, content neutral place, time, and manner regulation of sexually oriented businesses,\nwithout limiting alternative avenues of communication and at the same time, requiring the\nbusiness to carry its share of financing administrative and enforcement activities.\nSection 20-2.

The study will enable the Town of Calabash to assess\nthe impact of a proposed special use permit or development on the highway system when that\nsystem is at or near capacity or a safety problem exists. Its purpose is to insure that proposed\ndevelopments do not adversely affect the highway network and to identify any traffic problems\nassociated with access from the site to the existing transportation network. The purpose of the\nstudy is also to identify solutions to potential problems and to present improvements to be\nincorporated into the proposed development.\nSection 23-2. Conduct\nA traffic impact study shall be prepared by a qualified professional traffic engineer and/or\ncertified transportation planner with previous traffic study experience. The procedures and\nstandards for the traffic impact study are set forth in Section 23-5 of this Article.\nPrior to the preparation of a traffic impact study, a scoping meeting shall be held,\nincluding the planning staff, the applicant, and the preparer of the study. The discussion at this\nmeeting should set the study parameters, including the study area, planned and committed\nroadway improvements (by NCDOT or others), road links and intersections to be analyzed,\npreliminary traffic distribution, other planned developments to be considered, traffic growth rate,\navailable data, periods for which analysis is to be performed, and other staff concerns.

Capacity Analysis of the Existing System\nAn indication of the adequacy of the existing street system is a comparison of traffic\nvolumes versus the ability of the streets to move traffic freely at a desirable speed. The ability of\na street to move traffic freely, safely, and efficiently with a minimum delay is controlled\nprimarily by the spacing of major devices utilized. Thus, the ability of a street to move traffic can\nbe increased by restricting parking and turning movements, using proper sign and signal devices,\nand adding capacity by the application of other traffic engineering strategies.\nCapacity is the maximum number of vehicles which has a \"reasonable expectation\" of\npassing over a given section of roadway, during a given time period under prevailing roadway\nand traffic conditions. The relationship of traffic volumes to the capacity of the roadway will\ndetermine the level of service (LOS) being provided. Six levels of service have been selected for\nanalysis purposes. They are given letter designations from A to F with LOS A representing the\nbest operating conditions and LOS F the worst.\n(A)\nLOS A. Describes primarily free flow conditions. The motorist experiences a high\nlevel of physical and psychological comfort. The effects of minor incidents of\nbreakdown are easily absorbed. Even at the maximum density, the average\nspacing between vehicles is about 528 feet or 26 car lengths.\n(B)\nLOS Represents reasonably free flow conditions. The ability to maneuver\nwithin the traffic stream is only slightly restricted. The lowest average spacing\nbetween vehicles is about 330 feet or 18 car lengths.\n(C)\nLOS C. Provides for stable operations, but flows approach the range in which\nsmall increases will cause substantial deterioration in service. Freedom to\nmaneuver is noticeably restricted. Minor incidents may still be absorbed, but the\nArticle 23. Traffic Impact Study\nPage 23-2\n"}, {"page": "279", "text": "local decline in service will be great. Queues may be expected to form behind any\nsignificant blockage. Minimum average spacings are in the range of 220 feet or 11\ncar lengths.\n(D)\nLOS D. Borders on unstable flow. Density begins to deteriorate somewhat more\nquickly with increasing flow. Small increases in flow can cause substantial\ndeterioration in service. Freedom to maneuver is severely limited, and the driver\nexperiences drastically reduced comfort levels. Minor incidents can be expected\nto create substantial queuing. At the limit, vehicles are spaced at about 165 feet or\nnine car lengths.\n(E)\nLOS E. Describes operation at capacity. Operations at this level are extremely\nunstable, because there are virtually no usable gaps in the traffic system. Any\ndisruption to the traffic stream, such as a vehicle entering from a ramp, or\nchanging lanes, requires the following vehicles to give way to admit the vehicle.\nThis can establish a disruption wave that propagates through the upstream traffic\nflow. At capacity, the traffic stream has no ability to dissipate any disruption. Any\nincident can be expected to produce a serious breakdown with extensive queuing.\nVehicles are spaced at approximately six car lengths, leaving little room to\nmaneuver.\n(F)\nLOS F. Describes forced or breakdown flow. Such conditions generally exist\nwithin queues forming behind breakdown points.\nArticle 23.
