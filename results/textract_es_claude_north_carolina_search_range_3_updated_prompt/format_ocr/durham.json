Designation/Effect\nWhen a proposed zoning map change includes a development plan, the letter \"D\" shall follow the proposed\nzoning district designation. If approved, the letter \"D\" shall remain as a part of the zoning designation of the\nproperty. The proffered elements submitted as part of the development plan, called \"commitments,\" must be\nenforceable by staff. Approved commitments are binding on the property and establish the level of permitted\ndevelopment. Commitments may also be referred to as \"committed elements\" throughout this Ordinance.\nC.\nAuthority of the Planning Director\nThe Planning Director is authorized to:\n1.\nDelegate authority under this section to a designee;\n2.\nDetermine whether modification of an unapproved development plan or deviation from an approved\ndevelopment plan is significant/substantial or minor, or more or less stringent, if not specified in this\nsection;\nThe Durham Unified Development Ordinance is current through legislation effective: Durham County: March 1, 2024City\nof Durham: March 1, 2024\n"}, {"page": "52", "text": "Your Selections I Durham Unified Development Ordinance\nPage 52 of 769\n3.\nDetermine whether a conflict exists between commitments. Any conflict between commitments,\nincluding design commitments, shall be resolved in favor of the most stringent;\n4. Determine whether an element is a commitment if it is not specified as such in this section; and\n5.\nDetermine whether additional staff review time is necessary following addition of commitments at\nhearings through proffers or illustrative graphic depictions.\n6.\nWhen an element not listed needs to be determined to be allowed on a textual development plan, or\nrequires a graphic development plan, the Planning Director shall have the authority to determine\nwhether the commitment is allowed.\nD. General Requirements\n1.\nA development plan shall comply with all applicable laws and guidelines. Requirements under this\nsection shall consist of the following, which may be supplemented by guidelines of the Planning\nDepartment:\n2.\nContiguous Development\nParcels within a development plan (graphic or textual) must be contiguous. Parcels directly across from\neach other, and separated by intervening existing or proposed right-of-way, are considered contiguous\nfor the purposes of this section. Noncontiguous parcels that do not meet this criteria must be submitted\nas separate applications.\nE.\nTypes of Development Plans\nThis section permits two types of development plans in association with a zoning map change request: a\ntextual development plan and a graphic development plan. A graphic or textual development plan describes\nor depicts aspects of development that exceed regulatory requirements. Districts that require a development\nplan, including the PDR District, may have the requirement met through either a textual or graphic\ndevelopment plan if all requirements of the district can be met.\n1.\nTextual Development Plan\nA textual development plan is one where only text is used to describe the commitments. Descriptive\ninformation shall be denoted within a textual description. These commitments will become the zoning\nstandards with which development within the district must comply.\na.\nRequired Elements of a Textual Development Plan\n(1)\nA textual development plan shall, at a minimum, proffer a commitment that specifies, limits,\nand/or prohibits uses within the zoning district requested pursuant to Sec. 5.1, Use Table.\n(2) If the Planning Director determines a committed element cannot be clearly described through\na textual development plan, the applicant must submit a graphic development plan.\nThe Durham Unified Development Ordinance is current through legislation effective: Durham County: March 1, 2024City\nof Durham: March 1, 2024\n"}, {"page": "53", "text": "Your Selections I Durham Unified Development Ordinance\nPage 53 of 769\n2.\nGraphic Development Plan\nA development plan may depict additional proposed elements, including but not limited to the following,\nin graphic form without side notes.

Inappropriate development threatens the quality of the natural resources that\nmake it a special place to live and work. Durham's governing bodies recognize that establishing standards for the\nprotection of Durham County's natural resources represents prudent stewardship of the land and good business.\nThe multiple purposes of natural resource protection standards are:\nA.\nTo preserve and enhance the quality of the water in rivers, streams, ponds and lakes that flow into and out of\nDurham County;\nB.\nTo minimize future flooding problems by restricting development in flood prone areas;\nC.\nTo preserve the water carrying capacity of watercourses and the natural water storage capacity of the\nfloodplain;\nD. To protect land and watercourses from pollutants, sedimentation and erosion;\nE.\nTo retain open spaces in order to protect their environmentally-sensitive character;\nF.\nTo protect and conserve significant natural resources from degradation due to inappropriate development.\nSuch natural resources include Inventory Sites, wildlife and plant life habitats, wetland areas and riparian\nareas;\nG.

Therefore:\n1.\nThe first number indicates the required opacity when adjacent to undeveloped land.\n2.\nThe second number is the opacity required when adjacent to a development without a buffer.\n3.\nIf a buffer exists on adjacent property, the required opacity on the property to be developed shall be the\ndifference between the opacity on the adjacent property from the total, or second, opacity number.\n4.\nA zero means no project boundary buffer is required.\nExample: A new development in the CG District abutting a developed RS District without a buffer would\nbe required to provide a buffer with a total opacity of .8 (80% opaque). If the adjacent RS property were\nundeveloped, the requirement would be reduced to .6 (60% opaque), and the developer of the RS\nproperty would provide the remaining .2 (20%) at the time of development of the residential property.\nC.\nModifications of the Project Boundary Buffer Table\n1.\nMultiplex and apartment development proposed in any district to be adjacent to single-family or two-\nfamily developments on other properties shall provide buffers in accordance with the provisions for\nRS-M if in the Suburban tier or RU-M in the Urban tier.\n2.\nNonresidential development proposed in a residential district to be adjacent to residential districts or\nresidential developments (except for upper story residential or with any intervening street or railroad\nright-of-way) on other properties, that would not otherwise require a buffer, shall provide buffers in\naccordance with the provisions of the CN District in determining buffer requirements.
