These\nbuilding types do not favor one specific architectural style over another, though certain styles are not\nappropriate for the types presented in this Code. Design regulations are not intended to promote the\nreplication of the existing built form of Belmont, but to allow imaginative design that is respectful of\nits neighborhood.\nThe rich, architectural vocabulary of the City presents a wide variety of development opportunities\nusing traditional forms while avoiding any perception of monotony. Buildings that are stylized in an\nattempt to use the building itself as advertising shall be discouraged, particularly where the proposed\narchitecture is the result of a \"corporate\" or franchise style. The guidelines in this Chapter are\nintended to attach the same or greater level of importance to the overall building design as is placed\non the use contained within. Buildings are expected to be added to the City of Belmont as long-term\nadditions to the architectural vibrancy of the community.

All buildings, except accessory structures, shall have a main, useable entrance opening onto a\nstreet or square from the front facade.

Pedestrian connections from the\nprincipal entrance of the building to sidewalks on adjoining streets and parking lots shall be\nbuilt. (Exception: Flex Commercial buildings may be accessed from entries located in the\nfront half of the building)\n4. Important street vistas (such as along City gateways and primary pedestrian streets) should\nterminate in a focal point, such as a building or other architectural or natural feature.\n5. Adjacent buildings housing similar type uses that are located within the same or similar\nzoning districts should relate in similarity of scale, height, architectural style, and\nconfiguration.\n6.\nWindows, doors, columns, leaves, parapets, and other building components shall be\nproportional to the overall scale of the building. Windows shall be vertically proportioned\nwherever possible.\n7.\nAll visibly exposed facades (exception: Single Family Homes and Duplexes) should have:\na) a recognizable base course consisting of, but not limited to thicker walls, ledges or sills;\nintegrally textured materials such as stone or other masonry; integrally colored and\npatterned materials such as smooth finished stone or tile; lighter or darker colored\nmaterials, mullions, or panels; and/or planters; and\nb)\na recognizable top consisting of, but not limited to cornice treatments, other than just\ncolored stripes or bands, with integrally textured materials such as stone or other\nmasonry or differently colored materials; sloping roof with overhangs and brackets;\nstepped parapets; and/or a cornice capping the top of a building wall.\nInnovative planning or design ideas for development in any district where the proposed building\ntypes are different than those allowed by the base district requirements may be reviewed as a\nConditional-District Zoning.\nBelmont Land Development Code Adopted_05_03_21\nPage 4 - 1\n"}, {"page": "52", "text": "CHAPTER 4: BUILDING TYPE\nREQUIREMENTS\nRequired building materials may be substituted with materials that are similar in appearance and\ndurability.

Open space as defined by this Chapter is also distinct from those\nareas that are environmentally significant and must be protected in their pristine state as dedicated\nopen space is designed to supplement the human habitat through its use and enjoyment.\n7.1 OPEN SPACE DEDICATION\nAll residential developments with more than 8 total units shall be required to dedicate open space. To\nencourage development of residential units in the Downtown District, all such residential\ndevelopment shall be exempt from these provisions. The amount of useable open space required for\ndedication shall be determined using the Open Space Dedication Matrix. These figures are based\nupon similar dedication requirements throughout the State of North Carolina with three minor\nadaptations:\nFirst, the matrix was designed to base open space requirements on the number of bedrooms in a\ngiven development rather than the usual dedication based upon the dwelling unit. This more\naccurately reflects the needs of the residents, as the number of bedrooms within a given\ndevelopment is a better representation of the actual number of residents who would use open\nspace.\nSecond, the matrix is established to encourage the preservation of land. By allowing for an\nincrease in densities, the matrix provides for an increasing requirement in open space dedication.\nFor example, a 50-acre subdivision of 100 lots developed at a density of 2 units per acre would\ngenerally require 3.44 acres or 7% of dedicated open space. In contrast, this same tract of land\nsubdivided into 400 lots (or condos) at a density of 8 units per acre would require 15.15 acres or\n30% of dedicated open space. These figures are based upon an average of 3 bedrooms per unit.\nThird and final, this matrix has been developed with regard to the availability of accessible open\nspace in close proximity to the proposed development. Developments within a 1/2 mile (10\nminute) walk (along sidewalks or other pedestrian access) to existing publicly dedicated open\nspace (parks, greenbelts, etc.) are granted a reduction in required open space dedication of 25%.\nSimilarly, developments that are adjacent to existing publicly dedicated open space are granted a\n50% reduction in required dedication.\nBecause the open space dedication requirements are based upon preliminary estimations of bedroom\nunits in a given development, changing market conditions and final build-out of a project may yield a\ndifferent bedroom count. In order to accommodate for variations, this code will permit variations to\nthe estimated number of bedrooms up to 10%. Variations in excess of 10% may allow a payment in\nlieu of additional dedication. Variations in excess of 25% will require the dedication of additional\nopen space.\nFor the purposes of good faith estimation, all single family developments will dedicate open space at\na rate of 3.5 bedrooms per unit unless otherwise stipulated. Attached homes and apartments will\ndedicate open space at a rate of 2-4 bedrooms in accordance with building specifications.\nBelmont Land Development Code: As Adopted 7/7/03\nPage 7 - 1\n"}, {"page": "121", "text": "CHAPTER 7: OPEN SPACE\nAll figures are in square feet\nHow to use this matrix:\n1. Determine average density for proposed development (Gross Dwelling Units per Acre).\n2. Determine average number of bedrooms per dwelling unit (good faith estimate).\n3. Multiply number of bedrooms by the number of units to get to the estimated number of\nbedrooms.\n4. Multiply the estimated number of bedrooms by figures shown in the matrix which relate to the\ndensity of the site and its proximity to existing open space.\nEXAMPLE:\nA developer wants to subdivide a 50 acre tract of land into 120 lots. The average number of\nbedrooms per lot is 3.5 (some 3 bedroom, some 4 bedroom). The tract is not within 1/4 mile\nwalking distance to any publicly dedicated open space. How much open space is required for\ndedication?\nThe density (in dwelling units per acre) is 2.4. There are an estimated 420 bedrooms. Using\nthe multiplier of 520 as shown in the matrix, the required amount of useable open space to\nbe required is 218,400 square feet or 5.01 acres or 10% of the total area.\nBelmont Land Development Code: As Adopted 7/7/03\nPage 7 - 2\nCELL (1, 1): \nOPEN SPACE DEDICATION MATRIX\nCELL (1, 2): \nOPEN SPACE DEDICATION MATRIX\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nOPEN SPACE DEDICATION MATRIX\nCELL (1, 5): \nOPEN SPACE DEDICATION MATRIX\nCELL (1, 6): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nGross Dwelling Units per Acre\nCELL (2, 3): \nGross Dwelling Units per Acre\nCELL (2, 4): \nGross Dwelling Units per Acre\nCELL (2, 5): \nGross Dwelling Units per Acre\nCELL (2, 6): \nProximity to\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \n0-2\nCELL (3, 3): \n2-6\nCELL (3, 4): \n6-10\nCELL (3, 5): \n+10\nCELL (3, 6): \nParks\nCELL (4, 1): \nEstimated\nCELL (4, 2): \n500\nCELL (4, 3): \n520\nCELL (4, 4): \n550\nCELL (4, 5): \n580\nCELL (4, 6): \nBase\nCELL (5, 1): \nNumber of\nX\nCELL (5, 2): \n375\nCELL (5, 3): \n390\nCELL (5, 4): \n413\nCELL (5, 5): \n435\nCELL (5, 6): \nWithin 1/2 Mile\nCELL (6, 1): \nBedrooms\nCELL (6, 2): \n250\nCELL (6, 3): \n260\nCELL (6, 4): \n275\nCELL (6, 5): \n290\nCELL (6, 6): \nAdjacent\n"}, {"page": "122", "text": "CHAPTER 7: OPEN SPACE\nSECTION 7.2 PAYMENT IN LIEU OF OPEN SPACE DEDICATION\nIf open space within a development is physically impractical due to unusual topographic conditions\nthen the City Council may, at its discretion, accept either an equitable amount of land in another\nlocation or a fee paid to the City in lieu of dedication.
