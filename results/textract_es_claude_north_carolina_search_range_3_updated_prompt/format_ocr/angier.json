However, there are instances where a\nbase zoning district designation is clearly inappropriate for a property, but a specific use or uses\npermitted under this district and subject to development requirements would be consistent with the\nspirit and intent of this ordinance. Conditional zoning districts, herein established, are intended to\naccommodate such situations. This voluntary procedure is intended for firm development proposals,\nand is neither intended nor suited for securing early zoning for tentative uses which may not be\nundertaken for a long period of time.\nC.\nJust as there are nine base zoning districts, there are nine corresponding Conditional Zoning Districts.\n3.5.2 Applicability.\nA.\nProperty may be placed in a Conditional Zoning District only in response to a petition by the owners of\nall the property to be included.\nCreated: 2023-08-11 10:27:33 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 11, Update 1)\nPage 20 of 221\nCELL (1, 1): \nCZ OSR\nCELL (1, 2): \nConditional Zoning Open Space and Recreational\nCELL (2, 1): \nCZ RA-30\nCELL (2, 2): \nConditional Zoning Low Density Residential-Agricultura\nCELL (3, 1): \nCZ R-15\nCELL (3, 2): \nConditional Zoning Low to Medium Density Residential\nCELL (4, 1): \nCZ R-10\nCELL (4, 2): \nConditional Zoning Medium Density Residential\nCELL (5, 1): \nCZ R-6\nCELL (5, 2): \nConditional Zoning High Density Residential\nCELL (6, 1): \nCZ O&I\nCELL (6, 2): \nConditional Zoning Office & Institutional\nCELL (7, 1): \nCZ CB\nCELL (7, 2): \nConditional Zoning Central Business\nCELL (8, 1): \nCZ GC\nCELL (8, 2): \nConditional Zoning General Commercial\nCELL (9, 1): \nCZ CP\nCELL (9, 2): \nConditional Zoning Commerce Park\n"}, {"page": "21", "text": "B.\nSpecific conditions applicable to these districts may be proposed by the petitioner or the town or its\nagencies, but only those conditions mutually approved by the town and the petitioner may be\nincorporated into the requirements of the district.

Overlay districts.\nOverlay zoning districts are established to provide land use regulations in addition to those created by the\nbase zoning districts herein. These overlay districts are implemented when necessary due to special circumstances.\nThere are two overlay zoning districts in Angier that provide for the protection of special environmental features of\nthe town, as follows:\n3.6.1 Watershed Protection Overlay (WP-O). The following regulations were adopted April 2005 in\naccordance with the state model ordinance:\n3.6.1.1 Intent.\nA.\nThe purpose of the Watershed Protection Overlay District is to prevent significant future water quality\ndeterioration in existing or potential future drinking water reservoirs and rivers that receive\nstormwater runoff form land within the Town of Angier. Protection of all water supplies within the\nstate, in accordance with minimum standards, was mandated by the Water Supply Watershed\nProtection Act passed by the General Assembly in 1989. The quality of water in drinking water\nreservoirs and rivers can be affected by human activities including farming, obstruction of highways\nand streets, subdivision development, industrial development, and other land disturbing activities.\nTypes of water pollutants resulting from these activities include sediment, bacterial contamination,\nheavy metals, synthetic organic compounds, and low-level radioactivity.\nB.\nThe intent of the Watershed Protection Overlay District is to apply a set of regulations involving land\nuse and, in some cases, structural Best Management Practices (BMP's) that protect the watersheds by\nreducing the pollution from future development that enters the drinking water supplies. Land use\nmanagement practices involve minimum lot sizes, maximum allowed density, and built-upon area\nrestrictions, since built-upon areas such as streets, rooftops, and driveways are a major source of\npollution. Structural Best Management Practices allow for more intensive land uses by providing for\ntemporary detention of stormwater runoff so that pollutants may settle.\nC.\nThe Watershed Protection Overlay District as hereby established overlay other zoning districts\nestablished in this ordinance. The new use of any land or new structure within the Watershed\nProtection Overlay District shall comply with the use regulations applicable to the underlying zoning\ndistrict as well as the requirements of the Watershed Protection Overlay District.\nCreated: 2023-08-11 10:27:33 [EST]\n(Supp. No. 11, Update 1)\nPage 21 of 221\nCELL (1, 1): \nWP-O\nCELL (1, 2): \nWatershed Protection Overlay\nCELL (2, 1): \nFDP-O\nCELL (2, 2): \nFlood Damage Prevention Overlay\n"}, {"page": "22", "text": "D.\nA Watershed Protection Overlay District will be applied to the Town of Angier's portion of watersheds\nthat have been classified as WS-IV watersheds by the North Carolina Environmental Management\nCommission in its implementation of the Water Supply Watershed Protection Act of 1989.

Purpose and applicability.\n7.1.1 Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the protection, installation, and long-term\nmanagement of trees and shrubs and to minimize potential nuisances, such as visual impacts, noise, dust, odor,\nlitter, and glare of lights, from adjacent properties. The appropriate use of existing and supplemental landscaping\nenhances the appearance of built environment and blends new development with the natural landscape. Existing\nvegetation should be retained where possible to ensure a natural established landscape.\n7.1.2 Applicability.\nA.\nAll new developments (except for infill single-family detached residential uses) shall be designed in\naccordance with the requirements of this chapter. Any expansion of an existing building also requires\ncompliance with the requirements of this chapter.\nB.\nGenerally, the responsibility for screening is that of the more concentrated land use. However, new\ndevelopments with a less intense use being constructed next to an existing more intense use shall\nprovide the required landscaping on the new development's property.\nC.\nIn cases where an existing, landscaped, or vegetated area is located on the same property as the\nproposed development, further plantings and/or improvements shall not be required so long as said\nscreened area is of sufficient width and depth and contains adequate and sufficient materials to meet\nthe requirements of this ordinance. If the landscaped or vegetated area is deficient, the developer shall\nmake needed improvements and/or additions to satisfy the landscaping requirements and intent of\nthis ordinance.\n7.1.3 Relief from landscaping requirements.\nA.\nIn the event that the unusual topography or elevation of a development site or the location or size of\nthe parcel to be developed would make strict adherence to the requirements of this section serve no\nmeaningful purpose or would make it physically impossible to install and maintain the required\nlandscaping, the planning board may alter the requirements of this section provided the spirit and\nintent of the section are maintained. Such an alteration may occur only at the request of the\ndeveloper, who shall submit a plan to the administrator showing existing site features that would\nscreen the proposed use and any additional screen materials the developer may propose to have\ninstalled.\nB.\nThe vacancy or non-use of an adjoining parcel shall not constitute grounds for providing relief to the\nlandscaping requirements contained in this ordinance. Neither shall the desire of an owner to make a\nmore intensive use or greater economic use of the property be grounds for reducing the landscaping\nrequirements.\nSection 7.2. General provisions.\nA.\nTo the extent that existing natural vegetation located on the same parcel of land as the proposed\ndevelopment can meet the required screening levels of this section, the use of such materials is encouraged.\nIn such case, these areas shall be designated on the development plan as undisturbed vegetation areas.\nB.\nNo structure other than a wall, fence, sidewalk, mailbox, sign or driveway shall be permitted within a\nrequired landscaping area. No off-street parking may take place in any required landscaping area.
