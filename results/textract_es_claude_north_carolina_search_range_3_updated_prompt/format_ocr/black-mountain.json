The purpose of this district is to allow for the development of fully integrated, mixed-\nuse pedestrian oriented neighborhoods. The intent is to minimize traffic congestion, suburban sprawl, infrastructure\ncosts, and environmental degradation. The provisions of this district are based on urban design and development\nconventions which were widely used in the United States from colonial times until the 1940's and were based on the\nfollowing principles:\nA. All neighborhoods have identifiable centers and edges.\nB. The center of the neighborhood is easily accessed by non-vehicular means from lots on the edges (i.e.\napproximately one-quarter-mile from center to edge, or a five-minute walk).\nC. Uses and housing types are mixed and in close proximity to one another.\nD. Street networks are interconnected and blocks are small.\nE. Civic buildings are given prominent sites throughout the neighborhood.\n4.7.11.2 Master plan required.\nA.

Mechanical equipment, utility meters, storage areas, trash enclosures, transformers, generators or other\nutility hardware attached to or on the building or ground shall be screened from the US70 roadway with\nmaterials similar to the structure, or be located so as not to be visible from public view from US70.\nD. Signage.\n1. All free-standing signage as allowed in the town's sign regulations, must be of monument style and\nincorporate some non-metal materials such as wood, brick or stone into the structure. Such signs may be lit\nthrough the use of external or internal sources only in accordance with the town lighting regulations (see\nchapter 9) and shall not exceed 12 feet in height.\nE. Parking areas and requirement reduction incentives for tree preservation and bicycles.\n1. When parking lots abut the sidewalk adjacent to US70, a planted buffer area of average of six-feet-wide, and a\nminimum of three-feet-wide is required to separate the sidewalk from the parking lot. The buffer shall\ncontain continuous landscaping of shrubbery and/or flower beds, or plantings. Where a parking lot abuts the\nsidewalk along US70 for a length of more than 200 linear feet, then a break in the landscaping and a\npedestrian connection to the parking area is required.\n2. Town parking requirements may be decreased according to one or more of the following criteria within the\noverlay district:\na. Two to four parking spaces may be waived in exchange for the preservation of one established tree of 24\ninches diameter or greater within a parking lot, up to 20 spaces in exchange for established trees per\nacre. The \"Tree Protection Zone\" is a minimum area equal to the area of a circle having a radius in feet\nequal to the tree diameter in inches (24-inch diameter of tree would require a 24-foot radius area). A tree\nprotection zone must be incorporated into the site plan and preserved throughout construction. This\narea may serve more than one tree as long as the protection zone is adequately designated and\nmaintained. These protected areas for larger trees can count toward the landscaping and parking lot\nisland requirement of the town.\nb. A developer may choose the option of replacing one automobile space with four bicycle parking spaces,\n(or two spaces for eight bicycle parking spots, or three for 12) up to a maximum of 16 bicycle parking\nspaces in place of four automobile spaces.\nC. A developer may share parking through a joint-use agreement with another business or entity or group of\nbusinesses/entities. The number of spaces required for that business shall be determined by zoning\nadministrator based on a negotiated joint-use agreement among businesses and the projected combined\nparking needs of the businesses involved.\n147 of 253\n11/30/2023, 11:47 AM\n"}, {"page": "148", "text": "Black Mountain, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nCHAPTER 5. - ADDITIONAL USE STANDARDS FOR SPECIFIED USES\nSECTION 5.1 - PURPOSE\n5.1.1 Purpose.\nThe Town of Black Mountain finds that there are certain uses that require specific additional standards to ensure\ncompatibility with other uses and conformance to the town's comprehensive plan or other adopted plans.

Conservation subdivision plans meeting the requirements of this chapter shall be allowed twice the density\npermitted per acre under the density table for steep slopes in the erosion prevention and slope protection ordinance\n(applicable to lots of 25 percent slope or greater) and shall be exempt from the minimum lot size. Under no\ncircumstances however shall the gross density of a conservation subdivision exceed the density for the district in\nwhich it is located or as allowed by the inclusionary housing allowance.\nB. Yard setbacks are not required within the development but must be maintained on the perimeter of the project\nboundary.\nC. Building sites, including accessory buildings, must be established based on the site capacity analysis which identifies\nthe areas for construction with the most stability and the least amount of land disturbance, while preserving\nenvironmentally sensitive areas.\nD. Lot sizes may vary from the minimum lot size of the district in which the subdivision is located so long as the overall\ndensity of the district is maintained and any reduction in the area of individual lots is provided in a minimum of\nequal area dedicated as common open space as part of the master plan.

Significant landscape features may include rock outcroppings, trees with\ndiameter at breast height (DBH) of two feet or more, or other landscape characteristics which are unique to\nthe site, rare in the area, or which are visually or biologically unusual.\nB. Stormwater run-off is managed in such a way as to conform to the natural hydrology of the site and resulting in\nrun-off that is equal to or less than the pre-development conditions. Low impact development (\"LID\") is the\npreferred stormwater design strategy that seeks to maintain or replicate the pre-development hydrology of a site\n163 of 253\n11/30/2023, 11:47 AM\n"}, {"page": "164", "text": "Black Mountain, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nby using design techniques to create a functionally equivalent hydrologic landscape. The strategy seeks to\nmaintain the functions of storage, infiltration, and groundwater recharge, as well as the volume and frequency of\ndischarges by the use of integrated and distributed micro-scale stormwater retention and detention areas,\nreduction of impervious surfaces, and the lengthening of flow paths and runoff time.\nC. Colluvial soils are avoided.\nD. No more than 33 percent of total land area is disturbed in the development process,\nE. Buildings, driveways and roads are located in the most stable areas for construction and along contours that\nrequire the least amount of land disturbance and cut-and-fill.\nF. Native plants existing on the site pre-development are minimally disturbed and native plants occurring naturally\non the site are also incorporated into post-construction landscaping.\nG. When adjoining or located within established residential districts, a ten-foot setback from the side and rear\nproperty lines must be preserved.\nH.

An LID analysis of the natural hydrology and how the stormwater management plan is consistent with that\nhydrology. This analysis should include calculations for run-off based on the amount of impervious surface\nproposed, and how the run-off will be managed on-site.\nB. The disturbed area does not exceed 33 percent of the total tract area, and the location and footprint of buildings\nand roads are located in such a way as to minimize impact for the particular site.\nC. The plan meets or exceeds the overall density requirements of the district in which it is located.\nD. Buildings may not be more than 35 feet in height from the highest adjacent grade. A building may not exceed 45\nfeet in height on any one side.\nE. The subdivision development, including roads and buildings, shall be designed to meet the standards of the\ntown's insurance rating as determined by the town's fire marshal.\nF. All roads must follow pre-disturbance land contours in order to minimize cut and fill to the greatest extent\npossible. Designs with bifurcated, one-way, or variable travel widths may be included within the plan if periodic\nturnouts, one-way loops, bifurcations, or other designs are applied that allow for staging and passing of public\nvehicles.\nG.

The area of all signs is determined as follows:\n1. For wall signs, lawning signs, canopy signs and crown signs consisting of freestanding letters or logos, sign area is\ncalculated as the total area of the rectangle, circle or square that fully encloses all the letters or logo.\nCoffee\nPress\nCoffee Press\n2. For signs on a background, the entire area of the background is calculated as sign area, including any material or\ncolor forming the sign face and the background used to differentiate the sign from the structure on which it is\nmounted. Display surface includes the face of the structure that the message is affixed to. Display surface does\nnot include any structural members not bearing advertisement.\n240 of 253\n11/30/2023, 11:47 AM\n"}, {"page": "241", "text": "Black Mountain, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nGround Sign\nWall Sign\n3. The sign area of a three-dimensional sign is calculated as total area of the smallest rectangle, circle or square\nthat fully encloses the largest profile of the three-dimensional sign.\n4. The area for a sign with more than one face is calculated by adding the area of all sign faces that are 45 degrees\nor greater; where the sign face angle is less than 45 degrees only the area of the largest sign face is computed as\npart of the sign area.\n245\nB. Measurement of sign height.\n1. The total height of a sign is measured from the highest point of the sign or supporting structure to the top of the\nabutting sidewalk (or the crown of the adjacent roadway where no sidewalk exists).\nGround Sign\nC. Measurement of sign height: Commercial center sign.\n1. The height of a commercial center sign is measured from the mean natural grade.\n2. Mean natural grade is measured along a line parallel to the street frontage for a distance of 100 feet on either\nside of the base of the sign, and along a line perpendicular to the street starting at the right-of-way for a distance\n241 of 253\n11/30/2023, 11:47 AM\n"}, {"page": "242", "text": "Black Mountain, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nequal to the width of the proposed sign.\n3. Where the proposed location of the sign is below the natural grade of the adjacent street frontage, the overall\nheight of the base of the sign may be increased by up to ten feet in order to achieve the maximum permitted\nheight, as measured from the natural grade of the adjacent street frontage.\n4. Landscaping around the base of a sign must be shown on a landscape plan. The landscaping must buffer and\nscreen that portion of the base of the sign located below the natural grade of the adjacent street frontage.\n5. The design of the base of the sign must complement the features and frame of the sign.\n6. In those situations where compliance with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) floodplain regulations\nprohibits the installation of a contiguous structural base, the town manager may approve an alternate base\ndesign. Landscaping and screening must be incorporated into the alternate base design.\nD. Sign setback. Signs required to be set back are typically measured from the property line. However, in instances\nwhere the property line is adjacent to a drainage area or other right-of-way that may reasonably be anticipated to\nexist in the future, the town manager may allow the sign to be placed at the property line without any setback.\nE. Sign maintenance. All signs must be maintained in good condition and present a neat and orderly appearance.\nFailure by the owner or tenant to remove poorly maintained signs may result in enforcement action by the town. The\ntown manager may cause to be removed (after due notice) any sign which shows gross neglect, becomes dilapidated,\nor if the ground area around it is not well maintained.\n( Ord. No. 0-21-17, 12-13-2021)\n9.8 - Changeable copy.\nA. Defined. A sign or portion of a sign that has a reader board for the display of text information in which each\nalphanumeric character, graphic or symbol is defined by objects (not consisting of an illumination device) that may\nbe changed or re-arranged manually or mechanically without altering the face or the surface of the sign.\n1.\nManual changeable copy is allowed in conjunction with a permitted commercial center sign, ground sign or\nmarquee wall sign only.\n2. The manual changeable copy portion of the sign may be no greater than 50 percent of the total sign area on each\ndisplay face.\n( Ord. No. O-21-17 12-13-2021)\n9.9 - Sign illumination.\nA.
