However, the Town believes the need to\nprotect the integrity of residential areas is of paramount concern. A \"home occupation\"\nzoning provision, therefore, should protect residential areas from adverse impacts resulting\nfrom activities associated with home occupations. It is important to allow but to also to\nregulate some nonresidential activities in the Town's residential districts. In essence, a \"home\noccupation\" is a limited commercial-type activity in a residential area to an extent no\nneighbors or passersby will be aware, by outward appearance, of the activity. In practice, a\n\"home occupation\" gives the resident the legal right to use ones' residence for limited\nbusiness activities but not to the extent significant pedestrian and vehicular traffic is\ngenerated.\nB) Performance Criteria.\nA home occupation shall meet the following minimum conditions:\n1) The activity shall not be inconsistent with the use of the premises as dwelling.\n2) Only residents of the dwelling unit shall work there.\n3) There shall be no exterior evidence of the conduct of a home occupation, except as\nspecified in subsection C of this section. Thus, there may be no display of products visible\nin any manner from the outside of the home.\n4) A home occupation shall be conducted in an enclosed area of a primary or accessory\nstructure. It shall not occupy over twenty-five percent (25%) of the combined floor space\nof the primary and accessory structures. No portion of a home occupation shall be\nconducted outside the primary residence or accessory structure.\n5) Electrical or mechanical equipment which creates electromagnetic interference or causes\nfluctuations in line voltage outside the dwelling unit or creates noise not normally\nassociated with residential uses shall be prohibited.\n6) On-site sale of goods or services not produced on the premises shall be prohibited.\n7)\nA home occupation shall not create a significant increase, as determined by the zoning\nadministrator, in vehicular or pedestrian traffic to the residence.\n8)\nA home occupation shall not require additional off-street parking spaces for clients or\ncustomers of the home occupation.\n9) No home occupation shall result in garbage disposal exceeding standard residential use.\n10) No equipment or process shall be used in a home occupation which creates noise,\nvibration, glare, fumes, or odor detectable to the normal senses off the property.\nC) Permitted Signs.\nMore information on signs can be found in section 16 of this Ordinance. An indirectly lighted\nname plate or professional sign not over one square foot (1 ft2 in area and attached flat against\nthe building shall be permitted in connection with an incidental home occupation.\nD) Inspections.\nAn inspector shall have the right at any time, upon reasonable request and with the consent\nof the property owner, to enter and inspect the premises for safety and compliance purposes.\n135\n"}, {"page": "160", "text": "Land Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\nSECTION 13\nParking Requirements\nA) Intent.\nThese regulations are intended to provide off-street parking, stacking, and loading facilities\nin proportion to the need created by each use. These regulations are intended to provide for\naccommodation vehicles in a functionally and aesthetically satisfactory manner and to\nminimize external effects on adjacent land uses.\nB) Number of Parking Spaces Required.\n1) Limitations.\nAll developments in all zoning districts other than the Historic Business District and the\nHistoric Waterfront Business District (H-BD & H-WBD) shall provide a sufficient\nnumber of parking spaces to accommodate the number of vehicles which ordinarily are\nlikely to be attracted to the development in question. For any mixed-use development\ncreated after the adoption of this Ordinance who cannot meet the residential off-street\nparking requirement for their proposed development, the owner/developer shall be\nrequired to contribute $10,000 per parking space needed into a parking fund which will\nbe used by the Town to acquire property as it becomes available for off-street parking for\nthese residential purposes.\n2) Presumptions.\nThe presumptions established by this section are established in all other zoning districts:\na) A development must comply with the parking standards set forth in subsection B-4\nof this section to satisfy the requirement stated in subsection B-1 lof this section; and,\nb) Any development which meets these standards is in compliance. However, Table 13-\n1 of this section is only intended to establish a presumption of parking demand and\nshould be flexibly administered, as provided in subsection C of this section.\n3) Standards.\nStandards set forth in Table 13-1 of this section are indicated by the respective land uses\nassociated within the development. When a determination of the number of parking\nspaces required by this table results in a fractional parking space, any fraction of one-half\nor less may be disregarded, while a fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one\nadditional parking space.\n4) Table of Parking Requirements.\nTable 13-1 of this section shall prescribe the number of parking spaces required for the\nrespective uses when the existing or proposed development is less than twenty-five\nthousand square feet (25,000 ft2). For all existing, proposed, or combination thereof\nof\ndevelopment which is twenty-five thousand square feet (25,000 ft2) or more, there shall\nbe a corresponding twenty percent (20%) decrease in the number of parking spaces\nrequired for this actual use.

Having too few parking spaces may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations\nin adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby parking lots. Having too\nmany parking spaces can waste money as well as space which could be used for valuable\ndevelopment or environmentally useful open space.

Fencing of\nponds is not generally desirable, but may be required by the Town to mitigate safety\nhazards. A preferred method is to manage the contours of the pond to eliminate drop-\noffs and any other hazards. The landscaping required by this section shall not be counted\ntowards the total landscaping required by any other subsection.\n2) Safety Requirements.\nNew retention/detention ponds should be designed with safety in mind SO a person or\nchild in the water could easily exit the pond. The following standards are suggested and\nfailure to meet them will require the use of alternate safety measures.\na) It is recommended side slopes to the pond shall not exceed a 3:1 slope and shall\nterminate on a safety bench which extends inward from the toe of the pond side slope\nto the normal water edge and into the pond to a depth of no more than eighteen inches\n(18\").\nb) The pond beyond the bench may be of any depth.\nc) The safety bench should be designed to facilitate the egress of the pond.\nd) The safety bench may be landscaped to prevent access to the pond.\n3) Fencing Requirements.\nWhere required, fencing around ponds shall be four feet (4') in height. It shall be a steel\nor aluminum chain link fence with black or green vinyl coating. All fences shall provide\nsecurable entrances/exits to all of the sides of the fence to allow access for maintenance\npersonnel and equipment and to provide for the safety of citizens. In instances where the\nentire property or a portion of the property on which a pond is located is surrounded by a\nfence which is at least six feet (6') in height, an additional fence around the pond shall\nnot be required.\n4) Landscaping Requirements.\na) Shrubs Required.\nExcept for fence entrances, shrubs shall be provided around the perimeter of the\nrequired fence to screen fifty percent (50%) of the fence at maturity.

The diameter of a retained tree shall be\ndetermined by measuring the tree's DBH. In the case of multiple stems, only the largest shall\nbe measured. The developer shall take all necessary precautions during construction to\nensure the survival of retained trees. Barriers shall be erected to protect tree's root zone from\nexcavating, trenching, construction storage, dumping, driving, or other vehicle traffic\nand\nplacement of any debris above the roots. When digging near retained trees, tunneling shall\nbe used rather than trenching.\n1) Applicability.\nTrees may be retained and credit may be given when:\na) The trees are healthy and in good condition;\nb) The trees are located upon the lot being developed and within the areas of the site\nwhere tree planning is required; and,\nc) Trees to be retained for credit are approved by the BOC or their designee(s).\n2) Minimum Size.\nRetained tree must be at least two inches (2\") DBH to qualify for credit.\n3) Calculation of Credit.\nDivide DBH by 1.5 and round up to the nearest whole number. Multiply by 1000 to get\nthe square footage credit. For example, a 6\" retained tree would provide 4000 ft2 of credit.\n4) Survival of Retained Trees.\nShould retained trees die or the crown at least fifty percent (50%) dead within three years\nfrom the date of the certificate of occupancy, replacement trees shall be planted equal to\nthe number of trees required for the credit given. If there is no room for all of the\nreplacement trees, the BOC may designate an alternative location in the public right-of-\nway where the extra trees shall be planted as street trees.\nG) Plant Substitutions.\n157\n"}, {"page": "182", "text": "Land Development Ordinance for the Town of Beaufort\nWithin the landscaping plan plants may be substituted if desired type is unavailable at the\ntime of planting with similar plants only upon written request by the property owner or\ndeveloper and written approval from the BOC or their designee(s).\nH) Time for Installation of Required Landscaping.\n1) Time Limit.\nAll landscaping, including mulching and seeding shall be completed in accordance with\nthe approved site plan prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or a certificate\nof compliance for the site and shall follow the guidelines set forth in section 18 of this\nOrdinance.\n2) Extensions and Exceptions.\nExtensions may be granted by the town administrator for time limit installations due to\nunusual environmental conditions such as drought, hurricanes, over-saturated soil, or\ninappropriate planting season for the plant species provided.
