High quality design includes proper siting of structures and uses and proper landscaping. The\nCity desires to allow developers maximum flexibility in achieving these high standards of\ndevelopment. However, minimum requirements for protective yards between certain uses and/or\ndistricts are hereby established to reduce the impact of a use of land on adjacent uses, which are\nof a significantly different character, density or intensity. Protective yards separate different uses\nfrom each other in order to reduce adverse impacts such as dirt, litter, traffic, noise, odor, glare of\nlights, signs, buildings and parking areas. These regulations benefit both the developer and the\nadjoining landowner(s) because it allows options from which to choose in developing the property,\nwhile insuring each neighbor adequate protection regardless of the developer's choice, thereby\nprotecting the property values of all properties involved.\n(B) Applicability\n(1)\nAll uses\n(2)\nAll new construction, additions and expansions shall be made in strict compliance with this\nsection\nChapter 6 - Performance and Design Standards\n5\n"}, {"page": "233", "text": "(3) A change of use shall be made in strict compliance with this Ordinance only in cases where\na two, or greater, step difference in the protective yard matrix occurs between proposed and\nexisting uses\n(C) General\n(1) Installation\nBefore the issuance of Certificate of Occupancy, buffers and/or screening shall be installed\nor their installation guaranteed as per Section 2.03(D)(3).

This Chapter allows adequate communication through signage while\nencouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location, size and purpose of all signs. This Chapter\nmust be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. If\nany provision of this Chapter is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such\nfinding must not affect the validity of other provisions of this Chapter which can be given effect\nwithout the invalid provision.\n(B) A sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification, protection or directing\npersons to a use conducted therein must be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate\npart of the principal use of land or building. Therefore, the intent of this Chapter is to establish\nlimitations on signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to the land, building or use to which\nthey are appurtenant and are adequate for their intended purpose while balancing the individual\nand community interests identified in subsection (A) of this Chapter.\n(C)\nThese regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible with the use of the property\nto which they are appurtenant, are compatible with the landscape and architecture of surrounding\nbuildings, are legible and appropriate to the activity to which they pertain, are not distracting to\nmotorists, and are constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition.\n(D)\nThese regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual communication that may be\ndisplayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the City. Rather, they are intended to\nregulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the\npurposes set forth above.\n(E)\nThese regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation\nand display of signs. Rather, they strike an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of\ncommunication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the\nharms caused by signs.\nChapter Signs\n1\n"}, {"page": "287", "text": "(F)\nThese regulations are not intended to and do not apply to signs erected, maintained or otherwise\nposted, owned or leased by state government, the federal government or this City.
