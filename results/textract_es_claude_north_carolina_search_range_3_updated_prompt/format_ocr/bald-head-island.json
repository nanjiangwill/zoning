There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in questions\nbecause of its size, shape, or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in that same district;\nb. Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other\nresidents of the zoning districts in which the property is located;\nC. A literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by\nother residents of the zoning district in which the property is located;\nd. The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the\nneighborhood or to the general welfare;\ne. The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant; and\nf. The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or\nstructure.\ng. Where applicable, the planning board may also consider whether granting a variance is necessary and appropriate to\nmake a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a person with a disability.\n(2) Evaluation of impact of grant. In considering all proposed variances from this chapter, the planning board shall, before\nmaking any finding in a specified case, first determine that the proposed variance will not constitute any change in the zone\nshown on the zoning map and will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or materially increase\nthe public danger of fire and safety, or materially diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding area,\nor in any other respect impair the public health, safety, morals and general welfare.\n(3) No variance for prohibited uses. No permitted use of land in other districts shall be considered grounds for the\nissuance of a variance. Under no circumstances shall the planning board grant a variance to allow a use not permissible\nunder the terms of this chapter in the district involved, or any expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this\nchapter in the district.\n(4) Attachment of conditions. In granting a variance the planning board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the\nlocation, character, and other features of the proposed building, structure, or use as it may deem advisable in furtherance of\nthe purposes of this chapter. In order for such conditions to be effective the applicant or landowner must consent to the\nsame in writing.

It is the intent\nof this chapter to permit these nonconforming uses to continue until they are removed, discontinued, or destroyed, but not to\nencourage such continued use, and to prohibit the expansion of any nonconformance.\n(1) Substandard lots of record and structures. Any lot of record or structure existing at the time of adoption of this\nchapter, which does not meet one or more of the minimum requirements of this chapter for the district in which it is located,\nshall be subject to the following exceptions and modifications:\na. Adjoining lots. When two or more adjoining lots with continuous frontage are in one ownership at any time after the\nadoption of this chapter, and such lots individually are less than the minimum square footage required in the district in which\nthey are located, then such group of lots shall be considered as a single lot or several lots of minimum permitted area and\nwidth for the district in which located.\nb. Lot not meeting minimum lot size requirements. Except as set forth in this chapter, in any district in which single-\nfamily dwellings are permitted, any lot or record existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter which has dimensions\nwhich are less than required by this chapter may be used as a building site for a single-family dwelling providing the lot area\nand width are not less than 80 percent of the requirements in the district. If the lot is smaller or narrower, a variance may be\nrequested of the planning board.\nC. Yard requirements modified. Except as set forth in subsection (1)a of this section, where a lot has width or depth less\nthan that required in the district in which it is located, the zoning official shall be authorized to reduce the yard requirements\nfor such lot by not more than 20 percent. Additional or other forms of yard modification may be permitted with a variance\ngranted by the planning board.\nd. Enlargement of nonconforming structures. Any building which is nonconforming solely because of its encroachment\nin a required yard area may be extended in any lawful manner that does not further encroach in that yard.\n(2) Nonconforming uses of buildings. The nonconforming use of a building may be extended throughout the building\nprovided no structural alterations, except those required by law or ordinance or ordered by an authorized officer to secure\nthe safety of the building, are made therein but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. If\nthe nonconforming use of such building is discontinued for a continuous period exceeding 180 days, every future use of\nsuch premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter; provided that this provision shall not apply to any\nnonconforming commercial or industrial use which normally operates less than 90 calendar days in any given calendar year.\nThe nonconforming use which normally operates less than 90 calendar days in any given year (i.e., seasonal operation)\nshall not be resumed after 365 days have passed without operation. This provision shall not prevent the restoration of a\nnonconforming building, or a building used for nonconforming use which has been destroyed to the extent of not more than\n50 percent of its replacement value, but only if such building is restored within one year of the date of its destruction.\n(3) Nonconforming uses of land. The nonconforming use of land shall not be enlarged or increased, nor shall any\nnonconforming use be extended to occupy a greater area of land than that occupied by such use at the time of the passage\nof this chapter.

Purpose.\nThe development and execution of this chapter is based on the division of the village into districts within which the use of\nland and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is\nrecognized, however, that there are some land uses which are basically in keeping with the intent and purposes of the\ndistrict where permitted, but which may have an impact on the area around them which can only be determined by review of\nthe specific proposal. These uses may be established, under certain standards and with proper controls, in such a manner\nas to minimize any adverse effects. In order to ensure that these uses, in their proposed locations, would be compatible with\nsurrounding development and in keeping with the purposes of the district in which they are located, their establishment shall\nnot be as a matter of right, but only after review and approval of a special use permit as provided in this article.\n(Ord.

Purpose and intent.\n(a) The purpose and intent of these planned unit development regulations is to promote innovative design in\ndevelopment by providing flexibility in regard to permitted uses and bulk regulations. These regulations are designed to\npromote the development of attractive, desirable communities of place, where residents and visitors can work and live in a\ndevelopment pattern that integrates residential and nonresidential uses in a design that is accessible to pedestrians and\nencourages the use of alternative modes of transportation and shared parking and offers greater conveniences to the\nresidents of the village.\n(b) It is the intent and policy of the village to encourage planned unit developments because of the extensive planning\nthat is required prior to development. Planned unit developments allow the village to plan for large areas and to manage the\nimpacts of growth on the provision of government services and infrastructure.\n(c) It is the intent of the village to encourage the use of this section in conjunction with the other elements of this chapter\nin order to encourage the development of new communities.\n(d) It is the intent of the village to provide flexibility in design in order to achieve, to the greatest possible degree, land\ndevelopment which is responsive to the natural and environmental assets and liabilities of any given site. Environmentally\nsensitive features should be protected and development concentrated in more suitable or less sensitive areas in order to\npreserve the island's unique natural resources. Development should be located and undertaken in a manner that will be the\nleast disruptive to the natural functions of the environmentally sensitive lands. The maintenance and restoration of trees and\nother elements of the environmentally sensitive lands is an integral part of any planned unit development activities.\n(Ord.
