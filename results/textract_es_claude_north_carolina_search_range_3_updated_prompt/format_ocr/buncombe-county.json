The watershed review board shall hear and decide appeals from any decision or determination made\nby the watershed administrator in the enforcement of this article.\n(b) Variances. The watershed review board shall have the power to authorize, in specific cases, minor variances from the terms\nof this article as will not be contrary to the public interests where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this\narticle will result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this article shall be observed, public\nsafety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. In addition, the county shall notify and allow a reasonable\ncomment period for all other local governments having jurisdiction in the designated watershed where the variance is being\nconsidered.\n(1) Applications for a variance shall be made on the proper form obtainable from the watershed administrator and shall\ninclude the following information:\na. A site plan, drawn at an appropriate scale, indicating the property lines of the parcel upon which the use is\nproposed; any existing or proposed structures; parking areas and other built-upon areas; surface water drainage.\nThe site plan shall be neatly drawn and indicate north point, name and address of person who prepared the plan,\ndate of the original drawing, and an accurate record of any later revisions.\nb.\nA complete and detailed description of the proposed variance, together with any other pertinent information which\nthe applicant feels would be helpful to the watershed review board in considering the application.\nC.

There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the ordinance.\nIn order to determine that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, the board must find that the five\nfollowing conditions exist:\n1. If he complies with the provisions of the ordinance, the applicant can secure no reasonable return from, nor\nmake reasonable use of, his property. Merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit to be made\nfrom the property will not be considered adequate to justify the board in granting a variance. Moreover, the\nboard shall consider whether the variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of the ordinance\nthat will make possible the reasonable use of his property.\n2. The hardship results from the application of the ordinance to the property rather than from other factors such\nas deed restrictions or other hardship.\n3. The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such as its size, shape, or topography,\nwhich is different from that of neighboring property.\n4. The hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly violates the\nordinance, or who purchases the property after the effective date of the ordinance, and then comes to the board\nfor relief.\n5. The hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property, rather than the result of conditions that are widespread. If\nother properties are equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction, then granting a variance would be\na special privilege denied to others, and would not promote equal justice.\nb. The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the ordinance and preserves its spirit.\nC. In the granting of the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured and substantial justice has been\ndone. The board shall not grant a variance if it finds that doing so would in any respect impair the public health,\nsafety, or general welfare.\n(3) In granting the variance, the board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character, and other\nfeatures of the proposed building, structure, or use as it may deem advisable in furtherance of the purpose of this\narticle. If a variance for the construction, alteration or use of property is granted, such construction, alteration or use\nshall be in accordance with the approved site plan.\n(4) The watershed review board shall refuse to hear an appeal or an application for a variance previously denied if it finds\nthat there have been no substantial changes in conditions or circumstances bearing on the appeal or application.\n(5) A variance issued in accordance with this section shall be considered a watershed protection permit and shall expire if a\nbuilding permit or watershed protection occupancy permit for such use is not obtained by the applicant within 12\nmonths from the date of the decision.\n(6) If the application calls for the granting of a major variance, and if the watershed review board decides in favor of\ngranting the variance, the board shall prepare a preliminary record of the hearing with all deliberate speed. The\npreliminary record of the hearing shall include:\na. The variance application;\nb. The hearing notices;\nC. The evidence presented;\nd. Motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence, and rulings on them;\ne. Proposed findings and exceptions;\nf. The proposed decision, including all conditions proposed to be added to the permit.\nThe preliminary record shall be sent to the environmental management commission for its review as follows:\nIf the commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance qualifies as a major variance and that (1)\n19 of 119\n11/30/2023, 12:52 PM\n"}, {"page": "20", "text": "Buncombe County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nthe property owner can secure no reasonable return from, nor make any practical use of the property unless the\nproposed variance is granted, and (2) the variance, if granted, will not result in a serious threat to the water supply,\nthen the commission shall approve the variance as proposed or approve the proposed variance with conditions and\nstipulations.

It is the purpose and intent of the Beaverdam Low-Density Residential\nDistrict to protect existing development in Beaverdam Valley from incompatible use; to provide for low-density residential\nand agricultural uses; and, to set certain standards for such uses based upon an analysis of existing and future conditions of\ntopography, access, public water and sewer utilities, and community facilities, as well as health, safety and general welfare\nconsiderations.\n(k) Open Use District (OU). The OU Open Use District is established as a district in which all uses are allowed by right, except for\ncertain uses that are regulated as special uses so as to ensure that neighborhood impact is mitigated. Additionally, those\nuses which are specific to the Airport Industry District (AI) are excluded from the OU Open Use District. The neighborhood\nimpact from special uses will be mitigated through the use of minimum specific site standards combined with general\nstandards which provide the flexibility to impose a higher level of specific site standards dependent upon the degree of\nneighborhood impact. No zoning permit shall be required for permitted uses in the OU Open Use District.\n(I) Airport Industry District (AI). The AI Airport Industry District is established as a district that includes but is not limited to\nairport facilities, aviation related uses, and related aerospace uses. The AI Airport Industry District will also support office\nuses, industrial uses, storage and warehousing, and wholesale trade either directly related to or dependent upon the\naviation industry. Such locations should currently have public water and sewer services available or be expected to have\nthese services in the future. The Al Airport Industry District shall exist only in areas below 2,500 feet in elevation.\n(Ord. No. 09-12-01, \u00a7 1, 12-1-09; Ord. No. 14-02-02, \u00a7 2-4-14; Ord.

The purpose of this section is to facilitate the creation of affordable and workforce housing and to afford\nsubstantial advantages for greater flexibility and improved marketability through the benefits of efficiency which permit\nflexibility in building siting and mixtures of housing types. Residential densities are calculated on a project basis, thus\nallowing the clustering of buildings in order to create useful open spaces and preserve natural site features.\n(b) Applicability.

A\ntransportation corridor, for the purposes of this section, is a publicly-maintained road which is designated as an\ninterstate, arterial, or collector by NCDOT. The length of interstate on-ramps does not count towards the maximum\ndrivable distance. The Blue Ridge Parkway shall not be considered a transportation corridor.\n(c) Development standards.\n(1) Density requirements. There are no density requirements for nonresidential uses as long as the proposed project does\nnot violate the intent of the district in which it is located. Density may exceed that permitted in the district in which the\ndevelopment is located (as shown in section 78-642) by the provision of sustainable development elements and/or the\nprovision of community amenities. If the community oriented development lies in more than one district, the number of\nallowable dwelling units must be separately calculated for each portion of the community oriented development that is\nin a separate district, and must then be combined to determine the number of dwelling units allowable in the entire\ncommunity oriented development. Density may be increased up to 250 percent of that allowed in section 78-642,\naccording to the following table in section 78-650(c)(1)a. No variance(s) may be requested or obtained under section\n78-621(4) or section 78-623 in order to increase density within a community oriented development other than through\nstrict adherence to the requirements set forth in this subsection and the community oriented development density\ntable.\na. Community oriented development density table. Density may be increased up to 250 percent of that allowed in\nsection 78-642, according to the following table. In order to obtain any bonus in density, points must be obtained\nfrom at least two of the three principal categories within the table (Community, Environment/Transit, Economy);\nadditional points may be obtained through providing added amenities. Project density will be calculated as follows:\nthe number of points earned will be converted to a percentage which will be the density bonus multiplier. For\nexample, an application that earns 159 points will result in a density bonus multiplier of 159 percent and the density\nearned will be 159 percent of that allowed in section 78-642. In the case of a fractional unit, a fraction of one-half or\nmore will be considered a whole unit and a fraction of less than one-half will be disregarded.\n85 of 119\n11/30/2023, 12:52 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nCommunity Oriented Development Density Table\nCELL (1, 2): \nCommunity Oriented Development Density Table\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nPoints\nCELL (2, 3): \nPerformance Metric\nCELL (2, 4): \nMaximum\nPossible\nPoints\nCELL (3, 1): \nCommunity\nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (3, 4): \n"}, {"page": "86", "text": "Buncombe County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n86 of 119\n11/30/2023, 12:52 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nAffordable housing (15 years\nminimum)\nCELL (1, 2): \n2 points for each % affordable\n(10% minimum)\nCELL (1, 3): \nUnder guidelines of the\nAffordable Housing Services\nProgram (AHSP) (sold/rented to\nfamily up to 80% of Area Median\nIncome (AMI) adjusted for family\nsize, cost/rent of the home\nmeets criteria, sold/rented as\nprimary residence, minimum of\n15 years affordability, conditions\nrecorded in document\naccompanying the Deed of Trust)\nCELL (1, 4): \n140\nCELL (2, 1): \nWorkforce housing (15 years\nminimum)\nCELL (2, 2): \n1.5 points for each % workforce\n(20% minimum)\nCELL (2, 3): \nUnder guidelines of the\nWorkforce Housing Services\nProgram (sold/rented to family\nfrom greater than 80% to 120%\nof AMI adjusted for family size,\ncost/rent of the home meets\ncriteria, sold/rented as primary\nresidence, minimum of 15 years\naffordability, conditions recorded\nin document accompanying the\nDeed of Trust)\nCELL (2, 4): \n105\nCELL (3, 1): \nPeriod of affordability\nCELL (3, 2): \n2 points for each year beyond 15\nCELL (3, 3): \nSecured under guidelines of the\nAHSP\nCELL (3, 4): \n30\nCELL (4, 1): \nAccessibility\nCELL (4, 2): \nMultifamily: 20 points for\nelevator, 1 point for each %\ndwelling units with listed\naccessibility features\nSingle-family: 1 point for each %\ndwelling units with at least three\naccessibility features\nCELL (4, 3): \nMultifamily required accessibility\nfeatures: accessible showers and\ntoilets, grab bars, and lowered\ncounter tops\nSingle-family accessibility\nfeatures: 1) accessible showers,\ntoilets, and grab bars, 2) lowered\ncounter tops, 3) accessible\nswitches, outlets, and\nenvironmental controls, 4) ramp,\n5) doorways at least 32\" wide\nand passageways 36\" wide\nCELL (4, 4): \n30\n"}, {"page": "87", "text": "Buncombe County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n87 of 119\n11/30/2023, 12:52\nCELL (1, 1): \nSafe routes to schools (SRTS)\nCELL (1, 2): \n25 for a funded SRTS program\nthrough NCDOT, 15 points for a\nprogram that receives a letter\nfrom the regional SRTS\ncoordinator documenting that\nthe application meets the SRTS\ncriteria\nCELL (1, 3): \nFor the regional coordinator,\nemail activekidswnc@gmail.com\nCELL (1, 4): \n25\nCELL (2, 1): \nEnvironment/Transit\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (3, 1): \nConserve riparian buffers and\nwetlands\nCELL (3, 2): \n15 points for permanent\npreservation of at least 50% of\nriparian buffers and at least 50\nlinear feet of stream and\nidentified/mapped wetlands\npresent on the site; 20 points for\npermanent preservation of at\nleast 75% of riparian buffers and\nat least 75 linear feet of stream\nand identified/mapped wetlands\npresent on the site; 25 points for\npermanent preservation of all\nriparian buffers and at least 100\nlinear feet of stream and\nidentified/mapped wetlands\npresent on the site\nCELL (3, 3): \nDevelopment incorporates the\nretention of intact or restored\nriparian buffers (30 feet in width\nas measured from top of bank),\ndelineated wetlands (inclusive of\na 50-foot buffer surrounding the\nwetland area).

In this instance, the county may elect to either make the\nmailed notice provided for in the preceding paragraph of this section or may as an alternative elect to publish notice of the\nhearing required by subsection 78-720(a), but provided that each of the advertisements shall not be less than one-half of a\nnewspaper page in size. The advertisement shall only be effective for property owners who reside in the area of general\ncirculation of the newspaper which publishes the notice. Property owners who reside outside of the newspaper circulation\narea, according to the address listed on the most recent property tax listing for the affected property, shall be notified\naccording to the provisions of subsection 78-720(b) above.\n(d) When a zoning map amendment is proposed, the county shall prominently post a notice of the public hearing on the site\nproposed for rezoning or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way.
