It contains the rules that control how land\ncan be used in the County, what kinds of land uses may be located in particular locations (based on the zoning map), and how\nnew development must be configured. The following paragraphs explain some of the attributes of this document.\nThis UDO is Chapter 151 of the Camden County Code of Ordinances. This UDO implements the County's adopted policy\nguidance, like the Camden County 2035 Comprehensive Plan, and is regulatory (not advisory) in nature. This UDO is a legal\ndocument that carries the force of law.\nCamden County's zoning map is the graphical depiction of the location of the zoning districts, and is adopted by reference into\nthis UDO. There is a zoning district translation table in Article 151.1 of this UDO that explains how the County's prior zoning\ndistricts are named in this UDO and its associated zoning map.\nThis UDO includes a text formatting system comprised of numbered section and subsection headings that are designed to\nhelp code users understand how the text is organized. Section headings include different color backgrounds and subsection\nheadings use underlining to help them be more visible.\nSome articles, like Article 151.2: Procedures, also include an introductory section that explains how the regulations in the\narticle are structured and how to use them effectively.\nThe top of almost every page in the UDO includes the article's number and name, as well as the appropriate section number\nand name. This is done so users may use the tops of pages to quickly navigate the document.\nPage numbers are included at the bottom of each page. Page numbers include the article number so that users may quickly\nsee what article they are reviewing.\nThe\nbottom of the page also includes the date the UDO was last updated. It is important to ensure that a user is reviewing the\nmost recent version of the document. The most recent version of the document is maintained on the County's webpage and\nis available in the offices of the Camden County Planning Department.\nUnderlined text in this UDO that references a different section, table, or figure is a dynamic cross reference that, when selected\nwith a mouse, will automatically scroll to the location of the cross-referenced section, table, or figure in this UDO. Individual\ntable of contents entries are also dynamic cross references that when selected, will automatically scroll to the selected location.\nThis UDO includes numerous graphics. Graphics are supplemental to the text, but in cases where the text of the document is\nin conflict with what is shown in a graphic, the UDO text controls.\nThere is an index of key terms and concepts at the end of the document. Code users may use this index to quickly locate a\nparticular section or set of regulations.\nThis text of this UDO is searchable.\nThe following is a list of frequently asked questions. Code users who are not sure what they are looking for should consult\nthese questions and answers first. In the event of conflict between an answer listed in this frequently asked question section\nand the adopted UDO text, the UDO text will control.\nQuestion: What is the Unified Development Ordinance?\nThe Unified Development Ordinance (or \"UDO\") is the set of laws used by the County to ensure land is subdivided\nand used in ways that promote the health, safety, and welfare of all County residents, visitors, and landowners. It\ndescribes the kinds of allowed uses, where they are allowed, and how they may be established or changed. The\nUDO also includes the rules for how development sites are configured, including items like parking, landscaping,\nsignage, fencing, and building architecture. The text of the UDO is available in the offices of the Camden County\nPlanning Department at 117 North NC 343. It is also available online from the County's website at\nhttp://www.camdencountync.gov/\nQuestion: What is the Official Zoning Map?\nThe Official Zoning Map (or \"OZM\") is a map depicting the locations and boundaries of the zoning districts adopted\nby Camden County. Zoning districts control where particular uses of land may or may not be located, and how lots\nmust be configured (size, width, and required setbacks). The kinds of uses allowed or prohibited on a particular piece\nof land in the County are controlled by the land's zoning district designation. The zoning district designation for a\npiece of land may be changed by following the requirements in the UDO. Copies of the Official Zoning Map are\navailable in the offices of the Camden County Planning Department at 117 North NC 343. It is also available online\nfrom the County's website at http://www.camdencountync.gov/\n"}, {"page": "3", "text": "Question: What can | do or place on my land?\nThe kinds of development that are allowed on land in Camden County are established based on the type of zoning\ndistrict designation for the land as well the range of allowable uses in the particular zoning district from Chapter 151.4\nof the UDO. Bona fide farm and forestry uses are allowed everywhere in the County. Anyone with questions about\nwhat is allowed on their land should contact the Camden County Planning Department at (252) 338-1919 for more\ninformation.\nQuestion: What permits do I need to build a house?\nAll single-family detached dwellings require prior approval of a Zoning Compliance Permit and a Building Permit\nissued from Camden County. In cases where the home is on its own well or septic system, the dwelling also requires\na prior approval from Albemarle Regional Health Services to ensure the lot has a potable water supply and a method\nfor dealing with sewage. Dwellings located in a floodplain or flood prone area also require issuance of a Floodplain\nDevelopment Permit. If significant amounts of grading or soil deposition is required before the house can be built,\nit\nmay be necessary to obtain a Fill Permit before construction starts. During construction, the building must be\ninspected by County Building Inspectors as required by State law, and a Certificate of Occupancy must be issued\nbefore the home may be occupied. Applicants seeking to place a mobile or manufactured home may be required to\nobtain a Special Use Permit, and should contact the County's Planning Department at (252) 338-1919 for more\ninformation.\nQuestion: What permits do | need to build a porch or deck?\nBuilding a porch or a deck on or near a single-family detached dwelling requires approval of a Zoning Compliance\nPermit and a Building Permit. In cases where the home is on a small lot of less than an acre in area or the porch or\ndeck is closer than ten feet to a lot line, it may be necessary to also obtain a Variance.\nQuestion: Do | need permits to have a home business?\nYes, operating a home-based business (also called a \"home occupation\") requires approval of a Zoning Compliance\nPermit issued by the County. The business may not exceed 1,000 square feet in floor area and employ no more than\n2 people who do not already live in the home.\nQuestion: How do | create a lot for a family member?\nLots may be transferred among family members using the Transfer Plat procedure in the UDO. A subdivision of land\ncreating lots for family members must be signed by County personnel and recorded in the Office of the Camden\nCounty Register of Deeds at 117 North NC 343. Failure to record a transfer plat is a violation of the law and will\ninterfere with the ability to obtain a building permit to build a structure on the lot.\nQuestion: Do I need a permit for a sign?\nMost forms of signage require approval of a Sign Permit by the County. Flags and political (election) signs do not\nrequire a sign permit, but are subject to the rules for signage in the UDO.\nQuestion: What is the process for rezoning my land?\nChanging the zoning district designation of your land requires a Zoning Map Amendment to be approved by the\nCamden County Board of Commissioners. The procedure for zoning map amendments is included in the UDO.\nLandowners considering a request to change their zoning should talk with the Camden County Planning Department\nstaff at (252) 338-1919 before filing an application.\nQuestion: Who makes decisions on applications?\nDevelopment applications are decided by the UDO Administrator, the Building Inspector, the Planning Board, the\nBoard of Adjustment, or the Board of County Commissioners, based on the type of application. The UDO includes a\nsummary table in Chapter 151.2 that identifies who decides which kinds of applications.\nQuestion: How can I appeal a decision?\nYes. Any decision by a County staff member (like the UDO Administrator) may be appealed to the Board of\nAdjustment. Decisions from decision-making bodies like the Board of Adjustment may be appealed to the Superior\nCourt for Camden County. There are specific deadlines from the date a decision is made within which an appeal\nmay be filed.\nQuestion: What's the best way to learn more about submitting an application for development?\nCamden County Planning staff conducts free pre-application conferences with potential applicants. Some types of\napplications require a pre-application conference to be conducted. More information on pre-application conferences\nis in the UDO.\nQuestion: How long does it take to get an approval?\nThe amount of time it takes to obtain an approval for a proposed development varies widely based on the complexity\nof the type of application. Building Permits, Zoning Compliance Permits, and Certificates of Occupancy can be\nprocessed quickly in a matter of a few days. Zoning Map Amendments and Preliminary Subdivision Plats can take a\nfew months.\nQuestion: Who can I call about flooding or other nuisances?\n"}, {"page": "4", "text": "Persons with questions about flooding, nuisances, or potential code violations should contact the Camden County\nZoning Officer at (252) 338-1919.\n"}, {"page": "5", "text": "CONTENTS\nCELL (1, 1): \nARTICLE 151.1\nCELL (1, 2):

It shall\nnot be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use\ncan be made of the property.\n2.\nThe hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location,\nsize or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as\nhardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general\npublic, may not be the basis for granting a variance.\n3.\nThe hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The\nact of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the\ngranting of the variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.\n4.\nThe requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the ordinance,\nsuch that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.\nb.\nOther Considerations\nIn addition to the making the required findings in subsection (a) above, the BOA may also consider\nthe following:\n1.\nThe variance approval is the minimum necessary to make possible the reasonable use of\nthe land, building, or structure;\n2.\nAll property taxes on the land subject to the variance application have been paid in full;\n3.\nNone of the following may be used as the basis for approving a variance:\nA.\nNeither the nonconforming use of lands, buildings, or structures in the same\nzoning district, or the permitted use of lands, buildings, or structures in other\nzoning districts, or personal circumstances;\nB.\nA request for a particular use that is expressly, or by inference, prohibited in the\nzoning district;\nC.\nHardships resulting from factors other than application of the relevant standards\nof this Ordinance;\nD.\nThe fact that land or a structure may be utilized more profitably or be more\nmarketable with a variance;\nE.\nThe citing of other conforming or nonconforming uses of land or structures in the\nsame or other zoning districts; or\nF.\nFinancial hardship.\n2.\nSpecial Flood Hazard Area Variance Review Standards\nThe standards for variance to the special flood hazard area provisions is in Section 2.3.26.C, Variance\nProcedure.\n3.\nWatershed Protection Variance Review Standards\nDecisions or recommendations on applications to the watershed protection standards shall be based on the\nfollowing three findings (subsections a-c), which shall be supported by written findings of fact and\nconclusions of law:\na.\nThere are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter\nof the Ordinance. In order to determine that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary\nhardships, the BOA must find that all of the five following conditions exist.\n1.\nIf he or she complies with the provisions of this Ordinance, the applicant can secure no\nreasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of, his property. Merely proving that\nthe variance would permit to be made from the property will not be considered adequate\nto justify the BOA in granting a variance. Moreover, the BOA shall consider whether the\nvariance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of this Ordinance that will make\npossible the reasonable use of his or her property.\n2.\nThe hardship results from the application of the Ordinance to the property rather than from\nother factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship.\n3.\nThe hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such as its size,\nshape, or topography, which is different from that of neighboring property.\n4.\nThe hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly\nviolates this Ordinance, or who purchases the property after the effective date of the\nOrdinance, and then comes to the BOA for relief.\nCamden County\n2-63\nLast Updated:\nUnified Development Ordinance\nFebruary 4, 2019\n"}, {"page": "83", "text": "ARTICLE 151.2 Procedures\nSection 2.3 Specific Review Procedures\n2.3.26 Variance\n5.\nThe hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property, rather than the result of conditions\nthat are widespread. If other properties are equally subject to the hardship created in the\nrestriction, then granting a variance would be a special privilege denied to others, and\nwould not promote equal justice.\nb.\nThe variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Ordinance and preserves its\nspirit.\nC.\nIn granting the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured and substantial justice\nhas been done. The BOA shall not grant a variance if it finds that doing so would in any respect\nimpair the public health, safety, or general welfare.\nE.\nInsufficient Grounds for Approving Variances\nThe following factors shall not constitute sufficient grounds for approval of any variance:\nF.\nConditions of Approval\nIn granting a variance, the BOA may prescribe conditions of approval to ensure compliance with the standards of this\nsection, and to assure that the use of the land to which the variance applies will be compatible with surrounding lands\nand will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood.\nG.\nEffect\n1.\nGeneral\nApproval of a zoning variance or special flood hazard area variance authorizes only the particular regulatory\nrelief approved by the BOA. It does not exempt the applicant from the responsibility to obtain all other\npermits or development approvals required by this Ordinance or any other applicable laws, and does not\nindicate that the development for which the variance is granted should receive other permits or development\napprovals under this Ordinance unless the relevant and applicable portions of this Ordinance are met.\n2.\nNotification Regarding Flood Insurance Costs\na.\nAn applicant for whom a special flood hazard area variance is approved shall be provided written\nnotice by the UDO Administrator specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE)\nand the elevation to which the structure is built.

The district is intended to foster\nfunctional neighborhoods where County residents and visitors can live,\nwork, shop, and recreate without travelling large distances between\ndiffering uses. Buildings are built close to the sidewalk and one another\nMX\nand served by public gathering areas that create places for people to\ncongregate and interact. Off-street parking and service areas are located\nto the sides and rears of buildings to help ensure a continuity of building\nfacades along street edges and to avoid areas that are unsafe or\nundesirable for pedestrians. The district encourages a fine-grained\nMixed Use\nnetwork of streets and pedestrian ways that allow a wide freedom of\nmovement and choices in transportation mode. Uses are located in close\nproximity to one another and rely on design techniques to maintain\ncompatibility instead of large yards, deep setbacks, and suburban-style\nvegetative buffers. The district allows a wide variety of housing types to\npromote population density and to support nearby retail, dining, and\nentertainment establishments.

Principal uses are the primary, permanent use type\nproposed on a lot (like a single-family home). Accessory uses are subordinate to the principal use (like a detached\ngarage serving a single-family home). Temporary uses are uses allowed for a short duration of time (like a portable\nstorage container used for the purposes of storing or moving a household's belongings).\nB.\nSections 4.3 and 4.4 set out the standards for principal uses. Principal uses follow a three-tiered use classification\nsystem that is proposed for the sake of organizing use types and assisting the County in establishing a fair and\npredictable system of classifying new or unlisted use types that may be proposed. The principal use provisions are\ncomprised of two main subsections: a summary principal use table (Table 4.3.10: Principal Use Table) that lists all\nthe allowable use types and the general zoning districts where they are allowed, and a set of use-specific standards\nthat are applied to various use types regardless of the zoning district where they are proposed. The principal use\ntable also includes the definitions of use categories and use types.\nC.\nSection 4.5 sets out the general and specific standards for accessory uses. The general standards apply to all\naccessory uses, and the specific standards include additional standards that apply to some accessory uses.\nD.\nSection 4.6 sets out the standards for temporary uses, including the districts where allowed, the maximum duration,\nand any additional standards.\n4.2. USE CLASSIFICATIONS\n4.2.1.\nPURPOSE\nThis section is intended to provide a systematic framework for identifying and distinguishing land uses to determine how a\nspecific land use activity, or combination of activities, is to be considered when applying the principal use table and other\nprovisions in this Ordinance.\n4.2.2.\nORGANIZATION OF USES\nTable 4.3.10: Principal Use Table, organizes principal uses by use classifications, use categories, and use types to provide a\nsystematic basis for identifying, describing, categorizing, consolidating, and distinguishing land uses to determine whether a\nspecific use is permitted in a particular zoning district.\nCELL (1, 1): \nA.\nCELL (1, 2): \nUse Classifications\nThe use classifications identify broad classifications of land use and include residential uses, institutional uses,\ncommercial uses, and industrial uses. Use classifications are further broken down into a series of general \"use\ncategories\" and specific \"use types.\"\nCELL (2, 1): \nB.\nCELL (2, 2): \nUse Categories\nThe use categories describe the major sub-groups of the respective use classifications and are based on common\nfunctional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or\nresidents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site conditions. For example, the Residential Use\nClassification is divided into the Household Living and Group Living use categories. Use categories are further broken\ndown into a series of individual \"use types.\"\nCELL (3, 1): \nC.\nCELL (3, 2): \nUse Types\nThe specific use types are included in the respective use category. They identify the specific principal uses that are\nconsidered to fall within characteristics identified in the use category. For example, single-family detached dwellings,\ntwo-family dwellings, multi-family dwellings, manufactured homes, and upper-story residential are use types in the\nHousehold Living use category.\nCELL (4, 1): \nD.\nCELL (4, 2): \nDevelopments with Multiple Principal Uses\nWhen all principal uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is assigned to that use\ncategory. When the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories, then each principal use is\nclassified in the applicable use category and each use is subject to applicable regulations for that use category.\nDevelopments with multiple principal uses, such as shopping centers, shall incorporate only those use types allowed\nin the applicable zoning district.\nCELL (5, 1): \nE.\nCELL (5, 2): \nUse Categories and Use Types Defined\nThe general characteristics and definitions of individual use categories and use types used in this Ordinance are\ndefined in Table 4.3.10: Principal Use Table.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCamden County\nCELL (1, 2): \n4-3\nCELL (1, 3): \nLast Updated:\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nFebruary 4, 2019\n"}, {"page": "175", "text": "ARTICLE 151.4 Use Regulations\nSection 4.3 Principal Uses\n4.3.1 Table Structure\n4.3.\nPRINCIPAL USES\n4.3.1.\nTABLE STRUCTURE\nA.\nTable 4.3.10: Principal Use Table, lists principal use types and indicates for each zoning district whether the principal\nuse type is permitted by-right, as a special use, or prohibited.
