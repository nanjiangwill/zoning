For the purpose of this chapter, the town is hereby divided into the following use districts:\n(1) R-1 Residential District;\n(2) R-2 Residential District;\n(3) R-3 Residential District;\n"}, {"page": "8", "text": "(4) R-4 Residential District;\n(5) R-5 Residential District; and\n(6) P-S Public Service District.\n(B) Establishment of district boundaries. The boundaries of these districts are hereby established as shown on the official\nzoning map of the town.\n(C) Establishment of zoning map. A zoning map, entitled the \"Official Zoning Map of the Town of Biltmore Forest,\"\ndepicts all approved use districts and their respective boundaries. Such map is hereby made a part of this chapter and shall\nbe maintained by the Town Zoning Administrator and updated to reflect changes and amendments to this zoning ordinance.\nThis map shall be available for inspection by interested persons during normal business hours of the Town Zoning\nAdministrator. It shall be the duty of the Town Zoning Administrator to maintain the map and post any changes thereto as\nthey may be made.\n(D) Rules governing district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid\ndistricts as shown on the zoning map, the following shall apply:\n(1) Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways, alleys, streams, rivers, or\nother bodies of water, shall be construed to follow such lines;\n(2) Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines;\n(3) Boundaries indicated as approximately following town limit lines shall be construed as following such town limit\nlines;\n(4) Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets,\nhighways or railroads, or rights-of-way of same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at\nsuch distance therefor as indicated on the zoning map. If no distance is given on the map, such dimension shall be\ndetermined by the use of the scale shown on said zoning map; and\n(5) Where physical features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the official zoning map, or in\nother circumstances not covered by divisions (D)(1) through (D)(4) above, the Board of Adjustment shall interpret the district\nboundaries.\n(E) Statement of district intents.\n(1) R-1 Residential District.\n(a) The R-1 Residential District encompasses most of the town's developed residential areas and contains residential\nstructures of historical and architectural significance in a most unique residential environment. The intent of the R-1 District\nis to preserve and enhance the character of existing neighborhoods and generally to provide a pleasant living environment.\nThese neighborhoods consist of single-family owner occupied detached dwelling units placed on relatively large lots with\nconsiderable open spaces between structures, thus creating a low-density residential environment.\n(b) Nonresidential uses, including home occupations, have been limited in this District as a means of maintaining the\ncharacter of these neighborhoods. Likewise, dimensional requirements pertaining to lot size, building setbacks, yard\nrequirements, and height limitations have been established to promote the general welfare and preservation of the\ncommunity.\n(c) Future construction and alteration of existing structures should be oriented at maintaining and enhancing the\nexisting character of the residential neighborhoods. Therefore, structures should be compatible in materials, height, siting,\ncolor, texture, scale, and proportion to the other structures in the neighborhood. The R-1 District also contains undeveloped\nareas to provide locations for future single-family subdivisions.\n(d) Consistent with, and to protect the existing character of the neighborhoods in this District, home stays and short\nterm rentals are not allowed.\n(2) R-2 Residential District.\n(a) The R-2 Residential District is established to protect and maintain existing neighborhoods, which are\ncharacterized by single-family residences with smaller lots, and thus greater residential densities than found in the R-1\nDistrict.\n(b) As in the R-1, nonresidential uses, including home occupations, have been limited in this District as a means of\nassuring a pleasant residential atmosphere.\n(c) Consistent with and to protect and preserve the character of the neighborhoods in this District, home stays and\nshort term rentals are not allowed.\n(3) R-3 Residential District.\n(a) The R-3 Residential District is intended to provide locations that will accommodate future residential growth south\nof the Blue Ridge Parkway. This District is intended to provide locations for future subdivisions and for planned unit\nresidential developments as special uses when design plans show that such developments will be compatible with the\n"}, {"page": "9", "text": "surrounding development and available public services.\n(b) This District is primarily a low-density residential district; however, to accommodate contemporary design and\nbuilding practices, it includes residential planned unit developments as a conditional use at a maximum density of eight\ndwelling units per acre. Nonresidential uses, including home occupations, will also be limited in the R-3 District in order to\nmaintain the same quiet and pleasant living environment as found in the R-1 and R-2 Districts.\n(c) Consistent with and to protect and preserve the character of the neighborhoods in this District, home stays and\nshort term rentals are not allowed.\n(4) R-4 Residential District.\n(a) The R-4 Residential District provides areas for residential uses, and for special uses professional offices and\ncommercial services. Urban sprawl, strip commercial development, and congestion will be discouraged by promoting good\ndesign and clustered development. These areas should provide sufficient space for ample off-street parking and well\ndesigned entrances and exits to avoid traffic congestion and safety hazards.\n(b) Land uses in this District, other than single-family detached dwelling units, will require a special use permit as a\nmeans of assuring and promoting safety and good design. The integrity of residential uses in this zone will be preserved by\nrequiring a 20-foot wide buffer strip between residential and nonresidential uses.\n(c) Consistent with and to protect and preserve the character of the neighborhoods in this District, home stays and\nshort term rentals are not allowed.\n(5) R-5 Residential District.\n(a) The medium-density district is established as a district where both residential and business uses are\naccommodated. In addition, a wide range of community facilities and services are also available. It is intended that\nnonresidential uses, including business uses, shall be compatible with and exist in harmony with the community in which\nthey are located and that adequate standards will be maintained pertaining to the public health, safety, and welfare.\n(b) In addition, these areas should provide sufficient space for ample off-street parking and well designed entrances\nand exits to avoid congestion and safety hazards. Most land use in this District will require a special use permit as a means\nof assuring and promoting safety and good design.\n(c) Consistent with and to protect and preserve the character of the neighborhoods in this District, home stays and\nshort term rentals are not allowed.\n(6) P-S Public Service District.\n(a) This District is designed to provide for open green spaces, including forestation and other natural vegetation\nthroughout the jurisdiction.\n(b) It is to be used to protect the ambiance of the community by providing a series of natural buffers between\nresidential and nonresidential development.\n(c) It is expressly intended that any structures and/or buildings shall be prohibited except as associated with a public\npark or recreational area. Any land-disturbing activity such as driveway connections or landscaping shall be approved by the\nBoard of Adjustment.\n(Ord. passed 10-19-1983; Ord. passed 6-8-2021)\n\u00a7 153.006 PERMITTED USE TABLE.\n(A) Table.

Before issuing a special use permit, the\nBoard of Adjustment shall find that all standards for specific uses listed in these sections as well as all standards or\nrequirements listed in division (B) above and \u00a7 153.110(C)( 1) have been met.\n(2) Planned unit developments.\n(a) Purpose. The purpose of this division is to encourage and provide for flexibility and innovation in the design and\nlocation of structures and land development, to provide for mixtures of housing types, to provide for the most efficient use of\nland resources, and to provide an opportunity to develop land areas in a manner different from the standard arrangement of\none principal building on one lot. Residential densities are calculated on a project basis, thus allowing the clustering of\nbuildings in each proposed planned unit development project in order to create useful open spaces and preserve natural site\nfeatures. It is further intended that a planned unit development will be in harmony with the character of the district in which it\nis located.\n(b) Planned unit development defined. In this chapter, a PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT means a development\nwhere more than one principal building is proposed to be constructed on a single tract or a clustered housing development\nor any residential complex containing at least six or more units or any building with a gross floor area of 50,000 square feet\nor more, shall be deemed a PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD). Multi-family structures shall have no less than three\ndwelling units per structure. Residential units within a planned unit development may include single-family detached or\nattached units, townhouse developments, condominiums, and other multi- family type residential units, excluding time\n"}, {"page": "13", "text": "sharing units, mobile homes, and mobile home parks.\n(c) Land development standards.\n1. The following land development standards shall apply for all planned unit developments.\n2. These planned unit developments may be located only in certain specified districts as special uses, subject to a\nfinding by the Board of Adjustment that the following conditions be met.\na. Ownership control. The land in a planned unit development shall be under single ownership or management by\nthe applicant before final approval and/or construction, or proper assurances (legal title or execution of a binding sales\nagreement) shall be provided that the development can be successfully completed by the applicant.\nb.

Some harmful effects of one land use upon another can be prevented through zoning, subdivision\ncontrols, and building codes. Other aspects of development are more subtle. Among these are the general form of the land\nbefore and after development and the spatial relationships of the structures and open spaces as they contribute to an area\nas it is being developed. Such matters require the timely exercise of judgment in the public interest by people qualified to\nevaluate the design of new development.\n(B) The design review process is intended to encourage residential and commercial developments which exemplify the\nbest professional design practices and to promote the historic character of the town. The procedure is established to\nencourage individual identity for specific uses and structures; to enhance property values in the town and adjoining\nneighborhoods; to respect each individual site and its environmental qualities; and to minimize visual disharmony resulting\nfrom unrelated and poorly designed development.\n(C) The purpose of this subchapter is to establish minimum standards for the exterior design of commercial, office, and\nresidential structures, and to ensure high quality of development, redevelopment, and compatibility with evolving architecture\nor planning themes that contribute to a community image of quality, visual aesthetics, permanence, and stability which are in\nthe best interest of the citizens of the town. These standards are intended to prevent use of materials that are unsightly,\nrapidly deteriorate, contribute to depreciation of area property values, or cause urban blight.\n(D) These standards are further intended to ensure coordinated design of building exteriors, additions and accessory\nstructures' exteriors in order to prevent visual disharmony; minimize adverse impacts on adjacent properties from buildings\nwhich are or may become unsightly, and buildings that detract from the character and appearance of the area. It is not the\nintent of this subchapter to unduly restrict design freedom when reviewing and approving project architecture in relationship\nto the proposed land use, site characteristics, and interior building layout.\n(Ord. passed 10-19-1983; Ord. passed 6-8-2021)\n"}, {"page": "41", "text": "\u00a7 153.126 COMPOSITION OF DESIGN REVIEW BOARD AND MEETING PROCEDURE.\n(A) The Town Board of Commissioners hereby establishes a Design Review Board.\n(B) The Town Board of Commissioners shall appoint five resident members.
