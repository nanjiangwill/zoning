DESCRIPTION\nA Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) is a specialized study that evaluates the effects of a development's\ntraffic on the surrounding transportation infrastructure. It is an essential part of the development review\nprocess to assist developers and government agencies in making land use decisions involving various\ndevelopment reviews. The TIA helps identify where the development may have a significant impact on safety,\ntraffic and transportation operations, and provides a means for the developer and government agencies to\nmitigate these impacts. Ultimately, the TIA can be used to evaluate whether the scale of development is\nappropriate for a particular site and what improvements may be necessary, on and off the site, to provide safe\nand efficient access and traffic flow.\nB. APPLICABILITY\nThe following table identified the level of analysis required, if any, for different types of development proposals:\nC. STANDARD REQUIREMENTS\nNotwithstanding any criteria in effect by NCDOT, a standard TIA includes the following elements:\n1.\nAbstract or Summary: Summarize description of proposed development, location, traffic generation,\nexisting and future conditions (level of service), and recommended improvements. The report should not\nexceed two pages and preferably limited to one page.\n2. Description of Development: Describe acreage included in development, existing and proposed land use,\nexisting and proposed zoning, proposed density (number of houses, square feet of development, etc.)\n3.\nStudy Area: Generally, 1/4 mile to 1/2 mile from each proposed site access along roads accessed by the\nsite. This area may, in a few cases, be greater if the site is on a road with no intersections within that\ndistance.\n4.\nSite Location: Include location map showing site in relation to major streets and at least one-mile radius\nfrom site.\n5. Traffic Generation: Indicate number of trips generated by site daily, AM peak hour, PM peak hour (AM\npeak hour may be omitted for retail uses which are not expected to generate significant traffic volumes\nduring this period). Indicate internal or pass-by traffic generation if appropriate.

The payment in lieu of dedication shall be equal to the appraised value of the required acreage of\nland within the subdivision based on an appraisal prepared by a licensed appraiser and submitted\nby the developer. If the City disagrees with the submitted appraisal, it may have a second appraisal\nprepared. If the appraisals are within fifteen (15) percent of each other, the developer's appraisal will\nbe utilized to establish value. If the appraisals differ by more than fifteen (15) percent, the value will\nbe based on the average of the two appraisals.\nCITY OF EDEN, NC\n6-24\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nEFFECTIVE DATE: 01.01.2021\n"}, {"page": "161", "text": "ARTICLE 6\nGENERAL USE STANDARDS\nC.

Pre-existing development\na. Non-conforming preexisting development is subject to these standards as follows:\n(1) A change in type of occupancy, as set forth in the North Carolina Building Code\nCITY OF EDEN, NC\n6-25\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nEFFECTIVE DATE: 01.01.2021\n"}, {"page": "162", "text": "ARTICLE 6\nGENERAL USE STANDARDS\n(2) A change in land use which requires an increase in the number of off-street parking spaces or\nthe provision of a buffer yard\n(3) Additions or expansions which singularly or collectively exceed 25% of the land area or gross\nbuilding floor area existing at the effective date of this ordinance.\nb. The City of Eden recognizes that designing preexisting development to meet new regulations is more\ndifficult and expensive than applying these standards to undeveloped properties. Therefore, greater\nflexibility will be afforded preexisting development in meeting the requirements of this section, in that:\n(1) A modification of up to 25% percent may be granted by the Administrator for planting area and\ndimension requirements where compliance presents hardships due to building location, lot size,\nor vehicular area configuration.\n(2) A credit for reducing required off-street parking by one (1) space shall be given for the\nconstruction of each landscape island.\nC.\nFRONT YARD TREES\n1.\nFront yard trees (functioning as street trees) are an essential part of the City streetscape. As opposed to\nstreet trees, front yard trees are planted on private property, just outside of the right-of-way line.

To accomplish this objective, the following shall apply:\na.\nAll subdivisions and developments subject to site plan approval shall provide front yard trees along\ntheir frontage with adjacent public streets.\nb. Front yard trees shall be planted on private property. They shall be located five (5) to ten (10) from\nback of curb or edge-of-sidewalk, whichever is greater, or as close as possible to those criteria.\nC.\nFront yard trees shall be selected from the list of small or understory trees, or, where power lines are\nlocated, small trees included in the Appendix.\nd. Where necessary, planting strips shall be a minimum of six (6) feet wide.\ne.\nPlanting location shall take into consideration planned roadway widening, public safety, standard\ndrainage requirements, and maintenance of sight distances for traffic safety. Street trees may be\nplanted within the right-of-way, within planting strip abutting the right-of-way or other location\napproved by the Administrator.\n2. Front yard trees, unless subject to overhead power lines, shall be planted at the rate of one (1) two-inch\ncaliper tree per forty (40) feet of property line abutting a public street, excluding driveways and traffic\nvisibility zones. This rate may be varied based upon planned signage areas, existing trees, and the\ncrowns of planted trees.\n3. Trees used to meet buffer and vehicle use area requirements, may be used to meet the street\nrequirements to the extent that the trees are located within 25 feet of a street.\nCITY OF EDEN, NC\n6-26\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nEFFECTIVE DATE: 01.01.2021\n"}, {"page": "163", "text": "ARTICLE 6\nGENERAL USE STANDARDS\nD.\nBUFFER YARD REQUIREMENTS\n1.\nBuffers provide compatible transitions between differing land uses, reduce the visual impacts of\ndevelopment and retain existing plant materials.\na.
