Because of the refinement of this option, the\nTown strongly encourages its use for such situations. Conditional zoning affords\na degree of certainty when making land use decisions that is not possible when\nrezoning to a general zoning district, which allows the full range of uses\npermitted in the district and does not provide the flexibility to propose or require\nbinding site specific conditions to address unique issues that affect the subject\nproperty or any potential adverse impacts on adjacent property.\nB)\nApplications for Conditional District map amendment shall be filed with the\nAdministrator in the same manner as a standard map amendment. A\nConditional District map amendment shall only be initiated at the request of the\nproperty owner or their authorized agent. A \"CD\" map amendment shall not be\ninitiated by the Town Board, Planning Board, or administrative staff.\nC)\nThe Applicant shall submit an application for a \"CD\" map amendment and a site\nspecific plan to the Administrator. Following approval of the rezoning, the\napplicant shall file an application for a final site plan with the Administrator that\nis consistent with the approved preliminary site plan and any supplemental\nconditions set forth as part of the Conditional District approval.\nD) The applicant shall describe the exact land use(s) proposed for the \"CD\"\nrezoning. Such use(s) may be selected from any of the uses, whether permitted\nby right or conditional, allowed in the general zoning district upon which the\n\"CD\" rezoning is based. The applicant may also submit any other conditions\nlimiting the type, scope or intensity of development or use of the subject\nproperty for consideration by the decision making body.\nE)\nWithin a conditional zoning district, only those uses permitted by the zoning\ndistrict with which the \"CD\" rezoning corresponds shall be permitted.
