This district is established to accommodate, protect, rehabilitate and maintain the\ntraditional central business district and boardwalk area of the Town. This area accommodates a\nwide variety of pedestrian oriented, commercial and service activities, including retail, business,\noffice, professional financial, entertainment, and tourism.\n(2) Intent. The regulations of this district are intended to encourage the use of land for concentrated\ndevelopment of permitted uses while maintaining a substantial relationship between land uses and\nthe capacity of the Town's infrastructure. Developments which would significantly disrupt the\nhistoric balance between pedestrians and automobiles within the district, thereby destroying the\npedestrian-oriented nature of the area, are specifically discouraged. Large, off-street parking areas\nare encouraged to locate outside the district. Similarly, buildings and structures should have\npedestrian-oriented activities at ground level.\n(I) HB, Highway Business District. This district is established to accommodate businesses oriented toward\nthe motoring public and which require a high volume of traffic. In many cases, businesses in the HB\ndistrict serve the entire community and beyond. For the most part, they are located on major\nthoroughfares so that they can be conveniently reached by automobile and to avoid sending heavy\nautomobile traffic through smaller streets or residential areas. Certain wholesale activities are also\npermitted in HB district.\n(m) MB-1, Marina Business District. This district is established to reserve areas along the water's edge for\nmaritime uses, water dependent uses, and water-oriented uses. This district also provides for certain\nresidential and other non-water dependent uses which are closely aligned with water oriented uses.\nLand uses, which would wall off the public from public trust waters, are specifically discouraged.\n(n) I-1, Industrial District. This district is established to provide for warehousing and storage and light\nindustrial activities compatible with a small, tourist oriented, environmentally sensitive, coastal\ncommunity. Light industries are generally characterized as having small physical plants, lower land\nrequirements and higher worker to land ratios. Such industries typically generate few objectionable\nimpacts in terms of noise, lights, heavy truck traffic, fumes, smoke, dust, odor or other similar\ncharacteristics. Furthermore, any negative environmental impacts associated with these industries\nmay generally be mitigated through proper site planning, buffering, and operations management. This\ndistrict is located in areas that are readily accessible from major thoroughfares, so as to minimize\ntraffic impacts on non industrial areas of the community.\n(o) FP, Floodplain Overlay District.\n(1) Purpose; intent. The 100-year floodplain as depicted on the latest National Flood Insurance\nProgram's (NFIP) flood insurance rate map is hereby incorporated by reference as part of the\nofficial zoning map for the Town. Development within the 100-year floodplain must conform with\nall provisions of chapter 30, flood damage prevention. It is the intent of the Town Council to\npromote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses\ndue to flood conditions in specific areas through compliance with chapter 30, flood damage\n11 of 176\n5/10/2024, 9:15 AM\n"}, {"page": "12", "text": "Carolina Beach, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nprevention, noted in this subsection (o)(1).\n(2) Density. The standards of the underlying zoning district shall apply, except as may be required in\nany special regulations applicable to this area.\n(p) Height Overlay District (HOD). This district is established to preserve the character of the Town's\ntraditional single-family residential neighborhoods. This area can be described as having a high\nconcentration of permanently occupied homes in comparison to seasonal units. The regulations of this\ndistrict limit height to 45 feet.\n(Code 1986, app. A, \u00a7 3.7; Ord. No. 00-463, 10-10-2000; Ord. No. 01-484, 8-14-2001; Ord. No. 06-634, 5-9-2006;\nOrd.

The table in section 40-72 sets forth the permitted, conditional zoning, and special uses\nallowed in each zoning district.\n(1) Permitted by right (P). The letter \"P\" in the zoning district column opposite the listed use means the\nuse is permissible by right in the zoning districts in which it appears.\n(2) Conditional zoning (CZ). The letter \"CZ\" in the zoning district column opposite the listed use means\nthat conditional zoning, as set forth in article XVII of this chapter, must be obtained before the use\nmay be created.\n(3) Special use permit (S). The letter \"S\" in the zoning district column opposite the listed use means\nthat a special use permit, as set forth in article XI of this chapter, must be obtained before the use\nmay locate in the district in which it appears.\n(4) Prohibited. A use specifically prohibited in the table of permissible uses for every zoning district.\nAny use listed as prohibited has been reviewed and considered as having a detrimental impact on\nthe health and safety of the community.\n(5) Exemptions. The following may be exempted from the one customary accessory building: fence,\nflagpole or dog house not to exceed 16 square feet; pump house not to exceed 16 square feet; and\na playhouse not to exceed 36 square feet nor eight feet in height, or as may be provided for under\narticle XVII of this chapter (conditional zoning). The exemptions are not to have sewer, electrical,\nand plumbing except for a pump house. These exemptions are not considered part of the lot\ncoverage.\n(b) Use designation.\n(1) If a \"P\" or \"CZ\" or \"S\" does not appear in a zoning district column opposite a listed use, the use is\nnot permitted in that zoning district.\n(2) Uses not listed. The permitted, not permitted or conditional status of any use not listed in the table\nof uses shall be determined by the zoning administrator based upon the administrator's\ncomparison of similar uses as allowed in similar locations. The zoning administrator may refer any\nunlisted use to the board of adjustment for interpretation.

No interpretation shall be made which would change the character of\na zoning district relative to the purpose of such zoning district and the other uses allowed.\n(3) Interpretation of unlisted uses. Where a proposed use is not specifically listed in the table of\npermissible uses, the zoning administrator may permit the proposed use upon a determination\nthat the proposed use has an impact similar in nature, function, and / or duration similar to\nanother permitted used listed in the table of permissible uses. The zoning administrator shall give\ndue consideration to the purpose and intent statements in this section concerning the base zoning\ndistrict(s) involved, the character of the uses specifically identified, and the character of the use(s)\nin question.\n(4) Standards for approving unlisted uses. In order to determine if a proposed use(s) has an impact\nthat is similar in nature, function, and duration to the other approved uses allowed in a specific\nzoning district, the zoning administrator shall assess all relevant characteristics of the proposed\nuse, including but not limited to the following:\na. The volume and type of sales, retail, wholesale, etc.;\nb. The size and type of items sold and nature of inventory on the premises;\nC. Any processing done on the premises, including assembly, manufacturing, warehousing,\nshipping, distribution;\nd. Any dangerous, hazardous, toxic, or explosive materials used in the processing;\ne.\nThe nature and location of storage and outdoor display of merchandise, whether enclosed,\nopen, inside or outside the principal building; predominant types of items stored (such as\nbusiness vehicles, work-in-process, inventory, and merchandise, construction materials, scrap\nand junk, and raw materials including liquids and powders);\nf. The type, size, and nature of buildings and structures;\ng. The amount and nature of any nuisances generated on the premises, including but not limited\nto noise, smoke, odor, glare, vibration, radiation, and fumes;\nh.\nAny special public utility requirements for serving the proposed use type, including but not\nlimited to water supply, wastewater output, pre-treatment of wastes and emissions required or\nrecommended, and any significant power structures and communications towers or facilities;\nand\ni. The impact on adjacent lands created by the proposed use.\n(5) Decision by zoning administrator.\na. Typical use: Added to ordinance. In making the determination, the zoning administrator shall\nrecommend a text amendment to this section if it is determined the proposed use is common\nor likely to recur frequently, or that omission of specific inclusion and reference in the table of\npermitted uses is likely to lead to public uncertainty and confusion. Until final action is taken on\na proposed amendment, the interpretation of the zoning administrator shall be binding.\n13 of 176\n5/10/2024, 9:15 AM\n"}, {"page": "14", "text": "Carolina Beach, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nb.

Immediately following the text below, are three tables which set forth\nthe required area and dimensional standards associated with each district. The three tables are\nreferenced in the following sections:\n(1) Section 40-74, dimensional standards for lots and principal structures.\n(2) Section 40-75, dimensional standards for accessory structures.\n(b) Other special dimensional standards. In addition to the dimensional standards set forth in sections\n40-74 and 40-75, the following special dimensional standards are established:\n(1) Corner lots. Except within the CBD districts, all corner lots shall not be less than 12 1/2 feet on side\nstreet. Accessory structures shall also be subject to this requirement.\n(2) Front yards on through lots. On through lots, the minimum front yards for the respective zoning\ndistricts shall apply wherever such lots have frontage on a street.\n(3) Sight distance at intersections. On corner lots abutting to vehicular traffic rights-of-way, no\nplanting, fence, wall, sign or structure or other type of obstructions not specifically exempted shall\nbe permitted in the space between 30 inches above ground level and ten feet above ground level\nwithin a sight distance triangle that abuts a right-of-way. A sight distance triangle shall be the\nvisually unobstructed area of a street/driveway corner as determined by measuring a distance of\n30 feet along the intersecting curb lines, or edges of pavement of the intersecting street/driveway if\ncurbs are not present, and connecting the two points by a straight line to form a triangular shaped\narea over the corner. One support post not to exceed five square feet may be utilized in the sight\ntriangle to support the cantilever floors above. Structures deemed essential for public utilities, as\ndetermined by the Public Works or Public Utilities Director, may be exempt.\n(4) Reduction of required lot area. Where lots abut the estuarine and/or ocean tidal waters, as defined\nin section 40-548, and where lot depth has been lost due to the encroachment of such waters,\nmaking such lot area nonconforming to the zoning district requirements, the existing lot area may\nbe considered conforming to meet the minimum lot area requirements of the zoning district in\nwhich located. However, the front and side yards of the zoning district shall apply. Lots which have\nlost area due to estuarine and ocean tidal waters or Carolina Beach Erosion Control and Hurricane\nWave Protection Projects may be developed in accordance with all applicable permitted uses of the\nzoning district in which located, provided that the actual lot area extending to the Carolina Beach\nBuilding Line or Kure Beach's Beach Re-nourishment Easement Line shall be utilized when\ncomputing the density for multifamily dwellings per lot. The Zoning Administrator shall make the\ndetermination of actual lot area.\n(5)\nReduction of front yard setback.

There are also circumstances in which a general district designation\nallowing such a use by right would not be appropriate for a particular property even though the\nuse itself could, if properly planned, be appropriate for the property consistent with the objectives\nof these regulations, the adopted land use plan, adopted area plans and other long-range plans.\nThe review process established in this section provides for the accommodation of such uses by a\nreclassification of property into a conditional zoning district, subject to specific conditions which\nensure compatibility of the use with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties. A\nconditional zoning district is generally not intended for securing early zoning for a proposal, except\nwhen that proposal is consistent with an approved district or area plan or the proposal can\ndemonstrate that public infrastructure needed to serve the development will be made available\nwithin a reasonable time period.\n(2) All uses listed as part of any application shall be in the same format and description as listed in the\ntable of uses.\n(3) A conditional zoning and a zoning map amendment are occurring simultaneously in a conditional\nzoning hearing.
