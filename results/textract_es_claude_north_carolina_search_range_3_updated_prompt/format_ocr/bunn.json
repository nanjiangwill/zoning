The uses permitted in this district are\ndesigned to stabilize and protect the essential character of the area and to prohibit all activities of a\ncommercial nature except certain home occupations controlled by specific limitations.\nManufactured homes shall be allowed in this district, subject to regulations in Article X.\nAgricultural uses shall also be permitted in this district.\nSection 2. R-2 Medium Density Residential\nThis district is established to provide a quiet, medium density living environment\nconsisting of single family detached dwellings, two-family dwellings, medium-density multi-\nfamily dwellings and related uses necessary for a sound neighborhood. The regulations for this\ndistrict are designed to stabilize and encourage a healthful environment for family life\nSection 3. R-3 High Density Residential\nThis district is established to accommodate more dense development including single-\nfamily homes on smaller lots, two- and multi-family housing, and their accessory uses. This\ndistrict provides areas in the community for residents desiring smaller residences and multi-family\noptions in higher- density neighborhoods closer to commercial zoning districts.

C-3 Highway Commercial\nThe intent of this zone would be to encourage the establishment of areas for general\nbusiness that do not require a central location.

The district is intended to provide for offices, personal services, and the\nretailing of durable and convenience goods for the community.
