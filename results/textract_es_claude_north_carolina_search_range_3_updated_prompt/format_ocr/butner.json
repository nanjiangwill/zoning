The Butner Gateway consists of five Base Zoning Districts described\nin \u00a7 6.5 and three Conditional Zoning Districts described in \u00a7 6.6 within a specific area, the\nGateway, each of which allow a mix of uses. Using a hybrid of form based code and traditional land\nuse based code, these districts create a cohesive, integrated, and unified development consistent\nwith the town's Gateway Small Area Plan adopted December 3, 2015 and the town's current\nComprehensive Plan. The districts are allowed only within the Gateway Area. Before development\nin the Gateway Districts may occur, a concept plan must be reviewed and approved by Town\nCouncil in accordance with division 3.2.6. Uses allowed in each Gateway District are shown in\nTable 7-1, Table of Permitted Uses. Any property in the Gateway area can request a Conditional\nDistrict rezoning to allow a use allowed in another Gateway District.\n(A) Gateway Base Zoning Districts.\n(1) Central Avenue Mixed-Use District (CX).

The area in between, north of 26th Street and extending across the railroad to the\nleast, is intended to be the primary employment center for the Gateway area. This area focuses on\nnonresidential operations including employment and job generating uses. Uses within this district\nwill likely use the railroad and interstate for the movement of goods. Properties in this area may be\ndeveloped individually or as part of a business or office park. Supporting residential may be\nprovided under limited situations, and shall not be primary uses in this district.\n(5) Central Gateway East District (CE).
