Columbus County uses an equal interval system in its approach to assigning road address\nnumbers to buildings within the County. This requires the selection of two (2)\nintersecting baselines, one (1) running in an East-West direction and one (1) running in a\nNorth-South direction. A frontage interval of 5.28 feet is then used to assign a\nprogression of road address numbers to building and properties. Working out from these\nlines in any direction along a continuous road with this system will easily convert to\ndistance from the beginning point (i.e., 1600 equals 1.6 miles).\n2. The base lines selected for Columbus County are the Whiteville City limits. Most road\naddress numbers will begin at the end of the road closest to the nearest base line; or in\ncase of a dead-end road, at its intersection with another named road. For continuous\nroads, which cross a base line, they will be addressed with respect to East -West -North -\nSouth of that line.\n3. All buildings will be addressed relative to their position on a named road. Houses which\nare obviously facing a named road will be addressed with the number which falls closest\nto the front door of that building.
