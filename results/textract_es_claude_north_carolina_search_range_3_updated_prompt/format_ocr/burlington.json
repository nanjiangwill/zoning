It contains the rules\nthat control how land can be used in the City's jurisdiction (land within the City limits and the City's extra-\nterritorial jurisdiction), what kinds of uses may be located in particular locations, how new development must\nbe configured, and the rules for review of development applications.\nThe following paragraphs explain some of the attributes of this document.\nThis UDO updates and replaces the City's prior Zoning Ordinance, Land Development Regulations, and selected\nappendices from the City Code of Ordinances (Soil Erosion & Sedimentation Control, Riparian Buffers, Flood\nDamage Prevention, etc.). While this document implements the City's adopted policy guidance, like Destination\nBurlington (the City's comprehensive plan), the UDO is a legal document and is not advisory in nature (like\nthe comprehensive plan).\nThe City's zoning map is the graphical depiction of the location of the zoning districts and is adopted by\nreference into this UDO. There are zoning district translation provisions in Chapter 1 of this document that\ndescribe how the prior zoning districts are translated to corresponding zoning districts in this UDO.\nThis document contains 10 chapters that consolidate similar kinds of provisions, like procedures, zoning\ndistricts, use standards, or development standards. The second page of each chapter is a table of contents\nfor the chapter. Each table of contents entry is a dynamic hyper link that will advance the digital version of\nthe document to the selected section (a section is selected by clicking on a term with the mouse).

For example,\npre-application conferences, application submittal, application completeness determination, staff\nreview and report, public notification, public meeting or hearing procedures, and notification of\ndecision steps are identical for each type of development application, and as such, are listed only once.\nIn some cases, there are minor deviations from the common procedures for some types of specific\ndevelopment applications. In those cases, the provisions for the specific development application\nreview procedure control.\n4.\nSection 2.4, Specific Procedures, describes the steps in each type of application review process, the\nreview criteria specific to that type of procedure, and any other provisions that apply in addition to or\ninstead of the common procedures.\nB. STEPS IN THE REVIEW PROCESS\nAn applicant seeking development approval under this Ordinance should first consult the summary table\nof review procedures in Section 2.2, Summary Development Table, to determine which review authorities\nare involved with the application. Then, an applicant should review the common procedures in Section\n2.3, Common Procedures, to understand the steps in the application process. Finally, an applicant should\nreview the individual specific procedure related to their application type in Section 2.4, Specific Procedures.\n2.2.

Boundaries shown as approximately following a lot line shall be interpreted as following the lot line as\nit existed when the boundary was established. If a subsequent minor adjustment (such as from\nsettlement of a boundary dispute or overlap) results in the lot line moving 10 feet or less, the zoning\nboundary shall be interpreted as moving with the lot line.\n4. Boundaries shown as approximately following a river, stream, canal, lake, or other watercourse shall\nbe interpreted as following the centerline of the watercourse as it actually exists, and as moving with\nthat centerline to the extent the watercourse moves as a result of natural processes (flooding, erosion,\nsedimentation, etc.).\n5. Boundaries shown parallel to or as extensions of features indicated in this subsection shall be\ninterpreted as such.\n6.

More specifically, they are intended to:\n1. Provide appropriately located lands for residential development that are consistent with the goals,\nobjectives, and policies of the City's adopted policy guidance;\n2. Ensure adequate light, air, privacy, and open space areas for each dwelling, and protect residents\nfrom the negative effects of noise, excessive population density, traffic congestion, flooding, and other\nsignificant adverse environmental impacts;\n3. Protect residential areas from fires, explosions, toxic fumes and substances, and other public safety\nhazards;\n4. Provide for residential housing choice, affordability, and diversity with varying housing densities, types,\nand designs, including accessory dwelling units;\n5.\nProvide for safe and efficient vehicular access and circulation and promote bicycle-, and pedestrian-\nfriendly neighborhoods;\n6. Provide safe and efficient access to public transit facilities and alternative forms of transportation, like\ngreenways;\n7. Provide for public services and facilities needed to serve residential areas and accommodate public\nand very low intensity neighborhood-serving non-residential uses in the higher density residential\ndistricts while protecting residential areas from incompatible non-residential development;\n8. Create neighborhoods and preserve existing community character while accommodating new\ndevelopment and redevelopment consistent with the City's goals and objectives; and\n9.\nPreserve the unique character and historic resources of the traditional neighborhoods and the\ncommunity.\nB. BUSINESS ZONING DISTRICTS\nThe business zoning districts are intended to ensure a wide range of office, retail, service, industrial, and\nrelated uses necessary to meet resident and visitor needs, and more specifically to:\n1. Provide appropriately located lands for the full range of business uses needed by the City's residents,\nbusinesses, and workers, consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies in the City's adopted policy\nguidance;\n2. Strengthen the City's economic base, and provide employment opportunities close to home for\nresidents of the City and surrounding areas;\n3.\nCreate suitable environments for various types of business uses, and protect them from the adverse\neffects of incompatible uses;\n4.\nProvide safe and efficient access to alternative forms of transportation like public transit facilities,\nsidewalks, trails, and greenways;\n5. Preserve the unique character and historic resources of the downtown area while increasing\nopportunities for urban development in areas already well-served by infrastructure; and\n6. Minimize the impact of business development on residential districts and sensitive natural\nenvironments.\nC. SPECIAL ZONING DISTRICTS\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\nThe special zoning districts are intended to recognize those portions of the City's jurisdiction that are\nunique or that require special consideration in order to:\n1. Protect and preserve environmentally-sensitive lands;\n2. Accommodate various types of mixed-use development in ways that establish functioning\nneighborhoods where people can live, work, shop, and recreate without travelling extensive distances;\n3. Provide safe and efficient access to alternative forms of transportation like public transit facilities,\nsidewalks, trails, and greenways; and\n4.\nCreate appropriate amounts of flexibility to foster redevelopment, infill, downtown revitalization, and\neconomic opportunities for City residents.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCity of Burlington\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nNorth Carolina\nCELL (2, 2): \n3-9\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Updated 9.19.23\n"}, {"page": "132", "text": "CHAPTER 3 ZONING DISTRICTS\nSection 3.4 Central Business (CBD) District\n3.4.

DISTRICT PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Central Business (CBD) District is established and intended to\nserve as the commercial and cultural heart of the City's jurisdiction.\nDevelopment in the CBD includes the highest average densities and\nbuilding heights in the City. Development is configured for an urban\ncontext, with buildings built to the street, ground floor uses that\nsupport pedestrian travel, and numerous civic gathering spaces and\ncultural attractions. The district is intended to accommodate a well-\nbalanced mix of uses (e.g., office, retail, service, high-density\nresidential, and entertainment), promote a strong pedestrian-\noriented environment (with a reduced need for off-street parking),\nand preserve and protect the downtown's historical and architectural\nscale and character. The district requires urban-style open space\n(greens, seating areas, plazas, pocket parks, roof gardens, etc.) to\nbe included as a part of new development.

Development in the GB district tends to be\nautomobile oriented and comprised of a mix of individual buildings on\nindividual sites and multi-tenant or multi-building developments located\nnear major roadway intersections. In addition to commercial uses, the\ndistrict also accommodates wholesale sales, warehousing uses, and a very\nwide range of institutional uses. Limited forms of residential use are\nallowed, such as upper-story residential and multi-family development.\nUses in the district are subject to standards intended to ensure development\nis compatible with adjacent residential neighborhoods, ensure that the\ntraffic carrying capacity along the City's major roadways is not impaired due\nto unsafe turning movements, and that development is well landscaped and\naesthetically pleasing. In order to maintain compatibility with surrounding\nuses and ensure a high quality of development, all activities, including\nstorage shall be indoors or be fully screened from view from the street or\nfrom lands in lower-intensity zoning districts.\nB.

Buildings are built close to the sidewalk and served by public\ngathering areas that create places for people to congregate and interact. The district\nencourages a fine-grained network of streets and pedestrian ways that allow a wide\nfreedom of movement and choices in transportation mode, including public transit. Land\nuses are mixed (including both residential and non-residential) either in the same building\n(vertical integration) or on the same development site (horizontal integration), and are\nlocated in close proximity to one another. Mixed use districts are located on principal and\nminor arterials as well as collector streets. The district allows a wide variety of housing\ntypes to promote population density and to support nearby retail, dining, and entertainment\nestablishments.

WATER SUPPLY WATERSHED PROTECTION OVERLAY (WPO) DISTRICT\n1. District Established\nThe Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay (WPO) district is hereby established in accordance\nwith Section 143-214.5 of the North Carolina General Statutes and this section.\n2. Purpose and Intent\nThe purpose of the Water Supply Watershed Protection Overlay (WPO) district is to ensure the\navailability of public water supplies at a safe and acceptable level of water quality. More specifically,\nthese standards are intended to:\na.\nEnsure compliance with all applicable State and federal laws governing the protection of water\nsupply watersheds;\nb. Protect those portions of designated water supply watersheds which lie closest to existing and\nproposed water supply reservoirs from activities which could degrade water quality in the\nreservoirs;\nC. Minimize pollution entering drinking water sources to assure the public health; and\nd. Encourage a low intensity of land development in the most sensitive portions of the water supply\nwatershed.\n3. Applicability\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\nExcept for development exempted in accordance with Section 3.20.F.4, Exemptions, the standards in\nthis section shall apply to all development on land located within the WPO as indicated on the Official\nZoning Map and North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality's Water Supply Watershed Map.\n4. Exemptions\nAn existing vacant lot owned by the same individual prior to the effective date of these WPO standards\nmay be developed for single-family residential purposes without complying with these standards.\n5. Effective Date\nThe standards in this section became effective on March 5, 1996.\n6. Watershed Areas Distinguished\na. The Lake Mackintosh Watershed is the only water supply watershed in the City's jurisdiction\nsubject to these standards, and it is divided into two distinct areas based on proximity to potable\nwater intake facilities that deliver water to the area. The two distinct areas are:\ni. The WS-IV-CA Watershed Critical Area (WCA); and\nii. The Balance of the Watershed (BOW).\nb. The WCA and BOW are depicted on the map entitled \"Watershed Protection Map of Burlington,\nNorth Carolina\", which is hereby adopted and incorporated by reference into these regulations.\nC. The Watershed Protection Map is on file and is available for public inspection in the offices of the\nPlanning Department during normal working hours.\nd. The WCA is closer to the water intake facility, and as such has more restrictive standards on\ndevelopment density and configuration.\n7. Procedures for Development\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\na.

Principal uses are the primary, permanent use types proposed on a lot (like a single-family home).\n2. Accessory uses are subordinate to the principal use located on the same lot (like a detached garage\nserving a single-family home).\n3. Temporary uses are uses allowed for a short duration of time (like a portable storage container used\nfor the purposes of storing or moving a household's belongings).\nB. CHAPTER ORGANIZATION\n1. Principal Uses\na.\nSection 4.2, Principal Uses, explains the use organization system and sets out the summary use\ntable, or the master listing of principal use types and the districts where they are allowed.\nIndividual principal use types are defined in Section 8.4, Definitions.\nb. Section 4.4, Use-Specific Standards, sets out the requirements for designated individual use types,\nregardless of the zoning district where it is located.\nC.\nSection 4.3, Prohibited Uses, identifies the use types that are prohibited throughout the City's\njurisdiction.\n2. Accessory Uses\nSection 4.5, Accessory Uses, sets out the general standards applicable to all accessory uses as well as\nany additional standards applicable to specific accessory uses.\n3. Temporary Uses\nSection 4.6, Temporary Uses, sets out the standards for temporary uses, including the districts where\nallowed, the maximum duration, and any additional standards applicable to specific temporary uses.\n4.2. PRINCIPAL USES\nA. USE ORGANIZATION SYSTEM\nIndividual uses of land, or use types, are organized into one of five use classifications as described below.\n1. Use Classifications\na. Use classifications are the top tier in the system and are the broadest groupings of land uses.\nThere are five use classifications used in this Ordinance:\ni. Residential uses;\nii. Institutional uses;\niii. Commercial uses;\niv. Industrial uses; and\nV. Agricultural uses;\nb.\nThe primary purpose of the use classifications is to serve as an organizing principal for\ndistinguishing between the different use types.\n2. Use Types\na. Use types are the specific individual uses included within a particular use classification.\nb. Individual use types are defined in Section 8.4, Definitions.\n3. Developments with Multiple Principal Uses\nDevelopments with multiple principal uses, such as shopping centers, shall incorporate only those use\ntypes allowed in the applicable zoning district.\nB. UNLISTED USES\nThe Planning Director shall determine whether or not an unlisted use is similar to an existing use type set\nout in Table 4.2.C, Principal Use Table, based on the definitions in Section 8.4, Definitions, and the\nstandards for unlisted uses in Section 2.4.F, Determination. Nothing shall limit the Planning Director from\nseeking input from City staff, Planning and Zoning Commission, or City Council in making a determination\nof how to categorize an unlisted use. In cases where a proposed unlisted use type is not found to be\nsimilar to an existing use type, the Planning Director may, but shall not be required to, initiate a text\nCity of Burlington\nUnified Development Ordinance\n4-2\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\n"}, {"page": "213", "text": "CHAPTER 4 USE STANDARDS\nSection 4.2 Principal Uses\namendment application to revise the text of this Ordinance to add the use type in accordance with Section\n2.4.W, Text Amendment.\nC.

SCREENING\nA. PURPOSE AND INTENT\n(AMENDED 1.4.22 UDOTA-1-22)\nThese standards are intended to reduce the visual and auditory impact upon adjacent lots and the public\nrealm from certain site features and activities occurring on individual non-residential, multi-family, single-\nfamily attached residential, and mixed-use lots. In addition to mitigating negative impacts, these standards\nare also proposed to enhance the aesthetics of development in the City's jurisdiction.\nB. USING THESE STANDARDS\n1. These standards identify a series of use types, site features, and activities that are required to be\nscreened from off-site views (see Section 5.4.C, Applicability, and Section 5.4.D, Exemptions).\n2. The standards establish a series of screening methods organized into differing levels (e.g., Level 1\nthrough Level 10). The higher the screening method's level number, the greater its opacity, or its\nability to obscure a particular site feature from off-site view (see Table 5.4, Screening Methods).\n3. The standards identify which methods of screening may be used to screen a site feature or activity\nfrom view from a particular location, such as an adjacent street or abutting lot with residential zoning\n(see Table 5.4.F: Views to be Screened). Nothing prohibits a landowner from using a more intense\nor opaque screening technique than is required by Table 5.4.F: Views to be Screened.\nC. APPLICABILITY\n1. Generally\n(AMENDED 3.17.20 UDOTA-02-20)\nUnless exempted in accordance with Section 5.4.D, Exemptions, the standards in this section apply to\nthe following site features and activities for all development in the City's jurisdiction:\na. Refuse collection containers of more than 100 gallons in size;\nb. Recycling containers of more than 100 gallons in size, including cardboard recycling containers;\nC. Waste and cardboard compactors;\nd.

Outdoor storage of raw or semi-finished materials, including tires;\ni.\nOutdoor storage of finished products for sale, including tires; and\nj.\nThe outdoor storage, repair, or impoundment of vehicles or equipment, whether operable,\ninoperable, or being used for parts.\n2. Pre-Existing Development\nLawfully-established development established prior to November 1, 2019, that is subject to, but that\ndoes not comply with these standards shall be subject to applicable the standards in CHAPTER 9.\nNONCONFORMITIES.\n3. Expansions or Remodeling\nAll expansions or remodeling of principal buildings or open uses of land existing on or before November\n1, 2019, shall comply with these standards, subject to the requirements in Section 9.6, Nonconforming\nSite Features.\nD. EXEMPTIONS\nThe following items are exempted from the screening requirements of this section:\n1.

SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DESIGN GUIDELINES\n1. Purpose and Intent\nThese residential design guidelines are proposed as ways to ensure that new single-family detached\nand duplex housing is high quality, aesthetically pleasing, and provides a wide variety of living options\nfor City residents. More specifically, these guidelines are intended to:\na. Ensure single-family detached and duplex homes maintain consistent exterior materials and\narchitectural treatments on the front and sides of buildings;\nb. Establish guidance regarding changes of exterior finishes and materials on individual facades;\nC. Avoid garage-dominated street fronts in residential neighborhoods;\nd. Encourage duplex structures to appear as single-family homes; and\ne. Ensure an adequate level of variability in single-family home design so as to avoid monotonous\nstreetscapes where every dwelling appears identical or very similar to its neighboring dwellings.\n2. Applicability\na. Single-family detached residential dwellings and duplex dwellings shall comply with these\nguidelines in the following instances:\ni. When proposed development is subject to a signed statement of consent in accordance with\nSection 5.5.E.3, Statement of Consent; and\nii. When compliance with these guidelines is included as a condition of approval associated with\na conditional rezoning (see Section 2.4.P, Rezoning).\nb.

STREET CLASSIFICATION\n1. All streets dedicated to public use shall be classified in accordance with Table 6.3.B: Street\nClassification.\nCity of Burlington\nUnified Development Ordinance\n6-8\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nTABLE 6.3.B: STREET CLASSIFICATION\nCELL (2, 1): \nSTREET TYPE [1] [2]\nCELL (2, 2): \nDESCRIPTION\nCELL (3, 1): \nInterstate\nCELL (3, 2): \nInterstates are the highest classification of arterials streets and are designed and\nare constructed with mobility and long-distance travel in mind. Access is\ncontrolled, intersections are grade-separated, and roadways are designed for\nhigh-speed travel. Roadways in this functional classification category connect the\nCity to other destinations in the State and connect major activity centers in the\nCity to one another. Interstates carry the highest traffic volumes.\nCELL (4, 1): \nPrincipal Arterial\nCELL (4, 2): \nThese streets provide a high degree of mobility both within the City's urban areas\nas well as through neighboring rural areas. While principal arterials do provide\ndirect access to adjacent land uses along their alignments, their primary function\nis to facilitate the movement of vehicles from one part of the City's jurisdiction to\nanother. Principal arterials are found in the most urban or intense parts of the\nCity and are generally not located within residential neighborhoods, office\ncenters, or industrial parks. Vehicles move at moderate speeds and four-way\nintersections are often signal-controlled. These streets include at-grade\nintersections with other streets, but driveways to individual lots are kept to a\nminimum. The average number of vehicles trips can vary widely based on the\nurban or rural location of an arterial street.\nCELL (5, 1): \nMinor Arterial\nCELL (5, 2): \nMinor arterial streets connect principal arterial streets to one another and provide\nfor vehicle trips of moderate length within geographic areas smaller than those\nserved by principal arterials. Minor arterials help to distribute vehicle trips across\nthe City and provide much more direct access to individual lots and land uses via\ndriveways. Normally, the spacing of arterial streets should not exceed one mile\nin fully developed areas.\nCELL (6, 1): \nMajor Collector\nCELL (6, 2): \nMajor collector streets gather traffic from local streets and funnel it to the arterial\nstreet network. They serve as traffic circulators as well as facilitators of direct\nvehicular access to individual land uses such as multi-family residential,\ncommercial, and industrial developments. Major collector streets may also serve\nlarger single-family residential neighborhoods. Most vehicular trips on a major\ncollector street are longer than three-quarters of a mile. Collector streets\naccommodate higher vehicle speeds than local streets and often have a blend of\nsignalized and non-signalized intersections in addition to individual driveways for\nlarger developments. In rural areas, major collectors often facilitate intra-county\ntravel of distances shorter than those typical to an arterial street.\nCELL (7, 1): \nMinor Collector\nCELL (7, 2): \nMinor collectors also gather or collect traffic from local streets and connect it with\nthe larger arterial street network. Most vehicular trips on minor collector streets\nare less than three-quarters of a mile. Typically, minor collector streets are\n"}, {"page": "421", "text": "CHAPTER 6 SUBDIVISIONS\nSection 6.3 Streets\nNOTES:\n[1] The classification shall be based upon the function of the street and projected volume of traffic to be\ncarried by the street, stated in terms of the number of trips per day.\n[2] The types of streets and their general locations are depicted on the Burlington-Graham Metropolitan\nPlanning Organization's Functional Classification Map, as amended.\n2.

FINDINGS\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\nThe City Council establishes this set of stormwater quality and quantity regulations to meet the\nrequirements of State and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge based on the\ndetermination that:\n1. Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increases\nstormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and\npoint source pollution, and sediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater\nrecharge;\n2. These changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants and\nalterations in hydrology which are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural\nenvironment;\n3.\nThese effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and well-planned controls to\nmanage stormwater runoff from development sites; and\n4.\nThe Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (\"Clean Water Act\") and federal Phase II Stormwater\nRules promulgated under it, as well as rules of the North Carolina Environmental Management\nCommission promulgated in response to federal Phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized\nareas, including this jurisdiction, to adopt the minimum stormwater controls such as those included in\nthis ordinance.\nC. PURPOSE AND INTENT\n(AMENDED 10.20.20 UDOTA-03-20)\nThe purpose of this section is to protect, maintain, and enhance the public health, safety, environment,\nand general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects\nof increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with\nnew development and redevelopment as well as illicit discharges into municipal separate stormwater\nsystems. It has been determined that proper management of construction related stormwater and post-\ndevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure;\nsafeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare; and protect water resources and the aquatic\nenvironment. These standards seek to meet the general purpose through the following specific objectives\nand means:\n1. Establish decision-making processes for development that protect the integrity of watersheds and\npreserve the health of water resources;\n2. Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response\nin their post-development state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce\nflooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream\ntemperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;\nCity of Burlington\nUnified Development Ordinance\n7-32\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\n"}, {"page": "479", "text": "CHAPTER 7 ENVIRONMENT\nSection 7.4 Stormwater\n3.

Encourage the use of best management and site design practices, such as the use of vegetated\nconveyances for stormwater and the preservation of greenspace, riparian buffers, and other\nconservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable;\n6. Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural and\nnonstructural SCMs to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately,\nand pose no threat to public safety;\n7. Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of\nstormwater management plans, for the inspection of approved projects, and to assure appropriate\nlong-term maintenance;\n8. Require site design plans that include open space and natural areas in accordance with this section\nand the City's adopted policy guidance;\n9.

BASIC CONTROL OBJECTIVES\nAn erosion and sedimentation control plan may be disapproved if the Plan fails to address the following\ncontrol objectives:\n1. Identify Critical Areas\nOn-site areas which are subject to severe erosion, and off-site areas which are especially vulnerable\nto damage from erosion or sedimentation, are to be identified and receive special attention.\n2. Limit Time of Exposure\nAll land-disturbing activities are to be planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible\ntime.\n3. Limit Exposed Areas\nAll land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to minimize the size of the area to be\nexposed at any one time.\n4. Control Surface Water\nSurface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas should be controlled to reduce erosion and\nsediment loss during the period of exposure.\n5. Control Sedimentation\nAll land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted so as to prevent off-site sedimentation\ndamage.\n6. Manage Storm Water Runoff\nWhen the increase in the velocity of storm water runoff resulting from a land-disturbing activity is\nsufficient to cause accelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse, a Plan is to include measures to\ncontrol the velocity to the point of discharge so as to minimize accelerated erosion of the site\nand\nincreased sedimentation of the stream.\nF.

Innovative techniques and ideas will be considered and may be used when\nshown to have the potential to produce successful results. Some alternatives, while not exhaustive,\nare to:\na. Avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including measures to promote infiltration\nto compensate for increased runoff from areas rendered impervious;\nb. Avoid increases in stormwater discharge velocities by using vegetated or roughened swales and\nwaterways in place of closed drains and high velocity paved sections;\nC. Provide energy dissipators at outlets of storm drainage facilities to reduce flow velocities to the\npoint of discharge;\nd. Protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving cross sections or providing\nerosion-resistant lining; and\ne. Upgrade or replace the receiving device structure, or watercourse such that it will receive and\nconduct the flow to a point where it is no longer subject to degradation from the increased rate\nof flow or increased velocity.\n5.

SUSTAINABILITY INCENTIVES\nA. HOW TO USE THESE INCENTIVES\nThese sustainable development incentives are intended to reward applicants and forms of development\nthat are configured in ways that conserve resources or are better able to withstand damaging natural\nhazards. Rewards take the form of increased maximum residential densities, increased maximum building\nheights, or reductions from other kinds of development standards such as required off-street parking or\nmaximum sign face area.\n1. Applicants seeking to take advantage of these sustainable development incentives should first\nunderstand the type of incentives available in accordance with Section 7.6.D, Type of Incentives.\n2. Once the preferred type of incentive(s) is determined, an applicant should review Section 7.6.E,\nProcedure, in order to determine the minimum number and type(s) of sustainable development\npractices required to take advantage of the desired incentive(s).\n3. Each type of incentive requires provision of one or more types of sustainable development practice\nfrom each of two different schedules (Schedule A and Schedule B).\n4. The sustainable development practices are listed, by schedule type, in Table 7.6.F, Menu of\nSustainable Development Practices.\n5.\nThe types of sustainable development practices to be provided are at the applicant's discretion, but\nthe minimum number of practices from each schedule must be provided in order to benefit from a\nsustainable development incentive. Nothing shall limit the City Council from including a condition of\napproval that specifies the use of one or more particular types of sustainable development practice\nshould an applicant decide to pursue a sustainable development incentive.\n6. Site plans, subdivision plats, and other application materials shall identify the type(s) of incentives\nsought and the sustainable development practices provided.\nB. PURPOSE AND INTENT\nIn an effort to encourage sustainable development practices as a means of addressing climate change and\nthe need for more resilient development practices, the protection of natural resources, and ensuring a\nhigh quality of life for future City residents, the UDO provides the following sustainable development\npractice incentives.\nC. APPLICABILITY\nThe incentives included in this section are available to new development in the residential, commercial,\nindustrial, and planned development districts.\nD. TYPE OF INCENTIVES\n1. Development integrating sustainable development practices in accordance with the provisions of this\nsection shall be eligible for the following incentives:\na. A density bonus of up to one additional dwelling unit per acre beyond the maximum allowed in\nthe base zoning district, based on the land's designation in the Comprehensive Plan;\nb. An increase in the maximum allowable height by up to one story or ten feet beyond the maximum\nallowed in the base zoning district, with approval of the Fire Marshal;\nC. A modification to the off-street parking requirements resulting in a reduction from the minimum\nrequirements by 15 percent, or an increase to the maximum allowable number of spaces provided\nby 15 percent (without an alternative parking plan); or\nd. An increase in the maximum allowable sign area or maximum height for wall or freestanding signs\nby 10 percent.\n2. Development may include a sufficient number of sustainable development practices to take advantage\nof more than one type of incentive, but in no instance shall the amount of an incentive be increased\nor decreased (as appropriate) beyond the maximum listed in this sub-section.\nE. PROCEDURE\n1. Development seeking to use incentives shall include a written request with the development\napplication that identifies the type of sustainable development practice proposed and demonstrates\nhow compliance with the standards will be achieved.\n2. Review for compliance with this section, and granting of requests in accordance with this section shall\noccur during review of a site plan, subdivision, planned development master plan, special use permit,\nCity of Burlington\nUnified Development Ordinance\n7-61\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\n"}, {"page": "508", "text": "CHAPTER 7 ENVIRONMENT\nSection 7.6 Sustainability Incentives\nor building permit, as appropriate. The review authority responsible for review of the development\napplication shall also be responsible for the review of sustainable development incentive request.\n3. Approval of use of a particular incentive shall be based on the number of sustainable development\npractices provided, in accordance with Table 7.6.E, Sustainable Development Practice Incentives, and\nTable 7.6.F, Menu of Sustainable Development Practices. To obtain the right to a particular incentive,\ndevelopment shall provide the minimum number associated of sustainable development practices from\nboth schedule A and schedule B in the table below.\n4. In cases where a proposed development seeks to combine two or more development incentives, the\nminimum number of required sustainable development practices for each individual incentive shall be\nprovided.\nNOTES:\n[1] All zoning district dimensional requirements still apply.\n[2] Zoning district dimensional requirements may be reduced in accordance with the standards and procedures for an\nAdministrative Adjustment.\nF. MENU OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES\nOne or more of the sustainable development practices in Table 7.6.F, Menu of Sustainable Development\nPractices, may be offered by an applicant for proposed development in accordance with Table 7.6.E,\nSustainable Development Practice Incentives. An applicant may suggest a practice not listed, which shall\nbe considered by the Technical Review Committee as part of review.\nCity of Burlington\nUnified Development Ordinance\n7-62\nNorth

RULES OF MEASUREMENT\nA. PURPOSE\nThe purpose of this section is to clarify the rules of measurement and exemptions that apply to all principal\nand accessory uses allowed in this Ordinance. These standards may be modified by other applicable\nsections of this Ordinance.\nB. MEASUREMENTS, GENERALLY\n1. Straight Lines\nUnless otherwise stated in this Ordinance, distances specified in this Ordinance are to be measured\nas the length of an imaginary straight line joining two points.\n2. Rounding\nAll calculations that result in a fractional unit or part of a whole number, the number shall be rounded\nup to the next highest whole number, unless otherwise provided in this section or elsewhere in this\nOrdinance.\n3. Irregular Shapes\nIn cases where an irregular shape complicates the application of these standards, the Planning Director\nshall determine the applicable dimensional, setback, or bulk standards in accordance with the\nstandards in this section and Section 2.4.F, Determination.\n4. Separation\na. Lot to Lot\nWhen the provisions of this Ordinance require separation between two or more lots, or a lot and\nanother feature, separation shall be measured by drawing straight lines from the nearest point of\none lot line to the nearest point of the lot line subject to the separation requirement (see Figure\n8.3.B.4: Separation).\nb. Use Type to Use Type\nWhen the provisions of this Ordinance require one use type to be separated from another use\ntype, separation shall be measured by drawing straight lines from the nearest point of the wall of\none existing or proposed principal structure to the nearest point of the wall of another existing or\nproposed structure subject to the separation requirement.\nFIGURE 8.3.B.4: SEPARATION\nLEGEND\nA\nLot-to-Lot Separation\nB\nUse Type-to-Use Type\nSeparation\nB\nLot Line\n5. Abutting versus Adjacent\na. Abutting\nThe term abutting describes a condition where two or more features (a lot line, building, driveway,\netc.) are immediately beside or next to one another either on the same lot or on different lots\nsharing a common lot line.\nCity of Burlington\n8-7\nUnified Development Ordinance\nNorth Carolina\nLast Updated 9.19.23\n"}, {"page": "520", "text": "CHAPTER 8 MEASUREMENT AND DEFINITIONS\nSection 8.3 Rules of Measurement\nb. Adjacent\nThe term adjacent describes a condition where two or more similar features (a lot line, building,\nuse type, structure, site feature, etc.) are proximate to one another, but are separated by some\nform of intervening feature, such as a street, alley, water feature, railroad, lot or property under\nseparate ownership, or natural feature of sufficient size so as to prevent direct site visibility or\nimpede the movement of sound from one feature to another.\nC. LOT DIMENSIONS\n1. Lot Measurements\na. Acreage\nThe total number or gross number of acres on a tract or site.\nb. Lot Depth\nThe dimension measured from the front of the lot to the extreme rear line of the lot. In case of\nirregularly shaped lots, the mean depth shall be taken.\nC. Lot Width\nThe width of a lot is measured at right angles to its depth at the edge of the street setback or at\na proposed building setback line, whichever is further from the street right-of-way.\nd. Minimum Lot Area\nThe minimum amount of required land area, measured horizontally, that must be included within\nthe lines of a lot (see Figure 8.3.C.1.d: Lot Measurement). Lands located within any private\neasements shall be included within the lot area.\ne. Street Frontage\nThe length of the lot line of a single lot abutting a public or existing private street right-of-way.\n2. Lot Lines\nA lot line is a line of record bounding a lot which separates one lot from another lot or separates that\nlot from a public or private street or any other public space (see Figure 8.3.C.2: Lot Lines).
