Farmland is a defining\nelement of Coats's traditional identity and the protection of these lands aids in preserving\nthe character of the Town until such time as new development is preferred by the Town.\nListed uses are limited, with an emphasis on uses that are agricultural in nature.\nThe Single-Family Residential Districts (SFR-1, SFR-2 and SFR-3) provide for the\ncompletion of existing residential neighborhoods and the development of new residential\nneighborhoods. Allowed building/lot types in the Single-Family Districts are Detached\nHouse. Listed uses are restricted to Single-Family, including duplex (two-family), homes\nand their accessory uses. Neighborhoods in these districts are the dominant land use in\nCoats and are a major element in defining the character of the community. Standards for\nthe Single-Family Residential Districts promote that new development maintains the\ncharacter of the community. The Single-Family Residential Districts permit the\ncompletion and conformity of conventional residential subdivisions already existing or\napproved in sketch plan form by the Town of Coats prior to the effective date of these\nregulations.\nThe Residential Main Street Transition District (RMST) provides for the completion of\nresidential neighborhoods in the residential area(s) surrounding the Main Street and\ncontiguous Civic Districts through in-fill development. The intent of this district is to\nrecognize that gradual transformation of existing development to high quality mixed\ndensity residential development is needed to support the central core of the Town.\nHigher density residential development allows a greater number of households to walk or\nbike, thus supporting businesses while reducing the parking demand and providing\nenvironmental and health benefits. Allowed building/lot types in these districts are the\nDetached House, Attached House, and Multi-family Building. Streets in the Residential\nMain Street Transition District should be interconnected, with streets and sidewalks\nproviding a connection from Coats's Main Street and other mixed-use districts to the\nSingle-Family Residential districts surrounding these neighborhoods. A range of housing\ntypes is encouraged. Criteria for the mix of building types establishes compatibility.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 2\n"}, {"page": "133", "text": "The Main Street District (MS) and Main Street Periphery District (MSP) provides for\nnew development, revitalization, reuse, and infill development in Coats's core\ndowntown. A broad array of uses is listed to enable the needs of residents and visitors to\nbe met. Allowed building/lot types in this district are Urban Workplace, Shop-front,\nDetached House, Attached House, Multi-family Building, and Civic Building. The\ndevelopment pattern seeks to integrate shops, restaurants, services, workplaces, civic,\neducational, and higher density housing in a compact, pedestrian-oriented\nenvironment. The Main Street District serves as the hub of the surrounding\nneighborhoods and of the broader community while the Main Street Periphery District\nsupports the natural expansion of the Main Street District. The Main Street District and\nMain Street Periphery District (MSP) may be expanded over time to meet the needs of\nthe growing community for downtown facilities and services. Expansion of the Main\nStreet District and Main Street Periphery District shall be contiguous and not separated\nfrom the primary district area.\nThe Civic District (CIV) provides a location for educational, medical, governmental,\nreligious, and other institutional uses. Large developments in the Civic District are\nencouraged to provide a master plan to the Town. Institutional uses in the Civic District\nare required to provide pedestrian connections on their campuses and, to the extent\npossible, develop an internal street system with structures fronting on the streets. Parking\nshould not be the dominant visible element of the campuses developed for institutional\nuses. Providing a unique district for civic uses will establish uniform standards.\nThe Mixed-Use Districts (MU-1 and MU-2) are established to provide opportunities for\nboth compatible and sustainable re-development where underutilized commercial\nproperties already exist as well as infill sites where site specific land planning of new\ndevelopment creates opportunities for businesses and various housing designs sharing\ncommunity amenities and enhancements. Existing auto-oriented street, lot, and building\ndesigns can create uncomfortable pedestrian environments; however, with careful site\nplanning these areas will allow a greater number of residents to walk or bike to\nbusinesses and services with an interconnected network of streets and sidewalks.\nAllowed building/lot types are Highway Commercial, Urban Workplace, Shop-front,\nDetached House, Attached House, and Multi-family. Dominant uses in this district are\nresidential, retail and office. The Mixed-Use Districts are expected to serve Coats\nresidents as well as persons who travel from surrounding communities. The development\npattern in this district acknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access\nprovided to promote safety for the motoring public.

A TND is urban in form, is typically an extension of\nthe existing developed area of the Town and has an overall residential density of up to\neleven (11) dwelling units per acre. TNDO districts should have a significant portion of\nland dedicated to improved open spaces, and reserve un-improved open spaces where\nenvironmentally sensitive areas are located.\nThe Scenic Corridor Overlay District (SCO) is established to protect the pastoral scenes\nand open spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and visitors traveling the\nmajor entrance roads and gateways to the Town. The pastoral scenes and undeveloped\nproperty along the entrance roads and gateways contribute significantly to Coats's\ncommunity character and sense of place. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District provides\ndevelopment options for the owners of the property abutting the entrance roads and\ngateways. The goal of this district is to protect the scenic value of the corridors through a\nmix of incentives and development standards. These standards will preserve the\nsuburban character of the Town by maintaining the sense of a suburban corridor in an\nurban environment; provide an aesthetically appealing experience for those traveling the\ncorridor; provide multi-modal transportation options for travel; and promote a safe\ntransportation corridor for motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians.\nThe Heavy Industry Overlay District (HIO) is established to protect all environments\nfrom the negative impacts of certain activities and types of development.

The Scenic Corridor Overlay District (SCO) is established to protect the\npastoral scenes and open spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and\nvisitors traveling the major entrance roads and gateways to the Town. The pastoral\nscenes and undeveloped property along the entrance roads and gateways contribute\nsignificantly to Coats's community character and sense of place. The Scenic\nCorridor Overlay District provides development options for the owners of the\nproperty abutting the entrance roads and gateways. The goal of this district is to\nprotect the scenic value of the corridors through a mix of incentives and\ndevelopment standards. These standards will preserve the suburban character of\nthe Town by maintaining the sense of a suburban corridor in an urban\nenvironment; provide an aesthetically appealing experience for those traveling the\ncorridor; provide multi-modal transportation options for travel; and promote a safe\ntransportation corridor for motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians.\n(B.) Types. Three (3) types of scenic corridors are hereby created:\n(1.) Suburban Scenic Corridor - A corridor along which development is limited,\nconsisting largely of fields, pastures, and scattered residential uses. The\nsuburban scenic corridor evokes a sense of traveling through an undeveloped\narea, with pastoral scenes and a sense of being removed from the urban\nenvironment.\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 28\n"}, {"page": "159", "text": "(2.) Gateway Scenic Corridor - A corridor that serves as an entrance way to a\nplace that is unique and different from other communities in the area. The\ngateway corridor provides a sense of arrival to a place that is special and\ndifferent from the typical places. The gateway scenic corridor may be more\ndeveloped than the suburban scenic corridor, but the character of the\ndevelopment is such that those using the corridor are aware they are in a\nspecial place.\n(3.) Bypass Scenic Corridor - A corridor providing for buffering of the Bypass to\nprotect the traffic carrying capacity of the road and to provide for a pleasant\nexperience for motorists using the bypass. The bypass scenic corridor\nrequires an undeveloped setback from the bypass, promoting that the bypass\nthrough Coats is unique and portrays the character of the community while\nenhancing the safety of motorists using the road.\n(C.) General Standards & Specifications:\n(1.) Development Pattern. Building placement, parking placement, building type,\nurban form, access, and lot arrangement shall be controlled by the lot and\nbuilding type standards (Article 9) for the lot and building types listed in the\nScenic Corridor Overlay District.\n(2.) Activities Listed in the Scenic Corridor. In order to preserve the aesthetic\nquality of the scenic corridors, uses and activities within the designated scenic\ncorridors shall be limited to the following:\n(a.) The scenic corridor easement may be used for passive recreation,\nagricultural uses, and equestrian uses. No other use shall be listed within\nthe scenic corridor easement.\n(b.) No building construction, parking, land disturbing activity, signs, tree\nremoval, lighting (other than street lighting provided by the Town of Coats\nand driveway or private road lighting provided that said lighting is\nprovided by full cutoff fixtures), or other development activity shall occur\nwithin the scenic corridor easement except as follows:\n(i.) A bikeway, greenway, and/or other pedestrian/bicycle facility may be\nlocated within the scenic corridor easement.\n(ii.) Underground utilities and easements for underground utilities may be\nlocated within the scenic easement, provided that no above ground\ntransmission or other equipment is located within the scenic easement.\n(iii.) Buildings used primarily for agricultural and/or equestrian related\nactivities may be built in the scenic corridor easement upon approval\nby the Town Board of Commissioners as a Special Use. Parking shall\nbe located behind the building, shall not be located within the scenic\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 29\n"}, {"page": "160", "text": "easement, and shall be buffered from the scenic corridor.

The building's visual impact on the scenic corridor;\n2. The building's size;\n3. The compatibility of the building's architecture with community\ncharacter and the purposes of the scenic corridor overlay district.\n(3.) Scenic Corridor Dimensions. The designated scenic corridors shall meet the\nfollowing dimensional standards:\n(a.) The width of the scenic easement within the Suburban Scenic Corridor\nshall be 10% of the lot depth but no more than 100 feet from the edge of\nthe public right-of-way. The Planning, Zoning & Subdivision\nAdministrator may require an additional scenic depth of up to 50 feet in\norder to preserve structures and/or vegetation deemed to be significant.\n(b.) The width of the scenic easement within the Gateway Scenic Corridor\nshall be 10% of the lot depth but no more than 50 feet from the edge of the\nhighway right-of-way. The Planning, Zoning & Subdivision\nAdministrator may require an additional depth of up to 25 feet in order to\npreserve structures and/or vegetation deemed to be significant.\n(c.) The width of the scenic easement within the Bypass Scenic Corridor shall\nbe 10% of the lot depth but no more than 75 feet from the edge of the\npublic right-of-way. The Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator\nmay require an additional depth of up to 25 feet in order to preserve\nstructures and/or vegetation deemed to be significant.\n(4.) Scenic Corridor Provisions. The following provisions shall govern\ndevelopment within a designated scenic corridor:\n(a.) The area within the scenic easement may be dedicated to the Town as a\nconservation easement, provided it meets the standards for such an\neasement as established by applicable state and federal standards.\n(b.) Development density shall be calculated for the entire property, including\nthe area within the scenic easement, with the exception that development\ndensity bonuses of up to 50 percent are given for the portion of the\nproperty within the scenic easement. In the event that the property owner\nprovides a scenic easement wider than required by this ordinance, the\ndensity bonus may be increased up to 75% for the area located within the\nscenic easement.\nFor example, the Jones family own a 10-acre property zoned Single-Family\nResidential (SFR). Two (2) acres of the property are within the Scenic\nCorridor Overlay. The density is calculated as follows:\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 30\n"}, {"page": "161", "text": "Base density @ 3 units/acre X 10 acres = 30 units\n50% density bonus for 2 acres in scenic corridor easement\n50% of (2 acres X 3 units/acre) = 3-unit bonus\nTotal Density = 33units\nIf the Jones provide an easement wider than required, then they would receive a\n75% density bonus for the area within the easement:\nBase density @ 3units/acre X 10 acres = 30 units\n75% density bonus for 2 acres with wider easement\n75% of (2 acres X 3 units/acre) = 4.5-unit bonus\nTotal Density = 35 units\n(c.) Development may be clustered on the portion of the property located\noutside the scenic easement.\n(5.) Curb Cuts. There shall be a minimum separation of 500' between curb cuts\nin the suburban scenic corridors. This separation requirement may be waived\nby the Planning, Zoning & Subdivision Administrator if the width of the\nproperty frontage would preclude a second curb cut meeting this spacing\nrequirement.\n(6.) Lot Standards & Specifications. The lot type standards and building type\nstandard listed in the underlying district, as set forth in section 8.4 and further\ndescribed in Article 9, shall apply in the Scenic Corridor Overlay District.\n(D.) Open Space. The provision and design of open space shall comply with the\nrequirements set forth in Article 21. Land within the scenic easement may count\nfor up to 100% of the minimum open space required by Article 21 of this\nOrdinance.\n(E.) Parking & Landscaping. Parking shall comply with the requirements set forth in\nArticle 12. Landscaping shall comply with the requirements set forth in Article 11.\n(This space left blank intentionally.)\nCoats Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 31\n"}, {"page": "162", "text": "8.5-3 Heavy Industry Overlay (HIO)\n(A.)
