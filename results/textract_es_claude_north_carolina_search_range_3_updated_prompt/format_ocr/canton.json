Such notice shall include a description of the variance being requested. Local government or\nother entities receiving notice of the variance request may submit comments to the Administrator\nprior to a decision by the Zoning Board of Adjustment. Such comments shall become part of the\nrecord of proceedings of the Board.\n(3) An Equitable Density Credit (EDC) variance may be granted in mountainous watersheds\nwhere portion of the total tract acreage is greater than 30% slope. Higher density development may\nbe granted on portions of total tract acreage less than 30% slope. The Soil Conservation Service or\na certified surveyor must determine the portions of acreage greater than or less than 30% slope.\nEDC is equal to the number of additional dwellings (du) or equivalent impervious area that may be\nbuilt upon that portion of the tract that is less than 30% slope. Where the EDC variance is granted,\nthe remaining portion of the tract greater than 30% slope must remain undeveloped and retained in\nits natural vegetation cover. This latter environment produces high quality water in orographic\nwatersheds, which compensates for granting higher densities elsewhere.\nFormula:\nEDC = No. acres in tract greater than 30% slope\n(1 du/2 ac)\nThe total EDC or equivalent impervious area may be applied at the property owner's discretion, to\nincrease density on the remaining portion of the tract with less than 30% slope. However, the\ngranted additional density can be no greater than 1 du/ac or 12% impervious area/ac for both\nresidential and nonresidential development. Stormwater controls may be required on some sites. In\naddition, the Town of Canton shall notify and allow a reasonable comment period for all other local\ngovernments having jurisdiction in the designated watershed where the variance is being\nconsidered.\nExamples:\nProperty owner \"A\" has a 150 acre mountainous tract. A survey reveals that 50 acres are greater\nthan 30% slope, and the remaining 100 acres are less than 30% slope.\nEDC = 50ac = 25 du\n1 du/1 ac\nThe additional 25 du or equivalent impervious area may be added to the remaining 100 acres that\nare less than 30% slope.\n49 of 78\n1/4/2024, 1:05 PM\n"}, {"page": "50", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/ac197d88-61c0-406c-a8.\nProperty owner \"B\" has a 3.7 acre tract. A survey reveals that 1.9 acres are greater than 30%\nslope and the remaining 1.8 acres are less than 30% slope.\nEDC = 1.9ac = .95 du\n1 du/2 ac\nThe equivalent impervious area of 0.9 du may be added to the remaining 1.8 acres, which\nalready qualify for a ratio proportion (1 du/2ac) of 0.90 du or equivalent impervious area. Thus,\nproperty owner \"B\" qualifies for a total of 1.85 du or equivalent impervious are to be built upon the\nremaining 1.8 acres less than 30% slope. However, since a variance cannot be granted for greater\nthan I du/ac, only a total of 1.80 du or equivalent impervious area can be built upon the remaining\n1.8 acres less than 30% slope.\n(4) If the application calls for the granting of a major variance, and if the Zoning Board of\nAdjustment decides in favor of granting the variance, the Board shall prepare a preliminary record\nof the hearing with all deliberate speed. The preliminary record of the hearing shall include:\n- the variance application;\n- the hearing notices;\n- the evidence presented;\n-\nmotions, offers of proof, objections to evidence and rulings on them;\n-\nproposed findings and exceptions; and\n- the proposed decision, including all conditions proposed to be added to the permit.\nThe preliminary record shall be sent to the Environ-Management Commission for its review as\nfollows:\n(a) If the Commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance qualifies as a\nmajor variance and that 1) the property owner can secure no reasonable return from, nor make any\npractical use of the property unless the proposed variance is granted, and 2) the variance, if\ngranted, will not result in a serious threat to the water supply, then the Commission shall approve\nthe variance as proposed or approved the proposed variance with conditions and stipulations. The\nCommission shall prepare a Commission decision and send it to the Zoning Board of Adjustment.\nIf\nthe Commission approves the variance with conditions and stipulations, the Board shall prepare a\nfinal decision, including such conditions and stipulations, granting the proposed variance.\n(b) If the Commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance qualifies as a\nmajor variance and that 1) the property owner can secure a reasonable return from or make a\npractical use of the property without the variance, or 2) the variance, if granted, will result in a\nserious threat to the water supply, then the Commission shall deny approval of the variance as\nproposed. The Commission shall prepare a Commission decision and send it to the Zoning Board\nof Adjustment.

In that case, enforcement\nproceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If\nenforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request for an\nexpedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after\nsuch a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a development\napproval or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the development\nregulation shall not stay the further review of an application for development approvals to use such\nproperty; in these situations the appellant or local government may request and the Board may\ngrant a stay of a final decision of development approval applications, including building permits\naffected by the issue appealed.\n(b) Special use permits.

The Zoning Board of Adjustment must not impose conditions on special use permits that\nthe local government does not otherwise have statutory authority to impose. Further, the Board\nshall obtain the landowner's and/or applicant's written consent to the conditions related to any\nspecial use permit granted under these regulations.\n(5) The Zoning Board of Adjustment may provide that defined minor modifications to special use\npermits, that do not involve a change in uses permitted or the density of overall development\npermitted, may be reviewed and approved administratively (Section 9-4097(b)). Any other\nmodification or revocation of a special use permit shall follow the same process for approval as is\napplicable to the approval of a special use permit. Any modifications approved shall only be\napplicable to those properties whose applicants/landowners provide written consent for the\nmodification.\n(c) Variances. To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variances from the terms of the\nchapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal\nenforcement of the provisions of the chapter will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or\nunnecessary hardship; so that the spirit of the chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare\nsecured, and substantial justice done.\n(1) The existence of a nonconforming use of neighboring land, building, or structures in the\nsame district or of permitted or nonconforming uses in other districts shall not constitute a reason\nfor the requested variance. The fact that property may be utilized more profitably will not be\nconsidered adequate to justify the Board in granting a variance.\n(2) The variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding\nby the Board of Adjustment that all of the following conditions exist:\na. There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular place or\nproperty in question because of its size, shape, or topography that are not applicable to other lands\nor structures in the same district.\nb.

The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter and will\nnot be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare.\ne. The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant or the property\nowner.\nf.\nThe variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the\nland, building, or structure.\ng.
