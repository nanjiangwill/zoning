investment, and general\nwelfare of the citizens and residents of Bessemer City and its extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ). It is a\ncomprehensive, unified set of regulations that govern the subdivision of land, the development of land, and\nthe use of land.\n1.2 AUTHORITY\nThe Bessemer City LDC is hereby adopted under the authority and provisions in 160D-101 of the North\nCarolina General Statutes. Whenever any provision of this appendix refers to or cites a section of the\nN.C.G.S. and that section is later amended or superseded, the appendix shall be deemed amended to refer\nto the amended section or the section that most nearly corresponds to the superseded section.\n1.3 TITLE\nThis Code is officially titled as the \"Land Development Code of the City of Bessemer City, North Carolina,\"\nand shall be known as the \"LDC.\"\n1.4 JURISDICTION\nThe Bessemer City LDC shall be effective throughout the City of Bessemer City and its extraterritorial\nplanning jurisdiction (ETJ) exercised by Code and denoted on the Zoning Map. The planning jurisdiction of\nthe City may be modified from time to time in accordance with 160D-202 of the N.C.G.S.\n1.5\nCONFORMANCE TO LDC PROVISIONS\n1.5.A CONFORMANCE IN GENERAL\nFrom and after the adoption of the LDC, no real property lying within the jurisdiction of the LDC\nshall be subdivided except in conformance with all applicable provisions of the LDC. In addition,\nafter the effective date of the LDC, no plat for subdivision of land within the jurisdiction of the\nLDC shall be certified for recording by the Administrator, and the Clerk of Superior Court shall\nnot order the recording of a plat until it has been submitted and approved in accordance with\nthe provisions of the LDC.\nFurthermore, no land or structure shall be used or occupied, and no structure or parts shall be\nconstructed, erected, altered, or moved, unless in conformity with all the regulations herein\nspecified for the zoning district in which it is located. Every building erected, moved, or\nstructurally altered shall be located on a lot conforming to the requirements of the district.\nBESSEMER CITY LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE (LDO|1\n"}, {"page": "7", "text": "1.5.B EXEMPTIONS FOR BONA FIDE FARMS\n1. As established by House Bill 168 (Session Law 2011-363), property that is used\nfor bona fide farm purposes within Bessemer City's Extra Territorial Jurisdiction (ETJ) shall\nbe exempt from the provisions of this Code. For the purpose of applying exemptions\nto bona fide farms, \"property\" means a single tract of property or an identifiable portion of\na single tract. To determine whether a property is being used for bona fide farm purposes,\nrefer to the definition for \"Bona Fide Farm\" contained in Chapter 10.\n2.\nAs permitted under Senate Bill 263 (Session 2011), an accessory building of a \"bona fide\nfarm\" within the City of Bessemer City's zoning jurisdiction has the same exemption from\nthe building code as it would have under county zoning as provided by 160D-903 of the\nNorth Carolina General Statutes.\n1.6 NONCONFORMITIES UNDER PRIOR ORDINANCE\nAny nonconformity under the previous Unified Development Ordinance will also be a nonconformity under\nthis Code, if the circumstances that resulted in the nonconforming status under the\nprevious Ordinance continues to exist. If a nonconformity under the previous Ordinance becomes\nconforming because of the adoption of this Code, then the nonconformity will cease to exist.\n1.7\nUSES AND STRUCTURES RENDERED NONCONFORMING\n1. When a lot is used for a purpose that was a lawful use before the effective date of\nthis Code, and this Code no longer classifies such use as either a permitted use or special\nuse in the zoning district in which it is located, such use shall be considered nonconforming\nand shall be controlled by the provisions of Chapter 8 of this Code.\n2. Where any building, structure, or lot that legally existed on the effective date of\nthis Code does not meet all standards set forth in this Code, such building, structure, or lot\nshall be considered nonconforming and shall be controlled by the provisions of\nChapter 8 of this Code.\n1.8 CONFLICT WITH OTHER LAWS\n1. It is not intended that this Code repeal, supersede, annul, impair, or interfere with any\nexisting easements, private agreements, vested rights or building permits previously\nadopted or issued pursuant to law and currently effective.\n2. All existing lots of record, platted prior to the adoption of this Code and upon which no\nbuildings have been erected, shall be grandfathered upon the date of adoption of\nthis Code and shall not be subject to the new lot standards herein. However, buildings upon\nsuch lots shall be subject to standards in this Code.\n3. Should the courts declare any section or provisions of this Chapter invalid, such decision\nshall not affect the validity of the Chapter as a whole or any part thereof, other than the\npart so declared to be invalid.\nBESSEMER CITY LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE (LDO|2\n"}, {"page": "8", "text": "1.9\nOFFICIAL ZONING MAP\nThe official zoning map of the City dated 2017 is hereby replaced with the digital, \"Official Zoning Map of\nthe City of Bessemer City, dated MONTH, DAY YEAR,\" a copy of which is on file for public review at City\nHall. A copy of any state or federal map which is hereby incorporated by reference into the zoning map,\nshall be maintained by the City.\n1.10 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN\nAs a condition of adopting and applying zoning regulations under N.C.G.S 160D-501, the City shall adopt\nand reasonably maintain a comprehensive plan that sets forth goals, policies, and programs intended to\nguide the present and future physical, social, and economic development of the jurisdiction. Plans shall be\nadopted by the City Council with the advice and consultation of the Planning Board. Adoption and\namendment of a comprehensive plan is a legislative decision and shall follow the process mandated for\nzoning text amendments set by G.S. 160D-601. Plans adopted under this Chapter shall be advisory in\nnature. Plans adopted under this Chapter shall be considered by the planning board and governing board\nwhen considering proposed amendments to zoning regulations as required by G.S. 160D-604 and G.S.\n160D-605. If a plan is deemed amended by G.S. 160D-605 by virtue of adoption of a zoning amendment\nthat is inconsistent with the plan, that amendment shall be noted in the plan.\n1.11\nEFFECTIVE DATE\nThese regulations shall become effective on MONTH DAY, YEAR. Upon adoption, these regulations shall\nsupersede, repeal, and replace the Bessemer City Land Development Code, as made effective on August\n13, 2007.\n1.12 VIOLATIONS CONTINUE\nAny violation of provisions existing on the effective date of this Code shall continue to be a violation under\nthis Code and be subject to penalties and enforcement under Chapter 9, unless the use, development,\nconstruction, or other activity complies with the provisions of this Code.\n1.13 LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES\nThis Code shall not be construed to hold the City or its authorized representatives responsible for any\ndamage to persons or property by reason of the inspection or reinspection authorized in this Code, or for\nany actions taken by landowners or developers to comply with the procedures or standards of this Code.\n1.14 VALIDITY AND SEVERABILITY\nIt is the legislative intent of the City Council in adopting this Code that all provisions shall be liberally\nconstrued to protect and preserve the health, safety, investment, and general welfare of the inhabitants of\nthe City. If any Section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this Code is, for any reason, held by a\ncourt of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining\nportions of this Code. The City Council hereby declares that it would have passed this Code and\nany\nSection, subsection, sentence, clause, and phrase, thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more\nSections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases be declared invalid.\nBESSEMER CITY LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE (LDO|3\n"}, {"page": "9", "text": "2\nDISTRICTS AND USES\n2.1 GENERAL\nAs authorized by N.C.G.S. 160D-703.(a), Bessemer City may divide its territorial jurisdiction into zoning\ndistricts, best suited to carry out the purposes set forth in this Code.\n2.2 ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS\nFor the purpose of this Code, Bessemer City is hereby divided into seven (7) general zoning districts, and\nthree (3) overlay districts.

Characteristics of this area include, open pasture and woodlands, limited availability to\npublic utilities, rural roadways, and large, residential lots.\nBESSEMER CITY LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE (LDC) 1\n"}, {"page": "10", "text": "2.3.B NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTIAL (NR)\nThe Neighborhood Residential (NR) district is established where the principal use of land is for\nmedium density single-family uses along with limited home occupations and public and private\ncommunity uses. It is expected that all dwellings will have access to municipal water and sewer\nsupplies.\n2.3.C URBAN RESIDENTIAL (UR)\nThe Urban Residential (UR) district is established in which the principal use of land is for single-\nfamily, two-family, townhouse, and low or medium density multi-family residences. The\nregulations of this district are intended to provide areas in the community for those persons\ndesiring small residences and multi-family structures in higher density neighborhoods. The\nregulations are intended to prohibit any use which, because of its character, would interfere\nwith the residential nature of this district. This district also promotes contextual commercial and\nretail development, encouraging walkable corner stores and markets, local services, and\npocket parks. It is expected that municipal water and sewerage facilities will be available to\neach lot in such districts. Residential developments greater than three (3) acres in size will be\nconsidered and will utilize the Conditional Zoning District provided in Section 2.5.\n2.3.D CITY CENTER (CC)\nThe City Center (CC) district is established to provide for a mixture of commercial, residential,\nand civic/institutional uses in the City's downtown core. It is intended to be the historic, cultural,\nand civic hub for the community. Development emphasizes walkable, pedestrian-scaled\nbuildings with residential uses primarily being supplied above commercial storefronts or offices.\n2.3.E HIGHWAY COMMERCIAL (HC)\nThe Highway Commercial (HC) district is established along major thoroughfares and collector\nstreets in the planning area. They are intended to provide for offices, personal services, and\nthe retailing of durable and convenience goods for the community. Because these commercial\nuses are subject to public view and are important to the economy of the area, they should have\nample parking, controlled traffic movement and suitable landscaping. Uses along these\ncorridors shall be interconnected to mitigate traffic congestion and reduce driveway\nconnections.\n2.3.F BUSINESS CAMPUS/PRODUCTION (BCP)\nThe Business Campus/Production (BCP) district is established for those areas strategically\nidentified as suitable for light industrial, ancillary warehouse, institutional, and corporate\ncampus development. By design these uses are intended to remain near major highways and\nthoroughfares. These uses, by their nature, may create a nuisance(s), however, with proper\nbuffering and design standards, may be associated with residential, commercial and/or service\nestablishments.\nBESSEMER CITY LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE (LDO|2\n"}, {"page": "11", "text": "2.3.G INDUSTRIAL (I)\nThe Industrial (I) district is established to provide and protect areas for industrial uses which\nprovide jobs and other benefits to the community, but may generate excessive noise, odor,\nsmoke, dust, airborne debris, traffic, and other objectionable characteristics.\n2.4 OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS\n2.4.A FLOOD HAZARD OVERLAY (FH-O)\n1. The purpose of this zoning district is to promote public health, safety, and general welfare\nand to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas\nby provisions designed to:\n2. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or\nerosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;\na. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be\nprotected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;\nb. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective\nbarriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;\nC. Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion\nor flood damage; and\nd. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert\nfloodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\n3. Specific objectives of this zoning district are:\na. To protect human life and health;\nb. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\nC. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding that are at\nthe expense of the general public;\nd. To minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;\ne. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and gas mains, electric,\ntelephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood prone\nareas;\nf. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of\nflood prone areas; and,\ng. To ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a Special Flood Hazard\nArea.\n4.

Strategic management of\nstructure setbacks within this overlay will protect the natural views of the mountain and highlight\nunique municipal features.\n2.5\nCONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICTS\nConditional Zoning Districts (-CD) may be utilized to create new unique districts for uses or developments\nthat do not fit the typical patterns associated in Bessemer City. Conditional Zoning Districts may be utilized\nfor those situations where a particular use or development, if properly planned, may have particular benefits\nand/or impacts on both the immediate area and the community as a whole. The development of these uses\nshould not be constrained by general district standards. The applicant must provide an initial Master Plan\nand zoning proposal that includes all proposed uses and standards for the conditional zoning district being\nproposed. It is not the intention of Conditional Zoning to circumvent, reduce, or eliminate particular\nregulations as they would normally be applied to any particular use but rather provide flexibility and design\nstandards unique to the subject property and use. Conditional Zoning shall be subject to the specific\nprocedural rules herein and in Section 7.1.E.10.\n2.6 ZONING MAP\nThe boundaries of the districts are shown on the map accompanying this Code and made a part hereof\nentitled \"Official Zoning Map, Bessemer City, North Carolina\".

The design layout\nis intended to classify the natural and built environments as a continuum conditions, ranging from rural to\nurban. The value of the layout is that it serves to locate any given place within a context in which all the\nparts fit together harmoniously. For example, a rural street typically has no curbs or sidewalks, and its\nbuildings look like farmhouses or barns. An urban street, depending on the intensity of urbanism, may have\ncurb and gutter, regularly placed street trees, sidewalks, and building forms that include common walls, flat\nroofs, and cornices. Each zoning category has detailed provisions for density, height, street design, the\ndesign of parks, the mix of uses, building design, parking, and other aspects of the human environment.\nThe zoning districts for the City of Bessemer City have thus been ordered along this layout providing an\nappropriate detailing of development at each end as well as a simplified tool for users of this Code to use\nto facilitate appropriate development.\nBESSEMER CITY LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE (LDO I 1\n"}, {"page": "25", "text": "3.2\nDIMENSIONAL STANDARDS\n3.2.A\nPRINCIPAL STRUCTURES\nDimensional standards for principal structures shall be applied as follows:\nTable 3-1 Dimensional Standards for Principal Structures\n(a) There are no minimum/maximum dimensional requirements for Essential\nServices, Class 1 and Parks.\n(b) Thirty (30) feet if abutting the R, NR, or UR districts.\n(c) The maximum height of the structure may be increased to seventy-five (75) feet,\nprovided that the structure lies 200+ feet from a residentially zoned lot.\n(d) Within the Viewshed Overlay District, the front setback shall be one hundred (100)\nfeet per Section 2.9.\n(e) Dimensions reflect the total development, not an individual lot.

The reduction in required open space for the subdivision shall be calculated based on the\nacreage contained in the existing public park. For instance, if a subdivision contained two\nhundred (200) lots, it would ordinarily be required to have 5.71 acres of open space. If a\nfive (5) acre public park were located one-tenth (1/10) of a mile away from the subdivision,\none-quarter of the acreage of the park, or 1.25 acres, could be used to offset the amount\nof open space required in the subdivision.

In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may attach such\nconditions to the approval as it deems necessary and appropriate to satisfy the\npurposes and objectives of this Code. The Board of Adjustment may also attach\nconditions in order to reduce or minimize any injurious effect of such variance upon\nother property in the neighborhood and to ensure compliance with other terms of this\nCode. Such conditions and safeguards must be reasonably related to the condition or\ncircumstance that gives rise to the need for a variance.\nd. Any approval or denial of the request shall be accompanied by written findings of fact\nsupporting the conclusion that the variance meets or does not meet each of the\nstandards set forth in Section 7.3.B.3.\n3. Required Findings. The Board of Adjustment shall not grant a variance unless and until it\nmakes all of the following findings:\na. Carrying out the strict letter of the Code would result in an unnecessary hardship. It\nshall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no\nreasonable use can be made of the property.\nb. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location,\nsize, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as\nhardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the\ngeneral public, may not be the basis for granting a variance. A variance may be granted\nwhen necessary and appropriate to make a reasonable accommodation under the\nFederal Fair Housing Act for a person with a disability.\nC. The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant of the property owner.\nThe act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify\nthe granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.\nd. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of this Code,\nsuch that the public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.\n7.3.C SPECIAL USE PERMITS, MAJOR SITE PLANS, AND MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS\nSpecial uses permits, major site plans, and major subdivisions are generally compatible with\nthe land uses permitted by right in a zoning district, but which require individual review of their\nlocation, design, and configuration so as to evaluate the potential for adverse impacts on\nadjacent property and uses.
