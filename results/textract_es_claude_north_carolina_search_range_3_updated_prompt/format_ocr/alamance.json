A nonconforming situation is the use of land or existence of a structure that, after the\neffective date of this Ordinance, is prohibited in the district in which it is located.\nSection 10-2. Nonconforming Uses of Open Land\nA nonconforming use of open land consists of open lots used for storage yards, car lots, auto\nwrecking, junkyards, and similar uses where the only buildings on the lot are incidental and\naccessory to the open use of the lot and where the use is not permitted inthe zoning district\nwhere it is located.\nSuch nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was\noccupied by that use when it became nonconforming. Fencing or other screening of the use\ndoes not change its status as a nonconforming use of open land.\nSection 10-3.

Maintenance and Repair: Normal maintenance and repair of a structure used for a\nnonconforming purpose is permitted and encouraged, provided it does not extend the\nnonconformity.\nC.\nChange to Conforming Use: Any nonconforming use of a structure may be changed to a\nconforming use, or, with the approval of the Board of Adjustment, a nonconforming use\nmay be changed to a use more in character with the uses permitted in the district as long as\nthere is no structural enlargement.\nD. Extension of Use Within a Nonconforming Structure: A nonconforming use of a structure\nshall not be extended or enlarged except into portions of the structure, which, at the time\nthe use became nonconforming, were already erected, and arranged or designed for such\nVillage of Alamance Zoning Ordinance\nPage 80\n"}, {"page": "83", "text": "Draft #7\nZONING ORDINANCE\nChapter 10 Nonconforming Situations\nnonconforming use.

Vacancy and/or non-use of the building, regardless of the intent of the owner or\ntenant, shall constitute discontinuance under this provision.\nF. Single-Family Residence Exception: Any structure used for a single-family residence that has\nbeen made nonconforming by adoption of this ordinance or by rezoning maybe replaced\nwith a structure of the same or a larger size, as long as the replacement does not create\nnew nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to\nyard size and setback.

The Zoning Administrator shall\nmake an initial determination as to the existence of the vested right. The decision of the zoning\nadministrator or officer may be appealed under NCGS 160D-405. On appeal, the existence of a\nvested right shall be reviewed de novo. In lieu of seeking such a determination, a person\nclaiming a vested right may bring an original civil action as provided by NCGS 160D-405(c).\nSection 11-2. Types and Duration of Statutory Vested Rights\nAmendments to the Village of Alamance development regulations shall not be applicable or\nenforceable with regard to development that has been permitted or approved pursuant to\nNCGS 160D-108 long as one of the types of approvals listed in this subsection remains valid and\nunexpired. Each type of vested right listed in this subsection is defined by and is subject to the\nlimitations provided in this section. Vested rights established under this section are not\nmutually exclusive. The establishment of a vested right under this section does not preclude the\nestablishment of one or more other vested rights or vesting by common law principles. Vested\nrights established by Village of Alamance approvals are as follows:\n4.\nSix months - Building permits. - Pursuant to NCGS 160D-1109, a building permit expires six\nmonths after issuance unless work under the permit has commenced. Building permits also\nexpire if work is discontinued for a period of 12 months after work has commenced.\nB. One year - Other local development approvals. - Pursuant to NCGS 160D-403(c), unless\notherwise specified by statute or local ordinance, all other local development approvals\nexpire one year after issuance unless work has substantially commenced. Expiration of a\nlocal development approval shall not affect the duration of a vested right established under\nthis section or vested rights established under common law.\nC. Two years - Site-specific vesting plans.\n1. Duration. - A vested right for a site-specific vesting plan shall remain vested for a\nperiod of two years. This vesting shall not be extended by any amendments or\nmodifications to a site-specific vesting plan unless expressly provided by Village of\nVillage of Alamance Zoning Ordinance\nPage 84\n"}, {"page": "87", "text": "Draft #7\nZONING ORDINANCE\nChapter 11 Vested Rights and Development Agreements\nAlamance ordinance.\n2. Relation to building permits. - A right vested as provided in this subsection shall\nterminate at the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to buildings and\nuses for which no valid building permit applications have been filed. Upon issuance\nof a building permit, the provisions of NCGS 160D-1109 and NCGS 160D-1113 shall\napply, except that the permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the runningof\ntime while a vested right under this subsection exists.\n3. Requirements for site-specific vesting plans. - For the purposes of this section, a\n\"site-specific vesting plan\" means a plan submitted to the Village of Alamance\ndescribing with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specific\nparcel or parcels of property. The plan may be in the form of, but not be limited to,\nany of the following plans or approvals: a planned unit development plan, a\nsubdivision plat, a site plan, a preliminary or general development plan, a special use\npermit, a conditional zoning, or any other development approval as guided by the\nVillage of Alamance ordinance. What constitutes a site-specific vesting plan shall be\ndefined by the relevant development regulation, and the development approval that\ntriggers vesting shall be so identified at the time of its approval. At a minimum, the\nregulation shall designate a vesting point earlier than the issuance of a building\npermit. In absence of a Village regulation setting forth what constitutes a site-\nspecific vesting plan, any development approval shall be considered to be a site-\nspecific vesting plan. A variance shall not constitute a site-specific vesting plan and\napproval of a site-specific vesting plan with the condition that a variance be\nobtained shall not confer a vested right unless and until the necessary variance is\nobtained. If a sketch plan or other document fails to describe with reasonable\ncertainty the type and intensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property, it\nmay not constitute a site-specific vesting plan.\n4. Process for approval and amendment of site-specific vesting plans. - If a site-specific\nvesting plan is based on an approval required by Village of Alamance development\nregulations, a notice and hearing is required for that underlying approval. If the\nduration of the underlying approval is less than two years, that shall not affect the\nduration of the site-specific vesting plan established under this chapter. If the site-\nspecific vesting plan is not based on such an approval, a legislative hearing with\nnotice as required by NCGS 160D-602 shall be held. The Village of Alamance may\napprove a site-specific vesting plan upon such terms and conditions as may\nreasonably be necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Such\nconditional approval shall result in a vested right, although failure to abide by its\nterms and conditions will result in a forfeiture of vested rights. The Village of\nAlamance shall not require a landowner to waive vested rights as a condition of\ndevelopmental approval. A site-specific vesting plan shall be deemed approved upon\nVillage of Alamance Zoning Ordinance\nPage 85\n"}, {"page": "88", "text": "Draft #7\nZONING ORDINANCE\nChapter 11 Vested Rights and Development Agreements\nthe effective date of the local government's decision approving the plan or such\nother date as determined by the governing board upon approval. An approved site-\nspecific vesting plan and its conditions may be amended with the approval of the\nowner and the Village as follows: any substantial modification must be reviewed and\napproved in the same manner as the original approval; minor modifications may be\napproved by the Zoning Administrator, if such are defined and authorized by local\nregulation.\nC. Seven years - Multiphase developments. - A multiphase development shall be vested for the\nentire development with the zoning regulations, subdivision regulations, and unified\ndevelopment ordinances in place at the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial\nphase of the multiphase development. This right shall remain vested for a period of seven\nyears from the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multiphase\ndevelopment. For purposes of this subsection, \"multiphase development\" means a\ndevelopment containing 100 acres or more that (i) is submitted for site plan approval for\nconstruction to occur in more than one phase and (ii) is subject to a master development\nplan with committed elements, including a requirement to offer land for public use as a\ncondition of its master development plan approval.\nD. Indefinite - Development agreements. - A vested right of reasonable duration may be\nspecified in a development agreement approved under NCGS 160D-1001.\nSection 11-3. Continuing Review\nFollowing approval or conditional approval of a statutory vested right, the Village may make\nsubsequent reviews and require subsequent approvals to ensure compliance with the terms\nand conditions of the original approval, provided that such reviews and approvals are not\ninconsistent with the original approval. The Village may revoke the original approval for failure\nto comply with applicable terms and conditions of the original approval or the applicable\ndevelopment regulations.\nSection 11-4. Exceptions\nThe provisions of this section are subject to the following:\nA. A vested right, once established precludes any zoning action that would change, alter,\nimpair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the property as set\nforth in an approved vested right, except when any of the following conditions are present:\n1.

Compensation shall not\ninclude any diminution in the value of the property that is caused by such action.\n4. Findings made, by ordinance after notice and an evidentiary hearing, that the\nlandowner or the landowner's representative intentionally supplied inaccurate\ninformation or made material misrepresentations that made a difference in the\napproval by the local government of the vested right.\n5. The enactment or promulgation of a State or federal law or regulation that\nprecludes development as contemplated in the approved site-specific vesting planor\nphased development plan, in which case the local government may modify the\naffected provisions, upon a finding that the change in State or federal law has a\nfundamental effect on the plan, by ordinance after notice and an evidentiary\nhearing.\nB. The establishment of a vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning or\nother development regulation that imposes additional requirements but does not affect the\nallowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations that are general in nature\nand are applicable to all property subject to development regulation by a local government,\nincluding, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes.\nOtherwise, applicable new regulations shall become effective with respect to property that\nis subject to a vested right established under this section upon the expiration or termination\nof the vested rights period provided for in this section.\nC. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the establishment of a vested right under this\nsection shall not preclude, change, or impair the authority of a local government to adopt\nand enforce development regulation provisions governing nonconforming situations or\nuses.\nSection 11-5. Miscellaneous Provisions\nA vested right obtained under this section is not a personal right but shall attach to and run\nwith the applicable property. After approval of a vested right all successors to the original\nlandowner shall be entitled to exercise such rights.

Termination of a Vested Right\nA zoning right that has been vested as provided in this article shall terminate with:\nA. The written consent of the affected landowner.\nB. Findings made, after notice and an evidentiary hearing, that natural or man-made hazards on\nor in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threatto the\npublic health, safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as contemplated in the\napproved vested right.\nC. The extent to which the affected landowner receives compensation for all costs, expenses,\nand other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but not limited to, all fees paid in\nconsideration of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and other\nconsulting fees incurred after approval by the local government, together with interest as is\nprovided in NCGS 160D-106. Compensation shall not include any diminution in the value of\nthe property that is caused by such action.\nD.\nFindings made, after notice and an evidentiary hearing, that the landowner or the\nlandowner's representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material\nmisrepresentations that made a difference in the approval by the local government of the\nvested right.\nE. The enactment or promulgation of a State or federal law or regulation that precludes\ndevelopment as contemplated in the approved vested right, in which case the local\ngovernment may modify the affected provisions, upon a finding that the change in State or\nfederal law has a fundamental effect on the plan, after notice and an evidentiary hearing.\nARTICLE 2. DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS\nSection 11-7. Development Agreements\n3) Purpose\nThe purpose of this Article is to establish standards and procedures for the Village to enter\ninto Development Agreements for long-term, large-scale developments, in recognition ofthe\nfollowing findings and statements of intent:\n1. Large-Scale Development Projects and Long-Term Commitment of Resources Large-\nscale development projects often occur in multiple phases extending over aperiod of\nyears, requiring a long-term commitment of both public and private resources.\nVillage of Alamance Zoning Ordinance\nPage 88\n"}, {"page": "91", "text": "Draft #7\nZONING ORDINANCE\nChapter 11 Vested Rights and Development Agreements\n2. Potential Community Impacts - Such large-scale developments often create potential\ncommunity impacts and potential opportunities that are difficult or impossible to\naccommodate withintraditional zoning processes.\n3. Careful Integration between Public Capital Facilities Planning, Financing, Schedules-\nBecause of their scale and duration, such large-scale projects often require careful\nintegration between public capital facilities planning, financing and construction\nschedules and the phasing of the private development.\n4. Stable Development Standards - Because of their scale and duration, such large-scale\nprojects involve substantial commitments of private capital by private developers, which\nprivate developers areunwilling to risk without sufficient assurances that development\nstandards will remain stable through the extended period of the development.\n5.\nNontraditional Development Types - Because of their size and duration, such\ndevelopments often permit communities anddevelopers to experiment with different or\nnontraditional types of development concepts and standards, while still managing the\nimpacts on the surrounding areas.\n6.\nNegotiating Flexibility - To better structure and manage development approvals for such\nlarge-scale developments and ensure their proper integration into local capital facilities\nprograms, local governments need the flexibility in negotiating such developments.\n7. Plan Consistency - In negotiating for such developments, it is the intent of the Village to\nremain consistent with the adopted plans, policies, and goals of the Village as they relateto\nland use and capital improvements.\n4) Authority\nThe Village may enter into a Development Agreement with a developer, subject to the\nprocedures and standards of this Article. In entering into such a Development\nAgreement, the Village may not exercise any authority or make any commitment not\nauthorized by general or local act and may not impose any tax or fee not authorized by\notherwise applicable law.
