Continuation of Nonconforming Situations and Completion of Non-conforming\nProjects. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, nonconforming situations that\nwere otherwise lawful on the effective date of this chapter may be continued, subject to the\nrestrictions and qualifications set forth in Sections 16-8.2 and 16-8.9. Nonconforming projects\nmay be completed only in accordance with the provisions of Section 16-8.8.\nSection 16-8.2. Nonconforming Lots. This section applies only to undeveloped nonconforming\nlots. A lot is undeveloped if it has no substantial structures upon it. A change in use of a\ndeveloped nonconforming lot may be accomplished in accordance with Section 16-8.5.\n16-8.2.1. When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations\napplicable to the intended use, except that the lot is smaller than the required minimums set\nforth in Section 16-12.1, then the lot may be used as proposed just as if it were conforming.\nHowever, no use (e.g., a two-family residence) that requires a greater lot size than the\nestablished minimum lot size for a particular zone is permissible on a nonconforming lot.\n16-8.2.2. When the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all\nother respects, but the applicable setback requirements (Section 16-12.4) cannot reasonably\nbe complied with, then the entity authorized by this chapter to issue a permit for the\nproposed use, (the administrator or Board of Commissioners) may allow deviations from the\napplicable setback requirements if it finds that:\na) The property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such\ndeviations;\nb) These deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot; and\nc) The property can be developed as proposed without any significantly adverse impact on\nsurrounding properties or the public health or safety.\n16-8.2.3. For purposes of Section 16-8.2.2 compliance with applicable building setback\nrequirements is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use\nproposed for the nonconforming lot cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot\nin conformity with such setback requirements. However, mere financial hardship does not\nconstitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible.\n16-8.2.4. If, on the date this section becomes effective, an undeveloped nonconforming lot\nadjoins and has continuous frontage with one or more other undeveloped lots under the\nsame ownership, then neither the owner of the nonconforming lot nor a successor in interest\nmay take advantage of the provisions of this section. This subsection shall not apply to a\nnonconforming lot if a majority of the developed lots located on either side of the street\nwhere such lot is located and within 500 feet of such lot are also nonconforming. The intent\nof this subsection is to require nonconforming lots to be combined with other undeveloped\nlots to create conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein, but not to require\n8-1\n"}, {"page": "80", "text": "Town Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nsuch combination when that would be out of character with the way the neighborhood has\npreviously been developed.\nSection 16-8.3. Extension or Enlargement of Nonconforming Situations. Except as specifically\nprovided in this section, no person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the\nextent of nonconformity. In particular, physical alteration of structures or the placement of new\nstructures on open land is unlawful if such activity results in:\na) An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use; or\nb) An increase in nonconformity. For the purposes of this Article, an increase in nonconformity\nshall refer to any improvement or expansion which contravenes the density, dimensional or\nother requirements of the Land Use Ordinance. Structures or portions of structures which\nare nonconforming may not be extended or expanded in any fashion.\nEXPLANATORY NOTE: For purposes of illustration, and not limitation, a deck, or any portion\nthereof, which is nonconforming for failing to comply with applicable setback requirements may\nnot be altered so as to make it a porch as that would constitute an increase in nonconformity.\nNeither shall a nonconforming porch be altered to create an enclosed space with the exception\nthat mesh screening may be added.\n16-8.3.1. Subject to Section 16-8.3.3 a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any\nportion of a completed building that, when the use was made nonconforming by this chapter,\nwas manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use. However, subject to Section\n16-8.7 (authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances), a\nnonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the\noriginal building.\nEXCEPTION: If a nonconforming use of land is due to a property having a single-family\nresidence with an accessory apartment, then the principal structure may be expanded, and\nother accessory structures may be constructed as long as the accessory apartment or\nadditional dwelling unit is not expanded in any way. Further, no expansion of the principal\nstructure shall result in enlargement of a nonconforming situation with respect to setbacks\nor building height.\n16-8.3.2. Subject to Section 16-8.7 (authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in\ncertain circumstances), a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover\nmore land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming, except that a use\nthat involves the removal of natural materials from the lot (e.g., a sand pit) may be expanded\nto the boundaries of the lot where the use was established at the time it became\nnonconforming if ten percent or more of the earth products had already been removed at\nthe effective date of this chapter.\n16-8.3.3. Notwithstanding Section 16-8.3, any structure used for single-family residential\npurposes may be replaced with a similar structure, so long as the replacement does not create\nnew nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to such\nmatters as setback and parking requirements. (For example, a single-story dwelling that\n8-2\n"}, {"page": "81", "text": "Town Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nencroaches into one or more applicable setbacks may be replaced within the previous\nbuilding footprint. However, a second story may only be built if the applicable setbacks are\nmet.)

Notwithstanding Section 16-8.3 whenever:\na) there exists a lot with one or more structures on it; and\n16-8.3.5. Historic Properties. Notwithstanding the limitations contained in Section 16-8.3\nabove, certain historic properties on which one or more nonconforming uses are taking place\nmay be permitted to expand the structures and other facilities, such as patios, vehicular use\nareas, and the like, pertaining to said nonconforming uses by means of a special use permit\nas specified herein.\n16-8.3.5.1 The exception contained herein applies only to any property which is listed as\na landmark on the National Register of Historic Places or listed as a contributing property\nin an historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places and on which a\nnonconforming use has taken place continuously since prior to the effective date of the\nLand Use Code.

Repair, Maintenance and Reconstruction. Minor repairs to and routine\nmaintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged\nand may require a zoning permit or special use permit. Major renovation may be done only in\naccordance with a Zoning permit issued pursuant to this section. Major renovation takes place\nwhen the costs of renovation would exceed fifty percent of the appraised valuation of the existing\nstructure.\n16-8.4.1. If a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged\nby fire, natural disaster, or act of God, to an extent that the costs of repair or replacement\nwould exceed fifty percent of the appraised valuation of the pre-damaged structure, then the\ndamaged structure may be repaired or replaced only in accordance with a zoning permit or\nspecial use permit issued pursuant to this section. A structure damaged by fire, natural\ndisaster, or act of God, may be built back to the existing building footprint and may be\nenlarged as provided in Section 16-8.3. This subsection does not apply to structures used for\nsingle-family residential purposes, which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a\nzoning permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided in Section 16-8.3.4. For\npurposes of this section:\na) The \"cost\" of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the fair market value of the\nmaterials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation, repair, or replacement.\nb) The \"cost\" of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all such\nintended work, and no person may seek to avoid the intent of Section 16-8.4 or Section\n16-8.4.1 by doing such work incrementally.\nc)\nThe \"appraised valuation\" shall mean either the appraised valuation for property tax\npurposes, updated as necessary by the Watauga County tax model since the date of the\nlast valuation, or the valuation determined by a North Carolina licensed general\nappraiser.\nd)\nSections 16-8.4 and Section 16-8.4.1 do not apply to structures located in a designated\nFlood Hazard Area. The repair, maintenance, or reconstruction of structures in a Flood\nHazard Area may only be completed pursuant to Article 16 Flood Damage Prevention, of\nthis chapter.\n16-8.4.2.

This subsection does not apply to structures used for single-family residential\npurposes, which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a zoning permit just as they\nmay be enlarged or replaced as provided in Section 16-8.3.3. Also, the application of this\nsubsection shall not cause a permittee to lose their right to continue a nonconforming use.\n16-8.4.2.3. Compliance with a requirement of this chapter is not reasonably possible if\ncompliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the\nnonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a\npermanent foundation. Mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such\nrequirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is\nnot reasonably possible.\nSection 16-8.5. Change in Use of Property Where a Nonconforming Situation Exists. A change\nin use of property that is sufficiently substantial to require a new zoning, or special use permit,\nin accordance with section 16-4.1.1, may not be made except in accordance with this section.\nHowever, these requirements shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed.\n16-8.5.1. If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district\nwhere the property is located, and all of the other requirements of this chapter applicable to\nthat use can be complied with, permission to make the change must be obtained in the same\nmanner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot. Once conformity with this\nchapter is achieved, the property may not revert to its nonconforming status.\n16-8.5.2. If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district\nwhere the property is located, but all of the requirements of this chapter applicable to that\nuse cannot reasonably be complied with, then the change is permissible if the entity\nauthorized by this chapter to issue a permit for that particular use (the Administrator or Board\nof Commissioners) issues a permit authorizing the change. This permit may be issued if the\npermit-issuing authority finds, in addition to any other findings that may be required by this\nchapter, that:\na) The intended change will not result in a violation of section 8-3; and\nb) All of the applicable requirements of this chapter that can reasonably be complied with\nwill be complied with.\nCompliance with a requirement of this chapter is not reasonably possible if compliance\ncannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming\nsituation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation.\nMere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking\ndoes not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible.

If the intended change in use is to another principal use that is also nonconforming,\nthen the change is permissible if the entity authorized by this chapter to issue a permit for\nthat particular use (Administrator or Board of Commissioners) issues a permit authorizing the\nchange. The permit-issuing authority may issue the permit if it finds, in addition to other\nfindings that may be required by this chapter, that:\na) The use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning district with either a zoning,\nor special use, permit; and\nb) All of the conditions applicable to the permit are satisfied; and\nc) The proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on those most affected by\nit and will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in\noperation at the time the permit is applied for.\nSection 16-8.6. Abandonment and Discontinuance of Nonconforming Situations. When a\nnonconforming use is (a) discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days, or (b) discontinued\nfor any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use, the\nproperty involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes.\n16-8.6.1. If the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a\nnonconforming use exists is (a) discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days, or (b)\ndiscontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity,\nthen that property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations\napplicable to the preexisting use unless the entity with authority to issue a permit for the\nintended use issues a permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without\ncorrecting the nonconforming situations. This permit may be issued if the permit-issuing\nauthority finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible (i.e.,\ncannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming\nsituation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation).\nThe permit shall specify which nonconformities need not be corrected.\n16-8.6.2. For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation\nis lost pursuant to this section, all of the buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a\nlot are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment\nin a nonconforming apartment building for 180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to\nrent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is\ncontinuously maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a\nconforming use, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall\nterminate the right to maintain it thereafter.\n16-8.6.3. When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this chapter is vacant or\ndiscontinued at the effective date of this chapter, the 180-day period for purposes of this\nsection begins to run at the effective date of this chapter.\n8-6\n"}, {"page": "85", "text": "Town Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nSection 16-8.7.

Overlay Districts.\n16-9.3.1. Short-Term Rental Overlay District. The purpose of the short-term rental overlay\ndistrict is to provide areas within the underlying multi-family residential zoning districts that\nare appropriate for short-term residential rental uses. As an overlay district, the Short-Term\nRental Overlay District does not replace or restrict the range of uses allowed in the underlying\nzoning district but allows for additional uses within the boundaries of the overlay district.\na) Designation of Overlay District. Following approval by the Board of Commissioners of an\narea to be included in the Short-Term Rental Overlay District, the area so designated shall\nbe labeled as \"STR\" on the Official Zoning Map.\nb) Permitted Uses. In addition to the uses permitted within the underlying zoning district,\nshort-term rental of a dwelling unit is allowed within the Short-Term Rental Overlay\nDistrict.\nc) Adoption Criteria. A Short-Term Rental Overlay District may be established if the\nproposed map amendment application meets the following standards, criteria, and\nconditions:\n1) The map amendment may only be initiated by the Board of Commissioners, the\nPlanning Board, the Town Administration, or an owner of property located within the\nproposed district. Unless a map amendment is Town-initiated (by the Board of\nCommissioners, the Planning Board, or the Town Administration), an application for a\nmap amendment must be endorsed by a majority of the property owners of all lots,\nparcels, and units to be included within the boundary area of the proposed map\namendment. Third party downzoning is prohibited per S.L. 2019-111, Pt. I.

There shall be a map known and designated as the Official\nZoning Map, which shall show the boundaries of all zoning districts within the city's planning\njurisdiction. This map is maintained in digital format on the Town of Blowing Rock GIS.\nAmendments to the map are filed with the Town Clerk and may be found in the minutes of the\nBoard of Commissioners.\nSection 16-9.5. Amendments to Official Zoning Map. Amendments to the Official Zoning Map\nare accomplished using the same procedures that apply to other amendments to this chapter, as\nset forth in Article 23.\n16-9.5.1. The administrator shall update the Official Zoning Map as soon as possible after\namendments to it are adopted by the Board. Upon entering any such amendment on the\nmap, the administrator shall change the date of the map to indicate its latest revision.\n16-9.5.2.

The administrator shall keep copies of superseded prints of the zoning map for\nhistorical reference and make available for public inspection in accordance with NCGS 160D-\n105.\nSection 16-9.6. Conditional Districts (CD). Conditional districts are districts with conditions\nvoluntarily added by the applicant and approved in a legislative procedure by the Board of\nCommissioners in accordance with NCGS 160D-703. Conditional districts provide for orderly and\nflexible development under the general policies of this Ordinance without the constraints of\nsome of the prescribed standards guiding \"by right\" development.

Conditional district classification shall only be\nconsidered upon the request of the owners and/or the representatives of the owners of\nall the property to be included. A CD shall consist of land under unified control which may\nbe planned and developed as a single development or as an approved programmed series\nof development phases by multiple developers. \"Unified control\" means that all land to\nbe included within a CD shall be owned or otherwise under the legal control of the person\nor legal entity which has applied for a conditional district. Such person or entity shall be\nlegally capable of providing a commitment to the town that the CD development will\ncomply with all documents, plans, standards and conditions ultimately approved by the\ntown.\n16-9.6.1.2. Standards of District to be Met. Within an approved conditional district, no\nuse shall be permitted except pursuant to the conditions imposed by the applicant on the\nconditional district in the approval of the rezoning. In general, the development\nstandards for the associated land development district, as well as general standards\ncontained in this chapter, shall govern development within the conditional district.\nHowever, within a conditional district petitioner may place additional requirements or\nstandards onto themselves and their property or ask that certain uses identified in the\nassociated district be decreased. In addition, specific development standards (except\nthose involving use), may be varied if specifically requested by the petitioner as part of a\nconditional district application.\nIf no specific request is made by the petitioner to change the applicable development\nstandards or if the petition is silent on the point, it shall be understood that all applicable\ndevelopment standards shall govern the development and use of the property.\n16-9.6.1.3. Contents of Application. A conditional district application shall consist of the\nmaster plan, as provided for herein, as well as any other plans, drawings, renderings,\nelevations, maps and documents specifically included as development documents for\napproval by the Board of Commissioners. The master plan, as a site-specific conditional\nzoning plan, is itself a condition of the conditional district rezoning. The master plan shall\ninclude those existing environmental features (i.e., significant/historic trees,\nwatercourses, rock outcroppings) required on application forms and checklists provided\nby the Land Use Administrator. Additional application details are found in Section 16-4.4\nof this Chapter.\na) Master plan.

Site-Specific Development Plan. Conditional zoning is intended to link map\namendments with a specific development plan and uses; therefore, the limitations\ncontained in Section 16-10.5 concerning the range of uses proposed shall not apply.\n16-9.6.2.3. Fair and Reasonable Conditions. The provisions of the Master plan shall\nreplace all conflicting development regulations set forth in this Chapter which would\notherwise apply to the development site. The Board of Commissioners may attach,\nreasonable and appropriate conditions including, but not limited to, the location, nature,\nhours of operation, and extent of the proposed use(s); provided, however, only those\nconditions mutually approved in writing by the Town and the applicant may be\nincorporated into the permit requirements for the conditional district.

The development and use of all land\nwithin the conditional district shall be in keeping with the approved master plan and all\napplicable provisions therein.\n19-9.6.3.1. Final Approval by Stages. If so, reflected on the master plan, the Board of\nCommissioners may allow the staging of final development. Each phase of development\nshall adhere to all applicable provisions and standards of this section and the applicable\nCD master plan.\n16-9.6.3.2. Substantial Changes. Any substantial change to a master plan as noted below\nshall be reviewed by the Planning Board and approved or denied by the Board of\nCommissioners as an amended conditional district. The following changes to a CD master\nplan shall require approval by the Board of Commissioners:\na) Land area being added or removed from the conditional district.\nb) Modification of special performance criteria, design standards, or other requirements\nspecified by the enacting ordinance.\nc) A change in land use or development type beyond that permitted by the approved\nmaster plan.\nd) When there is introduction of a new vehicular access point to an existing street, road\nor thoroughfare not previously designated for access.\ne) When there is an increase in the total number of residential dwelling units originally\nauthorized by the approved master plan.\nf) When the total floor area of a commercial or industrial classification is increased more\nthan 10 percent beyond the total floor area last approved by Board of Commissioners.\n16-9.6.3.3.

This occurs whenever:\na) The change involves a change from one principal use category to another.\n10-3\n"}, {"page": "98", "text": "Town Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nb) The original use is a combination use (29.000) or planned unit development (30.000), the\nrelative proportion of space devoted to the individual principal uses that comprise the\ncombination use or planned unit development use changes to such an extent that the parking\nrequirements for the overall use are altered.\nc) If the original use is a combination use or planned unit development use, the mixture of types\nof individual principal uses that comprise the combination use or planned unit development\nuse changes.\nd) If there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot (regardless of whether that\nbusiness or enterprise consists of one individual principal use or a combination use), that\nbusiness or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in (even though\nthe new business or enterprise may be classified under the same principal use or combination\nuse category as the previous type of business). For example, if there is only one building on\na lot and a florist shop that is the sole tenant of that building moves out and is replaced by a\nclothing store, that constitutes a change in use even though both tenants fall within principal\nuse classification 2.110. However, if the florist shop were replaced by another florist shop,\nthat would not constitute change in use since the type of business or enterprise would not\nhave changed. Moreover, if the florist shop moved out of a rented space in a shopping center\nand was replaced by a clothing store, that would not constitute a change in use since there is\nmore than one business on the lot and the essential character of the activity conducted on\nthat lot (shopping center - combination use) has not changed.\n16-10.8.1. A mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice-\nversa does not constitute a change in use. Whether a change in use occurs shall be\ndetermined by comparing the two active uses of the property without regard to any\nintervening period during which the property may have been unoccupied, unless the\nproperty has remained unoccupied for more than 180 consecutive days or has been\nabandoned.\n16-10.8.2. A mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in the\nname shall not be regarded as a change in use.\nSection 16-10.9. Manufacturing/Processing, Etc. Uses. The Board finds that the\nresidential/resort character of the area within Blowing Rock's planning jurisdiction is\nincompatible with the development of such area for uses within the 4.000 classification of the\nTable of Permissible Uses (manufacturing, processing, etc.) except to the extent that such uses\ncreate none of the negative impacts often associated with such manufacturing/processing uses.\nTherefore, no 4.000 classification use within any zoning district may:\na) Emit from a vent, stock, chimney, or combustion process any smoke that is visible to the\nnaked eye.\nb) Generate noise that tends to have an annoying or disruptive effect upon uses located outside\nthe immediate space occupied by the 4.000 use if that use is one of several on the lot or uses\nlocated on adjacent lots.\nc) Generate any ground transmitted vibration that is perceptible to the human sense of touch\nmeasured at the outside boundary of the immediate space occupied by the enterprise\ngenerating the vibration if the enterprise is one of several located on a lot, or the lot line if\n10-4\n"}, {"page": "99", "text": "Town Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nthe enterprise generating the vibration is the only enterprise located on a lot.\nd)\nGenerate any odor that reaches the \"odor threshold\" measured at the outside boundary of\nthe immediate space occupied by the enterprise generating the odor, or the lot line if the\nenterprise generating the odor is the only enterprise located on a lot. For purposes of this\nsubdivision, the \"odor threshold\" is defined as the minimum concentration in air of a gas,\nvapor, or particulate matter that can be detected by the olfactory systems of a panel of\nhealthy observers.\ne) Require for its operations a daily average of more than 200 gallons of water per employee.\nf) Create any electrical disturbance that adversely affects any operations or equipment other\nthan those of the creator of such disturbance, or otherwise causes, creates, or contributes\nto\nthe interference with electronic signals (including television and radio broadcasting\ntransmissions) to the extent that the operation of any equipment not owned by the creator\nof such disturbance is adversely affected.\nSection 16-10.10. Combination Uses. When a combination use comprises two or more principal\nuses that require different types of permits (zoning or special use), then the permit authorizing\nthe combination use shall be:\na) A special use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a special use permit.\nb) A zoning permit in all other cases.\nThis is indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses by the designation Z and S in each of the columns\nadjacent to the 29.000 classification.\n16-10.10.1. Subject to Section 16-10.10.2 when a combination use in an R-6 or R-10 zoning\ndistrict consists of a residential subdivision and a multi-family development, the total density\npermissible on the lot shall be determined by having the developer indicate on the plans the\nportion of the total lot that will be developed for each purpose and calculating the density\nfor each portion as if it were a separate lot.\n16-10.10.2. Notwithstanding Section 16-12.2.2 whenever a combination use consists of a\nstandard residential subdivision and a multi-family development, and the subdivided portion\nof the tract contains lots that exceed the minimum lot size requirements set forth in Section\n16-181, but that do not exceed an average of 30,000 square feet, then the density of the\nportion of the tract developed for multi-family purposes may be increased beyond the\npermissible density calculated in accordance with Section 16-10.10.1. The increase in density\nshall be determined as follows:\na) The minimum lot size requirement for the applicable zoning district shall be subtracted\nfrom each lot that exceeds the minimum lot size, and the remainders totaled.\nb) The sum derived from the calculation in subdivision (1) shall be divided by the minimum\nlot size requirement. Fractions shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.\nc)\nThe product of the calculation in subdivision (2) shall yield the number of additional multi-\nfamily dwelling units that may be located within the portion of tract developed for multi-\nfamily purposes.\n10-5\n"}, {"page": "100", "text": "Town Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n16-10.10.3. When a residential use is combined with a non-residential use in a business\ndistrict, the lot must have at least the minimum square footage required for the residential\nuse alone.\n16-10.10.4. When two principal uses are combined, the total amount of parking required for\nthe combination use shall be determined by cumulating the amount of parking required for\neach individual principal use according to the relative amount of space occupied by that use.\nSection 16-10.11. More Specific Use Controls. Whenever a development could fall within more\nthan one use classification in the Table of Permissible Uses, the classification that most closely\nand most specifically describes the development controls. For example, a small doctor's office\nor clinic clearly falls within the 3.110 classification (Office and service operations conducted\nentirely indoors and designed to attract customers or clients to the premises). However,\nclassification 3.130, \"Physicians and dentists offices and clinics occupying not more than 10,000\nsquare feet of gross floor area\" more specifically covers this use and therefore is controlling.\nSection 16-10.12. Short-Term Rentals. The Board finds that short-term rentals (STRs) are an\nappropriate use given the residential/resort character of Blowing Rock's planning jurisdiction,\nprovided that specific controls are in place to regulate parking, trash, noise, tenant safety, and\nother related effects thereby protecting neighborhood property values, and the health, safety,\nand the general welfare of Town citizens and visitors.\nShort-term rentals are defined as the rental, lease, or offer to make available, any attached or\ndetached residential dwelling unit, or portion thereof, by way of a rental agreement, lease,\nlicense, or any other means, (whether oral or written) for compensation or consideration, for a\nduration that is less than 28 consecutive days. The following standards shall apply to all short-\nterm rentals with the Town's planning jurisdiction:\na) A zoning permit must be initially obtained for a change in use for each dwelling unit that is to\nbe rented for a period of less than 28 days. The permit is not valid until a satisfactory\ninspection is completed.\nb) A local contact person or management company contact information must be clearly posted\non the interior of the dwelling unit, and the person/company shall be available to respond to\ncomplaints or emergencies within one (1) hour.\nc) Sufficient off-street parking must be provided for each bedroom to be rented. The parking\nspace must meet the minimum dimensional requirements in Section 16-20.6. Short-term\nrental units that exist on July 1, 2018, are grandfathered with respect to parking, but each\nbedroom added after this date requires an additional parking space.\nd) Adequate trash and recycling containers must be provided. If collection containers are kept\nin an enclosure bin, the bin must meet minimum design standards defined in the Town Code\n(ex. Placed within 6 to 12 feet of the edge of the street, opaque screening at least four feet\nhigh, etc.).\ne) The dwelling unit must be equipped with operable smoke detectors and carbon monoxide\ndetectors consistent with the NC Building Code.\nf)\nThe 911 address must be posted on the front of the house or dwelling unit with 3.5-inch\nreflective numbers (6-inch reflective number if commercial or multi-family) or on the\n10-6\n"}, {"page": "101", "text": "Town Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nproperty according to Section 7-17 of the Town Code. The 911 address must be clearly posted\non the interior of the dwelling unit to notify tenants in case of emergency.\n16-10.12.1. In addition to those areas zoned to allow short-term rentals (CB, TC, GB, OI), there\nare other areas where short-term rentals are permissible including Chetola Resort and Royals\nOaks Condominiums (Overlay District). There are other properties that were previously\noperating short-term rentals or had permitted vested rights through Watauga or Caldwell\nCounty prior to being annexed or added to the Extraterritorial Jurisdiction. These properties\nhave a legal nonconforming status that provides the opportunity for short-term rental. Each\nproperty owner that applies for a zoning permit for short-term rental use in areas not\npermitted by right or listed herein must provide historical documentation that the\nnonconformity has been legally obtained or a vested right has been legally established under\nNCGS 160D-108.\n10-7\n"}, {"page": "102", "text": "Town Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n10-8\n"}, {"page": "103", "text":

Street Classification. In all new subdivisions, streets that are dedicated to public\nuse shall be classified as provided herein. The classification shall be based upon the projected\nvolume of traffic to be carried by the street, stated in terms of the number of trips per day. The\nnumber of dwelling units to be served by the street may be used as a useful indicator of the\nnumber of trips but is not conclusive. Whenever a subdivision street continues an existing street\nthat formerly terminated outside the subdivision or it is expected that a subdivision street will be\ncontinued beyond the subdivision at some future time, the classification of the street will be\nbased upon the street in its entirety, both within and outside of the subdivision.\n16-14.1.1. The classification of streets shall be as designated herein.\n16-14.1.1.1. Minor. A street whose sole function is to provide access to abutting\nproperties. It serves or is designed to serve not more than nine dwelling units and is\nexpected to or does handle up to seventy-five trips per day.\n16-14.1.1.2. Local. A street whose sole function is to provide access to abutting\nproperties.

Cul-de-sac. A street that terminates in a vehicular turn-around.\n16-14.1.1.4. Sub-collector. A street whose sole principal function is to provide access to\nabutting properties but is also designed to be used or is used to connect minor and local\nstreets with collector or arterial streets. Including residences indirectly served through\nconnecting streets, it serves or is designed to serve at least twenty-six but not more than\none hundred dwelling units and is expected to or does handle between two hundred and\neight hundred trips per day.\n16-14.1.1.5. Collector. A street whose principal function is to carry traffic between minor,\nlocal, and sub-collector streets and arterial streets but that may also provide direct access\nto abutting properties. It serves or is designed to serve, directly or indirectly, more than\none hundred dwelling units and is designed to be used or is used to carry more than eight\nhundred trips per day.\n16-14.1.1.6. Arterial. A major street in the city's street system that serves as an avenue\nfor the circulation of traffic into, out, or around the city and carries high volumes of traffic.\n16-14.1.1.7. Marginal Access Street. A street that is parallel to and adjacent to an arterial\nstreet and that is designed to provide access to abutting properties so that these\nproperties are somewhat sheltered from the effects of the through traffic on the arterial\nstreet and so that the flow of traffic on the arterial street is not impeded by direct\ndriveway access from a large number of abutting properties.\nSection 16-14.2. Access to Public Streets in General. Every lot shall have either direct or indirect\naccess to a public street.

Access to Arterial Streets. Whenever a major subdivision that involves the\ncreation of one or more new streets borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial\nstreet, no direct driveway access may be provided from the lots within this subdivision onto this\nstreet.\nSection 16-14.4. Entrances to Streets. All driveway entrances and other openings onto streets\nwithin the Town's planning jurisdiction shall be constructed so that:\na) Vehicles can enter and exit from the lot in question without posing any substantial danger to\nthemselves, pedestrians, or vehicles traveling in abutting streets; and\nb) Interference with the free and convenient flow of traffic in abutting or surrounding streets is\nminimized.\n16-14.4.1. As provided in G.S. 136-93, no person may construct any driveway entrance or\nother opening onto a state-maintained street except in accordance with a permit issued by\nthe North Carolina Department of Transportation. Issuance of this permit is prima facie\nevidence of compliance with the standard set forth in Section 16-4.4.\n16-14.4.2.

In addition, the permit-issuing authority may require temporary\nturnarounds to be constructed at the end of such streets pending their extension when such\nturnarounds appear necessary to facilitate the flow of traffic or accommodate emergency\nvehicles. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, no temporary dead-end\nstreet in excess of 1,000 feet may be created unless no other practicable alternative is\navailable.\nSection 16-14.6. Relationship of Streets with Topography. Streets shall be related appropriately\nto the topography. In particular, streets shall be designed to facilitate the drainage and storm\nwater runoff objectives set forth in Article 16, and street grades shall conform as closely as\npracticable to the original topography. The maximum grade for all public streets and private\nroads shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%).\nSection 16-14.7. Street Width, Sidewalk, and Drainage Requirements in Subdivisions. Street\nrights-of-way are designed and developed to serve several functions:\na) to carry motor vehicle traffic, and in some cases, allow on-street parking;\nb) to provide a safe and convenient passageway for pedestrian traffic; and\nc) to serve as an important link in the Town's drainage system.\nThe Board finds that, when properly constructed, streets developed without curb and gutter but\nwith shoulders and drainage swales may serve all these functions while lowering post\ndevelopment storm water runoff and minimizing development costs. Therefore, minor, local and\nsub-collector streets where the grade does not exceed ten percent may be developed with a\nright-of-way width of thirty feet, pavement width of eighteen feet, two feet wide shoulders on\neither side, and drainage swales on either side, all constructed in accordance with the\nspecifications referenced in Section 16-14.10.\nExcept as otherwise provided herein, all streets shall be constructed with curb and gutter and\nshall conform to the other requirements of this subsection.

Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles,\nand no two streets may intersect at an angle less than 60\u00b0. Not more than two streets shall\nintersect at any one point, unless the public works director certifies to the permit-issuing\nauthority that such an intersection can be constructed with no extraordinary danger to public\nsafety.\n16-14.9.1. Whenever possible, proposed intersections along one side of a street shall coincide\nwith existing or proposed intersections on the opposite side of such street. In any event,\nwhere a center line offset (jog) occurs at an intersection, the distance between centerlines of\nthe intersecting streets shall be not less than 150 feet.\n16-14.9.2. No two streets may intersect with any other street on the same side at a distance\nof less than 400 feet measured from centerline to centerline of the intersecting street.

Findings of Fact. The flood hazard areas of Blowing Rock are subject to periodic\ninundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of\ncommerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and\nrelief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and\ngeneral welfare.\nThese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing\nincreases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses\nvulnerable to floods.\nSection 16-16.2. Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public\nhealth, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood\nconditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:\na) restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or\nerosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or\nvelocities;\nb)\nrequire that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected\nagainst flood damage at the time of initial construction;\nc)\ncontrol the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers\nwhich are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;\nd) control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood\ndamage; and,\ne) prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood\nwaters, or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\nSection 16-16.3 Objectives. The objectives of this article are:\na) to protect human life and health;\nb) to minimize expenditure or public money for costly flood control projects;\nc) to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally\nundertaken at the expense of the general public;\nd) to minimize prolonged business interruptions;\ne) to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,\ntelephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;\nf) to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood\nprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and\ng) to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.\n16-1\n"}, {"page": "151", "text": "Town Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nSection 16-16.4.

Before the Watershed Review Board may grant a variance, it shall make the\nfollowing three findings, which shall be recorded in the permanent record of the case and\nshall include the factual reasons on which they are based.\n16-16.36.2.3.1. There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of\ncarrying out the strict letter of this article. In order to determine that there are\npractical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, the Board must find that the five\nfollowing conditions exist:\na) If the applicant complies with the provisions of this article, they can secure no\nreasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of, their property. Merely\nproving that the variance would permit a greater profit to be made from the\nproperty will not be considered adequate to justify the Board in granting a\nvariance. Moreover, the Board shall consider whether the variance is the\nminimum possible deviation from the terms of this article that will make possible\nthe reasonable use of their property.\nb) The hardship results from the application of this article to the property rather than\nfrom other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardships.\nc) The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such as its\nsize, shape, or topography, which is different from that of neighboring property.\n16-21\n"}, {"page": "171", "text": "Town Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\nd) The hardship is not the result of actions of an applicant who knowingly or\nunknowingly violates this article, or who purchases the property after the effective\ndate of the Ordinance, and then comes to the Board for relief.\ne) The hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property, rather than the result of\nconditions that are widespread. If other properties are equally subject to the\nhardship created in the restriction, then granting a variance would be a special\nprivilege denied to others and would not promote equal justice.\n16-16.36.2.3.2. The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this\narticle and preserves its spirit.\n16-16.36.2.3.3. In the granting of the variance, the public safety and welfare have\nbeen assured and substantial justice has been done. The Board shall not grant a\nvariance if it finds that doing so would in any respect impair the public health, safety,\nor general welfare.\n16-16.36.2.3.4. In granting the variance, the Board may attach thereto such\nconditions regarding the location, character, and features of the proposed building,\nstructure, or use as it may deem advisable in furtherance of the purposes of this\narticle. If a variance for the construction, alteration, or use of property is granted,\nsuch construction, alteration, or use shall be in accordance with the approved site\nplan.\n16-16.36.2.3.5. The Watershed Review Board shall refuse to hear an appeal or an\napplication for a variance previously denied if it finds that there have been no\nsubstantial changes in conditions or circumstances bearing on the appeal or\napplication.\n16-16.36.2.3.6. A variance issued in accordance with this Section shall be considered\na Watershed Protection Permit and shall expire if a Building Permit or Watershed\nOccupancy Permit for such use is not obtained by the applicant within twelve months\nfrom the date of the decision.\n16-16.36.2.3.7. If the application calls for the granting of a major variance, and if the\nWatershed Review Board decides in favor of granting the variance, the Board shall\nprepare a preliminary record of the hearing with all deliberate speed. The preliminary\nrecord of the hearing shall include:\na) The variance application;\nb) The hearing notices;\nc) The evidence presented;\nd) Motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence, and rulings on them;\ne) Proposed findings and exceptions;\nf)\nThe proposed decision, including all conditions proposed to be added to the\npermit.\n16-16.36.2.3.8.

Tourists, in large part, are attracted to the history, natural environment, scenic beauty,\nand aesthetic character of the community.\nA proliferation of signs in the Town would result in visual blight and unattractiveness and would\nconvey an image that is inconsistent with a high-quality, resort environment. In order to preserve\nthe quality, character, and economic vitality of the community, these sign regulations are\nintended to:\na) Create a balance between the need to advertise, identify, and communicate and the desire\nto maintain a safe, healthful, and attractive resort community environment.\nb) Enhance the general welfare of the community by protecting property values and preserving\nthe natural environment, the unique character, and the aesthetic integrity of the community.\nThe preservation of Blowing Rock's appearance and natural beauty from excessive and\nobtrusive signs is a matter of critical importance to the Town because of its reliance on\ntourism.\nc) Enhance the identification of public and private buildings and the effectiveness of visual\ncommunication by controlling the number, location, size, appearance, and illumination of\nsigns.\nd) Allow signs that are appropriate for the zoning district in which they are located and are\nconsistent with the category of use to which they pertain.\ne) Permit signs that are compatible with their surroundings and that are consistent with the\nscenic beauty and aesthetic quality of the community.\nf)\nImprove pedestrian and traffic safety through the proper placement of signs.\ng)\nProtect the public from the dangers of unsafe signs, and require that signs be constructed,\ninstalled, and maintained in a safe and satisfactory manner.\nh) Lessen the confusion, visual clutter, and sight impairment that can be caused by the\nproliferation, improper placement, excessive illumination, and disproportionate sizes of signs\nwhen such signs are not properly controlled or regulated.\nSection 16-17.2.

Purpose. It is the purpose of this Article to regulate adult business\nestablishments in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the Town\nof Blowing Rock, as well as to establish reasonable and uniform regulations and licensing\nrequirements to prevent the harmful location and concentration of adult business\nestablishments in Blowing Rock. Adult business establishments, because of their very nature, are\nrecognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics. Studies and experiences\nthat are relevant to North Carolina have shown that lower property values and increased crime\nrates tend to accompany and are brought about by adult business establishments. The Board of\nCommissioners finds that regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse\nsecondary effects do not have harmful impacts on the health, safety, morals, welfare, or peace\nand dignity of the Town and do not contribute to the blighting of surrounding neighborhoods.\n16-19.1.1. The provisions of this ordinance have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a\nlimitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually\noriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this ordinance to restrict or\ndeny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to\ndeny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their\nintended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this ordinance to condone or legitimize\nthe distribution of obscene material.\n16-19.1.2. This ordinance represents a balancing of the legitimate ends of the community by\nimposing an incidental, content-neutral, place, time, and manner regulation of adult business\nestablishments, without limiting alternative avenues of communication; and, at the same\ntime, requiring the business to carry its share of the financing, administrative, and\nenforcement activities.\nSection 16-19.2. Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult\nuses on the community presented in hearings and reports made available to the Board, and on\nfindings incorporated in the cases of City of Reton V. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S.41 (1986),\nYoung V. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes V. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S.\n560 (1991), and on studies in other communities, including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona;\nGarden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Indianapolis, Indiana;\nMinneapolis, Minnesota; Cleveland, Ohio; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Amarillo, Texas; Austin,\nTexas; Beaumont, Texas; Houston, Texas; and Seattle, Washington; and also on the findings from\nthe Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented\nBusinesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Board makes the following findings.\n16-19.2.1. Adult business establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy\nactivities, the control of which elsewhere presents challenges to the operators of such\nestablishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism in this Town to make the owners\nof such establishments responsible for the activities that would occur on their premises.\n19-1\n"}, {"page": "204", "text": "Town Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n16-19.2.2. Certain employees of adult business establishments defined in this ordinance as\nadult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual\nbehavior than employees of other establishments.\n16-19.2.3. Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at adult business\nestablishments, especially those that provide poorly lit, overly crowded, private or semi-\nprivate areas, booths, or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.\n16-19.2.4. Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other adult business\nestablishments for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such\nestablishments.\n16-19.2.5. At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in adult\nbusiness establishments, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human\nimmunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, and hepatitis B.\n16-19.2.6. The surgeon general of the United States in a report of October 22, 1986, has\nadvised the American public that AIDS and HIV infections may be transmitted through sexual\ncontact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and\nfrom an infected mother to the newborn.\n16-19.2.7. According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis\nand gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.\n16-19.2.8. Sanitary conditions in some adult business establishments are unhealthy, in part,\nbecause the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the\nunregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the\nfacilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities.\n16-19.2.9. Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas\nof adult businesses where persons view \"adult\" oriented films.\n16-19.2.10. The findings noted in paragraphs number 1 through 9 raise substantial\ngovernmental concerns.\n16-19.2.11. Adult business establishments have operational characteristics that should be\nreasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.\n16-19.2.12. A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the\nburden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the adult business\nestablishments. Further, such a licensing procedure will establish an incentive for the owners\nand operators to see that the adult business establishment is run in a manner consistent with\nthe health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the\nTown. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual\noperator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises\nand activities occurring therein.\n16-19.2.13. Prohibition of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises\nwith adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and\nunsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult business establishments.\n19-2\n"}, {"page": "205", "text": "Town Code of Blowing Rock, North Carolina\n16-19.2.14. Requiring licensees of adult business establishments to keep information\nregarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of\ncertain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or\nsuspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments.\n16-19.2.15. The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for\nthe day-to-day operation and maintenance of adult business establishments, where such\ninformation is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation\nof such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.\n16-19.2.16. It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain\na limited amount of information regarding employees who may engage in the conduct that\nthis ordinance is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.\n16-19.2.17. The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually\nrelated crime leads to the rational concern that the applicant may engage in that conduct in\ncontravention of this ordinance.\n16-19.2.18. The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period\nof years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct that leads to the transmission of\nsexually transmitted diseases.\n16-19.2.19. The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the Town will be\npromoted by the enactment of this ordinance.\nSection 16-19.3. Classification of Adult Business Establishments. Adult business\nEstablishments are classified as follows:\na) Adult arcades;\nb) Adult bookstores, adult novelty stores, or adult video stores;\nc) Adult cabarets;\nd) Adult motels;\ne) Adult motion picture theaters;\nf) Adult theaters;\ng) Escort agencies;\nh) Nude model studios; or\ni) Sexual encounter centers.\nSection 16-19.4. Licenses Required. It shall be unlawful for any person to operate or maintain\nan adult business establishment unless the owner or operator thereof has obtained an adult\nestablishment license from the Town. It shall also be unlawful for any person to operate such\nbusiness after such license has been revoked or suspended by the Town or has expired.\n16-19.4.1. It shall be unlawful for any person who operates an adult business establishment\nto employ a person to work or perform for the adult business establishment who is not\nlicensed as an adult establishment employee by the Town.\n16-19.4.2.

For all other changes in use, no additional parking is required.\n16-20.3.2. A one-time addition of bathrooms, storage or equipment areas less than 250\nsquare feet is not required to provide additional parking.\n16-20.3.3. Short-term rentals that legally exist on or before July 1, 2018 are grandfathered\nwith respect to required parking. If any dwelling unit is expanded to add a bedroom that will\nbe used for short-term rentals, the owner must provide an off-street parking space that\nmeets the dimensional requirements of the Land Use Code.\nSection 16-20.4. Flexibility in Administration Required. The Board recognizes that, due to the\nparticularities of any given development, the inflexible application of the parking standards set\nforth in herein may result in a development either with inadequate parking spaces or parking\nspace far in excess of its needs. The former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking\nviolations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots. The latter\nsituation results in a waste of money as well as a waste of space that could more desirably be\nused for valuable development or environmentally useful open space. Therefore, as suggested in\nSection 16-20.1, the permit-issuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive\nrequirements of 16-20.2 and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever it finds\nthat such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in Section 16-20.1.\n16-20.4.1. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the permit-issuing authority may\nallow deviations from the parking requirements set forth in 16-20.1.5 when it finds that:\na) A residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly; or\nb) A business is primarily oriented toward walk-in trade.\n16-20.4.2. Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the\npresumptive parking requirements set forth in 16-20.2 it shall enter on the face of the permit\nthe parking requirement that it imposes and the reasons for allowing or requiring the\ndeviation.\n16-20.4.3. If the permit-issuing authority concludes, based upon information it receives in the\nconsideration of a specific development proposal, that the presumption established by\nSubsection 16-16-20.2 for a particular use classification is erroneous, it shall initiate a request\nfor an amendment to the Table of Parking Requirements in accordance with the procedures\nset forth in Article 20.\nSection 16-20.5. Payment of Fee in Lieu of Providing Required Parking Spaces. With respect to\nproperties within the TC, CB and O-I districts that are developed for commercial purposes, the\npermit-issuing authority may authorize the developer to forego the construction of parking\nspaces otherwise required on the developer's property pursuant to the provisions of this Article\nfor commercial uses if:\na) the permit-issuing authority finds that the parking needs of such development can be met by\npublic parking facilities that are located or expected to be constructed within a reasonable\ntime within reasonable proximity to the proposed development, and\nb)\nthe developer pays to the Town for each such space that is not constructed a fee in lieu of\nproviding that space in an amount determined as provided herein.

Circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can proceed safely without\nposing a danger to pedestrians or other vehicles and without interfering with parking areas.\nSection 16-20.9. Vehicle Accommodation Area Surfaces. Vehicle accommodation areas that\ninclude lanes for drive-in windows or contain parking areas that are required to have more than\nten parking spaces and that are used regularly at least five days per week shall be graded and\nsurfaced with asphalt, concrete or other material that will provide equivalent protection against\npotholes, erosion, and dust. Driveways serving only 1 dwelling unit need not be paved.\nSpecifications for surfaces meeting the standard set forth in this subsection are contained in\nAppendix D.\n16-20.9.1. Vehicle accommodation areas that are not provided with the type of surface\nspecified in subsection (A) shall be graded and surfaced with crushed stone, gravel, or other\nsuitable material (as provided in the specifications set forth in Appendix D) to provide a\nsurface that is stable and will help to reduce dust and erosion. The perimeter of such parking\nareas shall be defined by bricks, stones, railroad ties, or other similar devices. In addition,\nwhenever such a vehicle accommodation area abuts a paved street, the driveway leading\nfrom such street to such area (or, if there is no driveway, the portion of the vehicle\naccommodation area that opens onto such streets), shall be paved as provided in subsection\n(A) for a distance of fifteen feet back from the edge of the paved street.\n16-20.9.2. The requirement of this Section shall not apply to driveways or turnouts serving\nonly single-family residences, duplexes, multi-family residences consisting of two dwelling\nunits, or other uses that are required to have only one or two parking spaces.\n16-20.9.3.

One parking area may contain required\nspaces for several different uses; however, except as otherwise provided in this section, the\nrequired space assigned to one use may not be credited to any other use.\n16-20.10.1. To the extent that developments that wish to make joint use of the same parking\nspaces operate at different times, the same spaces may be credited to both uses. For\nexample, if a parking lot is used in connection with an office building on Monday through\nFriday but is generally 90% vacant on weekends, another development that operates only on\nweekends could be credited with 90% of the spaces on that lot. Or, if a church parking lot is\ngenerally occupied only to 50% of capacity on days other than Sunday, another development\ncould make use of 50% of the church lot's spaces on those other days.\n16-20.10.2. If the joint use of the same parking spaces by two or more principal uses involves\nsatellite parking spaces, then the provisions of Section 16-20.11are also applicable.\nSection 16-20.11. Satellite Parking. If the number of off-street parking spaces required by this\nchapter cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot where the principal use associated with\nthese parking spaces is located, then spaces may be provided on adjacent or nearby lots in\naccordance with the provisions of this section. These off-site spaces are referred to in this section\nas \"satellite\" parking spaces.\n16-20.11.1. All such satellite parking spaces (except spaces intended for employee use) must\nbe located within 600 feet of a public entrance of a principal building housing the use\nassociated with such parking, or within 600 feet of the lot on which the use associated with\nsuch parking is located if the use is not housed within any principal building. Satellite parking\nspaces intended for employee use may be located within any reasonable distance.\n16-20.11.2. The developer wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this section must\npresent satisfactory written evidence that he has the permission of the owner or other person\nin charge of the satellite parking spaces to use such spaces. Satellite spaces must not be\nshared by another business unless the joint use of spaces meets the provisions found in\nSection 16-20.8. The developer must also sign an acknowledgment that the continuing\nvalidity of the permit depends upon the continuing ability to provide the requisite number of\nparking spaces. If the satellite spaces become invalid, the developer must secure other on-\nsite or satellite parking within 90 days and/or pay for each lost space into the Parking Fund at\nthe prevailing rate per space.\n16-20.11.3.

The Board\nfinds that:\na) Screening between two lots lessens the transmission from one lot to another of noise, dust,\nand glare.\nb)\nScreening can lessen the visual effects that may otherwise occur within an urbanized area.\nEven minimal screening can provide an impression of separation of spaces, and more\nextensive screening can shield entirely one use from the visual assault of an adjacent use.\nc)\nScreening can establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion, the degree\nof privacy varying with the intensity of the screening.\nd) The provisions of this part are necessary to safeguard the public health, safety and welfare.\nSection 16-22.2. General Screening Standard. Every development shall provide sufficient\nscreening so that:\na) Neighboring properties are shielded from any adverse external effects of that development;\nb) The development is shielded from the negative impacts of adjacent uses such as streets or\nrailroads.\nScreening shall be located and maintained so as not to interfere with vehicular and pedestrian\ntraffic.\nSection 16-22.3.

The portion of\nintermittent visual obstructions may contain deciduous plants. Suggested planting patterns\nthat will achieve this standard are included in Appendix E.\n16-22.6.2. Semi-Opaque Screen, Type \"B\". A screen that is opaque from the ground to a\nheight of three feet, with intermittent visual obstruction from above the opaque portion to a\nheight of at least twenty feet. The semi-opaque screen is intended to partially block visual\ncontact between uses and to create a strong impression of the separation of spaces. The\nsemi-opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted\nvegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural\nvegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of\nthe subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation.
