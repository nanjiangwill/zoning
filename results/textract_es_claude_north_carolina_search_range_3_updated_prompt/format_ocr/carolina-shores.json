For\nthe purpose of this section, properties are \"abutting\" even if separated by a street, railroad, or other transportation corridor. This notice must\nbe deposited in the mail at least ten but not more than 25 days prior to the date of the hearing. If the zoning map amendment is being\nproposed in conjunction with an expansion of the town's ETJ, a single hearing on the zoning map amendment and the boundary amendment\nmay be held. In this instance, the initial notice of the zoning map amendment hearing may be combined with the boundary hearing notice and\nthe combined hearing notice mailed at least 30 days prior to the hearing.\n(2) Optional notice for large- scale zoning map amendments. The first class mail notice required under division (B) of this section shall\nnot be required if the zoning map amendment proposes to change the zoning designation of more than 50 properties, owned by at least 50\ndifferent property owners, and the town elects to use the expanded published notice provided for in this division.

When a zoning map amendment is proposed, the town shall prominently post a notice of the hearing on the site\nproposed for the amendment or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way. The notice shall be posted within the same time period\nspecified for mailed notices of the hearing. When multiple parcels are included within a proposed zoning map amendment, a posting on each\nindividual parcel is not required but the town shall post sufficient notices to provide reasonable notice to interested persons.\n(4) Actual notice. Except for town-initiated zoning map amendment, when an application is filed to request a zoning map amendment and\nthat application is not made by the landowner or authorized agent, the applicant shall certify to the town that the owner of the parcel of land as\nshown on the county tax listing has received actual notice of the proposed amendment and a copy of the notice of the hearing.

The statement of reasonableness and the plan consistency statement required by this section may be\napproved as a single statement.\n(Ord. eff. 9-6-2012, \u00a7 4.1; Am. Ord. 16-1, passed 4-7-2016; Am. Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n91.51 MORATORIA.\nIn accordance with G.S. \u00a7 160D-107, the town may adopt temporary moratoria on any development approval required by law, except for the\npurpose of developing and adopting new or amended plans or development regulations governing residential uses. The duration of any\nmoratorium shall be reasonable in light of the specific conditions that warrant imposition of the moratorium and may not exceed the period of\ntime necessary to correct, modify, or resolve such conditions.\n(Ord. eff. 9-6-2012, \u00a7 4.3; Am. Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n\u00a7 91.52 VESTED RIGHTS AND PERMIT CHOICE.\n(A) Findings. Town approval of development typically follows significant investment in site evaluation, planning, development costs,\nconsultant fees, and related expenses. Therefore, it is necessary and desirable to provide for the establishment of certain vested rights in\norder to ensure reasonable certainty, stability, and fairness in the development regulation process, secure reasonable expectations of\nlandowners, and foster cooperation between the public and private sectors in land-use planning and development regulation.\n(B) Permit choice. If an application made in accordance with local regulation is submitted for a development approval required pursuant to\nthis chapter and a development regulation changes between the time the application was submitted and a decision is made, the applicant\nmay choose which version of the development regulation will apply to the application. If the development permit applicant chooses the version\nof the rule or ordinance applicable at the time of the permit application, the development permit applicant shall not be required to await the\noutcome of the amendment to the rule, map, or ordinance prior to acting on the development permit. This section applies to all development\napprovals issued by the state and by local governments. The duration of vested rights created by development approvals are as set forth in\ndivision (D).\n(C) Process to claim vested right. A person claiming a statutory or common law vested right may submit information to substantiate that\nclaim to the UDO Administrator, who shall make an initial determination as to the existence of the vested right. The UDO Administrator's\ndetermination may be appealed under G.S. \u00a7 160D-405. On appeal the existence of a vested right shall be reviewed de novo. In lieu of\nseeking such a determination, a person claiming a vested right may bring an original civil action as provided in G.S. \u00a7 160D-405(c).\n(D) Types and duration of statutory vested rights. Except as provided by this section and subject to division (B), amendments to this\nchapter shall not be applicable or enforceable with regard to development that has been permitted or approved pursuant to this chapter so\nlong as one of the approvals listed in this division remains valid and unexpired. Each type of vested right listed below is defined by and is\nsubject to the limitations provided in this section and the cited statutes. Vested rights established under this section are not mutually\nexclusive. The establishment of a vested right under one division does not preclude vesting under one or more other divisions or by common\nlaw principles.\n(1) Six months - building permits. Pursuant to G.S. \u00a7 160D-1110, a building permit expires six months after issuance unless work under\nthe permit has commenced. Building permits also expire if work is discontinued for a period of 12 months after work has commenced.\n(2) One year - other local development approvals. Pursuant to G.S. \u00a7 160D-403(c), unless otherwise specified by this section, statute, or\nlocal ordinance, all other local development approvals expire one year after issuance unless work has substantially commenced. Expiration of\na local development approval does not affect the duration of a vested right established as a site-specific vesting plan, a multiphase\ndevelopment plan, a development agreement, or vested rights established under common law.\n(3) Two to five years - site specific vesting plans.\n(a) Duration. A vested right for a site-specific vesting plan shall remain vested for a period of two years. This vesting shall not be\nextended by any amendments or modifications to a site-specific vesting plan unless expressly provided by the town. The town may provide\nthat rights regarding a site specific vesting plan shall be vested for a period exceeding two years, but not exceeding five years if warranted by\nthe size and phasing of development, the level of investment, the need for the development, economic cycles, and market conditions or other\nconsiderations. This determination shall be made in the discretion of the town and shall be made following the process specified by division\n(D)(3) below for the particular form of a site-specific vesting plan involved.\n(b) Relationship to building permits. A right vested as provided in this division shall terminate at the end of the applicable vesting period\nwith respect to buildings and uses for which no valid building permit applications have been filed. Upon issuance of a building permit, the\n"}, {"page": "17", "text": "provisions of G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 160D-1110 and 160D-1113 shall apply, except that the permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the running of\ntime while a vested right under this section exists.\n(c) Requirements for site specific vesting plans. For the purposes of this section, a \"site-specific vesting plan\" means a plan submitted\nto the town describing with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of property. The plan may be in\nthe form of, but not be limited to, any of the following plans or approvals: a planned unit development plan, a subdivision plat, a site plan, a\npreliminary or general development plan, a special use permit, a conditional zoning, or any other development approval as may be used by\nthe town. Unless otherwise expressly provided by the town, the plan shall include the approximate boundaries of the site; significant\ntopographical and other natural features effecting development of the site; the approximate location on the site of the proposed buildings,\nstructures, and other improvements; the approximate dimensions, including height, of the proposed buildings and other structures; and the\napproximate location of all existing and proposed infrastructure on the site, including water, sewer, roads, and pedestrian walkways. The\nTown of Carolina Shores uses existing development approvals, such as a preliminary plat, a special use permit, or a conditional zoning, to\napprove a site-specific vesting plan. A variance shall not constitute a \"site specific vesting plan,\" and approval of a site-specific vesting plan\nwith the condition that a variance be obtained shall not confer a vested right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained. If a sketch\nplan or other document fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property, it\nmay not constitute a site-specific vesting plan.\n(d) Process for approval and amendment of site-specific vesting plans. If a site-specific vesting plan is based on an approval required\nby a local development regulation, the town shall provide whatever notice and hearing is required for that underlying approval. If the duration\nof the underlying approval is less than two years, that shall not affect the duration of the site-specific vesting established by this division. If the\nsite-specific vesting plan is not based on such an approval, a legislative hearing with notice as required by G.S. \u00a7 160D-602 shall be held. The\ntown may approve a site-specific vesting plan upon such terms and conditions as may reasonably be necessary to protect the public health,\nsafety, and welfare. Such conditional approval shall result in a vested right, although failure to abide by such terms and conditions will result in\na forfeiture of vested rights. The town shall not require a landowner to waive vested rights as a condition of developmental approval. A site-\nspecific vesting plan shall be deemed approved upon the effective date of the town's decision approving the plan or such other date as\ndetermined by the Board of Commissioners upon approval. An approved site specific vesting plan and its conditions may be amended with the\napproval of the owner and the town as follows: Any substantial modification must be reviewed and approved in the same manner as the\noriginal approval; minor modifications may be approved by staff, if such are defined and authorized by local regulation.\n(4) Seven years - multi-phase developments. A multi-phase development shall be vested for the entire development with the Unified\nDevelopment Ordinance in place at the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phase development. This right\nshall remain vested for a period of seven years from the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phase\ndevelopment. For the purposes of this division, \"multi-phase development\" means a development containing 100 acres of more that: (i) is\nsubmitted for site plan approval for construction to occur in more than one phase; and (ii) is subject to a master development plan with\ncommitted elements, including a requirement to offer land for public use as a condition of its master development plan approval.\n(5) Indefinite - development agreements. A vested right of reasonable duration may be specified in a development agreement approved\nunder \u00a7 91.53 of this chapter.\n(E) Continuing review. Following approval or conditional approval of a statutory vested right, the town may make subsequent reviews and\nrequire approvals by the town to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval, provided that such reviews and\napprovals are not inconsistent with the original approval. The town may revoke the original approval for failure to comply with applicable terms\nand conditions of the original approval or the applicable local development regulations.\n(F) Exceptions.\n(1) A vested right, once established as provided for by divisions (C) or (D) of $91.52, precludes any zoning action by a local government\nthat would change, alter, impair prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the property as set forth in an approved\nvested right, except:\n(a) With the written consent of the affected landowner;\n(b) Upon findings, after notice and an evidentiary hearing, that natural or man-made hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the\nproperty, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health, and safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as\ncontemplated in the approved vested right;\n(c) To the extent that the affected landowner receives compensation for all costs, expenses, and other losses incurred by the\nlandowner, including, but not limited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and other\nconsultant's fees incurred after approval by the town, together with interest as is provided in 91.13. Compensation shall not include any\ndiminution in the value of the property that is caused by such action;\n(d) Upon findings, after notice and an evidentiary hearing, that the landowner or his representative intentionally supplied inaccurate\ninformation or made material misrepresentations that made a difference in the approval by the town of the vested right; or\n(e) Upon the enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or regulation that precludes development as contemplated in the\napproved vested right, in which case the town may modify the affected provisions, upon a finding that the change in state or federal law has a\nfundamental effect on the plan, after notice and an evidentiary hearing.\n(2) The establishment of a vested right under divisions (C) or (D) of $91.52, shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning or other\ndevelopment regulation that imposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or\nregulations that are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to development regulation by the town including, but not limited\nto, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes. Otherwise applicable new regulations shall become effective with respect to\nproperty that is subject to a vested right established under this section upon the expiration or termination of the vested rights period provided\nfor in this section.\n(3) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the establishment of a vested right under this section shall not preclude, change or\nimpair the authority of the town to adopt and enforce development regulation provisions governing nonconforming situations or uses.\n(G) Miscellaneous provisions.\n(1) A vested right obtained under this section is not a personal right, but shall attach to and run with the applicable property. After\napproval of a vested right under this section, all successors to the original landowner shall be entitled to exercise such rights.\n(2) Nothing in this section shall preclude judicial determination, based on common law principles or other statutory provisions, that a\n"}, {"page": "18", "text": "vested right exists in a particular case or that a compensable taking has occurred. Except as expressly provided in this section, nothing in this\nsection shall be construed to alter the existing common law.\n(Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\nEditor's note:\nG.S. \u00a7 160D-405(c) was repealed by SessionLaws 2020-25, S. 10, effective June 19, 2020.\n\u00a7 91.53 DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS.\n(A) Authorization.\n(1) In accordance with G.S. \u00a7 160D-1002, the Town of Carolina Shores finds:\n(a) Development projects often occur in multiple phases over several years, requiring a long-term commitment of both public and\nprivate resources.\n(b) Such developments often create community impacts and opportunities that are difficult to accommodate within traditional zoning\nprocesses.\n(c) Because of their scale and duration, such projects often require careful coordination of public capital facilities planning, financing,\nand construction schedules and phasing of the private development.\n(d) Such projects involve substantial commitments of private capital which developers are usually unwilling to risk without sufficient\nassurances that development standards will remain stable through the extended period of the development.\n(e) Such developments often permit communities and developers to experiment with different or nontraditional types of development\nconcepts and standards, while still managing impacts on the surrounding areas.\n(f) To better structure and manage development approvals for such developments and ensure their proper integration into local capital\nfacilities programs, the town needs flexibility to negotiate such developments.\n(2) The town may enter into development agreements with developers, subject to the procedures of this section. In entering into such\nagreements, the town may not exercise any authority or make any commitment not authorized by general or local act and may not impose\nany tax or fee not authorized by otherwise applicable law.\n(3) This section is supplemental to the powers conferred upon the town and does not preclude or supersede rights and obligations\nestablished pursuant to other law regarding development approvals, site-specific vesting plans, phased vesting plans, or other provisions of\nlaw. A development agreement shall not exempt the property owner or developer from compliance with the state Building Code or State or\nlocal housing codes that are not part of the town's development regulations. When the Board of Commissioners approves the rezoning of any\nproperty associated with a development agreement executed and recorded pursuant to this section, the provisions of \u00a7 91.50(E) apply.\n(4) Development authorized by a development agreement shall comply with all applicable laws, including all ordinances, resolutions,\nregulations, permits, policies, and laws affecting the development of property, including laws governing permitted uses of the property,\ndensity, intensity, design, and improvements.\n(B) Definitions. The following definitions apply in this chapter:\n(1) DEVELOPMENT. The planning for or carrying out of a building activity, the making of a material change in the use or appearance of\nany structure or property, or the dividing of land into two or more parcels. When appropriate to the context, DEVELOPMENT refers to the\nplanning for or the act of developing or to the result of development. Reference to a specific operation is not intended to mean that the\noperation or activity, when part of other operations or activities, is not development. Reference to particular operations is not intended to limit\nthe generality of this item.\n(2) PUBLIC FACILITIES. Major capital improvements, including, but not limited to, transportation, sanitary sewer, solid waste, drainage,\npotable water, educational, parks and recreational, and health systems and facilities.\n(C) Approval of Board of Commissioners required.\n(1) The Town of Carolina Shores may establish procedures and requirements, as provided in this division, to consider and enter into\ndevelopment agreements with developers. A development agreement must be approved by the Board of Commissioners following the\nprocedures specified in division (E).\n(2) The development agreement may, by ordinance, be incorporated, in whole or in part, into any development regulation adopted by\nthe\ntown. A development agreement may be considered concurrently with a zoning map or text amendment affecting the property and\ndevelopment subject to the development agreement. A development agreement may be concurrently considered with and incorporated by\nreference with a sketch plan or preliminary plat required under a subdivision regulation or a site plan or other development approval required\nunder a zoning regulation. If incorporated into a conditional district, the provisions of the development agreement shall be treated as\na\ndevelopment regulation in the event of the developer's bankruptcy.\n(D) Size and duration. The Town of Carolina Shores may enter into a development agreement with a developer for the development of\nproperty as provided in this chapter for developable property of any size. Development agreements shall be of a reasonable term specified in\nthe agreement.\n(E) Public hearing. Before entering into a development agreement, the town shall conduct a legislative hearing on the proposed agreement.\nThe notice provisions of \u00a7 91.50(B) applicable to zoning map amendments shall be followed for this hearing. The notice for the public hearing\nmust specify the location of the property subject to the development agreement, the development uses proposed on the property, and must\nspecify a place where a copy of the proposed development agreement can be obtained.\n(F) Content and modification.\n(1) A development agreement shall, at a minimum, include all of the following:\n(a) A description of the property subject to the agreement and the names of its legal and equitable property owners.\n(b) The duration of the agreement. However, the parties are not precluded from entering into subsequent development agreements that\nmay extend the original duration period.\n"}, {"page": "19", "text": "(c) The development uses permitted on the property, including population densities and building types, intensities, placement on the\nsite, and design.\n(d) A description of public facilities that will serve the development, including who provides the facilities, the date any new public\nfacilities, if needed, will be constructed, and a schedule to assure public facilities are available concurrent with the impacts of the\ndevelopment. In the event that the development agreement provides that the town shall provide certain public facilities, the development\nagreement shall provide that the delivery date of such public facilities will be tied to successful performance by the developer in implementing\nthe proposed development, such as meeting defined completion percentages or other performance standards.\n(e) A description, where appropriate, of any reservation or dedication of land for public purposes and any provisions agreed to by the\ndeveloper that exceed existing laws related to protection of environmentally sensitive property.\n(f) A description, where appropriate, of any conditions, terms, restrictions, or other requirements for the protection of public health,\nsafety, or welfare.\n(g) A description, where appropriate, of any provisions for the preservation and restoration of historic structures.\n(2) A development agreement may also provide that the entire development or any phase of it be commenced or completed within a\nspecified period of time. If required by ordinance or in the agreement, the development agreement shall provide a development schedule,\nincluding commencement dates and interim completion dates at no greater than five-year intervals; provided, however, the failure to meet a\ncommencement or completion date shall not, in and of itself, constitute a material breach of the development agreement pursuant to division\n(H) but must be judged based upon the totality of the circumstances. The developer may request a modification in the dates as set forth in the\nagreement.\n(3) If more than one local government is made party to an agreement, the agreement must specify which local government is responsible\nfor the overall administration of the development agreement. A local or regional utility authority may also be made a party to the development\nagreement.\n(4) The development agreement also may cover any other matter, including defined performance standards, not inconsistent with this\nchapter. The development agreement may include mutually acceptable terms regarding provision of public facilities and other amenities and\nthe allocation of financial responsibility for their provision, provided any impact mitigation measures offered by the developer beyond those\nthat could be required by the local government pursuant to G.S. \u00a7 160D-804 shall be expressly enumerated within the agreement, and\nprovided the agreement may not include a tax or impact fee not otherwise authorized by law.\n(5) Consideration of a proposed major modification of the agreement shall follow the same procedures as required for initial approval of a\ndevelopment agreement. What changes constitute a major modification may be determined by ordinance adopted pursuant to subsection (C)\nor as provided for in the development agreement.\n(6) Any performance guarantees under the development agreement shall comply with $91.67(E)(4).\n(G) Vesting.\n(1) Unless the development agreement specifically provides for the application of subsequently enacted laws, the laws applicable\nto\ndevelopment of the property subject to a development agreement are those in force at the time of execution of the agreement.\n(2) Except for grounds specified in division (H)(5), the town may not apply subsequently adopted ordinances or development policies to a\ndevelopment that is subject to a development agreement.\n(3) In the event state or federal law is changed after a development agreement has been entered into and the change prevents or\nprecludes compliance with one or more provisions of the development agreement, the town may modify the affected provisions, upon a\nfinding that the change in state or federal law has a fundamental effect on the development agreement.\n(4) This section does not abrogate any vested rights otherwise preserved by law.\n(H) Breach and cure.\n(1) Procedures established pursuant to division (C) may require periodic review by the UDO Administrator or other appropriate officer of\nthe town, at which time the developer shall demonstrate good-faith compliance with the terms of the development agreement.\n(2) If the town finds and determines that the developer has committed a material breach of the agreement, the town shall notify the\ndeveloper in writing setting forth with reasonable particularity the nature of the breach and the evidence supporting the finding and\ndetermination and providing the developer a reasonable time in which to cure the material breach.\n(3) If the developer fails to cure the material breach within the time given, then the town unilaterally may terminate or modify the\ndevelopment agreement, provided the notice of termination or modification may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment in the manner\nprovided by \u00a7 91.54(A).\n(4) An ordinance adopted pursuant to division (C) or the development agreement may specify other penalties for breach in lieu of\ntermination, including, but not limited to, penalties allowed for violation of a development regulation. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed\nto abrogate or impair the power of the town to enforce applicable law.\n(5) A development agreement shall be enforceable by any party to the agreement notwithstanding any changes in the development\nregulations made subsequent to the effective date of the development agreement. Any party to the agreement may file an action for injunctive\nrelief to enforce the terms of a development agreement.\n(I) Amendment or termination. Subject to the provisions of $91.53(F)(5), a development agreement may be amended or terminated by\nmutual consent of the parties.\n(J) Change of jurisdiction.\n(1) Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, any development agreement entered into by the town before the effective date of a\nchange of jurisdiction shall be valid for the duration of the agreement or eight years from the effective date of the change in jurisdiction,\nwhichever is earlier. The parties to the development agreement and the town assuming jurisdiction have the same rights and obligations with\nrespect to each other regarding matters addressed in the development agreement as if the property had remained in the previous jurisdiction.\n(2) The town, in assuming jurisdiction, may modify or suspend the provisions of the development agreement if the town determines that\nthe failure of the town to do so would place the residents of the territory subject to the development agreement or the residents of the town, or\n"}, {"page": "20", "text": "both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both.\n(K) Recordation. The developer shall record the agreement with the Brunswick County Register of Deeds within 14 days after the town and\ndeveloper execute an approved development agreement.

The burdens of the development agreement are binding upon, and the benefits of the agreement shall inure to, all successors\nin interest to the parties to the agreement.\n(L) Applicability of procedures to approve debt. In the event that any of the obligations of the town in the development agreement constitute\ndebt, the town shall comply, at the time of the obligation to incur the debt and before the debt becomes enforceable against the town, with\nany applicable constitutional and statutory procedures for the approval of this debt.\n(Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n91.54 APPEALS, VARIANCES AND INTERPRETATIONS.\n(A) Appeals.\n(1) Standing. Any person who has standing as defined in Appendix A or the town may appeal an administrative decision to the Board of\nAdjustment. An appeal is taken by filing a notice of appeal with the Town Clerk. The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for the appeal.\nA\nnotice of appeal shall be considered filed with the Town Clerk when delivered to the Town Hall, and the date and time of filing shall be entered\non the notice by the town staff.\n(2) Judicial challenge. A person with standing may bring a separate and original civil action to challenge the constitutionality of the\nchapter or that it is ultra vires, preempted, or otherwise in excess of statutory authority without filing an appeal under division (A)(1).\n(3) Notice of decision. The official who made the decision shall give written notice to the owner of the property that is the subject of the\ndecision and to the party who sought the decision, if different from the owner. The written notice shall be delivered by personal delivery,\nelectronic mail or by first-class mail.\n(4) Time to appeal. The owner or other party shall have 30 days from receipt of the written notice of the determination within which to file\nan appeal. Any other person with standing to appeal shall have 30 days from receipt from any source of actual or constructive notice of the\ndetermination within which to file an appeal. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, notice pursuant to G.S. \u00a7 160D-403(b) given by first\nclass mail shall be deemed received on the third business day following deposit of the notice for mailing with the United States Postal Service.\n(5) Record of decision. The official who made the decision shall transmit to the Board of Adjustment all documents and exhibits\nconstituting the record upon which the action appealed from is taken. The official shall also provide a copy of the record to the appellant and\nto the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal if the appellant is not the owner.\n(6) Stays. An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays enforcement of the action appealed from and accrual of any\nfines assessed, unless the official who made the decision certifies to the Board of Adjustment after notice of appeal has been filed that\nbecause of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property or because the violation is transitory in nature,\na stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the Unified Development Ordinance. In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be\nstayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Superior Court of Brunswick County. If enforcement proceedings are not\nstayed, the appellant may file with the official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board of Adjustment shall meet to\nhear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a development\napproval or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the Unified Development Ordinance shall not stay the further\nreview of an application for development approvals to use such property; in these situations, the appellant or town may request and the Board\nmay grant a stay of a final decision of development approval applications, including building permits affected by the issue being appealed.\n(7) Alternative dispute resolution. The parties to an appeal that has been made under this division (A) may agree to mediation or other\nforms of alternative dispute resolution.\n(B) Variances.\n(1) An application for a variance shall be submitted to the Board of Adjustment by filing a copy of the application with the UDO\nAdministrator. Applications shall be handled in the same manner as applications for development approvals.\n(2) When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of the Unified Development Ordinance, the Board of\nAdjustment shall vary any of the provisions of the Unified Development Ordinance upon a showing of all of the following:\n(a) Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the Unified Development Ordinance. It shall not be necessary to\ndemonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.\n(b) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size or topography. Hardships resulting from\npersonal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not\nbe the basis for granting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate to make a reasonable accommodation\nunder the Federal Fair Housing Act for a person with a disability.\n(c) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with\nknowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.\n(d) The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose and intent of the Unified Development Ordinance, such that public\nsafety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.\n(3) No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance. Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that\nthe conditions are reasonably related to the variance. Any other development regulation that regulates land use or development may provide\nfor variances from the provisions of those ordinances consistent with the provisions of this division (B).\n(4) The nature of the variance and any conditions attached to it shall be entered on the face of the zoning permit, or the zoning permit\nmay simply note the issuance of the variance and refer to the written record of the variance for further information. All such conditions are\nenforceable in the same manner as any other applicable requirement of this Unified Development Ordinance.\n(C) Interpretations.\n(1) The Board of Adjustment is authorized to interpret the zoning map and to act upon disputed questions of lot lines or district boundary\nlines and similar questions. If such questions arise in the context of an appeal from a decision of the UDO Administrator, they shall be handled\n"}, {"page": "21", "text": "as provided in division (A) above.\n(2) An application for a map interpretation shall be submitted to the Board of Adjustment by filing a standard town appeal form with the\nUDO Administrator. The application shall contain sufficient information to enable the Board of Adjustment to make the necessary\ninterpretation.\n(3) Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the rules of interpretation as specified\nin \u00a7 91.10 shall be applied. Where uncertainties continue to exist after application of the above rules, appeal may be taken to the Board of\nAdjustment as provided in division (A) above of this Unified Development Ordinance.\n(4) Interpretations of the location of floodway and floodplain boundary lines may be made by the UDO Administrator as provided in Part I.\nFlood Damage Prevention of the Environmental Regulations.\n(D) Requests to be heard expeditiously.

Performance guarantees associated with erosion control and stormwater control measures are not subject\nto the provisions of this section.\n(F) Procedure for plat recordation.\n(1) After the effective date of this Unified Development Ordinance, no subdivision plat of land within the town's jurisdiction shall be filed or\nrecorded until it has been submitted to and approved by the appropriate agencies, and until this approval is entered in writing on the face of\nthe plat by the chairperson or head of that agency. All publicly dedicated improvements must be accepted by the Board of Commissioners\ncontingent upon final plat recordation or acceptance of an approved performance bond.\n(2) A plat shall not be filed or recorded by the County Register of Deeds of any subdivision located within the town's jurisdiction that has\nnot been approved in accordance with this Unified Development Ordinance, nor shall the Clerk of Superior Court order or direct the recording\nof a plat if the recording would be in conflict with the requirements of this Unified Development Ordinance.\n(G) Transfer of lots in an unapproved subdivision.\n(1) Any person who, being the owner or agent of the owner of any land located within the planning and development regulation\njurisdiction of the town, thereafter subdivides his land in violation of applicable town ordinances the regulation or transfers or sells land by\nreference to, exhibition of, or any other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the land before the plat has been properly approved under\napplicable town ordinances such regulation and recorded in the office of the Brunswick County Register of Deeds, shall be guilty of a Class\n1\nmisdemeanor. The description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or\ntransferring land shall not exempt the transaction from this penalty. The town may bring an action for injunction of any illegal subdivision,\ntransfer, conveyance, or sale of land, and the court shall, upon appropriate findings, issue an injunction and order requiring the offending party\nto comply with the subdivision ordinance. Building permits required pursuant to G.S. \u00a7 160D-1108 may be denied for lots that have been\nillegally subdivided. In addition to other remedies, the town may institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent the unlawful\nsubdivision of land, to restrain, correct, or abate the violation, or to prevent any illegal act or conduct.\n(2) The provisions of this section shall not prohibit any owner or its agent from entering into contracts to sell or lease by reference to an\napproved preliminary plat for which a final plat has not yet been properly approved under the subdivision regulation or recorded with the\nBrunswick County Register of Deeds, provided the contract does all of the following:\n(a) Incorporates as an attachment a copy of the preliminary plat referenced in the contract and obligates the owner to deliver to the\nbuyer a copy of the recorded plat prior to closing and conveyance.\n(b) Plainly and conspicuously notifies the prospective buyer or lessee that a final subdivision plat has not been approved or recorded at\nthe time of the contract, that no governmental body will incur any obligation to the prospective buyer or lessee with respect to the approval of\nthe final subdivision plat,\nthat changes between the preliminary and final plats are possible, and that the contract or lease may be terminated without breach by the\nbuyer or lessee if the final recorded plat differs in any material respect from the preliminary plat.\n(c) Provides that if the approved and recorded final plat does not differ in any material respect from the plat referred to in the contract,\nthe buyer or lessee may not be required by the seller or lessor to close any earlier than five days after the delivery of a copy of the final\nrecorded plat.\n(d) Provides that if the approved and recorded final plat differs in any material respect from the preliminary plat referred to in the\ncontract, the buyer or lessee may not be required by the seller or lessor to close any earlier than 15 days after the delivery of the final\nrecorded plat, during which 15-day period the buyer or lessee may terminate the contract without breach or any further obligation and may\nreceive a refund of all earnest money or prepaid purchase price.\n"}, {"page": "33", "text": "(3) The provisions of this section shall not prohibit any owner or its agent from entering into contracts to sell or lease land by reference to\nan approved preliminary plat for which a final plat has not been properly approved under the subdivision regulation or recorded with the\nBrunswick County Register of Deeds where the buyer or lessee is any person who has contracted to acquire or lease the land for the purpose\nof engaging in the business of construction of residential, commercial, or industrial buildings on the land, or for the purpose of resale or lease\nof the land to persons engaged in that kind of business, provided that no conveyance of that land may occur and no contract to lease it may\nbecome effective until after the final plat has been properly approved under the subdivision regulation and recorded with the Brunswick\nCounty Register of Deeds.\n(H) Issuance of permits and conveyance of subdivision lots.\n(1) Zoning permits and building permits may be issued by the town for the erection of any building on any lot within a proposed\nsubdivision prior to the final plat of said subdivision being approved in a manner as prescribed by this Unified Development Ordinance and\nrecorded at the Register of Deeds office, provided an improvements permit has been issued by the Brunswick County Health Department, if\nrequired. A certificate of occupancy may not be issued until the final plat has been approved and recorded.\n(2) After the effective date of this Unified Development Ordinance, it shall be illegal for any person being the owner or agent of the owner\nof any land located within the territorial jurisdiction of this Unified Development Ordinance, to subdivide his or her land in violation of this\nUnified Development Ordinance or to transfer or sell land by reference to, exhibition of or any other use of a plat showing a subdivision of the\nland before the plat has been properly approved under the terms of this Unified Development Ordinance.\n(3) The description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transferring\nland shall not exempt the transaction from this penalty. The Board of Commissioners, through its attorney or other official so designated, may\nenjoin an illegal subdivision, transfer or sale of land by action for injunction. Further, violators of this Unified Development Ordinance shall be\nsubject, upon conviction, to fine and/or imprisonment as provided by G.S. \u00a7 14-4. Civil penalties may be issued in accordance with \u00a7 91.14.\n(I) Roadway acceptance procedure.\n(1) At the time of submittal of a preliminary plat with streets proposed to be dedicated for acceptance by the town as public, the Board of\nCommissioners will decide if it will approve the dedication, subject to the street or streets complying with all requirements for acceptance. The\ntown is not obligated to accept a street for maintenance.\n(2) Before a request for acceptance by the town is made, the petitioner(s) for street dedication must provide the following to the UDO\nAdministrator:\n(a) Town Engineer's certification that the street(s) have been properly constructed to town specifications;\n(b) As-built drawings of all street, drainage and other improvements;\n(c) All easement agreements;\n(d) Lien waiver executed by all providers of materials and services; and\n(e) Deed for roadway right-of-way conveyance.\n(3) If the town agrees to accept the offer of dedication, it will be obligated to maintain the street. The obligation to maintain the street\ndoes not impose any requirement on the town to immediately make improvements to the street in question. Necessary improvements to the\nstreet in question will be made by the town as funds are available.\n(4) The warranty period shall run for a minimum of one year from the date of acceptance by the Board of Commissioners. Warranty\ninspections will be conducted by the Town Engineer at six months and 12 months after acceptance or at any time that deficiencies are\ndiscovered. All repairs will require an additional one-year warranty.\n(5) Acceptance of roadway dedication will be provided by adoption of a resolution of acceptance by the Town Board of Commissioners.\n(J) School site reservation. If the Board of Commissioners and the Brunswick County Board of Education have jointly determined the\nspecific location and size of any school sites to be reserved in accordance with the town comprehensive plan, staff shall immediately notify\nthe Board of Education in writing whenever a sketch plan for a subdivision is submitted which includes all or part of a school site to be\nreserved. The Board of Education shall promptly decide whether it still wishes the site to be reserved. If the Board of Education does wish to\nreserve the site, the subdivision shall not be approved without such reservation. The Board of Education shall then have 18 months beginning\non the date of final approval of the subdivision within which to acquire the site by purchase or by initiating condemnation proceedings. If the\nBoard of Education has not purchased or begun proceedings to condemn the site within 18 months, the developer may treat the land as freed\nof the reservation.\n(K) Dedication of land for park, recreation and open space. Every subdivider who proposes a subdivision of land for residential purposes\nshall dedicate for public or private use a portion of land or pay a fee in lieu thereof, in accordance with this section, for public park, greenway,\nrecreation and open space sites to serve the recreational needs of the residents of the subdivision or development. The town prefers that\nownership and maintenance of parks, recreation or open space lands be by a private entity, such as a property owners' association.\nDedication of land, or fee in lieu of, must be approved by the Board of Commissioners prior to approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning\nBoard.\n(1) At least one-thirty-fifth of an acre shall be dedicated for each dwelling unit planned or proposed in the subdivision plat or\ndevelopment.\n(2) The minimum amount of land which shall be dedicated for a public park, recreation or open space site shall be no less than two acres\nin size. When the area to be provided is less than two acres, the subdivider may be required to make payment in lieu of the dedication to be\nused for the acquisition or development of recreation, park or open space sites which would serve the needs of the residents of the\nsubdivision.\n(3) Except as otherwise required by the Board of Commissioners, all dedications of land shall meet the following criteria.\n(a) The dedicated land shall form a single parcel of land, except where the Board of Commissioners determines that two or more\nparcels would be in the best interest of the public, given the type and distribution of open spaces needed to adequately serve the proposed\ndevelopment. In these cases, the Board of Commissioners may require that the parcels be connected by a dedicated strip of land at least 30\nfeet in width.\n(b) Two-thirds of the dedicated land shall be usable for active recreation. Furthermore, lakes and other bodies of water may not be\n"}, {"page": "34", "text": "included in computing any of the dedicated land area. Land dedicated only for greenways need not follow the requirements of this division (J)\n(3)(b).\n(c) The shape of the portion of the dedicated land which is deemed suitable for active recreation shall be sufficiently square or round to\nbe usable for any or all recreational facilities and activities, such as athletic fields and tennis courts, when a sufficient amount of land is\ndedicated to accommodate the facilities. Land dedicated only for greenways need not follow the requirements of this division (J)(3)(c).\n(d) The dedicated land shall be located so as to reasonably serve the recreation and open space needs of residents of the subdivision.\n(e) Public access to the dedicated land shall be provided either by adjoining public street frontage or by a dedicated public easement, at\nleast 30 feet wide, which connects the dedicated land to a public street or right-of-way. Gradients adjacent to existing and proposed streets\nshall allow for reasonable access to the dedicated land. Where the dedicated land is located adjacent to a street, the developer or subdivider\nshall remain responsible for the installation of utilities, sidewalks and other improvements required along that street segment.\n(f) Dedicated parks, recreation and open space areas shall have a sufficient natural or human-made buffer or screen to minimize any\nnegative impacts on adjacent residents.\n(4) The payment of fees, in lieu of the dedication of land, may occur at the request of the subdivider or developer. However, the decision\nto require the dedication of land for recreational purposes, or a payment of a fee in lieu, shall be made by the Board of Commissioners prior to\npreliminary plat approval after having received a recommendation from the Planning Board and having evaluated the proposed dedication and\nthe relationship the dedication would have with the town's overall recreational needs.\n(a) The fees in lieu of dedication shall be paid prior to final plat approval.\n(b) The amount of the payment shall be the product of:\n1. The number of acres to be dedicated, as required by this division (J); and\n2. The assessed value for property tax purposes of the land being subdivided, adjusted to reflect its current fair market value at the\ntime the payment is due to be paid.\n(c) Procedures for determining the amount of the payment are as follows.\n1. An appraisal of the land in the development shall be performed by a professional land appraiser selected by the developer from an\napproved list maintained by the Board of Commissioners. Professional land appraiser refers to a land appraiser who, in the opinion of the\nBoard of Commissioners, has the expertise and/or certification to perform an adequate appraisal.\n2. The appraisal shall not be done prior to submission of the preliminary plat. The cost of the appraisal shall be borne by the\ndeveloper.\n(5) At the time of filing a preliminary plat, the subdivider shall designate thereon the area or areas to be dedicated pursuant to this\nsection. If the subdivider desires to make a payment in lieu of the dedication of land, a letter to that effect shall be submitted with the\npreliminary plat. The Board of Commissioners reserves the right to approve or disapprove dedication of parcels for public park, recreation or\nopen space, or payment in lieu of.\n(6) Where a dedication of land is required, the dedication shall be shown on the final plat when submitted, and the plat shall be\naccompanied by an executed general warranty deed conveying the dedicated land to the town. Where a payment in lieu of dedication is\napproved by the Board of Commissioners, the payment will be made before the final plat is signed and recorded.\n(7) The Board of Commissioners shall have the authority to sell land dedicated pursuant to this section. The proceeds of the sale shall be\nused for the acquisition and/or development of other recreation, park or open space sites, or for sidewalk development serving the subdivision\nor more than one subdivision in the immediate area.\n(8) The town encourages neighborhood or property owner associations or management to construct, operate and maintain private parks\nand recreation. The construction, operation or maintenance of the private facilities shall not, however, diminish or eliminate the responsibility\nand obligations of the subdivider under this section.\n(9) Greenways may be credited against the requirements of this section, provided that the greenways are part of the town's greenway\nplan and dedicated to public use.\n(10) This chapter may not require a power line to be buried if the line existed above ground when the development's plat or development\nplan was initially approved (even if the power line was subsequently relocated) and the power line is located outside the parcel of land\ncontaining the subdivision or development plan.\n(L) Street construction. To provide for the orderly growth and development of the town, and to coordinate the streets and highways within\nproposed subdivisions with existing or planned streets and highways, a subdivider or developer may be required in lieu of required street\nconstruction and as a condition to plat approval, to provide funds which the town may use for the construction of roads to serve the occupants,\nresidents, or invitees of the subdivision or development and these funds may be used for roads which serve more than one subdivision or\ndevelopment within the area. All funds received by the town pursuant to this division shall be used only for development of roads, including\ndesign, land acquisition, and construction. The town may undertake these activities in conjunction with the North Carolina Department of\nTransportation under an agreement between the town and the Department of Transportation. Any formula adopted to determine the amount\nof funds the subdivider or developer is to pay in lieu of required street construction shall be based on the trips generated from the subdivision\nor development. A combination of partial payment of such funds and partial dedication of constructed streets may be required when the Board\nof Commissioners determines that such a combination is in the best interests of the public in the area to be served.\n(Ord. eff. 9-6-2012, \u00a7 5.7; Am.

Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n91.72 PRIMARY ZONING DISTRICTS.\nFor the purposes of this Unified Development Ordinance, the town is hereby divided into the following primary zoning districts.\n(A) R-15 Residential District. The R-15 Residential District is intended as a single-family residential area with a low to medium population\ndensity. Certain structures and uses of governmental, educational, religious and noncommercial recreational natures are either permitted\noutright or are subject to special conditions intended to preserve and protect the residential character of this district.\n(B) R-12 Residential District. The R-12 Residential District is intended as a single-family residential area with a low to medium population\ndensity. Certain structures and, uses of governmental, educational, religious and noncommercial recreational natures are either permitted\noutright or are subject to special conditions intended to preserve and protect the residential character of this district.\n(C) R-8 Residential District. The R-8 Residential District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for single-family,\ntwo-family and multi-family residences. The regulations of this district are intended to provide areas of the community for those persons\ndesiring residence and multi-family structures in medium density neighborhoods. The regulations are intended to discourage any use which\nbecause of its character would interfere with the residential nature of this district.\n(D) R-6 Residential District. The R-6 Residential District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for single-family,\ntwo-family and multi-family residences. The regulations of this district are intended to provide areas in the community for those persons\ndesiring small residences and multi-family structures in relatively high density neighborhoods. The regulations are intended to discourage any\nuse which because of its character would interfere with the residential nature of this district. The R-6 District was in effect prior to the date of\nadoption of this Unified Development Ordinance and shall continue in effect for those areas following the date of adoption of this Unified\nDevelopment Ordinance. It is the intention of the town that there will be no additional R-6 zoning.\n(E) MFH I Manufactured Home District I. The MFH I Manufactured Home District I is established as a district in which the principal use of\nland is for double-wide manufactured homes Class \"A.\"\n(F) MFH // Manufactured Home District II. The MFH II Manufactured Home District II is established as a district in which the principal use of\nland is for Class \"B\" manufactured homes.\n(G) O/I Office and Institutional District. This district is established primarily for office and institutional uses which cause no offensive noises,\nodors, smoke, fumes, excessive traffic or other objectionable conditions. This district may serve as a buffer between residential and\ncommercial/industrial districts.\n(H) NB Neighborhood Business District. The regulations for this district are designed to permit a concentrated development of permitted\nfacilities which are normally adjacent to non-federal highways and routinely adjacent to residential areas.\n(I) HC Highway Commercial District. The HC Highway Commercial District is established primarily for those businesses that serve the\ntraveling public, require large areas for displays of goods, and are not oriented to the pedestrian shopper.\n(J) ID Industrial District. The ID Industrial District is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for industries which can be\noperated in a relatively clean and quiet manner and which will not be obnoxious to adjacent residential or business districts. The regulations\nare designed to prohibit the use of land for heavy industry, which should be properly segregated, and to prohibit any other use that would\nsubstantially interfere with the development of industrial establishments in the district.\n(K) CRD Conservation Recreation District. This district is established as a district intended to preserve Carolina Shores' essential open\nspace areas, by protecting/preserving natural resources such as: floodplain areas, existing and proposed residential areas, recreational\nresources; and limiting impervious surfaces, thereby reducing stormwater runoff. Conservation zoning may be incorporated into surrounding\ndevelopments. Large lot zoning for single-family residential development is conditionally allowed as an effective way to preserve natural and\ncommunity open space resources.\n(L) PRD Planned Residential District. A Planned Residential District (PRD) is planned and developed as an integral unit in a single\n"}, {"page": "36", "text": "development phase or several phases in accord with an initially approved development plan.\n(M) AD Agricultural District. The purpose of this district is to provide for areas where the principal use of land is for low density residential\nand agricultural\npurposes. The regulations of this district are intended to protect the agricultural sections of the community from an influx of uses likely to\nrender them undesirable for farms and future residential development.\n(Ord. eff. 9-6-2012, \u00a7 6.3; Am. Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n\u00a7 91.73 CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICT.\n(A) The large site conditional zoning district (CZD) allows a site to be developed with a mixture of land uses according to an approved\noverall site plan. For example, a large tract may be developed with a mix of single-family and multi-family housing, with part of the site also\ndevoted to commercial and office uses. The CZD allows for greater flexibility in dimensional standards (such as lot sizes and setbacks) upon\napproval of an overall master plan for the entire development. The district does not require a rigid separation of different land uses. Uses are\nlimited to the uses identified in \u00a7 91.74 Table of Permitted/ Special Uses. All of the site-specific standards and conditions, including a site plan,\nare incorporated into the zoning district regulations for the CZD. Approval of the site plan will establish all zoning requirements for the subject\nproperty. A large site CZD district shall not be less than three acres in area. Within the MLK-O overlay district, lots smaller than three acres in\nsize may apply for CZD zoning.\n(B) This negotiated approach to a legislative decision allows maximum flexibility to tailor regulations to a particular site and project. But it\nalso has great potential for abuse - both in terms of impacts on individual landowners seeking approval and their neighbors and on the public\ninterests zoning is supposed to promote. Thus, special restrictions have been placed on conditional zoning. Conditional Zoning Districts may\nonly occur at the owner's request and cannot be imposed without the owner's agreement. The individual conditions and site-specific standards\nthat can be imposed are limited to those that are needed to bring a project into compliance with town ordinances and adopted plans and to\nthose addressing the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by use of the site. The town must assure that all of the factors defining\nreasonable spot zoning are fully considered and that the public hearing record reflects that consideration.\n(C) Conditional zoning provides important opportunities to carefully tailor regulations to address the interest of the landowner, the\nneighbors, and the public. The town may use conditional zoning when it concludes that a particular project should be approved but that the\nstandards in the comparable conventional zoning district(s) are insufficient to protect neighbors or public interests (perhaps because the\nconventional zoning allows other uses not suitable for the site or dimensional standards inadequate to preserve the neighborhood).\nConditional zoning often allows a developer to proceed with a project in a way that addresses site-specific concerns of neighbors and the\nTown of Carolina Shores. The petitioner must consent in writing to all conditions imposed by the conditional zoning.\n(Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n\u00a7 91.74 TABLE OF PERMITTED/SPECIAL USES.\nPS - Permitted Use with

Nonconforming uses may be continued subject to the limitations noted herein. For purposes of determining whether a right to\ncontinue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section, all buildings, activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to\nbe considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building or one space in a\nnonconforming manufactured home park for 90 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as\nthe apartment building or manufactured home park as a whole is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a\nnonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter.\n(A) Expansions: no nonconforming use shall be extended, expanded, enlarged or moved to occupy a different or greater area of land,\nbuildings or structures than was occupied by such use at the time it became nonconforming; provided, however, a nonconforming use may be\nextended throughout any parts of a building which were specifically designed and arranged for such use at the time it became nonconforming.\n(B) No building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered\nunless such building or structure is thereafter devoted to a conforming use; provided, however, such building or structure may be enlarged or\nextended upon prior authorization from the Board of Adjustment, which authorization shall not be granted unless the Board of Adjustment\nmakes each of the following findings of fact.\n(1) The proposed enlargement or extension shall be minor or insignificant in relation to the existing building or structure.\n(2) The proposed enlargement or extension shall not increase the intensity of the nonconforming use, which is to say, it will not result in\nan increase in dwelling units for a residential use nor in gross floor area for a nonresidential use.\n(3) The proposed enlargement or extension is designed so that it will not render the use of the property any less compatible than it is in\nits existing circumstances.\n(4) The authorization of such proposed enlargement or extension is not otherwise contrary to the public health, safety or welfare.\n(C) (1) A nonconforming use of a structure may not be changed to another nonconforming use unless such change is authorized by the\nBoard of Adjustment.

Adequate public facilities shall be provided within the confines of any subdivision to meet the public demand created by the\nsubdivision for such facilities as deemed appropriate by the Planning Board and in compliance with state law. Such facilities include but are\nnot limited to schools, libraries, parks, recreational facilities, public access facilities to natural/conservation areas, greenways/multi-modal\npaths, fire stations, police stations, emergency management facilities, drainage facilities, solid waste handling facilities, and other such\nfacilities that are intended for the use and enjoyment of the public.\n(B) Blocks and lots.\n(1) The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to: provision of adequate building sites suitable to the\nspecial needs of the type of use contemplated; zoning requirements; needs for vehicular and pedestrian circulation; control and safety of\nstreet traffic; limitations and opportunities of topography; and convenient access to water areas.\n(2) Blocks shall not be less than 400 feet or more than 1,320 feet.\n(3) Blocks shall have sufficient width to allow two tiers of lots of minimum depth except where single-tier lots are required to separate\nresidential development from through vehicular traffic or another type of use, in non-residential subdivisions, or where abutting a water area.\n(4) Where deemed necessary by the Planning Board or UDO Administrator, a pedestrian crosswalk at least 15 feet in width may be\nrequired to provide convenient public access to a public area such as a park or school, to a water area, or to areas such as shopping centers,\nreligious or transportation facilities.\n(5) Block numbers shall conform to the Brunswick County 911 number system, if applicable.\n(6) All lots in new subdivisions shall conform to the zoning requirements of the district in which the subdivision is located. Conformance\nto zoning requirements means, among other things, that the smallest lot in the subdivision must meet all dimensional requirements of this\nUnified Development Ordinance. It is not sufficient for the average lot to meet zoning requirements.\n"}, {"page": "88", "text": "(7) If not provided central water and/or sewer service, lots shall meet applicable County Health Department requirements.\n(8) Double frontage lots shall be avoided wherever possible.\n(9) Flag lots shall be avoided wherever possible.\n(10) Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to or radial to street lines.\n(C) Cluster development. Every lot shall meet the minimum size as specified in $91.75 except lots permitted to utilize the clustering\nprovision. Lots may be reduced using this provision but any lot area reduced shall be placed in common area and shall in no way increase the\nnumber of lots normally allowed by using this section. Averaging lot size can be approved on a case by case basis by the Planning Board\nwhere no additional lots are created.\n(1) Density bonuses shall be allowable when a cluster development avoids developing in a Special Flood Hazard Area such that density\nmay increase 25% above the density normally allowed in the Unified Development Ordinance.\n(D) Traditional neighborhood development. Traditional neighborhood development is encouraged to the extent practicable. Design\nstandards contained in this Unified Development Ordinance may be replaced when a Traditional Neighborhood Development is proposed and\nrezoned to a Planned Residential Development zoning district provided that the North Carolina Department of Transportation's Traditional\nNeighborhood Development standards are used.\n(E) Easements. Easements shall be provided as follows.\n(1) Utility easements.\n(a) Easements for underground or above ground utilities shall be provided, where necessary, across lots or centered on rear or side lot\nlines and shall be at least ten feet wide for water and sanitary sewer lines as required by the companies involved, for telephone, gas and\npower lines.\n(b) The Planning Board will determine whether one easement is sufficient or whether several easements are necessary to\naccommodate the various facilities and the subdivider shall provide the required easements.\n(2) Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a stream or drainage way, an easement shall be provided conforming with\nthe lines of such stream and of sufficient width as will be adequate for the purpose.\n(3) Greenway/multi-modal path easements. Where a subdivision, as deemed by the Planning Board, warrants additional off right-of-way\npaths for walking and recreation, a greenway and/or multi-modal path easement may be required. Such easement, where practical, shall run\ncoterminous with drainage easements.\n(Ord. eff. 9-6-2012, \u00a7 9.59; Am. Ord. 19-2, passed 7-12-2018; Am.

Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n\u00a7 91.223 STREETS.\n(A) Type of street required. All subdivision lots shall abut on a public or private street. All public streets shall be dedicated to the town, the\nstate or the public as determined appropriate by the Board of Commissioners. Streets not dedicated to the town which are not eligible to be\nput on the State Highway System because there are too few lots or residences shall only be approved as private streets.\n(B) Half-streets. The dedication of half-streets of less than 60 feet at the perimeter of a new subdivision shall be prohibited. If\ncircumstances render this impracticable, adequate provision for the concurrent dedication of the remaining half of the street shall be furnished\nby the subdivider. Where there exists a half-street in an adjoining subdivision, the remaining half shall be provided by the proposed\nsubdivision. However, in circumstances where more than 60 feet of right-of-way is required, a partial width right-of-wa not less than 60 feet\nin width, may be dedicated when adjoining undeveloped property is owned or controlled by the subdivider; provided that the width of the\npartial dedication is such as to permit the installation of such facilities as may be necessary to serve abutting lots. When the adjoining property\nis subdivided, the remainder of the full required right-of- way shall be dedicated.\n(C) Marginal access streets. Where a tract of land to be subdivided adjoins a principal arterial street, the subdivider may be required to\nprovide a marginal access street parallel to the arterial street or reverse frontage on a minor street for the lots to be developed adjacent to the\narterial. Where reverse frontage is established, private driveways shall be prevented from having direct access to the principal arterial.\n(D) Street connectivity requirements.\n(1) An interconnected street system is necessary in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare in order to ensure that streets\nwill function in an interdependent manner, to provide adequate access for emergency and service vehicles, to enhance nonvehicular travel\nsuch as pedestrians and bicycles, and to provide continuous and comprehensible traffic routes. All proposed new streets shall be platted\naccording to the current Town Thoroughfare Plan. In areas where such plans have not been completed, the streets shall be designated and\nlocated in relation to existing and proposed streets, the topography, to natural features such as streams and tree cover, to public safety and\nconvenience, and to the proposed use of land to be served by such streets.\n(2) All proposed streets shall be continuous and connect to existing or platted streets without offset with the exception of cul-de-sacs as\npermitted and except as provided below. Whenever practicable, provisions shall be made for the continuation of planned streets into adjoining\nareas.\n(3) (a) The street network for any subdivision shall achieve a connectivity ratio of not less than 1.45 (see example below). The phrase\n"}, {"page": "89", "text": "connectivity ratio means the number of streets links divided by the number of nodes or link ends, including cul-de-sac heads. A LINK means\nand refers to that portion of a street defined by a node at each end or at one end. Approved stubs to adjacent property shall be considered\nlinks. However, alleys shall not be considered links. A NODE refers to the terminus of a street or the intersection of two or more streets,\nexcept that intersections that use a roundabout shall not be counted as a node.\n(b) For the purposes of this section, an INTERSECTION shall be defined as:\n1. Any curve or bend of a street that fails to meet the minimum curve radius as established by the North Carolina Department of\nTransportation, Division of Highways design and minimum construction standards; or\n2. Any location where street names change (as reviewed and approved by the UDO Administrator).\n(4) For the purposes of this section, the street links and nodes within the collector or thoroughfare streets providing access to a proposed\nsubdivision shall not be considered in computing the connectivity ratio.\n(5) Residential streets shall be designed so as to minimize the length of local streets, to provide safe access to residences, and to\nmaintain connectivity between and through residential neighborhoods for autos and pedestrians.\n(6) Where necessary to provide access or to permit the reasonable future subdivision of adjacent land, rights-of-way and improvements\nshall be extended to the boundary of the development. A temporary turnaround may be required where the dead end exceeds 500 feet in\nlength. The platting of partial width rights-of-way shall be prohibited except where the remainder of the necessary right-of-way has already\nbeen platted, dedicated or established by other means.\nExample Subdivision that\nExample 2: Same development\ndoes not meet the Ratio\nmodified to meet Ratio\n(13 links/1 nodes 1.18 ratio)\n(16 links/11 nodes 1.45 ratio)\n12\n(7) Exemptions: new subdivisions that intend to provide one new cul-de-sac street shall be exempt from the connectivity requirement\nwhen the UDO Administrator determines that the subdivision will provide for connectivity with adjacent future development and there is:\n(a) No options for providing stub streets due to topographic conditions, adjacent developed sites or other limiting factors; and\n(b) Interconnectivity (use of a looped road) within the development cannot be achieved or is unreasonable based on the constraints of\nthe property to be developed.\n(E) Design standards. The design of all streets and roads within the jurisdiction of this Unified Development Ordinance shall be in\naccordance with the North Carolina Department of Transportation, Division of Highways design and minimum construction standards.\n(F) Other requirements.\n(1) Through traffic discouraged on residential collector and local streets. Residential collector and local streets shall be laid out in such a\nway that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. Streets shall be designed or walkways dedicated to assure convenient access to\nparks, playgrounds, schools or other places of public assembly.\n(2) Sidewalks. Sidewalks may be required by the Planning Board on one or both sides of the street in areas likely to be subject to heavy\npedestrian traffic such as near schools and shopping areas. Such sidewalks shall be constructed to a minimum width of four feet, and shall\nconsist of a minimum thickness of four inches of concrete. All sidewalks shall be placed in the right-of-way, unless the development is platted\nas a planned unit or group development. Sidewalks shall consist of a minimum of six inches of concrete at driveway crossings.\n(3) Street names. Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with existing streets shall be given the same name. In assigning\nnew names, duplication of existing names shall be avoided and in no case shall the proposed name be phonetically similar to existing names\nin Brunswick County irrespective of the use of a suffix such as street, road, drive, place or court. Street names shall be subject to the approval\nof the Planning Board and the Brunswick County Emergency Management Director.\n(4) Street signs. The subdivider shall be required to provide and erect all street signs, including street name signs, to State Department of\nTransportation standards within the subdivision.\n(5) Permits for connection to state roads. An approved permit is required for connection to any existing state system road. This permit is\nrequired prior to any construction on the street or road. The application is available at the office of district engineer of the State Division of\nHighways (Wilmington Division, Burgaw District).\n(6) Offsets to utility poles. Poles for overhead utilities should be located clear of roadway shoulders, preferably at edge of rights-of-way\non major thoroughfares. On streets with curb and gutter, utility should be set back a minimum distance of six feet from the face of the curb.\n(7) Wheelchair ramps. In accordance with G.S. Chapter 136, Article 2A, \u00a7 136-44.14, all street curbs in this state being constructed or\nreconstructed for maintenance procedures, traffic operations, repairs, correction of utilities or altered for any reason after September 1, 1973,\nshall provide wheelchair ramps for the physically handicapped at all intersections where both curb and gutter and sidewalks are provided and\nat other major points of pedestrian flow.\n(8) Private streets.\n(a) Streets designated as private may be allowed in subdivisions when, in the opinion of the Planning Board, they provide adequate\ningress and egress onto collector streets, and they provide sufficient assurance through legally established homeowners' or similar owners'\n"}, {"page": "90", "text": "associations, deed restrictions and/or covenants, or other maintenance agreements, that said street shall be properly maintained and said\nagreements perpetually carried with the land. The Planning Board shall reserve the authority, when the public welfare and safety warrant,\nrequiring the public dedication of street rights-of-way within developments. All private streets shall be designed and constructed to meet or\nexceed the public street standards as specified in this section.\n(b) The UDO Administrator shall be assured, prior to preliminary approval, that adequate provisions have been made through legal\ncovenants and restrictions which shall govern a homeowners' association, or through other legal agreements, that the responsibility as to\nthe\nmaintenance of the streets, utilities or other areas designated as private areas or as a common area will be accomplished by a source other\nthan by public maintenance.\n(9) Curb and gutter. Curb and gutter improvements are not required due to the adverse impact urban stormwater could have on the\nvaluable estuarine waters in and around the town. However, this does not relieve the subdivision developer from providing adequate grassed\nswales, culverts and retention ponds for managing stormwater and runoff.\n(Ord. eff. 9-6-2012, \u00a7 9.62 Am. Ord. 21-1, passed 9-17-2020)\n\u00a7 91.224 UTILITIES.\n(A) Water supply system and sewage disposal system required. Every lot within a subdivision shall be served by a water supply system\nand sewage disposal system that is adequate to accommodate the reasonable needs of the proposed use and comply with all applicable\nhealth regulations.

Stormwater runoff from driveways, residential or commercial, shall not discharge directly onto public or private\nthoroughfares. Runoff shall be diverted to stormwater drainage facilities such as drainage ditches, stormwater systems or on-site intrusion\nsystems. On streets with a curb and gutter section, runoff from a driveway directly to the curb and gutter is anticipated and allowable; provided\nhowever, the driveway shall not be steeper than a 3% to 4% grade. For streets with roadside ditches, the driveways shall be cross-sloped or\ncrowned to direct the runoff to the ditch system before the driveway connection to the street. A trench drain may also be used to intercept the\nrunoff before it enters the street. Driveway permit item.\n(2) Driveway access. Residential driveway access shall be a maximum of 36 feet wide. Note: this may be split up to allow for two 18-foot\ndriveway access points where the lot size will permit. In any case, the driveways or culvert piping shall not be located any closer than five feet\nfrom the side property line. Driveway permit item.\n(3) Lot plans. Applicants shall prepare a site plan for each and every lot to be developed that accounts for street flooding and local\ndrainage from and onto adjoining properties. The applicant shall be responsible for protecting the development/building from such local\ndrainage flow and shall discharge the drainage flow onto adjoining lots in a manner that does not adversely impact the adjoining lots, in each\nand every case providing for a point of collection on the applicant's lot prior to discharge onto an adjoining lot that does not create a hazard or\nexacerbated drainage problem on adjoining lots.\n(4) Impervious surface limits. No lot shall exceed 50% impervious surface without managing stormwater. Such stormwater management\nshall limit the post-development runoff discharge of the impervious surface area exceeding 50% of the lot to a rate no more than the pre-\ndevelopment 25-year, 24-hour storm runoff discharge rate. The maximum amount of impervious surface permitted on any lot shall be 90%.\n(a) Lots that fall outside of a master stormwater permit or otherwise not part of a stormwater management plan approved by the State\nof North Carolina shall limit the post-development runoff discharge of any impervious surface area to a rate no more than the pre-\ndevelopment 25-year, 24-hour storm runoff discharge rate.\n(5) Elevation. The finished floor elevation of the first floor of any structure, including the garage, must be a minimum of 18 inches above\nthe surrounding finished grade or the crown of the roadway, whichever is greater.\n(6) Easements. Easements shall be restricted to prohibit all fences and structures which would prevent access to the easement areas\nand/or prevent the maintenance of the drainage system.\n(7) Downspouts. No downspouts from roof gutters shall be discharged into town ditches, or onto public or private driveways, parking\nareas and other impervious surfaces that drain directly to storm sewers or streams. All such downspouts from roof gutters shall be discharged\ninto stabilized vegetated areas where the runoff can infiltrate or by other means that allows the runoff to infiltrate the ground as may be\napproved by the UDO Administrator.\n(B) If a new development has a disturbance of one acre or more, or, proposes to construct more than 10,000 square feet of built-upon\narea, all stormwater control designs shall limit the post-development runoff discharge rate to no more than the pre-development 50-year, 24-\nhour storm runoff discharge rate.

The zoning of a relatively small area of land differently from the way the majority of the surrounding land is zoned. Spot\nzoning is legal only if the government establishes that it is reasonable. Reasonableness is determined by considering the size of the area; any\nspecial conditions or factors regarding the area; the consistency of the zoning with the land use plan; the degree of change in the zoning; the\ndegree it allows uses different from the surrounding area; and the relative benefits and detriments for the owner, the neighbors, and the\nsurrounding community. The town should consider the following factors in deliberating any potential spot zoning:\n(1) The size and nature of the tract. The larger the area of spot zoning the more likely it is to be reasonable. Singling out an individual lot\nfor special zoning treatment is more suspect than creating a zoning district that involves multiple parcels and owners. Special site\ncharacteristics, such as topography, availability of utilities, or access to rail or highways, can be important in this analysis.\n(2) Compatibility with existing plans. If a clear public policy rationale for the different zoning treatment is set out in the local government's\nadopted plans, that evidences a public purpose for the zoning. By contrast, a zoning action that is inconsistent with a plan may indicate\nspecial treatment that is contrary to the public interest and thus be unreasonable.\n(3) The impact of the zoning decision on the landowner, the immediate neighbors, and the surrounding community. An action that is of\ngreat benefit to the owner and only a mild inconvenience for the neighbors may be reasonable, while a zoning decision that significantly\nharms the neighbors while only modestly benefitting the owner would be unreasonable.\n(4) The relationship between the newly allowed uses in a spot rezoning and the previously allowed uses. degree of difference in\nthe\nexisting surrounding land uses and the proposed new use is also important. The greater the difference in allowed uses, the more likely the\nrezoning will be found unreasonable. For example, in an area previously zoned for residential uses, allowing slightly higher residential density\nmay be reasonable while allowing industrial uses would be unreasonable.\n(5) Ownership. In order to constitute spot zoning, the area to be rezoned must be owned by a single owner.\nSTANDING. The following persons shall have standing to file an appeal:\n(1) Any person meeting any of the following criteria:\n(a) Has an ownership interest in the property that is the subject of the decision being appealed, a leasehold interest in the property that\nis the subject of the decision being appealed, or an interest created by easement, restrictions, or covenant in the property that is the subject of\nthe decision being appealed.\n(b) Has an option or contract to purchase the property that is the subject of the decision being appealed.\n(c) Was an applicant before the decision-making board whose decision is being appealed.\n(2) Any other person who will suffer special damages as the result of the decision being appealed.\n(3) An incorporated or unincorporated association to which owners or lessees of property in a designated area belong by virtue of their\nowning or leasing property in that area, or an association otherwise organized to protect and foster the interest of the particular neighborhood\nor local area, so long as at least one of the members of the association would have standing as an individual to challenge the decision being\nappealed, and the association was not created in response to the particular development or issue that is the subject of the appeal.\n(4) A town whose decision-making board has made a decision that the council believes improperly grants a variance from or is otherwise\ninconsistent with the property interpretation of an ordinance adopted by that council.\nSTART OF CONSTRUCTION.
