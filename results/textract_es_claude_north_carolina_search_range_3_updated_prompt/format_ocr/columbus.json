VII, \u00a7 703, passed - -)\n\u00a7 154.064 STATEMENT OF DISTRICT INTENTS.\n(A) Residential Estate (RE). The Residential Estate (RE) district as herein established is intended to be the most\nrestrictive of the residential districts. The intent is to provide for an environment of low density one-family detached dwelling\nunits along with other residentially related facilities which serve the residents in this district. These areas will often be\ndependent on private, individual septic tanks and wells; therefore, requiring larger lot sizes to sustain individual water\nsupplies and sewage disposal facilities. These areas may have soil and topographic constraints that preclude intense urban\ndevelopment.\n(B) Low Density Residential District (R-1). The Low Density Residential District is primarily intended to provide locations\nfor low-density residential development in outlying rural areas that are not likely to have public water and sewer services\navailable and may have soil and topographic constraints that preclude intense urban development. These areas often will be\ndependent upon private, individual septic tanks and wells; therefore, requiring larger lot sizes to sustain individual water\nsupplies and sewage disposal facilities. This district also provides for recreational, community service and institutional uses\nthat will complement the residential development. This district will be applied within those areas designated on the land use\nplan as Low Density Residential areas.\n(C) Community Residential-Medium Density Residential District (R-2). The Community Residential-Medium Density\nResidential District is primarily intended to provide locations for residential uses and supporting recreational and community\nservice uses in area where generally both Town public water and sewer services are available. These are the more urban\nareas of the community and will be primarily within the town limits and in close proximity to public and private services and\nthe town's central business district. This district is intended to protect existing single-family homes and subdivisions within\nthe town. This district will be applied within those areas designated on the land use plan as Medium Density Residential\n"}, {"page": "17", "text": "areas.\n(D) Central Business District (CBD). The Central Business District is intended to be the primary retail and service center,\nand focal point of the community. This district provides for the concentration of commercial uses, professional services,\nfinancial services, governmental functions, and related services. The CBD area currently has access to both public water\nand sewer services, and dimensional requirements for this district are intended to encourage concentrated commercial\ndevelopment and to promote convenient pedestrian shopping in pleasant surroundings. This district will be applied to the\nexisting commercial center and to adjacent properties that with commercial development will complement and enhance the\nCBD as the retail and service center of the community. This district will be applied within the commercial areas as\ndesignated on the land use plan.\n(E) I-26 Corridor Overlay Area (I-26 COA). The I-26 Corridor Overlay boundaries are from the concrete right-of-way\nmonument set at the east intersection of Highway 26 and Highway 108, at the corner of Spartan Petroleum Company and\nrunning least 500 feet on Highway 108 to a line parallel to the right-of-way of 1-26, and also at the concrete right-of-way\nmonument set at the west intersection of Highway 26 and Highway 108, at the corner of the McFarland tract and running\nwest 500 feet on Highway 108 to a line parallel to the right of way of 1-26. This overlay area has the same requirements as\nin\nthe Highway Commercial District, but also has additional requirements for tall signs and electronic gaming operations.\n(F) Highway Commercial District (HC). The Highway Commercial District is intended to provide suitable locations for\nclustered groupings of highway commercial development in convenient locations along N.C. 108, to serve local residences\nand persons traveling by automobile. Urban sprawl, congestions, and strip commercial development will be discouraged by\npromoting good design, clustered developments, and by guiding commercial development primarily to areas that have water\nand sewer services and suitable soil and topographic conditions. These areas should provide sufficient space for ample off-\nstreet parking and well designed entrances and exits to avoid traffic congestion and safety hazards. Highway commercial\nareas are intended for commercial enterprises and services that require greater land area and lot dimensions than\nestablishments locating in the Central Business District. This district will be applied within the commercial areas as\ndesignated on the land use plan.\n(G) Industrial District (IND). The Industrial District is intended to provide sites for manufacturing and industrial uses,\nstorage and warehousing, wholesale trade, and other major employment centers. These locations should currently have\nboth public water and sewer services available or be expected to have these services in the future, and have suitable soil\nand topographic conditions to sustain the development. This district includes existing manufacturing areas, and sites suited\nfor future or further industrial development, and area designated on the land use plan as Industrial Centers. Only those\nmanufacturing uses will be allowed which have meet all local, state, and federal environmental standards, and do not involve\nobnoxious noise, vibrations, smoke, gas, fumes, odor, dust, fire hazards or other objectionable conditions which would be\ndetrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the community.\n(H) Public Service District (PS). The Public Service District is intended to be an area containing a concentration of public\nservice activities such as recreation areas, educational facilities, hospitals, emergency services and the like. This district\nis\nintended to preserve existing public service centers and will apply to those areas designated on the land use plan as Public\nService Centers.\n(I) Mixed-Use District (MU). The Mixed-Use District is established to provide opportunities for compatible and sustainable\nre-development where underutilized commercial properties already exist. The existing auto-oriented street, lot and building\ndesigns can create uncomfortable pedestrian environments; however, with careful site planning these areas will allow a\ngreater number of residents to walk or bike to businesses and services with an interconnected network of streets and\nsidewalks. Dominant uses in this district are residential, retail and office. The Mixed-Use District is expected to serve\nColumbus residents as well as persons who travel from the surrounding communities. The development pattern in this\ndistrict acknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access provided to ensure safety for the motoring public.\nDevelopment standards in the Mixed-Use District ensure the creation of a pleasant auto-oriented environment while enabling\na compatible transition to uses in adjacent districts. This District is available for rezoning only with the consent of the\nproperty owner(s).\n(J) Traditional Neighborhood Development District (TND). The Traditional Neighborhood Development District provides\nfor the development of new neighborhoods and the revitalization or extension of existing neighborhoods. These\nneighborhoods are structured upon a fine network of interconnecting pedestrian oriented streets and other public spaces.\nTraditional Neighborhood Developments (TND's) provide a mixture of housing types and prices, prominently sited civic or\ncommunity building(s), stores/offices/workplaces, and churches to provide a balanced mix of activities. A Traditional\nNeighborhood Development (TND) has a recognizable center and clearly defined edges; optimum size is a quarter mile from\ncenter to edge. A TND is urban in form, is typically an extension of the existing developed area of the Town, and has an\noverall residential density of up to 16 dwelling units per acre. TND districts should have a significant portion of land\ndedicated to open spaces. This District is available for rezoning only with the consent of the property owner(s).\n(Ord., Art.

The existing auto-oriented street, lot, and building\ndesigns can create uncomfortable pedestrian environments; however, with careful site planning these areas will allow\na\ngreater number of residents to walk or bike to businesses and services with an interconnected network of streets and\nsidewalks. Dominant uses in this district are residential, retail and office. The Mixed-Use District is expected to serve\nColumbus residents as well as persons who travel from surrounding communities. The development pattern in this district\nacknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access provided to ensure safety for the motoring public.\nDevelopment standards in the Mixed-Use District ensure the creation of a pleasant auto-oriented environment while enabling\na compatible transition to uses in adjacent districts.

The Traditional Neighborhood Development District (TND) provides for the development of new\nneighborhoods and the revitalization or extension of existing neighborhoods. These neighborhoods are structured upon a\nfine network of interconnecting pedestrian oriented streets and other public spaces.

A TND is\nurban in form, is typically an extension of the existing developed area of the Town, and has an overall residential density of\nup to 16 dwelling units per acre. TND districts should have a significant portion of land dedicated to open spaces.

The multi-family development shall not exceed a total of seventy-two (72) dwelling units.\n2. The maximum permitted density for the multi-family development shall be 14 1/2 units per acre.\n3. The permitted building and lot types for the multi-family development in a single-family area shall be the\ndetached house and the attached house building and lot types.\n4. All parking for the multi-family development shall be located behind the building. The parking area shall be\nscreened from adjacent properties and from the street with a screening device.\n5. The buildings in the multi-family development shall be architecturally compatible with single family structures on\nthe street on which the multi-family building is proposed. Elements that shall be incorporated into the design of the multi-\nfamily building to ensure architectural compatibility are:\na. The multi-family building shall be constructed of building materials similar to those used on single family\nstructures on the street.\nb. The roof pitch of the multi-family building shall be the same as that of the single-family structures on the street.\nC. The fenestration of the multi-family building by location and size of windows and doors shall be similar to that of\nthe single-family homes on the street.\nd. Color renderings of the proposed building must be submitted with the application to ensure architectural\ncompatibility.\n6. No multi-family building shall be located closer than 48 feet to an existing multi-family building or development.\nThe distance shall be measured along centerline of streets from the edge of the property proposed for development to the\nclosest edge of the property on which the existing multi-family building or development is located.\n(3) TND general requirements.\n(a) Along existing streets, new buildings shall respect the general spacing of structures, building mass and scale, and\nstreet frontage relationships of existing buildings.\n1. New buildings which adhere to the scale, massing, volume, spacing, and setback of existing buildings along\nfronting streets exhibit demonstrable compatibility.\n2. New buildings which exceed the scale and volume of existing buildings may demonstrate compatibility by varying\nthe massing of buildings to reduce perceived scale and volume.\n(b)\nOn new streets, allowable building and lot types will establish the development pattern.\n(c) A master plan in compliance with Traditional Neighborhood Development standards shall be provided with the\nzoning permit submittal for a general district TND. The master plan shall include a topographic survey and shall show the\nlocation and hierarchy of streets and public open spaces, location of residential, commercial, and civic building lots, street\nsections and/or plans, a master sign program, an outline of any additional regulatory intentions, phasing, and any other\ninformation, including building elevations, which may be required to evaluate the interior pedestrian environment and\nconditions at project edges.\n(d) Minimum Development Size: eight acres.\n(e) Maximum Development Size: none.\n(4) TND design requirements.\n(a) Neighborhood form.\n1. The area of the TND shall be divided into blocks, streets, lots, and open space.\n2. Similar land uses shall generally front across each street. Dissimilar categories shall generally abut at rear lot\nlines. Corner lots which front on streets of dissimilar use shall generally observe the setback established on each fronting\nstreet.\n(b) Streets, alleys and blocks.\n1. Public streets shall provide access to all tracts and lots.\n"}, {"page": "22", "text": "2. Streets and alleys shall, wherever practicable, terminate at other streets within the neighborhood and connect to\nexisting and projected streets outside the development.\n3. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 250 feet in length, must be accessed from a street providing internal or external\nconnectivity, shall be permanently terminated by a vehicular turnaround, and are listed only where topography makes a\nstreet connection impracticable\n4. Vehicular turnarounds of various configurations are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately\nprovided.\n5. Pedestrian connections should be provided as extensions of terminating streets where not precluded by\ntopography or other physical constraints.\n6. The average perimeter of all blocks within the TND should not exceed 1,350 feet. No block face should have a\nlength greater than 500 feet without a dedicated alley or pathway providing through access.\n7. A continuous network of rear alleys shall provide vehicular access to lots 49 feet or less in width.\n8. Utilities may run along alleys provided that a permanent public access and utility easement is recorded for the full\nlength of alley being used for utilities or public services such as garbage collection.\n9. TND streets shall be organized according to a hierarchy based on function, size, capacity, and design speed;\nstreets and rights-of-way are therefore expected to differ in dimension. The proposed hierarchy of streets shall be indicated\non the submitted site plan. Each street type in a TND shall be separately detailed. An array of elements that are combined to\nmeet the purposes of TND neighborhood streets: building placement line, optional utility allocation, sidewalk, planting strip,\ncurb and gutter, optional parallel parking, and travel lane(s). Alternative methods of assembling the required street elements\nwill be considered to allow neighborhood street designs that are most appropriate to setting and use.\n10. To prevent the buildup of vehicular speed, disperse traffic flow, and create a sense of visual enclosure, long\nuninterrupted segments of straight streets should be avoided. Methods to achieve this interruption include:\n(i) A street can be interrupted by intersections designed to calm the speed and disperse the flow of traffic and\nterminate vistas with a significant feature (building, park, natural feature);\n(ii) A street can be terminated with a public monument, specifically designed building facade, or a gateway to the\nensuing space;\n(iii) Perceived street length can be reduced by a noticeable street curve where the outside edge of the curve is\nbounded by a building or other vertical elements that hug the curve and deflect the view; and\n(iv) Other traffic calming configurations are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately provided.\n(c) Buildings and lots.\n1. All lots shall share a frontage line with a street or square; lots fronting a square shall be provided rear alley\naccess.\n2. Consistent build-to lines shall be established along all streets and public space frontages; build-to lines determine\nthe width and ratio of enclosure for each public street or space. A minimum percentage build-out at the build-to line shall be\nestablished on the plan along all streets and public square frontages.\n3. Large-scale, single use facilities (conference spaces, theaters, athletic facilities, etc.) shall generally occur behind\nor above smaller scale uses of pedestrian orientation.\n(d) Open space.

IX, passed -\n\u00a7 154.067 BUILDING HEIGHT OVERLAY DISTRICTS.\n(A) Reason for regulation. It is recognized that two major characteristics of the town greatly contribute to the atmosphere,\ncultural heritage and appeal of the whole community. Specifically, the scenic mountain views bounding the town on the north\nand north west and the historic county courthouse located in the middle of town both offer a sense of place and community\nto the town's residents and add to the attractiveness of the area. It is further recognized that the height of buildings, if left\nunregulated or inadequately regulated, can detract from these two features. Therefore, building heights shall be regulated\nbased on the location of the subject building in relation to mountain view-sheds and to the historic county courthouse.\n(B) Establishment of Building Height Overlay Districts The boundaries of the Building Height Overlay Districts shall be\ndepicted on a map named the \"Town of Columbus Building Height Overlay District Map\" and shall be made part of this\nchapter upon adoption of this section.\n(C) Districts. For the purposes of determining maximum building heights, the town shall be divided into the following\nBuilding Height Overlay Districts:\n(1) General;\n(2) Courthouse; and\n(3) Mountain View-Shed.\n(D) General Building Height District. In this district no building shall be taller than 36 feet. However, if the average\nelevation (above mean sea level) of the ridgelines of existing adjacent buildings situated on lots having a common boundary\nwith the subject parcel upon which the proposed building is to be situated (adjacent lots that are vacant not being included in\nthis calculation) is less than the elevation (above mean sea level) determined by measuring 36 feet vertically from the\naverage grade of the proposed building envelope on the subject parcel, then the proposed building shall be no taller than\nthat average. In the event that the average elevation (above mean sea level) of the existing buildings' ridgelines on the\nsurrounding adjacent properties is such that the subject parcel is rendered unbuildable (meaning a single story building with\nan appropriate roof is not feasible), then the proposed building shall have a height not exceeding 29 feet. The determination\nthat a subject parcel is rendered unbuildable under this division (D) shall be at the discretion of the approving administrator,\nboard, or council.\n(E) Courthouse Building Height District. In this district no building's ridgeline shall have an elevation higher than the\nelevation defined by the plane of the soffit of the eave of the roof of the historic county courthouse; however, in no case shall\na buildings height be taller than 29 feet.\n(F) Mountain View-Shed District. Buildings on areas of high elevation are highly visible from surrounding public spaces.\nAs such, buildings in this district shall not be more than 29 feet tall.\n(G) Height. The height of a building shall be measured from the grade of the average grade of the property to the highest\nridge of the roof of the structure.\n(Ord., Art. IX, \u00a7 900, passed - -; Ord. passed - -)\n\u00a7 154.068 FLOOR AREA.\n(A) Potential.

As such, the town finds it necessary to limit the allowable floor area of commercial development\nin order to ensure that the development is carried out in a manner that is appropriate and consistent with the character of the\ntown.\n(B) Commercial development. The building footprint of any structure and any accessory structure in the aggregate to be\nused for any commercial enterprise shall not be larger than 10,000 square feet in size. The building's footprint shall be\nconstrued to mean the perimeter line created by the edge of the roof of any structure and building on a lot in the aggregate.\nFor the purposes of this section, the term commercial development shall include any development intended to be used or\npotentially used by for-profit enterprises, including manufacturing and industrial developments, except that those uses\nallowed within the town's Public Service District shall not be considered commercial. It is recognized that in certain\ncircumstances it may be appropriate to allow for a larger building footprint for commercial developments. In order for a\ncommercial structure proposed to have a footprint larger than 10,000 square feet to be constructed, a special use permit\nshall be obtained prior to the commencement of the development. See \u00a7\u00a7 154.082 and 154.083 below for details regarding\nthe issuance of a special use permit for large scale commercial developments.\n(C) Residential development. The building footprint of all newly constructed residential developments shall not be larger\nthan 35% of the lot on which the residential development is proposed to be erected.\n(D) Public service development. Development to be used for any land use allowed in the town's Public Service (PS)\nzoning district shall have no limit on the size of the building footprint.\n(Ord., Art. IX, \u00a7 901, passed -)\nCONDITIONAL AND SPECIAL USES\n\u00a7 154.080 CONDITIONAL USE DISTRICTS.\n(A) For each general use district established in 154.060 through 154.064 above, there is also established a\ncorresponding conditional use district as follows:\n(B) It is recognized that certain types of zoning districts would be inappropriate at certain locations in the absence of\nspecial conditions. Where the applicant for rezoning desires property to be rezoned to such a district in those situations, the\nConditional Use District (CUD) is a means by which the special conditions can be imposed in the furtherance of the\npurposes of this chapter. The Conditional Use District classification will be considered for rezoning only upon request of a\nproperty owner. If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these regulations is found to be illegal or invalid or if the\napplicant should fail to accept any condition, it is the intent of this chapter that the authorization of the conditional use permit\nshall be null and void and of no effect, and that proceedings shall be instituted to rezone the property to its previous zoning\nclassification.\n(C) Within a CUD, only those uses authorized as either permitted or conditional uses in the zoning district with which the\nCUD corresponds shall be permitted, and all other requirements of the corresponding district shall be met as minimum\nstandards. In addition, with a CUD no use shall be permitted except pursuant to a conditional use permit authorized by the\nTown Council, which shall specify the use or uses authorized. The permit may further specify the location on the property of\nthe proposed use or uses, the number of dwelling units, the location and extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots,\ndriveway and access streets, the location and extent of buffer areas, and other special purpose areas, the timing of\ndevelopment, the location and extent of right-of-way and other areas to be dedicated for public use, and other such matters\nas the applicant may propose as conditions upon the request, but not to include conditions not generally a part of land\ndevelopment controls. In granting a conditional use permit, the Town Council may impose additional reasonable and\nappropriate safeguards upon the permit as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose and intent of this chapter are\nserved, public welfare secured and substantial justice done.\n(D) In approving a Conditional Use District Rezoning, the Town Council shall make the following (in addition to the\nfindings for conditional use permits in \u00a7 154.081(C) below) affirmative findings:\n(1) That the use(s) requested is among those listed as an eligible use in the Conditional Use District in which the\nsubject property is located or is to be located; and\n(2) That the location and character of the Conditional Use District if developed according to the site specific plan will be\nreasonable and consistent with the surrounding area and with adopted plans of the town.\nCELL (1, 1): \n(1) CU-R-1 Conditional Use R-1 District;\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \n(2) CU-R-2 Conditional Use R-2 District;\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (3, 1): \n(3) CU-CBD Conditional Use CBD District;\nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (4, 1): \n(4) CU-HC Conditional Use HC District;\nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (5, 1): \n(5) CU-IND Conditional Use IND District;\nCELL (5, 2): \nCELL (6, 1): \n(6) CU-PS Conditional Use PS District;\nCELL (6, 2): \nCELL (7, 1): \n(7) CU-MU Conditional Use MU District; and\nCELL (7, 2): \nCELL (8, 1): \n(8) CU-TND Conditional Use TND District.\nCELL (8, 2): \n"}, {"page": "26", "text": "(Ord., Art.

Those uses, shown\nas \"special\" in the permitted use table in \u00a7 154.065, shall be subject to the requirements and review process in this section.\n(B) Approval process. The hearing for a special use permit shall be processed and considered in a quasi-judicial manner\nby the Zoning Board of Adjustment.

Prohibited locations. Communication towers are prohibited within the property of a national historic site or a\nproperty listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a property listed on the State Study List as eligible to be listed\non the National Register of Historic Places.\n2. Lot size. In the event that a tower or antenna is installed and/or leased on a portion of a lot, the lot in its entirety\nwill determine any and all district development regulations that the structure may be subjected to; including but not limited\nto: setback, lot-coverage and other requirements.\n"}, {"page": "36", "text": "3. Tower height. Towers shall not exceed 150 feet in height. However, applicants must supply engineering data to\njustify that any footage over 120 feet is necessary to accomplish the provision of wireless service throughout the town.\n4. Fall zone. No tower or antenna shall be designed and/or sited such that it poses a potential hazard to nearby\nresidences or surrounding properties or improvements. The minimum distance away from all habitable structures or property\nlines shall be one and one-half feet to each vertical foot of the tower unless a Professional Engineer certifies that the tower\nand appurtenances will have a fall zone which is entirely within the lot where the tower is sited. In a report, the professional\nengineer shall describe the tower structure, specify the number and type of antennas it is designed to accommodate,\nprovide the basis for the calculations done in determining the fall zone, and document the actual calculations performed.\n5. Co-location potential. Any telecommunications tower 50 feet high or taller shall be engineered and constructed to\naccommodate three additional antennas that are at least as large as the largest proposed antenna at the time of application.\n6. Separation distance between towers. Towers shall be separated a distance, as measured from the base of any\npreexisting towers. The separation distances shall be measured by drawing or following a straight line between the base of\nthe preexisting tower and the base location, pursuant to a site plan, of the proposed tower.\n7. Aesthetics.\na. Monopole. Towers shall be of a monopole style only.\nb. Camouflage. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may, at its option require as a condition of a special use permit,\nthat a tower be camouflaged, as for example, made to look like a tree. If the Zoning Board of Adjustment does not choose to\nrequire an alternative tower structure or other camouflage, any tower shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or be\npainted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.\nC. Pleasant visual. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting\nelectrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the\nsupporting structure. This is in order to make the antenna, and related equipment, as visually unobtrusive as possible.\nd. Design. Transmission lines shall be placed inside the monopole and the pole shall be designed to\naccommodate placement and installation of the lines of future co-locators.\ne. Lights. No tower or antenna shall have affixed or attached to it in any way any lights, reflectors, flashers, day-\ntime strobes or steady night time light or other illumination devices. This restriction against lights shall not apply to towers\nwhich have been combined with light standards for illumination of ball fields, parking lots, playgrounds or other similar public\nuses.\nf.\nSigns. Signs on a tower, or on any portion of the premises leased for wireless communication use, shall be\nlimited to those needed to identify the property and the owner and to warn of any danger. Signs which advertise for\ncommercial purposes are prohibited.\ng. Landscaping. Landscaping shall be required to minimize the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas\nthrough careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques. Tower facilities shall be\nlandscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent residential\nproperty. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the\ncompound. Plant materials forming the visual buffer may exist on the subject property or be installed as part of the proposed\nfacility, but existing mature plant growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent\npossible. The Zoning Administrator may waive these requirements in locations where the view of the tower base is\nobstructed by existing buildings or natural topography and cannot be viewed from adjacent property or a public street.\n8. State or federal requirements. All towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations\nof the FAA, the FCC, and any other state or federal government agency with the authority to regulate towers and antennas.\nIf the standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this chapter shall\nbring the towers and antennas into compliance with the revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective\ndate of the standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal\nagency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with the revised standards and regulations may constitute\ngrounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense, to the extent consistent with applicable law.\n9. Repeater. At any time, the town and the county shall each have the right to install, at their own expense, one\ncommunications repeater on the tower and to use the repeater with no cost for the use being due to the applicant, the tower\nowner or the operator, provided, however, that the repeater shall not interfere with the use of the tower by the applicant or\nco-locators thereon.\n10. Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers and antennas, the owners of the\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nMonopole 50 feet in\nheight or greater\nCELL (1, 3): \nMonopole less than 50\nfeet in height\nCELL (2, 1): \nMonopole 50 feet in height or greater\nCELL (2, 2): \n720 feet\nCELL (2, 3): \n435 feet\nCELL (3, 1): \nMonopole less than 50 feet in height\nCELL (3, 2): \n435 feet\nCELL (3, 3): \n300 feet\n"}, {"page": "37", "text": "facilities shall ensure that they are maintained in compliance applicable with standards contained in the State Building Code.\n11. Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height and no more than\neight feet in height and shall be equipped in such a manner as to deter climbing.\n12. Accessory equipment storage. The equipment cabinets and other structures used in association with towers or\nantennas shall comply with the following provisions:\na. Equipment cabinets and/or other structures shall comply with all applicable building codes;\nb. Accessory buildings shall satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements; and\nC. Equipment cabinets and/or structures shall be no greater than 14 feet in height or 300 square feet in gross floor\narea. The entry or access side of a cabinet and/or structure shall be gated by a solid, sight-obscuring gate that is separate\nfrom the cabinet and/or structure. The access way shall not face residentially zoned property.\n13. Co-location.\na. Applicants and permittees shall make a good faith effort to share wireless communication structures, facilities\nand sites where feasible and appropriate. Good faith effort shall include, when a determination that the feasibility of the\nplacement would require technical data, then the applicants and permittees must share the data, and may include\nnegotiations for erection of a replacement support structure to accommodate co-location. A competitive conflict to co-\nlocation or financial burden caused by sharing the information normally will not be considered as an exception to the duty of\ngood faith.\nb. Towers shall be engineered and constructed to accommodate three additional antennas. The applicant shall\ndemonstrate that the tower is designed to support the load of four antenna.\nC. Towers between 50 feet and 135 feet shall be constructed so that they can be extended up to 150 feet at a later\ntime if another applicant seeks to co-locate on the tower. The cost of the extension shall be borne by the co-locator.\nd. The applicant shall allow co-locators to share use of the applicant's generator for the tower. The applicant will\nwork with the town to determine suitable times to run the generator in non-emergency situations.\ne. In the event a dispute arises as to whether a permittee has exercised good faith in accommodating other users,\nthe Zoning Administrator may require the applicant to obtain a third-party technical study at the applicant's expense. The\nZoning Administrator may review any information submitted by the applicant and permittee(s) in determining whether good\nfaith has been exercised.\nf. No co-location may be required where the shared use would or does result in significant interference with the\nbroadcast or reception capabilities of the existing wireless communication facilities or the failure of the facilities to meet\nfederal standards for emissions.\ng. Failure to comply with co-location requirements may result in denial of a permit request or revocation of an\nexisting permit.\n(b) Factors considered in granting special use permits for towers 50 feet high or taller In determining whether to\nissue a special use permit, the Board of Adjustment shall consider, any other standards in this chapter governing conditional\nuse permits, including, but not limited to, the standards set forth in \u00a7 154.082(C) above of this chapter, and the following\nfactors:\n1. Height of the proposed tower;\n2. Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residentially zoned areas;\n3. Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;\n4. Surrounding topography;\n5. Surrounding tree coverage and vegetation;\n6. Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that reduce or eliminate visual\nobtrusiveness. Specifically, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials,\ncolors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting and surrounding buildings located\nadjacent to the tower or antenna site. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may, at its option require as a condition of a special\nuse permit, that the tower be camouflaged;\n7. Proposed ingress and egress;\n8. Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or alternative technology. No new tower 50 feet high or\ntaller shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board of Adjustment that no\nexisting tower, structure or alternative technology, that does not require the use of towers or structures, can adequately\nserve the carrier's purposes, even if it does so by other means than accommodating the proposed tower or antenna.\nEvidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology can accommodate the\napplicant's proposed tower or antenna may consist of the following without limitation:\na. No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area which meet the applicant's engineering\n"}, {"page": "38", "text": "requirements;\nb. Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height and cannot be extended to sufficient height to meet the\napplicant's engineering requirements;\nC. Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed\nantenna;\nd. The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing\ntowers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's\nproposed antenna;\ne. The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure\nor\nto adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs required by the owners of existing towers or\nstructures that exceed new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable;\nf. The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures\nunsuitable; and\ng. The applicant demonstrates that alternative technologies that do not require the use of towers or structures are\nunsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render\nthe technology unsuitable.\n(6) Authority to remove; required bond. A performance bond naming the town as the obligee shall be set for 1.25 times\nthe estimated cost of removal of all towers, antennas, and accessory equipment structures that are approved. The\nperformance bond shall be filed prior to issuance of a zoning permit. This amount will be determined by a removal company\nand certified by a Licensed Engineer, and provided to the Zoning Administrator at the time of application. The costs of the\nLicensed Engineer's certification of the removal amount and the selection of the Engineer will be borne by the applicant. For\nevery year following approval, the bond shall increase by an inflation factor based upon the Consumer Price Index (CPI)\nIndex. The applicant / permittee shall furnish a copy of the bond to the Zoning Administrator each year, and failure to do so\nshall result in denial of a permit request or revocation of an existing permit.\n(7) Removal of abandoned antennas and towers\n(a) Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 180 days shall be considered abandoned,\nand the owner of the facility shall physically remove the antenna or tower at its own cost within 90 days of receipt of notice\nfrom the Zoning Administrator notifying the owner of the abandonment.\n(b) If there are two or more users of a single tower or antenna, then this provision shall not become effective until all\nusers cease using the tower or antenna for the prescribed period.\n(c) PHYSICALLY REMOVE shall include, but not be limited to:\n1. Removal of antennas, mount, equipment shelters and security barriers from the subject property;\n2. Proper disposal of the waste materials from the site in accordance with local and state solid waste disposal\nregulations; and\n3. Restoring the location of the facility to its natural condition, except that any landscaping and grading shall remain\nin the after condition.\n(L) Large scale commercial developments.\n(1) The proposed use will complement the existing commercial uses in the town and will add to the economic diversity\nand vitality of the town.\n(2) The Location Quotient (LQ) for the industry within which the proposed use falls under (according to the North\nAmerican Industrial Classification Standard), including the projected number of persons employed by the proposed project,\nis less than one. If the computed Location Quotient (LQ) is greater than one, the proposed project may be, but necessarily,\ndenied. Reasons for approving a project whose computed LQ is greater than one may include a significant amount of\nproposed job creation, a proposed use that may be considered over-represented countywide, but not so within the vicinity of\nthe town, the proposed use will support other existing industries, the proposed project is an infill project or a brownfields\nredevelopment project, or the proposed project significantly conforms with any existing and adopted land use plan for the\ntown. A LQ can be computed using the following formula:\nLQ = (ei + et) + (E, + Et); where:\ne, = local employment in industry i;\net = total local employment;\nE, = national employment in industry i; and\nEt = total national employment.\n(3) The proposed use may only be viably sustained with a structure larger than that which is allowed under \u00a7\n154.068(B) above.\n"}, {"page": "39", "text": "(4) LID stormwater management facilities shall be incorporated into the proposed parking, internal circulation system,\nand property as a whole to such an extent as to slow, treat, and cool the runoff from the entire proposed parking and internal\ncirculation areas generated by the first half inch of rain of a rainstorm.\n(5) All required and otherwise proposed pedestrian paths shall be provided with other pedestrian amenities, such as\nbenches, special landscaping areas, trash cans, decorative light posts, decorative bollards, walls, sculptures or other pieces\nof artwork, or other approved amenities. The amenities shall be provided in such quantity and spacing as approved by the\nZoning Board of Adjustment.\n(6) The architectural design and site design of the proposed commercial structure are such that the larger commercial\nstructure will compliment and fit into the context of the community within the town.\n(a) This is accomplished by incorporating a combination of the following:\n1. Use of high quality exterior finishes such as stone, heavy timber, brick or some other approved material;\n2. Include varied architectural elements such as arcades, archways, recesses, projections, entrance ways or some\nother approved elements;\n3. Use of carefully designed landscaping and screening to effectively visually break down the mass of the\nbuilding;\n4. Use of neutral/earth toned colors on the exterior facade;\n5. Careful site design and layout; and\n6. Other approved architectural, design or engineering methods.\n(b) The following examples show practices and building elements that may not be exactly suited for all large scale\ncommercial developments; however, the examples do exemplify principles that can be applied to all developments.\nExample 1:\n(c) The above example shows a number of desirable architectural details that should be considered in commercial\nbuilding design. The use of heavy timber and stone on the outer facade along with neutral colors helps this building conform\nto the context of a mountain town. The exterior materials also enable the building to settle into the scenery rather than stand\nout as a severe contrast. The roof is varied in height and is broken down into multiple sections reducing the appearance of\nthe mass of the building. This aids in the aesthetics of the building as well as the feel of the building from the perspective of\na pedestrian. This helps maintain a sense of quaintness and offers a scale of building that a human can identify with. The\ncovered entranceway offers a nice transition to the building for patrons and pedestrians and helps reduce the scale and\nmass of the front facade, again aiding the building in maintaining a human and personable scale.\nExample 2:\n"}, {"page": "40", "text": "SS\n(d) In this example the roof line is broken into multiple smaller sections helping to reduce the scale of the building and\noffer visual interest. The sectioned brick columns also lend the building to a pedestrian scale.\nExample 3:\n(e) The above building is a better example of desired site layout than of actual architectural detailing. The building is\nset back from the road, which, in this case, helps maintain the view of the surrounding mountains. Setting a building back\nfrom the road may not always be appropriate, but specific site characteristics should be taken into account when designing a\nproject.\nExample 4:\n(f) The previous examples were of newer buildings, while this example and the ones following are of older buildings\nin town. This example depicts how subtle architectural details can add character and interest to a building. The change in\nbrick work around the window helps offer visual interest to the facade.\nExample 5:\n"}, {"page": "41", "text": "(g) This example shows how a roof line can be varied when brick is used as the main construction material and the\nroof is flat. Flat roofs should be provided with a parapet wall and the parapet wall should be varied in order to offer visual\ninterest.\nExample 6:\nTH\n(h) The above example actually shows multiple buildings that are connected to each other. However, due to the fact\nthat they are in fact connected to one another, they represent one singular large building very well. In this example the roof\nline is varied (although all of the roofs are flat) and the facade is broken up by lawnings. Breaking down the expanse of the\nfront facade makes the building more inviting. The lawnings also offer a degree of protection from the weather to\npedestrians.\n(7) A Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) shall be completed in accordance with the Federal Highway Administration's (FHW)\nManual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and all standard guidelines set forth by the State Department of\nTransportation (NCDOT). Proposed projects that, upon completion of a TIA, are projected to increase the Average Daily Trip\n(ADT) count on an adjacent road by 25% or more may be, but not necessarily, denied by the Zoning Board of Adjustment.\nAll recommendations contained within the submitted TIA shall be implemented.\n(8) In no case will a special use permit be issued for a retail development (for the purposes of this division (L)(8) retail\ndevelopment shall be construed to mean any development whose intended use in part or in whole is the sale of goods or\ncommodities directly to consumers) whose proposed building footprint is larger than 15,000 square feet in the aggregate.\n(9) (a) The property on which the proposed building is to be constructed is not within 1,000 feet of another parcel\nwhereon a commercial structure exists or is proposed to exist whose building footprint is over 10,000 square feet in size.\n(b) This division (L)(9) shall not apply to planned commercial development projects that meet the following criteria:\n1. Subdivision of land is involved with the proposed project;\n2. The proposed development is developed under single or common ownership;\n3. The proposed project intends to create one or more buildings that each are to have a building footprint greater in\nsize than 10,000 square feet or to create multiple structures that exceed 10,000 square feet in aggregate building footprint\n"}, {"page": "42", "text": "area;\n4. The development proposed includes in the design/proposal all utilities, roads and other circulation systems, open\nspaces and buildings as one cohesive design; and\n5. All of the buildings are proposed to share common entrances and exits and parking facilities.\n(M) Other special uses. Other special uses not listed in this section shall meet at least the site plan requirements\ncontained in \u00a7 154.082 above and provide other information so the Board of Adjustment may make the finding as prescribed\nin \u00a7 154.082 above.\n(Ord., Art.

Should these landscaping requirements not be complied with in full upon the expiration of the\nconditional certificate of occupancy, the use of the property for which the certificate was issued shall be discontinued and\nfurther use of the property beyond the expiration date of the certificate shall constitute an illegal use and occupancy of the\nproperty.\n(2) It is not the intent of this section to prevent the use of a material or method of construction not specifically\nprescribed by this section, especially whenever a stream, natural rock formation or other physiographic obstacles make\nconventional compliance extraordinarily difficult or impossible. Alternate materials and methods may, therefore, be utilized to\nsatisfy these requirements, provided that any proposed alternate is suitable for the purpose intended, and is at least the\nequivalent of that specifically prescribed by this section in quality, effectiveness, durability, hardiness and performance. The\nZoning Administrator may require that sufficient evidence and data be submitted to substantiate any claim that may be made\nin this regard.\n"}, {"page": "45", "text": "(a) Existing trees which meet or exceed the minimum standards, as established herein, may be used to satisfy these\nrequirements, and an allowance for the preservation of existing trees may be applied at the following rate:\n(b) In order to qualify for the above table, each existing tree to be preserved must be uniformly encircled with an\neffective protected ground area which shall extend at least seven feet from the base of the tree trunk in all directions, or at\nleast one foot per inch of caliper of the tree trunk measured at grade, whichever is greater.\n(3) During construction, all protected ground areas shall be clearly marked and identified on the site by effective\nbarriers, such as a fence at least three feet high using 2X4 posts not more than ten feet apart with one by four horizontal\nrails and/or covered with orange polyethylene laminar safety fencing, or other effective barriers. No credit will be allowed if\nthere is any encroachment of construction, construction activity or construction materials within the protected ground area.\n(4) Landscaping shall not obstruct the view of motorists using any street, private drive, parking aisle or other\napproaches to street intersections so as to constitute a condition endangering the public safety upon any such street,\ndriveway, parking aisle or street intersection.\n(5) All required planting and landscaped areas shall be maintained at all times in good, stable and healthy condition.\n(E) Specific landscaping requirements.\n(1) Street yards.\n(a) It is the intent of this section to encourage a landscape planting area, hereinafter called a \"street yard\", adjacent\nand parallel to the street right-of-way, but not within it, and containing plantings of trees, and which shall be grassed, and/or\nmulched with organic material and may contain other plantings of shrubs and/or flowers.\n(b) The purpose of street yards is to provide a more pleasing view from the ways of travel, to provide for a continuity\nof vegetation throughout the zoning jurisdiction of the town, to reduce the amount of impervious surface and storm water\nrunoff, to filter air, provide shade and otherwise improve the microclimate of the streets.\n1. Each street yard should contain at least one large maturing tree or two small maturing trees for every 50 linear\nfeet of street yard, or fraction thereof, as measured from the corners of the lot, and the trees shall be located so that at least\none such tree will be within each 75 linear feet of street yard.

A screen that is at least 90% opaque from the ground to a height of at least six feet. The\nscreen is intended to block visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of spatial separation. The screen\nmay be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of\nplanted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of\nfoliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. In any case where vegetation, either existing or\nproposed, is to be used as the required screening device, if the vegetation is to be less than ten feet in width (thickness), a\nfence, wall or similar device at least 50% opaque and six feet in height shall be used in combination with the vegetation. In\nall cases, the screen must be at least 90% opaque in all seasons of the year. Planted vegetation must be a minimum of four\nfeet high and one inch in caliper, measured six inches above grade, when planted. Existing vegetation must be equivalent.\nIn no case shall the screening device required by this section interfere with visibility at intersections or with visibility at\nentrances and exits at public streets. Any trees within the ten foot required buffer yard width may be included in the\nscreening devise.\n(4) Trash container and dumpster screens/buffers. The large metal boxes commonly known as \"dumpsters\" are a type\nof \"trash container\" as such term is used herein. These \"dumpsters\" are, however, referred to in this section by specific name\nfor purposes of emphasis and clarity. It is the intent of this section to provide for visual screens and/or buffers between trash\ncontainer and dumpster locations and all street rights-of-way and adjoining properties.\n(a) Trash containers and dumpsters shall not be located in the front yard of any property and shall be screened from\nview on all sides, except for one opening not greater than ten feet across in width to allow for service access. A screen that\nis at least 90% opaque from the ground to a height of at least eight feet shall be required. The screen is intended to block\nvisual contact and to create a strong impression of spatial separation. The screen may be composed of a wall, fence,\nplanted vegetation, or existing vegetation.\n(b) Screens and/or buffers intended to satisfy this requirement shall be as approved by the Town Manager. Existing\ndumpsters on town property or street rights-of-way will not be grandfathered.\n(Ord., Art.

Outdoor lighting shall be designed to provide the minimum lighting necessary to ensure adequate\nsafety, night vision and comfort, reduce light pollution and not create or cause excessive glare on adjacent properties and\nstreet rights-of-way.\n(B) IESNA cutoff classifications. The following descriptions are designed with minimal word modifications to provide non-\ntechnical clarity. See the appendix for diagrams of these cutoff classifications.\n(1) Full cutoff. A fixture light distribution where no light intensity is emitted at or above a horizontal plane drawn through\nthe bottom of the fixture and no more than 10% of the lamp's light intensity is emitted at or above an angle ten degrees\nbelow that horizontal plane, at all lateral angles around the fixture.\n(2) Cutoff. A fixture light distribution where no more than 2.5% of a lamp's light intensity is emitted at or above a\nhorizontal plane drawn through the bottom of the fixture and no more than 10% of the lamp's light intensity is emitted at or\nabove an angle ten degrees below that horizontal plane, at all lateral angles around the fixture.\n(3) Semi-cutoff. A fixture light distribution where no more than 5% of a lamp's light intensity is emitted at or above a\nhorizontal plane drawn through the bottom of the fixture and no more than 20% of the lamp's light intensity is emitted at or\nabove an angle ten degrees below that horizontal plane, at all lateral angles around the fixture\n(4) Noncutoff. A fixture light distribution where there is no light intensity limitation in the zone above the maximum\ndistribution of light intensity.\n(C) Light measurement technique. Light level measurements shall be made at the property line of the property upon\nwhich the light to be measured is being generated. If measurement on private property is not possible or practical, light level\nmeasurements may be made at the boundary of the right-of-way that adjoins the property of the complainant or at any other\nlocation on the property of the complainant. Measurements shall be made at finished grade (ground level), with the light-\nregistering portion of the meter held parallel to the ground pointing up. The meter shall have cosine and color correction and\nhave an accuracy tolerance of no greater than plus or minus 5%. Measurements shall be taken with a light meter that has\nbeen calibrated within the previous two years. Light levels are specified, calculated and measured in footcandles (FC). All\nFC values are maintained footcandles unless specified otherwise. See the definition for maintained footcandles in \u00a7\u00a7\n154.004 and 154.005 above for maximum allowed light loss factors.\n(D) General standards for outdoor lighting.\n(1) A lighting plan shall be provided for review and must be approved prior to the issuance of the building permit. The\nlighting plan shall demonstrate a consideration for reduced energy consumption through the selection of energy efficient\nfixtures.\n(2) Unless otherwise specified in the following divisions, the maximum light level shall be one- half maintained\nfootcandle at any property line in a residential district, or on a lot occupied by a dwelling, congregate care or congregate\nliving structure, unless otherwise approved by the town. All floodlights shall be installed such that the fixture shall be aimed\ndown at least 45 degrees from vertical. These lights shall be positioned such that any such fixture located within 50 feet of a\npublic street right-of-way is mounted and aimed perpendicular to the right-of-way, with a side-to-side horizontal aiming\ntolerance not to exceed 15 degrees from perpendicular to the right-of-way. The Zoning Administrator may require shields to\nbe installed on floodlights before, during or after the installation when needed to further reduce lighting trespass, glare and\nlight pollution. Flood lights shall not be aimed at residential property, which property shall be construed to mean that property\nwhich contains one or more residential uses and is occupied by either the owner of the property or the renter or lessee of\nthe property.\n<15\nside\nview\noverhead view\n(3) All flood lamps emitting 1,000 or more lumens shall be aimed at least 60 degrees down from horizontal or shielded\nsuch that the main beam from the light source is not visible from adjacent properties or the public street right-of-way.\n(4) All wall pack fixtures shall be full cutoff fixtures.\n"}, {"page": "49", "text": "(5) All fixtures installed for the purpose of illuminating public or private streets shall be full cut-off and shall comply with\nthe standards of this section.\n(6) The lighting plan shall demonstrate a consideration for reduced energy consumption through the selection of energy\nefficient fixtures.\n(7) With the exception of essential all-night security lighting, the plan shall demonstrate lighting reduction procedures,\nimplemented using timers or other methods (such as fixtures that automatically change wattage output). The lighting\nreduction shall be active between approximately 12:00 midnight and dawn. For 24-hr commercial activities, this requirement\nmay be adjusted by approval of the Town Council.\n(8) Hazardous or emergency situational lighting (lighting for emergency vehicles, or lighting temporarily set up for\nemergencies shall be exempt.\n(E) Lighting in outdoor areas (residential and non-residential)\n(1) (a) Other than flood lights and flood lamps, all outdoor area and parking lot lighting fixtures of more than 2,000\nlumens shall be full cutoff fixtures, or comply with division (E)(4) below. Any street lighting located in areas considered as\n\"steep slope\" as defined in the town's Steep Slope Ordinance, shall be full cutoff fixtures.\n(b) The mounting height of all pole mounted outdoor lighting, except outdoor sports field lighting and outdoor\nperformance area lighting shall not exceed 15 feet above finished grade, unless approved by the Town Council as having no\nadverse effect.\n(c) Dusk-to-dawn open bottom security lights, even if privately owned, shall be fully shielded so as to provide a full\ncutoff lighting distribution.\n(d) Security lighting for open parking facilities: For lighted parking lots the minimum light level shall be no less than\n0.2 footcandles. The minimum light level requirements vary depending on the activity classification. The specified minimum\nFC value above 0.2 FC as outlined in the following table means that the lowest light level point or location in the parking lot\nmust not exceed the minimum stated FC value in the table (i.e. 0.9 FC for large shopping centers). An average to minimum\nuniformity ratio of 4:1 means that the average FC to minimum FC ratio cannot be worse (higher) than 4:1. See the following\ntable.\nSecurity Light Levels for Open Outdoor Parking Facilities*\nMaintained\nUniformity\nUse/Task\nFootcandles\nAvg/Min\n*\nSource: IESNA 8th Edition Lighting Handbook; Modification: Medium and Low Activity Level\nrecommendations have been combined.\nNotes:\n1. Illumination levels are horizontal on the task, e.g. pavement or area surface.\n2. Uniformity ratios dictate that average illuminance values shall not exceed minimum values by\nmore than the product of the minimum value and the specified ratio. For example, for\ncommercial parking medium/low activity, the average footcandles shall not be in excess of 2.8\n(0.7 X 4).\n3. A low/medium activity can be reclassified upward when appropriate and only with town\nPlanning Department approval.\n4.

The following provisions apply to outdoor display areas except for car dealership\nparking lots, as specified in division (I)(4) below.\n(1) Parking lot outdoor areas shall be illuminated in accordance with the requirements for division (f) above. Outdoor\ndisplay areas shall have a maximum average maintained illuminance of 24 maintained footcandles.\n(2) All light fixtures shall meet the IESNA definition of cutoff fixtures. Forward throw fixtures (type IV light distribution, as\ndefined by the IESNA) are required within 25 feet of any public street right-of-way. Alternatively, directional fixtures (such as\nfloodlights) may be used provided they shall be aimed in accordance with divisions (D)(2) and (3) above.\n(3) The mounting height of outdoor display area fixtures shall not exceed 15 feet above finished grade.\n(4) For car dealership parking lots, the following provisions shall apply.\n(a) Full cutoff fixtures shall be used.\n(b) Mounting heights: Up to a maximum of 15 plus two-foot raised base for parking areas as needed.\n(c) Lighting at the plane defined by the row of car bumpers closest to the street right-of-way may not exceed a\nmaximum average maintained illuminance of 24 footcandles.\n"}, {"page": "51", "text": "(d) Lighting in the non-display area of the parking lot after hours shall be no higher than seven FC average\nmaintained.\n(5) The use of klieg lights or search lights for the purpose of advertising sales or grand openings shall not be allowed.\n(J) Lighting of buildings.\n(1) Lighting fixtures shall be selected, located, aimed and shielded so that direct illumination is focused exclusively on\nthe building facade, plantings and other intended site features, and away from adjoining properties and the public street\nright-of-way.\n(2)\nIllumination on any vertical surface or angular roof shall not exceed five FC average maintained.\n(3) To the extent practical and where possible, lighting fixtures shall be directed downward rather than upward.\n(4) When upward aiming is used, placement of low wattage fixtures with shields (as needed) close to the building to\ngraze the facade is required to minimize reflected light from windows and other surfaces. The Planning Department can\nwaive this requirement in rare and unusual cases if it is demonstrated that the physical location of light fixtures close to the\nbuilding to accomplish this design is not possible.\n(K) Permanent sign and billboard lighting.\n(1) Lighting fixtures illuminating signs and billboards shall be aimed and shielded so that direct illumination is focused\nexclusively on the sign, Externally lighted signs shall be lighted from the top of the sign downward. The Planning\nDepartment can waive this requirement in rare and unusual cases if it is demonstrated that the physical location of light\nfixtures for top down aiming is not possible. The maximum watts permitted to illuminate a sign are determined by multiplying\nthe sign face area by two watts per square foot. For additional guidance, see the sign section of the town Zoning Ordinance.\nException: signs less than seven feet (two meters) in height above grade may be illuminated by ground mounted uplighting\nnot exceeding 100 lamp watts per sign face.\n(2) Light-Emitting Diode (LED) billboards and/or other permanent signs shall be prohibited.

The walkway, pathway or ground areas that are to be lighted shall be illuminated to a level of at least 0.2\nand no more than one-half average horizontal maintained footcandles.\n(2) Driveway lighting. Non-cutoff decorative or non-decorative post lighting shall be allowed when located at the end of\na residential driveway. Typically this type of driveway light is installed at the end of the drive for purposes of providing\nsecurity to the residents of the dwelling. However, the driveway light shall not use a light bulb that uses energy at a rate\nhigher than 60 watts.\n(N) Landscape lighting. All landscape and residential facade lighting systems shall employ shielded directional luminaires\nnot to exceed 40 lamp watts. The luminaires shall be aimed such that the light source cannot be seen from any reasonable\nviewing point on an adjacent property.\n(O) Permitting and approval process. A permit shall be required for work involving outdoor lighting for commercial, office,\nindustrial and institutional projects with a gross floor area of more than 5,000 square feet, residential projects of more than\nsix units consisting of non-single-family detached dwellings, all major subdivisions, all vehicular canopies, and all outdoor\ndisplay areas.\n(1) The applicant for a permit shall submit the appropriate supporting documentation at the time the application is\nsubmitted for review. The documentation submitted shall include, but not be limited to the following, all or part of which may\nbe part of, or in addition to, the information required elsewhere in this chapter, and by the policies and procedures\nestablished by the town:\n(a) A lighting plan to scale that shows a point-by-point footcandle array on a 10 feet by 10 feet grid in a printout format\nindicating the location and aiming of illuminating devices. The printout shall include a summary table to indicate compliance\nwith the average maintained and minimum footcandles and average to minimum uniformity ratios. FC point values in the\nappropriate areas to determine light trespass compliance is also required. The lighting plan shall include as a minimum an\narrangement of the subject outdoor lighting, a fixture schedule detailing the mounting height and technique, fixture type, bulb\ntype and wattage, controls, lenses and the like. The lighting plan shall demonstrate a consideration for reduced energy\nconsumption through the selection of energy efficient fixtures as well as the implementation of the stated lighting practices\nas outlined throughout this chapter; and\n(b) A point-by-point photometric footcandle array created from industry recognized lighting software systems and/or\nmanual calculations created by a professional engineer, lighting certified professional, vendor or an individual that possesses\nthe skills to perform the calculations. Methods used for calculating the lighting footcandle levels shall be indicated in the\napplication documentation. The footcandle array shall be provided in a hard copy printed format indicating the location and\n"}, {"page": "52", "text": "aiming of all applicable illuminating devices covered under the subject application based on the site and/or building\narrangement plan complete with consideration of adjoining properties and roadways. Description of the illuminating devices,\nfixtures, lamps, supports, reflectors, poles, raised foundations and other devices (including but not limited to manufacturers\nor electric utility catalog specification sheets and/or drawings, and photometric report indicating fixture classification [cutoff\nfixture, wall pack, Hood light and the like]).\n(2) Projects that are not required to submit items identified in this division (O) are still subject to comply with the\nprovisions of this chapter and may be required to provide this information upon request.\n(3) The Town Zoning Administrator or his or her designee may modify and/or waive any part(s) of the above referenced\npermit requirements, provided the applicant can otherwise demonstrate compliance with this code. Note: An example of this\nprovision might be where a contractor or utility repeatedly installs the same lighting equipment on different projects in the\ntown. One submittal containing the specification sheets of a particular group of fixtures may be sufficient for the Planning\nDepartment to modify the project requirement and require that only the other provisions of the ordinance be met since the\nfixture specification provisions have already been met. This modification would conserve town personnel and lighting\nsupplier/installer resources.\n(P) Nonconformities.\n(1) Any lighting fixture lawfully in place or approved by the town prior to the adoption of this chapter shall be exempt\nfrom these requirements.\n(a) At the time that a non-conforming fixture is replaced, moved, upgraded or otherwise changed, the fixture must be\nbrought into compliance with the requirements of this chapter.\n(b) Any expansion of, or addition to, an existing lighting system must conform to the requirements of this chapter.\n(2) Routine maintenance, including changing the lamp, ballast, starter, photo control, lens and other required\ncomponents, is permitted for all existing fixtures. When the fixture housing is changed, the fixture must come into\ncompliance.\n(3) (a) Vehicular canopies do not qualify for the exemption for non-conforming structures described in division (P)(1)\nabove and shall have five years from the adoption date of this chapter to bring the outdoor lighting into compliance. If a\nmajor renovation of the canopy (25% or more of the existing light fixtures) occurs at this facility prior to the expiration of the\nfive-year term, the earlier date will apply regarding compliance.\n(b) Property owners that install lighting fixtures after the effective date of this chapter and are found to be in non-\ncompliance shall receive written notification according to this chapter.\n(4) See division (G)(4) above for nonconformity provisions for outdoor sports fields and performance areas.\n(Q) Effective date. The regulations of this section shall become effective on the date specified by the Town Council upon\nadoption.\n(Ord., Art. XI, \u00a7 1112, passed - -)\n\u00a7 154.108 STREET EDGE.\nAll newly constructed roads shall be provided with a defined street edge. The provision of defined street edges shall help\ndelineate areas that are appropriate for vehicular traffic, increase the aesthetic appeal of public spaces within the town, and\nhelp manage and control storm water runoff from areas of impervious surface. Different types of streets shall dictate the\nappropriate manner in which to define the street's edge.\n(A) Standard curb and gutter.\n(1) Curb and gutter systems shall be constructed according to the State Department of Transportation's Division of\nHighways' standards. The following shall be typical cross sections of standard curb and gutter systems and valley gutter\nsystems:\n1/2' RAD.\n2'-0\"\n2\u00b0\n3\" RAD.\n18\" RAD.\n9\n\"MIN.\n7\"\n2' 6\"\nStandard Curb and Gutter\nVALLEY GUTTER\n(2) The standard curb and gutter system or the valley gutter system shall be used to convey storm water runoff.\nTypically this type of storm water runoff control is used to collect and convey the runoff to a centralized (end of pipe)\ntreatment facility. If a treatment facility is not required and is not installed, then the runoff shall be released from the\nconveyance mechanism in a non-erosive manner. The standard or valley system shall also serve the purpose of effectively\ndefining the street's edge and separating, both horizontally and vertically, the vehicular traffic from any pedestrian activity.\n"}, {"page": "53", "text": "(B) Standard or valley curb and gutter systems and bio-retention facilities\n(1) More development is incorporating storm water management techniques within the site design of a project. This is\ntypically known as an aspect of low impact development. Not to be construed as an exhaustive list, bio-retention cells,\ngrassed swales, rain gardens and storm water wet lands are all facilities that are designed to treat storm water on site with\nlittle or no concrete or metal conveyance (micromanagement). These techniques are typically viewed as positive due to the\nfact that the systems mitigate large quantities of water flowing at high velocities, they generally can treat the runoff for\npollutants, and typically aid in groundwater recharge. To facilitate the use of these systems, standard curb and gutters or\nvalley gutters may be used by incorporating curb cuts. In this fashion the road's edge is defined and storm water is\neffectively conveyed, but for short distances to infiltration aiding systems. While this street edge technique does provide\nvertical separation of vehicular traffic from pedestrian activity, the larger separation comes from the implementation of the\nstorm water control system.\nPotention\n(2) Inlets to the storm water control system shall be provided with energy dissipaters in order to prevent erosion from\nentering waters. Inlets shall also be spaced at least every 12 feet on center and shall be a minimum of 12 inches wide. Other\nthan these curb cuts, the curb and gutter system shall be designed and constructed according to division (A) above. This\ndivision (B) shall not be construed to offer a comprehensive guide on the construction of the storm water systems, rather the\ncurb adjacent to the system.\n(C) Flat curb.\n(1) This method of street edge definition includes the curb, but not the gutter. Typically, this type of curb is used in\nconjunction with the micromanagement storm water systems discussed in division (B) above as it facilitates sheet flow into\nthe management system. However, flat curb systems may be utilized in other applications, such as alleyways, as well as\nother appropriate applications. The flat curb system defines the street's edge, offers minor traffic calming capabilities, allows\nstorm water to enter retention facilities as sheet flow, and can offer minor separation of pedestrians from vehicles. The\nfollowing is an example of a flat curb system:\n(2) It is highly recommended that the flat curbs be constructed of permeable materials, such as permeable pavers,\npermeable concrete, or permeable asphalt. These flat curb areas will not be heavily used and so these types of permeable\nmaterials will remain structurally sound for a considerable time.\n(D) Streets with on-street parking.\n"}, {"page": "54", "text": "(1) For streets that are provided with on-street parking, an edge defining mechanism shall be installed on the moving\nvehicular traffic side of the parking spaces. The edge defining mechanism shall be a flat curb, a wide painted stripe or some\nother effective means. The following diagram shall illustrate the placement of the edge definition:\nEdge\nDefining\nMachanism\nParking Place\n2 -Lane Road Way\n(2) In most cases a similar curb or edging system will be provided on the opposite side of the parking space as well, but\nfor the purposes of this division (D), the edge definition along the street side of the parking places shall be required.\n(E) Streets with bike lanes.\n(1) When a street is constructed and the street incorporates the provision of a bicycle lane, then the bicycle lane may\nserve as the street edge defining mechanism. The street edge may be comprised of the typical white line that delineates the\nbicycle lane, a different colored material as the bicycle lane, or a combination of both. For the purposes of this division (E)\nthe street edge shall be deemed defined by the bicycle lane; however, another edge defining mechanism may be used on\nthe non-vehicular side of the bicycle lane. The following is an example of a street whose edge is defined by a bicycle lane:\n(2) While it is desirable to incorporate permeable, porous and/or recycled materials into traditionally impervious\nsurfaces, the material chosen to construct a bicycle lane should be done in a manner that weighs the texture of the surface\n(as it relates to a bicyclist's riding experience) against the desired environmental benefit of the material.\n(F) Other edge defining techniques. It is recognized that other methods of supplying an adequate road edge exist and\nmay be more appropriate for a given project than those listed above. As such, proposed alternative approaches shall be\nconsidered on a case by case basis.\n(G) Preliminary meeting. If a proposed development project is governed by this section, then a clear description and/or\ndepiction of the proposed street edge defining method shall accompany the applicant's first application for development\napproval. Upon review of the application, the town Zoning Administrator or Subdivision Administrator shall forward the\napplication to the Town Manager and Public Works Director for comments specifically relating to the proposed method of\nstreet edge definition. The approved street edge defining method shall be a part of the approved development plan and shall\nbe binding as such.\n(Ord., Art. XI, \u00a7 1113, passed -)\n\u00a7 154.109 PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION.\n(A) Purpose. The town has a desire to promote pedestrian activity within its territorial limits. This has been exemplified\nthrough the town's efforts in creating a pedestrian plan which aims to increase what can be called the walkability of the area.\nPromoting pedestrian activity can help stimulate economic activity, encourage a healthier citizenry, reduce vehicular\ncongestion along roadways, and help towards decreasing the town's carbon footprint.\n(B) General provisions. As such, certain new developments shall aid in the promotion of pedestrian activity by providing\npedestrian circulation systems. The following provisions shall apply to any pedestrian facilities required by division (C)(1)\nthrough (4) below.\n(1) Standard. All newly constructed pedestrian circulation systems shall be compliant with the \"Americans with\nDisabilities Act\" (ADA) and all applicable State Department of Transportation standards. External pedestrian circulation\nfacilities shall be constructed to line up as closely as possible to any existing neighboring facilities. The width of any external\npedestrian circulation facilities shall match that of any existing neighboring facilities as well; however, in no case may a new\n"}, {"page": "55", "text": "pedestrian circulation facility be less than four feet wide.\n(2) Approval. The town's Zoning Administrator, Council or Board responsible for the final approval of the proposed\ndevelopment project shall be responsible for approving, disapproving or approving with modifications the proposed\npedestrian circulation plan.\n(3) Plan submittal. All development proposals that are regulated by this section shall be required to submit a pedestrian\ncirculation plan. The plan required by this section shall be in combination with the first application submittal required by the\ntown for approval for the applicable development proposal. The plan shall show the extent of the project's proposed internal\npedestrian circulation system and external pedestrian circulation system.\n(4) Fee in lieu of. At the discretion of the authorizing administrator, council, or board, a fee may be paid by the party\nthat is financially responsible for a proposed development project instead of installing external pedestrian circulation\nsystems. The fee shall be determined by first determining the length of required pedestrian systems. Then the volume of\nconcrete that would normally be required to complete the required pedestrian facility shall be computed based on the\npreviously determined length. The current average price of concrete per cubic yard shall be used to determine the cost of\nthe total amount of concrete for the normally required pedestrian facility. That figure shall be increased by 80%. If the town\nprompted the payment of a fee in lieu of constructing the required external pedestrian circulation system, then the previously\ncalculated figure shall be the amount of the fee in lieu of. If the payment of the fee in lieu of pedestrian circulation\nconstruction is at the sole request of the project applicant, then the previously calculated fee amount shall be doubled. The\ntown shall put the paid fee into an account set aside for pedestrian facility development and shall only use the moneys for\nthe construction of new pedestrian facilities or the upgrading of existing pedestrian facilities.\n(C) Specific provisions.\n(1) New subdivisions.\n(a) Applicability. This division (C)(1) shall apply to any new minor subdivision, major subdivision, cluster subdivision,\nplanned unit development, and special subdivision that incorporates condominiums and/or townhouses as defined in \u00a7\n153.27(C) through (F).\n(b) Internal circulation. All development projects to which this division (C)(1) applies shall provide pedestrian facilities\nthat will be accessible to areas of relatively high densities of dwelling units, any commercial components of the\ndevelopment, and any designated open spaces. There shall be no prescribed method of providing adequate pedestrian\ncirculation; however, the two most common methods are the provision of a standard sidewalk system or the provision of off-\nstreet pedestrian trails.\n(c) External circulation. All development projects to which this division (C)(1) apply shall provide pedestrian facilities\nalong the portions of the property that are adjacent to the access granting public street right-of-way, whether the street is\nowned by the State Department of Transportation or the town.\n(2) New commercial structures.\n(a) Applicability. This division (C)(2) shall apply to any newly constructed commercial structure.\n(b) Internal circulation. If a commercial structure is proposed to be located 35 or more feet from the proposed external\npedestrian circulation system (or if a fee in lieu of is paid, the distance shall be measured to the edge of the street right-of-\nway), then internal pedestrian facilities shall be provided. These facilities shall safely and conveniently guide pedestrians\nthrough any parking lot and/or front yard areas to the main entrances of any commercial spaces.\n(c) External circulation. All development projects to which this division (C)(2) apply shall provide pedestrian facilities\nalong the portions of the property that are adjacent to the access granting public street right-of-way, whether the street is\nowned by the State Department of Transportation or the town.\n(3) Remodeled commercial structures.\n(a) Applicability. This division (C)(3) shall apply to any existing commercial structure and/or property that is\nremodeled, altered, repaired or added to such that the cost of the work is equal to or greater than 50% of the assessed tax\nvalue of the property prior to the work being performed.\n(b) Internal circulation. If a commercial structure is located 35 or more feet from any existing external pedestrian\ncirculation system (or if no external pedestrian circulation system exists and a fee in lieu of is paid, the distance shall be\nmeasured to the edge of the street right-of-way), then internal pedestrian facilities shall be provided. These facilities shall\nsafely and conveniently guide pedestrians through any parking lot and/or front yard areas from the adjacent street right-of-\nway to the main entrances of any commercial spaces.\n(c) External circulation. All development projects to which this division (C)(3) apply shall provide pedestrian facilities\nalong the portions of the property that are adjacent to the access granting public street right-of-way, whether the street is\nowned by the State Department of Transportation or the town. Given the fact that the structures and properties to which this\ndivision (C)(3) applies are existing; it is recognized that there may arise unusual hardships in implementing the exact\nstandards contained herein. If an existing pedestrian facility is located on the opposite side of the access granting public\nstreet right-of-way as the subject commercial structure and the subject property's topography or some other characteristic of\nthe property renders the construction of a new external pedestrian facility so infeasible as to pose a hardship upon the\napplicant, then the applicant may have an additional option to that provided in division (C)(4) below. In this scenario the\n"}, {"page": "56", "text": "applicant may provide a safe and adequate street crossing from the existing sidewalk opposite the street right-of-way to\na\npoint within 100 feet of the subject commercial structure. The Town Public Works Director shall have the authority to utilize\ndiscretion in approving the application of this part and in approving proposed street crossings. In approving the proposals,\nthe Public Works Director shall take into account the Town Manager and Planner's comments.\n(4) Streets and utilities.\n(a) Applicability. This division (C)(4) shall apply to street and/or utility repair work that: destroys existing pedestrian\ncirculation facilities; widens the existing right-of-way width by 15% or more; or creates a new street.\n(b) Destruction of existing pedestrian circulation facilities. In the event that the destruction of an existing pedestrian\ncirculation facility occurs as a result of work performed for the maintenance, repair or construction of a portion of a street or\nutility infrastructure, the group or person responsible for the work shall be responsible for restoring the pedestrian circulation\nfacility. If the existing facility was not ADA compliant before the maintenance, repair or construction, then the restoration\nshall render the facility ADA compliant.\n(c) New and expanded rights-of-way. Pedestrian circulation facilities required by division (C)(4)(a) above shall be\nconsidered external pedestrian circulation facilities. These facilities shall be required along all portions of the street that are\nnew or whose right-of-way has been expanded by 15% or more.\n(5) Accessibility during construction. During the construction and/or development of any proposed project, all existing\nexternal pedestrian facilities shall remain accessible to pedestrians. In no case shall a portion of an existing external\npedestrian facility be blocked, destroyed, damaged or otherwise made to be in a state of disrepair so as to render the\npedestrian facility inadequate for the safe mobility of persons with restricted movement capabilities.\n(a) Applicability. This division (C)(5) shall apply to all developments to which divisions (C)(1), (2), (3) and (4) above\napply.\n(b) General regulations. Portions of an external pedestrian facility may be blocked or in some other way rendered\ninadequate for the safe mobility of persons with restricted movement capabilities for a period of time not to exceed 24 hours,\nif the interruption to the pedestrian facility is associated with development and work is being performed to the area\ncontaining the pedestrian facility the entirety of the interruption. One non-exhaustive example of such a circumstance is the\ncutting away of the pedestrian facility, installing the forms for an access drive to a property, pouring the cement into the\nforms, installing the asphalt in the driveway, and letting the wet cement set and the asphalt dry all in one day of work. If the\nsimilar work is being performed, but will take longer than 24 hours before the pedestrian facility is rendered adequate again,\nthen a pedestrian detour shall be provided that adequately provides for the safe mobility of persons with restricted\nmovement capabilities or some other approved alternate ramp or path shall be provided that safely bypasses the pedestrian\nfacility interruption.\n(Ord., Art.
