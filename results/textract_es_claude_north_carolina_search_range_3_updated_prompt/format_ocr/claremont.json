A TIS shall be required for all development that experiences a change in zoning classification\nafter the effective date of this chapter and is projected to generate one thousand five hundred (1,500) daily trips. A TIS may\nbe required by the City of Claremont for any redevelopment or change in use of an existing occupied development that has\nexperienced a change in zoning classification after the effective date of this chapter that would generate one thousand\n(1,000) additional daily trips, and shall be required when the subject development is expected to generate one thousand five\nhundred (1,500) additional daily trips, subject to the exception set out below.\nWhen sufficient information on the proposed development is available for the City of Claremont to determine that the\naforementioned criteria is met, a TIS shall be submitted with all preliminary plats, site plans, site plan revisions, and special\nuse permit applications. The trip rates shall be based on trip generation rates contained in the latest edition of Trip\nGeneration published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers or any local trip generation rates either published or\napproved by the City of Claremont. Additional trips shall be determined by subtracting the gross trip generation of the\nexisting use from the gross trip generation of the proposed use. The additional trip calculation shall apply to property that is\noccupied at the time of submittal or has been occupied at any time prior to submittal.\nIf a development or property experiences a change in zoning classification after the effective date of this chapter and\nspecial circumstances exist, the City of Claremont may require a TIS without regard to the expected trip generation of the\ndevelopment. Factors that would warrant such a requirement are:\n1. There are existing levels of service deficiencies in the area of the proposed development.

Available accident data and/or operational and geometric factors indicate safety concerns.\nNotwithstanding the above, a TIS shall not be required if the property to be rezoned or developed has been the subject of\na TIS within the previous three (3) years and the projected trip generation of the newly proposed development is equal to or\nless than the previous study performed and the trip distribution has not significantly changed. As a part of subdivision, site\nplan and driveway permit approval, the City of Claremont may require needed transportation improvements for the property\nrequesting development approval; however, a TIS shall not be utilized as a means for staff to require the party developing\nthe property to make needed transportation improvements remote from the property for which the TIS is submitted, nor shall\nidentified deficiencies in level of service automatically preclude approval of the proposed development.\nThe TIS shall address the proposed land use, the trip generation therefrom, site access, modal splits if appropriate,\nimpacts on the transportation system from the proposed development, and physical improvements or enforceable\nmanagement strategies to mitigate negative impacts.

There shall be a pre-application meeting for all intended applications. The purpose of the pre-application meeting will\nbe to address issues that will help to expedite the review and permitting process and certain issues or concerns the city may\nhave. A pre-application meeting shall also include a site visit, if there has not been a prior site visit for the requested facility.\nCosts of the city's consultants to prepare for and attend the pre-application meeting will be borne by the applicant and paid\nfor out of a retainer based on the fixed hourly rate to be set in the city's fee schedule applied to the anticipated time\ncustomarily required for the review of similar applications.\n23. An applicant shall submit to the city the number of completed applications determined to be needed at the pre-\napplication meeting. However, applications will not be transmitted to the Board for consideration until the application is\ndeemed complete.\n24.

The holder of a special use permit shall notify the city of any intended modification of a wireless telecommunication\nfacility and shall apply to the city to modify, relocate or rebuild a wireless telecommunications facility.\n26. A zoning permit shall not be issued for construction of the wireless telecommunications facility until there is an\napplication for a specific carrier that documents that the facility is necessary for that carrier to serve the community and that\nco-location on an existing telecommunications structure is not feasible within the applicant's search ring. Co-location on an\nexisting structure is not reasonably feasible if co-location is technically or commercially impractical or impracticable or the\nowner of the wireless telecommunications facility is unwilling to enter into a contract for such use at fair market value.\nSufficient documentation in the form of clear and convincing evidence to support such claims shall be submitted with a\nwireless telecommunications facility application for the first carrier to determine whether co-location on existing structures is\nreasonably feasible and to document the need for a specific height and that less height will serve to prohibit or have the\neffect of prohibiting the provision of service.

An applicant may not by-pass sites of higher priority by stating the site proposed is the only site leased or selected or\nbecause there is an existing lease with a landowner.

Such documentation shall be provided prior\nto consideration of a special use permit when the requested height exceeds the ninety (90) foot maximum height.\n9. Prior to issuing a zoning permit for the co-location of an antenna array on an existing wireless telecommunications\nfacility, an applicant shall demonstrate that the co-location is located appropriately on the wireless telecommunications\nfacility with the overall goal being to preserve the carrying capacity of the wireless telecommunications facility for future co-\nlocations and to minimize the visual intrusiveness and impact, including the profile of the wireless telecommunications\nfacility.\n10.

Stealth: All new wireless telecommunications facilities, including but not limited to towers, shall utilize stealth or\ncamouflage techniques and technology, unless such can be shown to be either commercially or technologically\nimpracticable.\n3. Dual mode: In order to minimize the number of antenna arrays and thus the visual impact, the city may require the use\nof dual mode antennas to be used, including by two (2) different carriers, unless it can be proven that such will not work\ntechnologically and that such would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service in the city.\n4.

Lighting: If lighting is legally required or proposed, the applicant shall provide a detailed plan for sufficient lighting of as\nunobtrusive and inoffensive an effect as is permissible under state and federal regulations. For any wireless\ntelecommunications facility for which lighting is required under the FAA's regulations, or that for any reason has lights\nattached, all such lighting shall be affixed with technology that enables the light to be seen as intended from the air, but\nthat\nprevents the ground scatter effect so that it is not able to be seen from the ground to a height of at least twelve (12) degrees\nvertical for a distance of at least one (1) mile in a level terrain situation. Such device must be compliant with or not in conflict\nwith FAA regulations. A physical shield may be used, as long as the light is able to be seen from the air, as intended by the\nFAA.\n6.

Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to\ndemonstrate that in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.\nb. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property such as location, size, or topography. Hardships\nresulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood\nof the general public may not be the basis for granting a variance.\nC. The hardship did not result from the actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing the\nproperty with knowledge that the circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as\ncreated hardship.\nd. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose and intent of the ordinance, such that public safety, is\nsecured and substantial justice is achieved.\n"}, {"page": "95", "text": "e.
