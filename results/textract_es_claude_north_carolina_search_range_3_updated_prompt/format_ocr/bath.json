This ordinance has been enacted pursuant to the Town's\npolice powers to regulate the public health, safety and general welfare of persons and property as authorized\nby Article 8 of Chapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes and N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 160A-381\net\nseq.\nPart 2 - Definitions\nGlare: The sensation produced by luminance within the visual field that is sufficiently greater than the\nluminance to which the eyes are adapted to cause annoyance, discomfort or loss in visual performance and\nvisibility. In addition, glare is also light emitting from a luminaire with an intensity great enough to reduce\na viewer's ability to see, and in extreme cases causing momentary blindness.\nLight Trespass: Any form of artificial illuminance emanating from a light fixture or illuminated sign that\npenetrates other property and creates a nuisance, as specified in Part 3. Light Trespass is also the shining\nof light produced by a luminaire beyond the boundaries of the property on which it is located.\nObjectionable Direct Glare Source: Glare resulting from excessive levels of illumination or insufficiently\nshielded light sources emanating from light fixtures in the field of view where the lens, lamp or reflector is\noffensively visible above a height of five (5) feet at a property line or a public roadway.\nOutdoor Light Fixture: An luminaire or electrically powered illuminating device containing a total light\nsource of more than 2000 initial lumens per fixture or any spot or flood luminaire with a reflector contained\nin the lamp component such as a parabolic aluminized reflector (PAR) lamp, of more than 1000 initial\nlumens, which is permanently installed outdoors, including but not limited to, devices used to illuminate\nany site, architectural structure, or sign. It is often an assembly that houses the light, lamp or lamps and\ncan include all or some of the following parts: a housing, a mounting bracket or pole socket, a lamp holder,\na ballast, a reflector or mirror, and/or a refractor or lens.\nShielded Light Fixture: A light fixture with cutoff optics that allows no direct light emissions above a\nvertical cutoff angle of 90 degrees above nadir (straight down at perfect vertical), through the light fixture's\nlowest light emitting part. Any structural part of the light fixture providing this cutoff angle must be\npermanently affixed.\nDirect Light or Glare: Light or Glare emitted directly from the lamp, off of the reflector or reflector diffuser,\nor through the refractor or diffuser lens, of a luminaire.\n44\n"}, {"page": "48", "text": "Flood or Spotlight: Any light fixture or lamp that incorporates a reflector or a refractor to concentrate the\nlight output into a directed beam in a particular direction.\nFully shielded lights: outdoor light fixtures shielded or constructed SO that no light rays are emitted by the\ninstalled fixture at angles above the horizontal plane as certified by a photometric test report.\nHeight of Outdoor Light Fixture or Luminaire: The height of an outdoor light fixture or luminaire shall be\nthe vertical distance from the ground directly below the centerline of the luminaire to the lowest direct-\nlight-emitting part of the luminaire.\nIndirect Light: Direct light that has been reflected or has scattered off of other surfaces.\nLamp: The component of a luminaire that produces the actual light.\nLumen: A unit of luminous flux. One foot-candle is one lumen per square foot. For the purposes of this\nOrdinance, the lumen-output values shall be the INITIAL lumen output ratings of a lamp.\nLuminaire: This is a complete lighting system, and includes a lamp or lamps and a fixture. Luminaires\nnot conforming to this code that were in place at the time this code was voted into effect must be removed\nor changed within thirty (30) days of the date of execution of this Ordinance.\nOutdoor Lighting: The evening and/or night-time illumination of an outside area or object by any man-\nmade device located outdoors that produces light by any means.\nPart 3 - Regulations\nA.

Any Luminaire with a\nlamp or lamps rated at a total of MORE than 2000 lumens, and all Flood or Spot Light or Luminaires with\na lamp or lamps rated at a total of MORE than 1000 Lumens, shall not emit any direct light above a\nhorizontal plane through the lowest direct-light-emitting part of the Luminaire.\nB. Mounting Heights - The maximum height for Outdoor Light Fixtures shall be twenty-five (25) feet\nmeasured from final grade to the top of the Outdoor Light Fixture. For Outdoor Light Fixtures in the interior\nof development projects, the Planning Board for the Town of Bath may, subject to a public hearing and\nnotification of all property owners of record within 300 feet of the subject parcel, approve greater mounting\nheights when all of the following conditions are met:\na. Fewer luminaries will be required for the site; and\nb. The greater mounting height will not cause light trespass and/or glare beyond the property line for reasons\nof topography, screening, or similar circumstances; and\nC. The greater mounting height will contribute less artificial sky glow by reducing the intensity of the\nlighting beneath the light fixture.\nC.
