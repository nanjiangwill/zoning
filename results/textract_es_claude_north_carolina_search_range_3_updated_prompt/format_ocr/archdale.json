The form and density of residential development in the Downtown\nResidential District is intended to help build and sustain a critical mass of residents living in\na\nwalkable environment that is connected to Downtown Archdale in order to enhance the viability\nof a diverse array of commercial and civic uses in the downtown area.\n2.1.8 Office and Institutional District (OI)\nThe Office and Institutional District (OI) is established to provide for business and professional\noffice service occupations and light commercial uses. Because the office and institutional uses\nare subject to the public view, developers and operators of offices and businesses should provide\nan appropriate appearance, parking, and design of entrances and exits to offices and businesses\nin a manner to minimize the traffic congestion.\n2.1.9 Highway Business District (HB)\nThe Highway Business District (HB) is established for the retailing of goods and services that cater\nprimarily to the passing motorists. Uses in this district are highly intensive in nature, require high\nvisibility, and have significant front setbacks. Developments in this district are located along\nmajor thoroughfares and are within a close proximity to the interstate highway.\n2.1.10 B-1 Business District\nThe B-1 Business District is established to provide for retailing goods and services to the passing\nmotorists and residents living in the area.

This district is intended to allow a lower density of manufacturing and\nwarehousing operations which create a more desirable appearance and less environment\npollution than a more dense manufacturing zone. These uses normally seek outlying locations\non large tracts of land where the operations involved do not detract from the development\npotential of nearby development property. The purpose of these regulations is to control\nbuilding and traffic congestion and to provide an appropriate community appearance.\n2.2\nConditional Zoning Districts Established: Purposes Set Forth\nParallel Conditional Zoning Districts are hereby established to correspond to each Base Zoning\nDistrict established in Section 2.1, excepting the GRD District. For the purposes of record-keeping\nand administering the Ordinance, each Conditional Zoning District shall be denoted by the prefix\n\"CD\" and assigned a unique case number.\n2.2.1 Purpose and Intent\nIt is recognized that certain zoning districts would be inappropriate to establish in certain\nlocations in the absence of site-specific conditions that ensure the compatible development and\nuse of the property in the context of its location in the City and the surrounding uses and\ndevelopment pattern. Where the applicant for rezoning desires property to be rezoned to such\na district in such situations, Conditional Zoning is the means by which such site-specific conditions\ncan be imposed in the furtherance of the purpose of this Ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan.\nZoning map amendments to a Conditional Zoning District classification will be considered only\nupon request of a property owner. If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these\nregulations is found to be illegal or invalid, or if the applicant should fail to accept any written\ncondition, it is the intent of this Ordinance that the authorization of such Conditional Zoning\nDistrict shall be null and void and of no effect and that proceedings shall be instituted to rezone\nthe property to its previous zoning classification.\n8\n"}, {"page": "16", "text": "City of Archdale Zoning Ordinance\n2.2.2 Uses Permitted in a Conditional Zoning District\nWithin a Conditional Zoning District, only those uses authorized as permitted or special uses in\nthe Base Zoning District with which the Conditional Zoning District corresponds shall be\npermitted, and all other requirements of the corresponding district shall be met as minimum\nstandards.
