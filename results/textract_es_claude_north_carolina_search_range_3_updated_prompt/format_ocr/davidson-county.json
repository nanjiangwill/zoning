The additional regulations imposed in the AHD are designed to place\nadditional restrictions on buildings, structures and trees.\nThe District is intended to be utilized as an overlay designation which identifies areas subject to\nsupplementary regulations and designated as such on the Zoning Atlas.\nAirport Zone Height Limitations\nExcept as otherwise provided in this section, no structure shall be erected, altered or maintained, and\nno trees shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this section to a height in excess of the\napplicable height limitations herein established for each zone in question as follows.\n1)\nApproach Zone-AHD. Slopes thirty-four (34) feet outward for each one (1) foot upward\nbeginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a\nhorizontal distance of ten thousand (10,000) feet along the extended runway centerline.\n2) Transitional Zones-AHD-T. Slopes seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the\nside of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach surface, and\nextending to a height of one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation or eight\nhundred and seventy four (874) feet above mean sea level, and extending one thousand fifty\n(1,050) feet each side of runway primary surface. In addition to the foregoing, there are\nestablished height limits sloping seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the\nsides and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to where they intersect\nthe horizontal surface.\n3)\nHorizontal Zone-AHD-H. Established at one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport or at an\nelevation of eight hundred and seventy four (874) feet above mean sea level.\n4) Conical Zone-AHD-C. Slopes twenty (20) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the\nperiphery of the horizontal zone and at one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation\nand extending to an elevation of one thousand seventy four (1,074) feet above mean sea level.\nThere are four conical zones (AHD-C-A, AHD-C-B, AHD-C-C, and AHD-C-D) one thousand (1,000)\nfeet horizontally and rise over three hundred (300) feet in elevation.

In the case of lots not bounded by four lines, the rear line shall be construed to be perpendicular\nto the longest front-to-rear axis at a point where the length of such rear line within lot lines is not less\nthan 25 feet. Depth of regular corner and through lots shall be measured in the same manner, with the\nfollowing adjustments. Lines constructed at street right-of-way lines corresponding to one or more side\nlot lines on interior lots, and lines constructed at street frontages corresponding to rear of lines on\ninterior lots shall conform to straight-line extensions or connections of the edges of the lot where radii\nhave been established at intersections or streets are curvilinear.\n(B) Width of Regular Lots\nWidth of a regular lot shall be determined by measurement at the required front setback, provided that\nthe width between side lot lines at the street shall not be less than eighty percent (80%) of the required\nminimum lot width. In the case of lots on the turning circle of a cul-de-sac or at points of street\ncurvature where the radius at the right-of-way line (or a circle approximately following the right-of-way\nline and intersecting the foremost points of the side lot lines) is less than 90 feet, the eighty percent\nrequirement shall not apply.\nOn corner lots and through lots, width requirements shall be considered met if the regular lot has one\nfrontage meeting such requirements and contains a buildable area of width, depth and area at least\nequivalent to that remaining on a rectangular interior lot of minimum dimensions required in the\ndistrict.\n(C) Lot Frontage of Regular Lots\n1) On regular interior lots, the front shall be construed as the shortest boundary adjacent to a\nstreet.

Where property corners are rounded, such points shall be\nplotted by projecting the lot lines to the point where they would have met without rounding.\nDepth of required setbacks adjacent to public streets shall be measured perpendicular to such\nstraight lines, and the inner line of such required setbacks shall be parallel to the outer line.\n2) Front Setbacks on regular lots are open spaces extending across the frontage of the lot between\nside lot lines. Depth of required front setbacks shall be measured as indicated under setbacks\nadjacent to streets, above.\n3) Interior setbacks on regular lots are all setbacks other than those adjacent to streets.\n4) Rear setbacks on regular lots are open spaces extending across the full width of the lots at the\nrear, between side lot lines. Corner and through lots will have no rear setbacks, but only front\nand side setbacks. For most lots, depth of a rear setback shall be measured perpendicular to the\nlot line, so that the required setback is a strip of the minimum depth prescribed by district\nregulations. However, in the case of lots whose rear lines intersect in the general form of an\nangle pointing away from the street the required rear setback shall be construed as running\nbetween the apex of the angle and a line parallel to the rear line of the required front setback,\nand at the distance prescribed for a rear setback from the apex of the angle. Adjacent to the\nremainder of such lot lines, side setback requirements shall apply.\n5) Side setback on regular lots run from the rear line of the front setback to the front line of the\nrear setback. The depth of a side setback shall be measured perpendicular to the side lot line,\nso that the required setback is a strip of the minimum depth prescribed by district regulations.\nSection IV.11\nDIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR IRREGULAR LOTS\n(A) Computing Setbacks\n1) Minimum lot area, computed as for regular lots, shall meet district requirements for the\nproposed uses and structures.\nArticle IV.
