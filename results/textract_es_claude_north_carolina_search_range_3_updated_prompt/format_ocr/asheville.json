VI from \"Variances and Administrative Appeals\" to read as set\nout.\n"}, {"page": "43", "text": "Sec. 7-6-1. Variances.\n(a) Purpose. The variance process administered by the board of adjustment is a quasi-judicial process intended to provide limited relief from the requirements of this chapter in\nthose cases where strict application of a particular requirement will create an unnecessary hardship prohibiting the use of land in a manner otherwise allowed under this chapter.\nIt\nis not intended that variances be granted merely to remove inconveniences or financial burdens that the requirements of this chapter may impose on property owners in\ngeneral or to increase the profitability of a proposed development. Rather, it is intended to provide relief where the requirements of this chapter render the land difficult to use\nbecause of some unique physical attribute of the property itself or some other factor unique to the property for which the variance is requested.\n(b) Provisions which may not be varied by the board of adjustment:\n(1) Other than those exceptions explicitly noted, in no event shall the board of adjustment grant a variance to any special requirement set out in article XVI for a use by\nright subject to special requirements, or grant a variance with respect to any special use permit or conditional zoning district ordinance adopted pursuant to this chapter.\n(2) In no event shall the board of adjustment grant a variance which would modify, alter, change, or suspend the special requirements set forth in article XVI of this\nchapter, for a use by right, subject to special requirements, or a conditional use.\n(3) In no event shall the board of adjustment grant a variance to the flood protection provisions within the designated floodway district which would result in any increase\nin the flood levels during the regulatory flood discharge.\n(4) In no event shall the board of adjustment grant a variance which would permit the creation of a n-conforming lot except that the board may grant a variance\npermitting a reduction in lot area and dimensional standards, for an individual lot located in residential districts, provided that the variance does not permit a reduction of\ngreater than ten percent in the required lot area and dimensional standards. Provided further, applications for such variance for additional lot(s) under common ownership\nor located within the same development shall not be submitted within three years of submittal of the previous application, regardless of the decision of the board on the\nprevious application.\n(5) In no event shall the board of adjustment grant a variance from the design guidelines established for local historic districts and historic landmarks.\n(6) In no event shall the board of adjustment grant a variance which would conflict with the North Carolina State Building Code, the Asheville Fire Prevention Code, or\nany other state code unless otherwise authorized by laws and regulations.\n(7) Reserved.\n(8) In no event shall the board of adjustment grant a variance from the landscape and buffering standards set forth in section7-11-1 of this chapter.\n(c) Applications.\n(1) An application for a variance may be filed only by the owner of the land affected by the variance or an agent specifically authorized in writing by the owner to file such\napplication.\n(2) Before filing the application, the applicant is strongly encouraged to meet with the planning and development director or the engineering director if proceeding under\nsections 7-5-12, 7-12-1 or 7-12-2 of this chapter to discuss the proposed variance and to become more familiar with the applicable requirements and approval procedures\nof the city.\n(3) An application for a variance shall be filed with the city clerk who will then forward to the planning and development director or the engineering director, if proceeding\nunder section 7-5-12, 7-12-1 or 7-12-2, on a form prescribed by the director, and containing such information and plans as required on the application form. The notice of\nappeal shall state the grounds for the appeal.\n(4) The application shall be accompanied by a fee as set forth in the City of Asheville's Fees and Charges Manual.\n(5) Once an application is accepted as complete by the clerk, the planning and development director or the engineering director, if proceeding under the section7-5-12,\n7-12-1 or 7-12-2, the application will be scheduled for consideration at a public hearing by the board of adjustment; provided however, all appeals and requests for\nvariances under section 7-5-12 and 7-12-1 of this chapter shall initially be heard by the specifications review committee.\n(d) Action by the board of adjustment.\n(1) Upon receiving the application materials, the board of adjustment shall hold a quasi-judicial hearing on a proposed variance. Notice of the hearing shall be provided in\naccordance with the provisions of section 7-5-20 of this chapter.

It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no\nreasonable use can be made of the property.\n(2) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well\nas hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance.\n(3) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that\nmay justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.\n(4) The variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose and intent of the ordinance such that public safety is secured and substantial justice is achieved.\nNo\nchange in permitted uses may be authorized by the variance. Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance provided that the conditions are reasonably related to the\nvariance.\n(f) Standard of review-flood regulations variances.

See section 7-13-9 of this chapter.\n(h) Effect of approval or denial.\n(1) After the board of adjustment approves a variance, the applicant shall follow all appropriate procedures set forth in article V of this chapter for the receipt of permits,\ncertificates, and other approvals necessary in order to proceed with development.\n"}, {"page": "44", "text": "(2) An application for a rehearing may be made in accordance with the board of adjustment's rules of procedure.\n(i) Appeals.

In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by restraining order which may be granted by the Superior Court of Buncombe\nCounty on notice to the administrative official from whom the appeal is taken, with due cause shown. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file\nwith the official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the board of adjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a permit or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the ordinance shall not stay the further\nreview\nof an application for permits or permissions to use such property.

Conditional zoning is established to provide for flexibility in the development of property while ensuring that the development is compatible with neighboring uses.\nConditional zoning affords a degree of certainty in land use decisions not possible when rezoning to a general use district. Additional conditions, standards and regulations are\nattached to a proposed development to ensure that the activities and operations are compatible with the surrounding uses and with applicable adopted plans in accordance with\nthe requirements of this section.\n(b) Conditional zoning districts. Conditional zoning is available to any of the general zoning classifications enumerated in this chapter, except for those that require a master\nplan as part of the application (e.g. Urban Village). Expansion zoning districts are only allowed as conditional zoning districts for Level III projects and as otherwise indicated in\nthe Table of Permitted Uses and this UDO. Applicants for Level III projects shall select the most applicable expansion district based on the proposed use(s).

A conditional zoning involving an expansion district must meet all standards\nand requirements of the expansion district.\n(4) No uses shall be permitted except those enumerated in the ordinance adopting the conditional zoning.\n(5) The conditions agreed upon pursuant to the conditional zoning approval shall be stated in the adopting ordinance and may limit the uses which are permitted on the\nproperty. By way of illustration and not limitation, conditions may specify location on the property of the proposed structure(s), the number of dwelling units, the location\nand extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways, access streets, and sidewalks, the location and extent of landscaping, buffer areas and open space, the\ntiming of development, the height of structures, the design and orientation of structures, the location and extent of rights-of-way and other areas to be dedicated for public\npurposes, and other such matters as may be identified as appropriate for the proposed development.\n(6) Minor modifications to the approved site plan may be reviewed and approved administratively provided that they do not involve a change in permitted uses, changes\nin overall density or substantial changes to the configuration of the development that affect the operation or impacts of the development. Any other modification of the\nconditions and standards in a conditional zoning district shall be approved by the city council following this review process as an amendment to the conditional zoning\nordinance and may be referred to the technical review committee as appropriate. The planning and urban design director shall in every case have the discretion to decline\nto exercise the power to approve minor modifications as provided for herein, and may require the applicant to seek an amendment to the conditional zoning ordinance.\n(7) When adopting or rejecting any zoning amendment, the city council shall also approve a statement describing whether its action is consistent with an adopted\ncomprehensive plan and any other officially adopted plans that are applicable, and briefly explain why the council considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the\npublic interest.

The\nconditional zoning ordinance may provide a specific duration of the approval. Appropriate approval conditions may be added to guarantee site maintenance and security.\nNothing herein shall be construed to extend any time limitations prescribed by statute or by other ordinances in this chapter.\n(10) If the use(s) commenced pursuant to a conditional zoning ordinance is abandoned or discontinued as described in article 17 the planning and urban design director\nmay initiate appropriate action to rezone the affected property to any other classification or the applicant may seek an amendment to the conditional zoning approval by\nfollowing the process outlined in this chapter.\n(11) No variances or conditional use permits may be issued for developments on property that is subject to a conditional zoning ordinance.\n"}, {"page": "47", "text": "(d) Pre-application procedure.\n(1) Pre-application conference.

VIII from \"General Use Districts\" to General Use and Expansion Districts.\"\nSec. 7-8-1. Enumeration and description of districts; designation of districts on official zoning maps.\n(a) Criteria for zoning districts. For the purposes set forth in article I, the City of Asheville and its extraterritorial jurisdiction are divided into zoning districts taking into account the\ndesign, size, and/or location of one or more of the following:\n(1) Transportation facilities, including streets, sidewalks, and bridges;\n(2) Schools, parks, greenways, and other public facilities and requirements;\n(3) Police protection;\n(4) Fire protection;\n(5) Sanitary sewer and stormwater drainage structures;\n(6) Water supplies for purposes of fire protection and consumption;\n"}, {"page": "48", "text": "(7) Access and location to other utility services;\n(8) Potential hazards from fire, flooding, and diseases;\n(9) Access to light and air from buildings;\n(10) Access for fire and police protection and refuse collection;\n(11) Protection for occupants of dwellings from noise, dust, and gases caused by traffic and other uses;\n(12) Topography and other natural features; and/or\n(13) Current uses of land and buildings for residences, businesses, industries, places of worship, schools, and for other uses and heights of buildings, the size and\nlocation of yards, and the density of population in each of the zoning districts hereinafter mentioned.\n(b) Enumeration and descriptions of zoning districts. There are three types of zoning districts:\n(1) General use districts are those in which a variety of uses are permitted. The general use districts established in this article are classified from \"highest\" to \"lowest\" in\nthe following order:\n\"Highest\"\nRS-2 Residential Single-Family Low-Density District\nRS-4 Residential Single-Family Medium Density District\nRS-8 Residential Single-Family High Density District\nRM-6 Residential Multi-Family Low Density District\nRM-8 Residential Multi-Family Medium Density District\nRM-16 Residential Multi-Family High Density District\nNeighborhood Business District\nOffice District\nOffice II District\nOffice/Business District\nCommunity Business I District\nCommunity Business II District\nUrban Residential District\nNeighborhood Corridor District\nHaywood Road Form District\nRiver Arts Form District\nUrban Village District\nUrban Place District\nResort District\nInstitutional District\nHighway Business District\nRegional Business District\nCentral Business District\nRiver District\nCommercial Industrial District\nLight Industrial District\nIndustrial District\n\"Lowest\"\nFor any district where an overlay district is found, the overlay district shall have the same order as the general use district for the purpose of determining its hierarchy under the\ntable.\n(2) Overlay districts are zoning districts which overlap one or more general use districts. Overlay districts (article IX) involve additional regulations on some or all property\nwithin underlying general use districts. The following overlay districts are established:\na. Reserved.\nb. Historic preservation overlay district(s). Asheville's historic areas are important assets to the city. The protecting and conserving of the historic areas is\nencouraged through the establishment of historic preservation overlay districts. Designation of an area as a historic district and the development of design\nstandards for the area help preserve the architectural integrity of the area and stabilize and enhance property values. Historic districts, protected by designation as\npreservation overlays, serve as valuable educational tools and as tourist attractions.\nC. Downtown design review overlay district. Urban design review assists in protecting the downtown local architectural heritage and in the preservation of the\nconsiderable economic investments that have occurred over the years. The downtown design review process seeks to encourage renovation and new development\nin a manner that will promote visual harmony, enhance the historical integrity, and develop creative design solutions. While the design guidelines will not dictate\narchitectural styles, they will suggest a variety of design options for achieving compatibility within the designated boundaries.\nd. Manufactured housing and manufactured housing community overlay districts. The manufactured housing and manufactured housing community overlay\ndistricts are established to provide a procedure for identifying areas in which manufactured housing may be located and to establish standards for individual\nmanufactured homes and for the development of communities. These overlay districts are intended to expand the range of housing opportunities available to\nresidents of Asheville while assuring that manufactured housing is compatible with existing development.\ne. Blue Ridge Parkway Overlay District. Realizing the importance of the Blue Ridge Parkway to the economy of Asheville and western North Carolina, the Blue\nRidge Parkway Overlay District is created to protect and preserve the unique features of this asset to the city. The standards established in this district will protect\nthe scenic quality of the parkway and reduce encroachment on its rural setting.\nf. Transition overlay district. Several areas in the City of Asheville are experiencing development pressures which are pushing the areas toward change. The\nlocation of most of these area on the edge of residential neighborhoods means that changes in these areas could have a significant impact on the adjacent\nneighborhoods. Transition overlay districts are established to allow these areas to change while assuring that the change is compatible with adjacent areas.\nStandards are developed individually for each area and designed to meet each area's unique needs. Involvement of area property owners and residents in the\npreparation of development standards is encouraged.\n(3) Conditional districts are zoning districts which provide for flexibility in the development of property while ensuring that the development is compatible with neighboring\nuses. Conditional zoning districts are available for any of the general use zoning classifications enumerated in this ordinance; moreover, there are certain conditional\ndistricts that are not associated with an existing general use district and may only be considered with Level III developments. These districts include:\nCentral Business Expansion District\nInstitutional Expansion District\n"}, {"page": "49", "text": "Commercial Expansion District\nResidential Expansion District\nIndustrial Expansion District\nLodging Expansion District\nMixed Use Expansion District\n(c) Designation of districts on official zoning maps. Each district shall be shown on the official zoning maps of the City of Asheville, North Carolina, a copy of which is located in\nthe city planning and development department. Said set of maps, and all district designations, boundaries, figures, letters, and symbols shown on such maps are hereby declared\nto be a part of this chapter.\n(d) Table of Permitted Uses.

Regional Business District.\n(a) Purpose. The Regional Business District is established to provide areas for large scale commercial operations. This district is intended to encourage innovative development\nthat is integrated with adjacent uses. It is not the intent of the district to encourage strip commercial areas, but rather a concentration of commercial activities with an overall\ndesign scheme. This district is designed to be located around the intersections of high traffic volume thoroughfares such as interstate highways and arterial roads. This district\npermits a wide range of commercial uses and is easily accessible by the automobile. The Regional Business District is characterized by high traffic generation, large structures\nwhich may contain multiple businesses, and shared parking and access between adjacent businesses. Although the automobile and bus are the primary modes of transportation\nto this district, pedestrian connections between the businesses within the district enhance the functionality of the district.\n(b) Allowable land uses. All permitted uses, special uses, conditional uses and uses expressly prohibited are identified in subsection7-8-1(d), Table of Permitted Uses.\nStandards for special uses and conditional uses can be found in article XVI of this chapter.\n(c) Reserved.\n(d) Reserved.\n(e) Reserved.\n(f) Development standards.\n(1) Density standards.

It shall be the purpose of the Central Business District to reinforce the downtown as the urban center of Asheville and Western North Carolina, encouraging private\nand public investment which will preserve the Central Business District as the primary retail, office, hotel, institutional, cultural and entertainment center of our community. It is\nfurther the purpose of this district to encourage a strong supportive retail center along with high density residential development which will complement other downtown uses and\nsurrounding neighborhoods. A high priority is placed on design, integrating new uses into and with existing architecture in a respectful and cohesive manner. Design review\nguidelines in place for the downtown area remain as a companion document for urban design decisions. Development within this district should facilitate the circulation patterns\nand needs of individuals and business alike. A well-balanced transportation system for this district must recognize the importance of all forms of movements, be it pedestrian,\nbicycling, transit, automobile, or truck in nature.\n(b) Allowable land uses. All permitted uses, special uses, conditional uses and uses expressly prohibited are identified in subsection7-8-1(d), Table of Permitted Uses.\nStandards for special uses and conditional uses can be found in article XVI of this chapter.\n(c) Reserved.\n(d) Reserved.\n(e) Reserved.\n(f)\nDevelopment standards-Downtown. The following development standards apply to all parcels zoned Central Business District for new construction and/or changes that\nmodify the exterior walls and/or roof of an existing building that are located within the boundaries of the Downtown Design Review Overlay District, as described in section 7-9-3\nof this chapter. Routine maintenance, repairs or replacement of same or similar materials on existing buildings are exempt from these requirements.\n(1) Density standards. None.\n"}, {"page": "62", "text": "(2) Structure size standards. Structure size shall not be limited except that height and design and operational standards shall apply.\n(3) Lot size standards. None.\n(4) Lot width standards. None.\n(5) Setback standards. The following minimum setbacks shall be required for uses in the Central Business District.\nFront:\nMinimum setback: Zero feet from the right-of-way line. For corner lots buildings are to be placed at the corner.\nMaximum setback: Zero feet from the right-of-way line. The following exceptions to the maximum setback may be permitted. The agency or official responsible for project\nreview may consider allowing greater setbacks under one or more of the following circumstances:\na. A setback of up to 50 feet from the edge of the curb may be approved for places of worship, civic and governmental buildings, and residential projects that will\nprovide a public space, such as a courtyard or plaza space.\nb. A setback of up to 20 feet for uses in the district providing courtyard or plaza spaces in the setback area.\nCourtyard and plaza areas should meet definitions located in 7-2-5 of this chapter which describe form and purpose. The main fa\u00e7ade of the building must face this\nsetback area.\nC. An adopted plan or other official document of the city recommends a greater setback.\nd. A greater setback is determined as part of a design review process or is the result of an addition (that is otherwise compliant with this article) to an existing\nbuilding.\nSide: None required, except that a 15-foot setback will be required when adjacent to residentially zoned property.\nRear: None required, except that a 15-foot setback will be required when adjacent to residentially zoned property.\n(6) Impervious surface standards. None.\n(7) Height standards. For the definition of height see building height in section7-2-5 of this chapter. The minimum height for new structures in the Central Business\nDistrict will be two stories (a minimum of 24 feet). Maximum building height will be determined according to the context transition edge map, the height zone map, the\nheight zone edge setback and shadow impacts described below and with maps following this section.\na. The two-story requirement for new construction will mean that:\n1. A second floor is provided as a full occupiable floor and a mezzanine level will not be sufficient to meet this requirement; and\n2. Civic uses such as places of worship, arenas, auditoriums, and performance centers will not be required to meet the two-story requirement described in\nsubsection 1. above.\nb. Context transition edge: The first step in determining the height permitted for a structure is to review the context transition edge map found at the end of this\nsection to determine if it is applicable to the specific property. This map shows areas where a gradual scale transition is required for new downtown construction\nfrom nearby established residential neighborhoods. The map reflects a specific height overlay for properties located near the context transition edge (a 100-foot-\nwide area measured from the transition line). Buildings located within this transition edge will have their actual height determined by using the formula for height: H\n= D/1.5; (where H is the height of the building and D is the distance from the transition edge). The one exception is that a two-story structure with a 15-foot setback\nwhen adjacent to residentially zoned property is exempt from the formula requirements.\nContext Transition Edge\nBuildings shall be set back from the\nContext Transition Edge distance to\nat least 1.5 times their height for the\nfirst 100' of lot depth.\naximum\nbuilding\nContext Transition\nenvelop\nEdge\n> 1.5 height b\nproposed\nResidentially\nbuilding\nzoned property\ntwo stories\nallowed by right\n1.5 height a\nC. Height zones: Measurement of height: The second step in determining the height permitted for a structure is to review the building height zone map located at\nthe end of this section.\n(1) The intermediate height zone is 145 feet and the tallest height zone is 265 feet.\n(2) Actual building heights may exceed this height by an additional overall amount of 50 feet to accommodate such uses as the final occupied floor,\nmechanical penthouses and roof cap features.\nd. Height zone edge setback from the right-of-way: To protect certain views in downtown, as illustrated on the height zone map by a dashed line (specific to\nportions of four streets listed below), a height zone edge setback is established. The height zones for the intermediate height zone and the tallest height zone follow\nproperty lines except for the following streets where a height transition between these two zones 40 feet wide measured from the right-of-way line edge will be\nobserved:\n(1.) College Street between the tunnel and Town Mountain Road.\n(2.) Haywood Street between Battery Park Avenue and N. French Broad Avenue (south side).\n(3.) Patton Avenue from Pearl Street to Otis Street (both sides of street) and continuing from Otis Street to the point of Pritchard Park (south side).\n(4.) Hilliard Avenue between Clingman Avenue and Pearl Street (north side).\ne. Shadow impact limits: Shadows from new construction on large or small public parks or public plazas are limited by the following standard:\n(1.) Shadows impacts on any one point are limited to no more than two hours between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. on the spring or fall equinox at\nground level; March 21 or September 21 respectively.\n(2.) Where no right-of-way exists between the proposed project and the public park or plaza, a 50-foot buffer free of any shadow limitations will be\nobserved.\nThis shadow impact standard will not apply to smaller public spaces such as pocket parks or private plazas, parks and courtyards. See the definition for parks\nspecific to the Central Business District in section 7-2-5 of this chapter for further clarification.\nf. One story additions to existing buildings are approved under the following circumstances:\n1. Additions are permitted when they are:\na. 1,000 square feet or less, or\nb. The addition does not expand the footprint of the existing building by more than 20 percent; and\nC.\nThe addition is located no closer than five feet of the primary fa\u00e7ade of an existing contributing structure in the Downtown National Register\nDistrict, or is located at the rear of the existing building so there is no affect on the primary fa\u00e7ade, or for non-contributing structures is placed to make\n"}, {"page": "63", "text": "the existing building either equal to or more compliant with setback requirements; and\nd. As measured from the primary street fa\u00e7ade, the width of the addition shall not exceed 50 percent of the width of the existing building, and\ne. Other fenestration and design requirements if any, apply.\n2. One-story accessory structures, that are in support of a primary use on a site are allowed when:\na. Placement of the accessory structure is behind or to the side of the primary building or in the case of outside dining spaces for restaurants, may\nbe placed at the front of the lot to enhance activity at the sidewalk level, and\nb. Fenestration and design requirements if any, apply.\nOther additions that fall outside of these provisions may be considered by the planning and zoning commission following the usual process for variances, which includes a\nrecommendation from the downtown commission.\n(8) Landscaping/buffering standards. Landscaping and/or buffering shall be provided as required by section7-11-3 of this chapter.\n(9) Parking/loading standards. If provided, loading facilities shall be placed along alleys or streets not identified on the Key Pedestrian Streets map (found at the end of\nthis section) when available. There shall be no requirements for off-street parking in the Central Business District except for hotels with all required parking to be provided\non-site. No parking is allowed between the building and any abutting street.\nParking garages placed on a key pedestrian street shall provide a full habitable story and use along the street-side facade(s) with a minimum depth of 15 feet and an average\nminimum depth of 20 feet, or shall comply with the design and operation standards for openings and design organization requirements for new construction.\n(10) Sidewalk standards. Sidewalks shall be provided as required by and pursuant to the requirements for sidewalks as set forth in section7-11-8 of this chapter.\n(11) Access standards. Vehicular entries shall be a maximum of 24 feet in width. In addition driveway curb cuts are limited to a single standard driveway per 200 feet\nalong a block face per development. Automobile access and services from a rear alley is encouraged.\n(12) Open space standards. Open space shall be provided as required by section7-11-4 of this chapter.\n(13) Design and operational standards.\na. The following requirements apply to all buildings in the CBD:Street wall and step-back requirements: In order to enhance the traditional scale of downtown\nand ensure adequate air and light at the sidewalk level and neighboring properties, a visual demarcation will be established across the fa\u00e7ade of the building at a\nheight that is defined as the street wall. Corresponding to this elevation on the fa\u00e7ade a step-back across the front or side(s) will be provided and in limited\ncircumstances described below, other alternatives may apply to ensure variety in new construction.\n(1.) Street wall height: The street wall height and specific alternatives are established in the following ways:\na. If the property is located within the Traditional Downtown Core area as illustrated on the map following this section, the street wall will be set at\nbetween two and four stories with a recommendation to reflect the height of neighboring buildings;\nb. If the property is located outside the Traditional Downtown Core the street wall will be established by a one-to-one relationship to the width of the\nright-of-way (ROW). For example, a ROW of 50 feet would result in a maximum street wall height of 50 feet. Depending on the site the following\nscenarios may apply:\n1. If a parcel fronts on more than one street, the street wall shall be established by:\na. The ROW width of the key pedestrian street if applicable; or\nb. Measuring the ROW from the side of the building with the primary pedestrian entrance.\n2.\nThe street wall may wrap around to the side(s) at the same height or be re-established based on the ROW of the side street. For the\npurposes of this section frontage on a service alley will be treated the same as an internal property line and therefore would not require a street\nwall step- back, or;\nC. Throughout the CBD, a building that provides a setback along the frontage line to create a plaza or courtyard area (minimum depth ten feet), will\nnot be required to establish a street wall. This setback area must exceed two-thirds of the building width along the frontage line; or\nd.\nFor areas outside the Traditional Downtown Core where the ROW area is greater than 75 feet, a building is not required to provide a street wall\nstep- back or side step-back. Buildings in these situations will be required to meet other design and operational standards as applicable; or\ne. Throughout the CBD, a variance may be sought as set forth in section7-5-9.1 from the step-back requirements by meeting design guidelines that\nspecify a clear visual demarcation provided between the base of the building and upper floors corresponding to the height of the street wall. The\nrequested variance shall not result in conflict with building code requirements; or\nf. Throughout the CBD, buildings determined to be signature buildings or proposed for landmark locations may seek a variance as set forth in section\n7-5-9.1 from street wall and step-back requirements when they meet design guidelines specific to landmarks. See the Public View Corridors map for\nrecommended landmark locations.\ng. When an existing one-story building that is a contributing structure in the downtown national register district will be incorporated into\na\ndevelopment proposal that may include a single or multi-story addition, it will be deemed to satisfy the requirement or that portion of the requirement\nfor the streetwall.\nStreet wall\nStreet wall\n(2.) Step-back requirement: In order to enhance the traditional scale of downtown and ensure adequate air and light at the sidewalk level and neighboring\nproperties a step-back at the street wall height is required according to the following standards. In no case shall the required step-back(s) decrease the\nbuildable area by more than ten percent:\na. At the street wall height a minimum ten-foot-wide step-back is observed along at least two-thirds of the length of the street-side fa\u00e7ade (the\nremaining one- third may be provided at up to two hundred percent 2 x) of the street wall height); or\nb. A side step-back may be provided as an alternative according to the following requirements as applicable.\n1. At the street wall height, a 40-foot-wide step-back is provided along the side of the proposed structure. This 40-foot-wide step-back may be\nsplit between two sides (such as 20 feet each side);\n2. Buildings taller than 75 feet shall provide a side step-back that equals one-half of the width of the fa\u00e7ade above 75 feet*.\n*\nThe step-back amount may be split between two sides.\nSee street wall height description to determine the height of the corresponding street wall.\n"}, {"page": "64", "text": "SIDE STEP-BACK\nDIAGRAM\nFRONT STEP-BACK\nDIAGRAM\nAt-Grade\nProperty Lines\nUp to 1/3 building\nfrontage may remain\nSide step.\nproperty line\nback option\nEXISTING\nNEW\n>10\nEXISTING\nBUILDINGS\nBUILDING\nBUILDINGS\n(3.) Design organization: Buildings shall demonstrate a building design organization on each fa\u00e7ade such as but not limited to a base-middle-cap\norganization, vertical articulation or other organizing principle.\nBuilding caps: Downtown Asheville has a wealth of buildings with distinctive caps that use special forms and materials. The unique diversity of building caps\nhas become a defining feature of the downtown skyline. In order to frame views and provide attractive landmarks that enhance the skyline of the downtown\narea, building caps are required. See the design guidelines regarding building caps for recommendations in addition to the following requirements:\na. Provide a cap to enhance a base-middle-cap oriented design; or\nb. Provide a cornice or other decorative band for flat roofs to serve as a cap.\n(4.) Pedestrian entrances: All buildings shall have their primary pedestrian entrance on a frontage line. If the site is located on a key pedestrian street then\nthe primary pedestrian entrance shall be located along that street. See the Asheville Downtown Design Guidelines for additional recommendations.\n(5.) Windows, doors and other openings. Building fenestration is required because it enhances the character of downtown Asheville by providing features of\nvisual interest at the sidewalk for the benefit of pedestrians, by defining the scale of buildings between the ground floor and upper floors and by improving\nthe skyline vista of Asheville. The following requirements apply:\na. For buildings along streets designated as key pedestrian streets (see map at the end of this section), at least 70 percent of the street-level fa\u00e7ade\nis composed of windows, doors and other openings.\nb. For buildings along streets that are not designated as key pedestrian streets, at least 50 percent of the street-level fa\u00e7ade is composed of\nwindows, doors and other openings.\nC. Residential buildings shall provide at least 30 percent (40 percent for live/work units) windows, doors or other openings along the street-level\nfa\u00e7ade unless located along a key pedestrian street where it will be required to meet the 70 percent standard noted above.\nd. All buildings are required to provide a minimum of 20 percent of the upper story areas as windows, doors or other openings with each face\ncalculated independently. This requirement applies to exposed building sides unless otherwise restricted by the NC State Building Code.\ne. At street-level, areas of opaque wall may extend no more than 20 feet horizontally before beginning a window, door or other opening.\nf. Glass may be tinted but shall not be reflective.\ng. When the fa\u00e7ade of a building follows the natural grade of a sloping site, windows and other openings which may start out at pedestrian-level\nquickly go overhead and no longer relate to the sidewalk; in these situations where the surface level of the floor reaches six feet or more above the\nsidewalk, that floor will be deemed to no longer be at the pedestrian level. Requirements for windows, doors or other openings will be reassessed for\nthe remaining ground level fa\u00e7ade length.\nb. The following requirements apply to buildings taller than 75 feet for additional floors extending above this point:\nTower size limited\nTower size limited\n75' height\n75' height\n(1.) Floor plate limited:\na. For parcels 20,000 square feet and larger, the gross floor plate area is limited to 40 percent of the lot area;\nb. For parcels smaller than 20,000 square feet, gross floor plate area may not exceed 8,000 square feet.\nC.\nFor parcels greater than 16,000 square feet, the agency or official responsible for project review may consider floor plates up to 50 percent if it is\nsurrounded by substantial permanent public or private open space that allows for views and access to direct sunlight.\n(2.) Maximum dimension defined: The maximum horizontal wall dimension in any direction is limited to 145 feet for additional floors above the 75 feet.\n(3.) External vista points: Photomontages modeling the proposed building are required from each of the established external vista points as a tool to\nevaluate development proposals:\nMerrimon Avenue at Gracelyn Street\nCollege Street at the west side of the tunnel\nStephens-Lee Recreation Center\nBiltmore Avenue at Short Coxe Avenue\nI-240 at the Smokey Park Bridge\nTown Mountain Road at the bridge over I-240\n(4.) Public view corridors: If a project lies within a public view corridor based on the map following this section a photomontage from the internal vista point is\nrequired and where possible, building mass should be oriented to preserve views and roof forms should help to frame views.\nC. Additional site related standards for all projects:Street furnishings: Street furnishings placed in the public right-of-way shall be approved by the department of\npublic works and will include but not be limited to benches, tree grates, lighting fixtures and waste receptacles.\nMechanical equipment and appurtenances necessary for the function of the building shall be enclosed and screened or otherwise designed to be integral with the\noverall building design, including but not limited to elevators, stairs, cooling towers and vent stacks.\nThe design of the base of a building, as well as the quality and durability of its materials, shall be emphasized at the first floor of structures. Exterior insulation and\nfinish systems (EIFS) are prohibited as a base material.\nPrivate dumpsters and freestanding service equipment shall be screened by solid partitions or other screening.\n"}, {"page": "65", "text": "Development on key pedestrian streets shall meet the following requirements:\nFor new construction along key pedestrian streets, buildings are required to be constructed along a minimum of 80 percent of the frontage line of the lot. This\nstandard is not intended to restrict site access especially for smaller lots. Access is covered under access standards above. On corner lots the 80 percent frontage\nrequirement applies to the primary street.\n(14) Downtown design review guidelines. All construction work requiring building, sign, demolition, and zoning permits and projects requesting a variance, within the\ndowntown boundaries designated by the Asheville City Council, shall be submitted for mandatory review, voluntary compliance with the adopted Downtown Asheville\nDesign Review Guidelines, with the exception of locally designated historic landmarks which shall be reviewed by the Historic Resources Commission of Asheville and\nBuncombe County in accordance with the applicable review procedures of the historic resources commission.\n(15) Emergency wireless communications.

River District is hereby created to celebrate, conserve, promote, and manage those areas on both sides of the French Broad and Swannanoa Rivers within the\ncorporate limits and those areas of extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City of Asheville, North Carolina. These zoning standards will ensure that new development is compatible\nwith and enhances the unique river resources as called for in Asheville's Comprehensive Plan and addenda. It is the intent of these standards to promote economic revitalization\nthroughout the river valleys while providing for an opportunity for enjoyment of the river by a maximum number of citizens, neighbors, and guests. The Riverfront Plan, the\nRiverfront Open Space Guidelines, and the River District Design Review Guidelines are companion documents to these regulations.\nThe goals of the River District are to:\n(1) Promote the protection and improvement of the French Broad and Swannanoa Rivers as water resources;\n(2) Allow a mixture of river oriented land uses (residential, recreational, office/institutional, commercial, manufacturing, industrial, open space, and agricultural) to develop\nand prosper together through the establishment of specific development standards;\n(3) Promote responsible development that will result minimal stormwater runoff, soil erosion, river bank destabilization, grading, and flood damage;\n(4) Promote the preservation of a vegetative river resource corridor between the top of the river bank and new development to protect property from flooding and to\nenhance water quality;\n(5) Encourage the planting of specific riparian landscaping that will aid in controlling erosion, improving water quality, reducing stormwater runoff, enhancing fish and\nwildlife habitats, and protecting visual quality;\n(6) Promote the protection of existing natural areas, wetlands, and habitats, especially bluffs along the rivers;\n(7) Encourage the establishment of vegetative buffer yards between incompatible land uses to lessen negative impacts;\n(8) Encourage the conservation, protection, and promotion of the district's natural, cultural, and historic resources to enhance its value as a significant amenity to\nAsheville's citizens, neighbors, and tourists;\n(9) Encourage the creation of identifiable neighborhoods within the district through preferred land uses and the enhancement of their historical significance through\ncoordinated physical amenities;\n(10) Promote improvements to existing infrastructure and the coordination of all new utility improvements;\n(11) Promote the rivers as a gateway to the city by encouraging the improvement of physical connections to Downtown, West Asheville, Biltmore Village, U.N.C.-A., A. B.\nTechnical Community College, Warren Wilson College, Blue Ridge Parkway, and the N.C. Arboretum and encourage the provision of controlled public access directly to\nthe water; and\n(12) Encourage the development of different uses on different floors of multiple story buildings.\nThe development of a pedestrian trail/greenway along the rivers is encouraged within the River District. Land owners are encouraged to dedicate/grant a dry land right-of-way or\neasement within the river resource yard. The public pedestrian trail/greenway along the rivers would be a part of the proposed greenway system for the City of Asheville as\ndesignated in the Greenway Master Plan.\nLand owners are additionally encouraged to dedicate or grant a dry-land right-of-way or easement for use and maintenance by the Asheville Fire Department as a river\nemergency/rescue point.\n(b) Allowable land uses.

The Urban Village District is established to create mixed use development that is economically vital, pedestrian-oriented and contributes to the place-making\ncharacter of the built environment. The Urban Village District offers the unique opportunity to provide quality and long lasting retail, office and residential uses in an organized\nlayout that encourages the full range of access by patrons and users, and offers innovative high quality design of structures, public amenities and pedestrian facilities. The\ndevelopment and design standards set forth in this district intend to accomplish the following purposes:\n(1) Provide safe and convenient access to shopping and other essential services to:\nPedestrians,\nBicyclists,\nTransit riders, and\nPersons with disabilities.\n(2) Effective traffic flow through:\nAccess management, and\nImproved internal and external connectivity.\n(3) Create a built environment that serves to:\nEnhance gateway corridors,\nPreserve historic heritage,\nPromote economic development and an improved tax base for the city, and\nCelebrate Asheville's distinction from other cities.\n(4) Promote sustainable use of limited land and investment resources by:\nEncouraging higher building densities,\nAllowing efficient shared parking areas, making cost effective use of existing infra-structure,\nShowcasing innovative high quality development,\nProviding adaptive re-use of under-performing retail properties,\nEnsuring multi-modal transportation access,\nInsuring internal and external connectedness,\n"}, {"page": "71", "text": "Developing a durable framework of infrastructure and built structures that can accommodate future renovations,\nUpgrades and rehabilitation, and\nReestablishing the public realm, civic pride, and sense of community ownership in new developments.\n(b) Allowable land uses. All permitted uses, special uses, conditional uses and uses expressly prohibited are identified in subsection7-8-1(d), Table of Permitted Uses.\nStandards for special uses and conditional uses can be found in article XVI of this chapter.\n(c) Reserved.\n(d) Reserved.\n(e) Reserved.\n(f) Development standards.\n(1) Master plan required.\na. Unless initiated by the city pursuant to its zoning authority, Urban Village District projects are required to submit a master plan with the zoning application for the\nentire parcel that indicates the general street network, the land use configuration within that network, the ultimate proposed development intensity (including the\nnumber of residential units and gross square footage of all nonresidential uses), and the proposed structure heights for the Urban Village. For initiation of this\nzoning classification, properties may fall under more than one ownership so long as there exist covenants or other legally binding agreements that address cross-\naccess, s-parking and other similar issues affecting joint operation of the projects.\nb. After the establishment of the Urban Village District zoning, regardless of scale, Urban Village District development projects shall be approved under the Level II\nsite plan review process. - phase projects must submit drawings and elevations along with the approved master plan at the time of Level II review. A traffic\nimpact analysis will be required for all Urban Village projects and shall be submitted with the Level II application. Projects for the Urban Village District shall be\nreviewed for compliance with the standards set forth in the ordinance.\nC. Revisions to approved Urban Village District master plans may be approved by the city council or by the planning and development director depending on the\ntype of revisions being requested. City council shall review any revisions to a master plan that increases the overall development intensity, changes the proposed\nmix of uses by increasing or reducing any use category by 25 percent or more, or increases the maximum building height from that shown on the approved master\nplan. Additionally, city council shall review any revision to a master plan that results in a decrease in the amount of perimeter open space or perimeter parking lot\nbuffering, or in a 25 percent or greater reduction in the number of proposed blocks from that shown on the approved master plan. For the purpose of determining\noverall development intensity, one residential unit shall be regarded as the equivalent of 500 square feet of office floor area; one residential unit shall be regarded as\nthe equivalent of 200 square feet of commercial floor area; and 1,000 square feet of office space shall be regarded as the equivalent of 350 square feet\nof\ncommercial floor area. For other uses, the planning and development director shall determine the equivalency factor using quantifiable information such as\nautomobile trip generation data. In reviewing master plan revisions, the city council shall follow the same public hearing process used to approve the initial master\nplan; at its discretion, the city council may refer the proposed revisions to the planning and zoning commission for their recommendation. The planning and\ndevelopment director is authorized to review and approve all other revisions to master plans. In approving revisions to a master plan, the planning and development\ndirector shall analyze the revisions in terms of compliance with the specific requirements of the Urban Village Zoning District, the general development pattern\napproved by city council, and the overall development concept, including the mix of uses, of the initial approved masRen plan. In the event the planning and\ndevelopment director denies the proposed revisions, the property owner may request that the city council review the revisions following the same public hearing\nprocess as provided above.\n(2) Density standards. Maximum residential density shall not be limited, except by other standards such as building height, parking, landscaping and buffering, open\nspace, and traffic impact analysis.\n(3) Structure size standards. The structure size shall not be limited except by other standards such as building height, parking, landscaping and buffering, open space,\nand traffic impact analysis.\n(4) Area standards. The minimum area required to establish an Urban Village District shall be five acres.\n(5) Lot size standards. There is no minimum lot size in an Urban Village District.\n(6) Street design standards. Internal streets in the Urban Village District shall be designed using the Asheville Standards And Specifications Manual (or as approved by\nthe city engineer) but shall contain: pedestrian zone area, travel lane area, center medians if any, on-street parking. The sight visibility triangle requirement noted in article\nXI may be modified at the review of the city engineer.\n(7) Lot width standards. None\n(8) Setbacks.\nMinimum setback: Zero feet from the right-of-way.\nMaximum setback: 15 feet from the street as measured from back of curb, except as follows:\na. Arcades and lawnings may encroach into the setback area.\nb. Mixed use office/retail structures may be setback from the back of curb up to 25 feet if at least ten feet in front of the structure includes an arcade, forecourt,\ndooryard, or courtyard offering public amenities.\nC. Institutional and public uses may be setback a maximum of 75 feet as measured from back of curb for projects that incorporate a courtyard or green. Courtyard\nand green areas may include landscape portions but shall also include hardscape paving elements for public meeting or gathering. The main fa\u00e7ade of institutional\nand public use structures must face this setback area.\nd. Single-family residential structures may be setback up to 25 feet from back of curb and may include a dooryard, courtyard, porch and fence.\ne. Multifamily residential structure setback areas may include a courtyard up to 25 feet deep. The courtyard may not be wider than one-third of the building length\nunless approved by the director of planning and development.\nf. Variations in setback requirements may be granted by the city council to address issues of context, including but not limited to alignment of buildings in the\nsame blockface, street classification on the thoroughfare plan, and proposed or existing public greens, pedestrian zones and courtyards.\ng.\nBuildings may be set back up to 40 feet from back of curb for topographic reasons subject to the following requirements:\nA\npedestrian zone and sidewalk is provided at the back of the curb meeting UV standards and may include street trees and other streetscape enhancements;\nThe top of the retaining wall (excluding handrails, etc.) does not exceed five feet above (or below depending on the specific topographic grade) the sidewalk level;\nThe area above (or below depending on the specific topographic grade) the retaining wall and adjacent to the building includes uses to encourage a lively\npedestrian space and shall be considered an active pedestrian level;\nBuilding frontages facing this active pedestrian level shall meet fenestration requirements as described in the ordinance.\nNo more than 50 percent of the length of the fa\u00e7ade of the building is separated from the main sidewalk level with the use of a retaining wall. The remaining 50\npercent of the street frontage must:\n1. Have upper and lower sidewalks join at the same grade as a single sidewalk, or\n2. Connect the upper and lower sidewalks through no more than five steps or a ramp at no more than a one to 12 slope. The steps described in this\nscenario are the steps running parallel to the face of the building connecting to the sidewalk area.\n(9) Impervious surface standards. None.\n(10) Height standards.\na. Minimum height: 15 feet. Maximum height: 100 feet. It is the intent of this section that the predominant height of structures in Urban Village Districts be between\ntwo and six stories in height. In applying this provision, single story structures shall not exceed 50 percent of the total gross building footprint of structures included\nin the master plan. Any structure taller than four stories shall be designed with a cornice at the fourth story level, with those portions of the structure taller than four\nstories being set back at a minimum of ten feet from the cornice level. Any structure taller than six stories shall be located internally to the site unless the\nsurrounding context supports such height.\nb. As part of its approval of the master plan, increases in maximum height of a structure may be allowed by the city council not to exceed 150 feet, based on such\n"}, {"page": "72", "text": "factors as topography, relationship to other structures in the area, and compliance with applicable design guidelines. For structures exceeding 100 feet in height,\nthe minimum cornice level setback shall be 20 feet or a second cornice level with a minimum setback of 10 feet shall be established at a point between floors five\nthrough eight.\n(11) Design and operational standards.\na. Orientation. Buildings shall be oriented towards their primary access street. On corner lots, the building must be located at the corner. Single-family residential\nunits located on a corner are exempt from this requirement. Building sides should appear similar to their fronts.\nb. Entrances. All buildings should include well-defined entrances facing the street at regular intervals. An operable entrance on each primary fa\u00e7ade should be\nprovided to encourage access by pedestrians. Buildings on corner lots may place the entrance at the corner eliminating the need for side entrances.\nC. Windows, doors and other openings. The first floor of all new structures in the Urban Village District shall be designed in a way that a minimum of 45 percent of\nthe length of the first floor street frontage incorporates either windows, doors and other openings to complement pedestrian scale activity. Structures shall have\nwindows evenly distributed across the fa\u00e7ade. Upper story windows, doors and other openings shall make up at least 30 percent of the wall surface. Residential-\nonly buildings that are identified on the approved masterplan may reduce the openings along the ground floor street facing fa\u00e7ade to 30 percent. All storefront\nwindows shall be transparent or lightly tinted and shall not appear false or applied. Windows are also required along the sides of structures that are visible from\nroadways or have parking adjacent to them. Exceptions to these standards may be made by the city council in order to achieve compliance with LEED or NC\nbuilding energy code standards, to accommodate public art or to allow alternative fenestration approaches provided the intent of this section is met by the building\nexhibiting a primary focus on pedestrian interest.\nd. Variances. Requests for variances of the design and operational standards set forth in this subsection may be granted by the planning and zoning commission,\nwhich is hereby designated to perform the duties of a board adjustment for this purpose.\n(12) Internal access and connectivity. The site shall be traversed by a network of internal streets built according to the Asheville Standards and Specifications Manual (or\nas approved by the city engineer). Internal streets should seek to avoid cul-de-sacs and dead end roads and other features that hamper connectivity. However, roads may\nterminate at a monumental structure or a green. In such cases, a sidewalk or other connection must be provided to ensure the goals of connectivity. In addition, internal\nstreets are also required to have sidewalks and street trees. A bus shelter is required for Urban Village Districts. Larger projects may require more shelters as determined\nby the Traffic Impact Analysis and or by the transit director. Connectivity is a goal of the internal street system and external connections to areas outside and adjacent to\nthe Urban Village should be created where possible and appropriate. Blocks are required throughout the site to provide access to different village areas and to encourage\nmulti-modal transportation options. Only one driveway per block face shall be allowed for blocks shorter than 350 feet; up to two driveways may be allowed in blocks 350\nfeet or longer provided measures are taken to maintain pedestrian interest and safety. Single-family (including townhome) and duplex uses are exempt from this driveway\nrestriction. Parking and loading access from service alleys for all uses, however, is encouraged, and such alleys, when approved as part of the street network of the\nmaster plan, shall be exempt from the requirements of this section.\n(13) Block length. Block length may vary but shall not exceed 500 feet in length. For blocks on local streets that are 350 feet or longer, a mid-block pedestrian street\ncrossing is required which may also include a parking lot driveway and/or pedestrian passageway between two or more buildings, and shall have curb extensions\n(bulbouts) for ease and safety of pedestrian street crossing (per the Asheville Standards and Specifications Manual). Collector streets may also require mid-block\npedestrian crossings as noted above. Variations in block length and pedestrian crossing requirements may be approved by the city engineer provided the intent of this\nsection is met.\n(14) Pedestrian zone and sidewalks. The pedestrian zone is the area between the street curb and the building edge or for access roads, the street curb and the ROW\narea. The pedestrian zone includes sidewalks, street trees and other pedestrian amenities. The pedestrian zone will generally be 15 feet wide along primary streets in the\nUrban Village District but may be wider depending on the setback pattern. On secondary streets, the city engineer may accept a 12-foot wide pedestrian zone after\nevaluation of traffic and circulation patterns. Sidewalks in Urban Village Districts shall be required along one side of access streets and both sides of internal streets\nthroughout the development. If appropriate to the design of the Urban Village, greenway paths may be substituted for sidewalks in residential areas to provide\nconnections. The sidewalk shall be a minimum of seven feet wide in the Urban Village District. In solely residential areas containing less than eight units per acre,\nsidewalks are only required to be five feet wide. With institutional and public uses that have an increased setback, a sidewalk shall connect the building fa\u00e7ade entrance\nwith the street. The sidewalk may be as wide as the entire pedestrian area. Arcades, lawnings, outdoor dining, shelters, seating areas, fountains, street trees, additional\nlandscaped areas and other pedestrian amenities may be a part of this pedestrian area so long as seven feet of clear walking space is maintained. The pedestrian area\nmay also be used to create an area for waiting, pick up and drop off. At locations such as intersections and other crosswalks, curb extensions (bulb-outs) are required to\ncreate safer pedestrian crossings. No fee in lieu of construction of sidewalks will be accepted in urban village districts.\n(15) Parking/loading standards. Parking facilities shall be provided as per the parking, loading and access standards, article 11 of this code with the exceptions noted\nbelow:\na. Amount of parking. Parking spaces in the Urban Village District shall be reviewed at the master plan level. The maximum number of spaces allowed in Urban\nVillages shall be the minimum required in the parking section in article 11 since this district can take advantage of shared parking opportunities. Parking spaces\nin\nparking structures shall be exempt from parking space calculations.\nb. On-street parking. On-street parking is required for all local streets and for collector streets as approved by the city engineer. On-street parking may take the\nform of parallel or angle parking and shall be built according to the Asheville Standards and Specifications Manual. On-street parking shall be counted when\ncalculating the maximum number of spaces allowed.\nC. Off-street parking. Uses in the Urban Village District are not required to provide off-street parking. Off street parking lots are encouraged to be provided at the\nside or rear of buildings or the interior of a block of buildings and not closer to the street than the edge profile of the structures. No more than 20 percent of parking\nthat is provided in the Urban Village District shall be in the form of off-street surface lots not located to the side or rear of buildings. Off-street parking shall not be\nadjacent to street intersections. No parking is permitted in any setback area. No more than 50 percent of the parking spaces provided may be in the form of off-\nstreet surface parking, with other parking to be accommodated in on-street or structured parking. Phased development may exceed the allowable amount of\nsurface parking for time frames determined in master plan approval provided that full development of all phases meets the above requirements.\nd. Bicycle parking. Bicycle parking shall be provided as per article 11 except that the five percent calculation of total parking spaces will include on-street and off-\nstreet spaces provided in the master plan. Bicycle parking shall be distributed throughout the project use area.\ne. Loading standards. Urban Village Districts may share on-street and off-street loading facilities and are therefore allowed to provide these facilities at half the\nrate listed for the applicable uses. On- street loading spaces may be counted toward the project loading requirements.\n(16)\nStreet trees. Street trees are required in the pedestrian zone and along access roads at an average rate of one tree every 40 feet and shall be selected from the City\nof Asheville recommended tree species list for durable large maturing trees. Trees may be planted in minimum of five foot by five-foot square pits close to the curb edge of\nthe sidewalk. Tree frames and grates are not required but are recommended especially near store entrances, other sidewalk constraints, points of ingress or egress, or\npublic gathering areas. If tree grates are not used, an organic surfacing material shall be used to level the surface of the tree pit with the sidewalk. This material shall\nreceive regular maintenance. To offer flexibility in the tree planting requirements, trees may be planted in planting strips adjacent to the curb edge of the sidewalk. Planting\nstrips shall be no narrower than five feet wide. Planting strips may include grass, flowers and other plant materials where appropriate. Planting strips may not be\nappropriate in pedestrian gathering areas.\n(17) Landscape/buffering standards. Landscaping and buffering shall be in accordance with article 11 [of the UDO] of the code with exceptions as noted below. Surface\nparking lots shall include interior and perimeter tree plantings made up of deciduous trees at a rate of one tree for every 1,500 square feet of parking and shall be selected\nfrom the City of Asheville Recommended Species Tree List for durable large sized trees. No parking space may be farther than 45 feet from a tree. Parking areas adjacent\nto roadways will require buffering from the street as noted in article 11 [of the UDO] with the exception that the buffer planting area shall be a minimum of eight feet wide.\nResidential structures within the Urban Village may have up to a 100 percent reduction in buffering requirements from the rest of the Urban Village. Buffering for Urban\nVillage District projects is measured and reviewed from the parcel lot lines used to establish the district and not on an internal lot-by-lot basis. The Urban Village\ndevelopment projects shall be considered a high impact use based on the existing adjacent land use table in article 11 [of the UDO]; however, required buffering of\nneighboring uses may be reduced by the director of planning and development depending on the compatibility of the design of the project or particular component thereof\nwith adjoining uses.\n(18) Open space standards. Open space for urban village district shall be a minimum of five percent of the area covered by the master plan. Pedestrian zones and public\nplaza spaces may be counted toward the open space requirements. Any bufferyards provided according to this section that are constructed with a greenway or other\ndurable walking trail may also be counted toward the open space requirements. Dedicated public park space shall be reviewed with the City of Asheville Parks and\nRecreation Department for concurrence, agreement and maintenance (if required).\n(19) Emergency wireless communications. Communication requirements shall be provided as required by section? of this chapter.\n(Ord. No. 2851, \u00a7 1(a), 9-25-01; Ord. No. 3115, \u00a7 1, 4-27-04; Ord. No. 3156, \u00a7 1, 8-24-04; Ord.

In the\nNeighborhood Corridor District, street trees may be provided in the front building setback or the street right-of-way (with an approved encroachment agreement) as a part\nof a streetscape plan that may be proposed or in place for the corridor. Landscape bufferyards shall be a minimum of a 'B' buffer. Automobile related businesses shall\nprovide a minimum of a 'C' buffer. In determining bufferyard requirements for uses in the NCD, the measure of application shall be that the adjacent property is not zoned\nNCD and the neighboring use is exclusively residential. The intent of the bufferyard requirement as applied to the Neighborhood Corridor District is to provide an effective\nscreen to buffer residential uses. With this in mind and respecting site topography, plantings should be included at the highest points of original slopes or fill slopes along\nproperty lines where the buffer is required. As an alternative to these landscaped buffer requirements, a landscaped buffer ten feet wide is allowed with plantings provided\nconsistent with a Type \"A\" buffer and the provision of a fence eight feet in height that complies with the standards outlined in subsection 7-11-3(d)(17). Landscaped\nbufferyards shall be a type 'B' buffer except as indicated below.\n(9) Parking/loading standards.

Parking may be provided in the street right-of-way adjoining the property as on-street parking with the approval of the city traffic engineer or the North Carolina\nDepartment of Transportation.\nC. Uses in the Neighborhood Corridor District are permitted a 50 percent reduction in the minimum number of parking spaces required by section7-11-2 of this\nchapter provided that a walking amenity and bike racks are provided (walking amenities may include but are not limited to public courtyards, drinking water\nfountains, benches, shade structures, pocket green spaces and public access restrooms).\nd. Shared and remote parking is encouraged and may count for up to 100 percent of the required parking so long as the parking is within 500 feet of the property.\nParcels that are sharing parking areas or providing remote parking shall bring the parking lots into compliance with parking and landscaping requirements found in\narticle 11 [of the UDO], at a minimum, the area that is provided as a part of the shared use. Rules requiring that shared and remote parking areas must be found in\nthe same zoning classification are waived in the Neighborhood Corridor District. Residentially zoned areas may not be used to provide shared or remote parking\nspace for this district except that non-residential uses in residential districts may be used. Parcels will require a recorded agreement for the shared or remote\nparking arrangement.\ne. Parking structures may be provided as a secondary use in meeting a project's parking requirements.\n(10) Sidewalk standards. Sidewalks shall be provided as required by and pursuant to the requirements for sidewalks as set forth in section7-11-8 of this chapter. In\naddition, sidewalk connections may be required to ensure and provide a safe passageway for pedestrians and patrons to maneuver through the parking area to the\nentrance of the businesses. If internal cross-access is provided between businesses and parcels, then sidewalks shall be also provided along accessways as needed\nto\ninsure pedestrian connectivity.\n(11) Open space standards. Open space shall be provided as required by the requirements found in section7-11-4 of this chapter with the addition that all uses (projects)\nexceeding 10,000 square feet of gross floor for commercial projects or eight residential units are required to comply. Sidewalk spaces featuring public-pedestrian\namenities, outside dining facilities and vest pocket parks are supported and shall count towards open space requirements.\n(12) Design and operational standards.\na.

On corner lots\nthe building or portions of the building must be located at the street corner respecting setback standards unless prohibitive terrain issues are present.\nb. Entrances. All buildings shall include a well-defined operable entrance at regular intervals not exceeding 45 feet on each primary fa\u00e7ade to encourage access by\npedestrians. Secondary entrances may face second tier streets, driveways or parking areas. Buildings on corner lots may place the entrance at the corner,\neliminating the need for dual entrances.\nC. Windows. Windows shall be evenly distributed at pedestrian level across the length of the fa\u00e7ade on the first floor of the building. Windows will create a more\neffective pedestrian environment if they are un-tinted and non-reflective. Windows shall make up at least 45 percent of the first floor fa\u00e7ade facing the primary\nstreetfront. If located on a corner property, windows shall make up at least 40 percent of the first floor fa\u00e7ade facing a side street.\nd. Fa\u00e7ades. When new building fa\u00e7ades will be wider than 45 feet, the fa\u00e7ade surface shall be subdivided into portions not exceeding this distance by varying\nsetbacks, roof forms, or adding design details such as pilasters or other architectural treatments.\ne.

Urban Residential District.\n(a) Purpose: The Urban Residential District (URD) is established to complement existing residential neighborhoods by providing an improved diversity of housing types, scale,\naffordability, and character in areas where they can best be served by city services and infrastructure and is intended to be located on significant transit corridors and/or in high\ngrowth areas. The Urban Residential District is designed to provide new development and redevelopment opportunities that encourage urban scaled residential structures that\nrelate to the street and character of Asheville's urban areas. While housing types that are economically viable and pedestrian oriented will be emphasized, a mix of other\ncompatible activities, especially those that support residential uses within walking distance, will be permitted. It is also intended that this district enhance and maintain the\ntransportation connectivity through the promotion of multi-use greenway paths, sidewalks, and public transit.\n(b) Allowable land uses. All permitted uses, special uses, conditional uses and uses expressly prohibited are identified in subsection7-8-1(d), Table of Permitted Uses.\nStandards for special uses and conditional uses can be found in article XVI of this chapter.\n(c) Reserved.\n(d) Reserved.\n(e) Reserved.\n(f) Development standards.\n(1) Density standards.

In cases where required streetscape elements are\ninstalled on private property the building setbacks shall be measured from the back of the streetscape elements.\nThe required percentage specifies the amount of the front building facade that must be located in the BTZ, measured based on the width of the building divided by\nthe width of the lot. Driveways and open spaces. Permitted driveways and open spaces may be removed from the BTZ calculations. Open spaces within the BTZ\nshall measure at least 60 feet deep and 25 feet wide.\nb. The BTZ applies up to the minimum required building height.\n2. Corner lots. On a corner lot, a building facade must be placed within the BTZ for the first 30 feet along the street extending from the block corner, measured\nfrom the intersection of the two right-of-way lines.\n3. Through lots. Projects on through lots may select the street to which the BTZ shall be applied.\n4. Uses allowed. With the exception of parking spaces and outdoor storage, all structures and uses (including outdoor dining) allowed on the lot are allowed in the\nBTZ.\n5. Driveways. In no case will driveway access to a lot be denied because of the build-to requirement.\nG. Nonconforming build-to zone.\n1. Additions. Expansion of an existing building which is unable to meet the build-to requirement, must comply with the following nonconforming provisions:\na. Front: Addition. Any addition to the front that exceed 50 percent of the existing footprint must be placed in the BTZ; however, the addition does not have\nto meet the build-to percentage for the lot. A front addition is not allowed on a contributing structure in a National Register Historic District or a structure that\nis eligible for historic designation (although a variance may be granted where a hardship exists, including but not limited to a conflict with the NC Building\nCode or specific purposes for the addition that make a front location the most technically, not financially feasible option).\n"}, {"page": "80", "text": "Build-to-Zone\nb. Rear: Addition. Rear additions are allowed because the extension does not increase the degree of the nonconformity.\nStreet\nBuild-to-Zone\nC. Side: Addition. Side additions meeting the following conditions are allowed:\ni. The side addition is no greater than 500 square feet in area or 20 percent of the existing building footprint, (whichever is greater) and is less than\n50 percent of the existing building width measured along the primary street.\nii. In the case of a contributing structure in a National Register Historic District (or a structure eligible for designation), the side addition must be\nplaced no closer than five feet from the street-facing facade of the building.\n2. New buildings. Where a new building is being constructed on a lot or site with an existing building on it that doesn't meet the build-to requirement, the following\nnonconforming provisions apply.\nStreet\nBuild-to-Zone\na. Front: New Building. All new buildings must be placed in the build-to zone until the build-to percentage for the lot has been met.\nb. Rear: New Building. New buildings located outside of the build-to zone are not allowed until the build-to percentage for the lot has been met.\nStreet\nBuild-to-Zone\nC. Side: New Building. New buildings located outside of the build-to zone are not allowed until the build-to percentage for the lot has been met.\nd. Accessory Structures: New Structure. New accessory structures must be placed behind or to the side of the principal building. Outdoor dining may be\nplaced at the front of the lot to enhance activity at the sidewalk.\n"}, {"page": "81", "text": "Street\nBuild-to-Zone\nH. Setback encroachments.

A front addition is not allowed on a contributing structure in a National Register District or a structure that\nis eligible for historic designation (although a variance may be granted where a hardship exists, including but not limited to a conflict with the Building Code\nor specific purposes for the addition that make a front location the most technically (not financially) feasible option.\nb. Rear: Addition. One-story or multi-story rear additions are allowed because the extension does not increase the degree of the nonconformity.\nC. Side: Addition. One-story or multi-story side additions meeting the following conditions are allowed:\ni. The side addition is no greater than 500 square feet in area or 20 percent of the existing building footprint, (whichever is greater), and is less than\n50 percent of the existing building width measured along the primary street.\n"}, {"page": "107", "text": "ii.

Any one or more allowed\nuses may be established on a lot, subject to the requirements of this section, and in compliance with all applicable requirements of this Haywood Road Form District.\nA. Principal uses.\n1. Allowed principal uses by sub-district are shown in the Table of Permitted Uses in section 7-8-1(d).\n2. Any use not listed is not allowed unless the planning and development director determines that the use is similar to a listed use. Prohibited uses found in the\nTable of Uses in 7-8-1d of this chapter also apply to the Haywood Road Form District.\n3. When determining whether a proposed use is similar to a listed use, the planning and development director will consider the following:\na. The actual or projected characteristics of the proposed use.\nb. The relative amount of site area or floor area and equipment devoted to the proposed use.\nC. Relative amounts of sales.\nd. The customer type.\ne. The relative number of employees.\nf. Hours of operation.\ng. Building and site arrangement.\nh. Types of vehicles used and their parking requirements.\ni. The number of vehicle trips generated.\nj. How the proposed use is advertised.\nk. The likely impact on surrounding properties.\nI. Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other activities on the site.\n4.\nWhere a use is determined not to be similar to any listed use, a text amendment is required prior to establishment of that use.\nB. Accessory uses.\n1. Accessory uses and structures are permitted in conjunction with an allowed principal use. Accessory uses and structures must be accessory and clearly and\ncustomarily incidental and subordinate to a permitted principal use or structure.\n2. No accessory use or structure may be established prior to the establishment of a permitted principal use or structure.\n3. All accessory structures must meet the requirements of subsection 2.0.\n4. The planning and development director is authorized to determine when a use or structure is accessory. In order to classify a use or structure as accessory, the\nplanning and development director must determine that the use or structure:\na. Is subordinate to the principal use in terms of area, extent and purpose;\nb. Contributes to the comfort, convenience or necessity of occupants of the principal use or structure served;\nC. Is located on the same lot as the principal use or structure, or on a contiguous lot in the same ownership;\nd. Does not involve operations not in keeping with the character of the principal use or structure served; and\ne.

Building setbacks apply to both principal and accessory buildings\nand structures except where explicitly stated otherwise.\n2. Measurement of building setbacks.\na. The primary street setback is measured at a right angle from the primary street right-of-way line. In cases where required streetscape elements are\ninstalled on private property the building setbacks shall be measured from the back of the streetscape elements.\nb. On corner lots, the side street setback is measured at a right angle from the side street right-of-way line.\nC. The rear setback is measured at a right angle from the rear property line or the rear right-of-way or easement line where there is an alley. The rear\nproperty line is the property line opposite to the primary street property line.\nd. All lot lines which are not primary street, side street or rear lot lines are considered side interior lot lines for the purpose of measuring setbacks. Side\ninterior setbacks are measured at a right angle from the side property line.\ne. In cases where a PUE is on private property the building setbacks may be measured from the easement line or the setback may reduced to zero feet\nfrom the easement line.\n3. Primary street designation.\na. Where only one street abuts a lot, that street is considered a primary street.\nb. The following streets are considered primary streets:\ni. Clingman Avenue and Clingman Extension:\nii. Craven Street;\niii. Depot Street;\niv. Haywood Road;\nV. Lyman Street;\nvi. Ralph Street;\nvii. Riverside Drive; and\nviii. Roberts Street.\nC. A lot can have more than one primary street.\nD. Parking setbacks.\n1. All parking spaces must be located behind the parking setback line. Underground parking may encroach into a required parking setback but cannot extend into\na required easement or the right-of-way.\n2. The parking setback applies to surface parking and to the ground story only of a build- ing.\n3. Parking setbacks are measured from the right-of-way.\nE. Parking location for townhouses/multifamily.\n1. General. Garage doors used for the parking of vehicles must be placed entirely to the rear of the unit and be rear-ac- cessed and must face the rear alley or\neasement.\n2. RAD-RES.

Combined parking and driveway area cannot be more than 50 percent of the arna between the front building facade and the front property line.\nC. Any parking in the front setback must have suf-ficient depth so that parked cars do not encroach on the adjacent sidewalk. To provide sufficient depth,\nthe garage doors must be set back at least 20 feet from the sidewalk.\nd. Garage doors must be recessed at least one foot behind the front wall plane or a second-story element over the garage doors must be provided that\nextends at least one foot beyond the front wall plane.\n"}, {"page": "141", "text": "F.

A maximum of 20 percent of\nthe building facade width may encroach into the ten foot stepback as shown below.\n1. The minimum percentage of windows and doors that must cover a ground or upper story facade is measured from top of the finished floor to the top of\nthe wall plate. The percentage is derived for each story based on the transparent area of all ground or upper story windows and doors divided by the total\narea of the ground or upper story facade.\n2. Transparency applies to primary and side street-facing facades only.\n3. Glass is considered transparent where it has a transparency higher than 80 percent and external reflectance of less than 15 percent.\n4. An opening to a parking garage is not considered transparency.\n5. Any glass in a garage door for a restaurant or entertainment use (and not for loading purposes) is considered transparent.\n6. Garage doors that have no or limited transparency that can be rolled up during regular business hours (and are not used for the storing or parking of\ncars) can count for up to 50 percent of a transparency requirement.\nO. Blank wall area.\n1. Blank wall area means a portion of the exterior facade of the building that does not include: windows or doors; columns, pilasters or other articulation greater\nthan 12 inches in depth; or a substantial material change (paint color is not considered a substantial change).

Resource Management Overlay District.\n(a) Purpose. The resource management overlay district is established to regulate the planting and preservation of trees during development activities.\n(Ord. No. 4824, \u00a7 1b, 9-8-20)\nSec. 7-9-2. Historic Preservation Overlay District.\n(a) Purpose. Local historic districts are hereby deemed important assets of the City of Asheville. The historic districts are established for the purpose of protecting and\nconserving the heritage of the City of Asheville, Buncombe County and the State of North Carolina; for the purpose of safeguarding the character and heritage of the historic\ndistricts by preserving the historic districts as a whole and individual property therein that embodies important elements of its culture, history, architectural history, or prehistory;\nfor the purpose of promoting the conservation of such historic districts for the education, pleasure and enrichment of the residents of the historic districts, the City of Asheville,\nBuncombe County, and the State of North Carolina as a whole; for the purpose of fostering civic beauty; and for the purpose of stabilizing and enhancing property values\nthroughout the historic districts as a whole; thereby contributing to the improvement of the general health and welfare of the City of Asheville and the residents of the historic\ndistricts.\n(b) Establishment of the historic districts. Pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 160D-944, local historic districts are hereby established as districts which overlay the general use zoning\ndistricts, the extent and boundaries of which historic districts are indicated on the official zoning maps for the City of Asheville. The city hereby re-adopts and designates as\nhistoric districts those historic districts described in appendix 7E of this chapter. Additional local historic districts may be established following the required statutory procedure.\n(c) Historic district commission. The Asheville-Buncombe Historic Resources Commission (\"HRC\") established by the City of Asheville in Ordinance No. 1109, and by the\nCounty of Buncombe in Ordinance No. 1644, shall constitute a joint preservation commission and shall have the powers of a joint preservation commission as set forth in\nN.C.G.S. part 4 of article 9 chapter 160D, or its successor.\n(d) Permitted uses. The historic districts contain several zoning classifications. All uses permitted in each of the zoning districts shall be permitted in the historic district pursuant\nto the requirements set forth in that zoning classification. Provided, however, when the provisions of this section 7-9-2, and the guidelines and regulations promulgated\nhereunder, impose higher standards than are required for that zoning classification, the provisions of this section, and the regulations and guidelines promulgated hereunder,\nshall govern.\n(e) Compliance with requirements. Structures within the historic districts shall meet all requirements and standards of article VIII of this chapter in addition to those set forth in\nthis section. Provided, however, no structure or part thereof within the historic districts shall extend nearer to or be required to be set back further from the front property line than\nthe arithmetic mean distance of the setbacks of the nearest principal building within 150 feet on each side of such building and fronting on the same side of the street.\nAdditionally, proposed subdivisions within historic districts must be reviewed by the HRC as part of the overall subdivision review process in accordance with article XV of this\nchapter.\n(f) Authentic restoration and reconstruction.\n(1) Authentic restoration or reconstruction is permitted, subject to approval of the HRC, even though the authentic restoration or reconstruction does not meet with\ncurrent setback and other requirements and standards of article VIII of this chapter. Authentic restoration or reconstruction shall mean exact replication of an historic\nstructure to include, but not limited to siting, scale, massing, and materials of structure. Where it is found by the HRC that an application for a building permit covers\nactivity consisting of an authentic restoration or reconstruction in the same location as the original location and in the original structural conformation for a structure of\nhistoric and/or architectural significance to the historic district, such activity may be approved by the HRC.\n(2) The board of adjustment hears requests for variances from the requirements for setback and other standards established by article VIII of this chapter.\na. The board of adjustment, may attach reasonable and appropriate conditions to the granting of such variances so that the public health, safety, and general\nwelfare shall be protected.\nb. The board of adjustment shall not be authorized, in action undertaken by this subsection, to approve a use of property which is not permitted by right within the\nzoning district in which the property is located.\n(g) Parking waiver. Where the HRC, in considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, shall find that the number of off-street parking spaces required by zoning\nregulations for a building or structure for which a building permit is requested would render the building incongruous with the historic aspects of the historic district, it may\nrecommend to the board of adjustment that a variance be granted from the off-street parking requirements.\nThe board of adjustment may authorize a lesser number of off-street parking spaces provided the board finds, in addition to the required findings for granting a variance, as\nfollows:\n(1) That the reduced number of spaces will not create problems due to increased on-street parking; and\n(2) That the reduced number of spaces will not constitute a threat to the public safety.\n(h) Certificate of appropriateness.\n(1) From and after the designation of a historic district, no exterior portion of any building or other structure (including masonry walls, fences, light fixtures, steps,\npavement, landscape and color or other appurtenant features), nor above ground utility structure, nor any type of outdoor advertising sign shall be erected, altered,\nrestored, moved or demolished within such historic district until after an application for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted to and approved by the HRC.\nFurther, no historic sign, significant landscape, archeological and natural features of the area associated with such a structure or building shall be altered, moved, or\nremoved within such historic district until after an application for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted to and approved by the HRC. Further, no subdivision\nof land within a historic district shall be approved until it has been reviewed and approved in accordance with the provisions of section 7-5-8 of this chapter. This provision\nshall not apply to subdivisions which are exempted pursuant to section 7-15-1 of this chapter.\nNo building permit granted for the purposes of constructing, altering, moving, or demolishing structures within the historic districts shall be issued prior to the issuance of a\ncertificate of appropriateness by the HRC.\nA certificate of appropriateness may be issued subject to reasonable conditions to carry out the purposes of this section. A certificate of appropriateness shall be required\nwhether or not a building permit is required. Any building permit or such other permit not issued in conformity with this section shall be invalid.\nFor the purpose of this section, \"exterior features\" shall include the architectural style, general design, and general arrangement of the exterior building or other structure,\nincluding the kind, texture and color of the building materials, the size and scale of the building, and the type, color and style of all windows, doors, light fixtures, signs and\nother appurtenant fixtures and important landscape and natural features of the lot on which the building or other structure is located. In the case of outdoor advertising\nsigns, \"exterior features\" shall be construed to mean the style, material, size, and location of all such signs. Such \"exterior features\" also included historic signs, significant\nlandscape, archaeological, and natural features of the area.\nThe HRC shall have no jurisdiction over interior arrangement and shall take no action under this section except for the purpose of preventing the construction,\nreconstruction, alteration, restoration, moving, or demolition of buildings, structures, appurtenant fixtures, outdoor advertising signs, or other significant features in the\nhistoric district which would be incongruous with the special character of the historic district.\n(2) Permitted alterations and uses for historic buildings within historic district. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of\nany exterior architectural feature in the historic district which does not involve a substantial change in design, material, or outer appearance thereof, nor to prevent the\nconstruction, re-construction, alteration, restoration, or demolition of any such feature which the chief building inspector or his designee shall certify in writing to the HRC\nis\nrequired by the public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition.\n(3) Delay in demolition of buildings within historic district. An application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the relocation, demolition, or destruction of a\nbuilding or structure or the removal or obliteration of an archeological resource within the historic district may not be denied except for as set forth hereinafter. However,\nthe effective date of such a certificate may be delayed for a period of up to 365 days from the date of approval of the certificate of appropriateness. The maximum period\nof\ndelay authorized by this subsection shall be reduced by the HRC where it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial\nuse of or return from such property by virtue of the delay. During such period the HRC may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means\nof preserving the building, structure of site. If the HRC finds that the building, structure or site has no special significance or value toward maintaining the character of the\nhistoric district, it shall waive all or part of such period and authorize earlier demolition or removal.\nIf the HRC has voted to recommend designation of an area as a historic district, and final designation has not been made by the city council, the demolition or destruction\nof any building, structure, or site located in the proposed historic district may be delayed by the HRC for a period of up to 180 days or until the city council takes final action\non the designation, whichever occurs first.\nIt shall constitute a violation of this chapter by the property owner where any building or structure which is located within a historic district is subject to demolition by\n"}, {"page": "178", "text": "neglect; provided, however, where the property owner can show evidence of undue economic hardship satisfactory to the HRC, no violation shall be deemed to have\noccurred.\nAn application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the demolition or destruction of a building, structure, or site determined by the State Historic Preservation\nofficer, or his/her successor, as having statewide significance as defined in the criteria of the National Register of Historic Places may be denied except where the HRC\nfinds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use or return by virtue of the denial.\nThe procedures for obtaining a certificate of appropriateness are set forth in section7-5-11 of this chapter.\n(Ord.

Conditional Use District.\nFrom and after July 1, 2005, the Conditional Use District shall not be available for use in rezoning property within the zoning jurisdiction of the City of Asheville. Any conditional use\ndistrict ordinance adopted prior to July 1, 2005, shall remain valid and subject to the provisions contained herein and in the adopted ordinances establishing said districts.\n(a) Purpose. The Conditional Use District is established to provide for flexibility in the development of property while ensuring that the development is compatible with\nneighboring uses. Additional standards and regulations may be attached to a proposed development to ensure compatibility with the surrounding uses and with applicable\nadopted plans in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance. When applying for designation as a Conditional Use District, the owner shall specify the nature of the\nproposed development and shall propose conditions to ensure compatibility between the development and the surrounding uses.\n(b) General requirements. The use of the Conditional Use District is strongly encouraged due to the refinement of requests permitted by this option. Conditional use overlay\nzoning affords a degree of certainty in land use decisions not possible when rezoning to a general use district.\n(1) A Conditional Use District application shall be considered only upon request by the property owner or a duly authorized representative of the property owner.\n(2) Prior to submittal of the application, it is strongly recommended that the applicant meet with representatives of the surrounding property owners and of the\nsurrounding neighborhood(s) to discuss the proposed development.\n(3) All standards and requirements of the underlying zoning district shall be met, except to the extent that the conditions imposed by the conditional use zoning are more\nrestrictive than the underlying standards.\n(4) No use shall be permitted except those allowed by approval of a conditional use permit.\n(5) The conditions imposed pursuant to the conditional use permit approval shall be stated on the permit and may limit the uses which are permitted on the property.\nSuch conditions may further specify location on the property of the proposed structure(s), the number of dwelling units, the location and extent of supporting facilities such\nas parking lots, driveways, and access streets, the location and extent of buffer areas and other special purpose areas, the timing of development, the height of structures,\nthe location and extent of rights-of-way and other areas to be dedicated for public purposes, and other such matters as may be identified as appropriate for the proposed\ndevelopment.\n(6) Minor modifications of the approved conditional use permit may be approved by the planning and development director. The minor modifications authorized herein\nare intended to provide relief where conditions, established by the conditional use permit granted, create a hardship based upon a unique physical attribute of the property\nitself or some other factor unique to the property which was not known at the time of permit approval and which subsequently rendered the land difficult or impossible to\nuse due to the condition(s) imposed. The permit holder shall bear the burden of proof to secure the modification(s). Such modifications shall be limited to the following:\na. A deviation of up to ten percent or 24 inches, whichever is greater, from the approved setback, provided that the conditions for approving a deviation from the\nrequired setback established by subsection 7-11-8(c)(1) of this chapter are met.\nb. A reduction of up to 25 percent in the number of parking spaces required for the use provided that the conditions established by subsection-11-8(c)(2) of this\nchapter are met.\n(7) Any violation of a condition included in the approval of a conditional use permit shall be treated the same as any other violation of this chapter and shall be subject to\nthe same remedies and penalties as any other such violation.\n(8) If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these regulations is found to be illegal or invalid, or if the applicant should fail to accept any condition, the\napproval of such Conditional Use District shall be null and void, the property shall revert to its previous zoning classification and the conditional use permit shall be deemed\nrevoked, all without further action by the city council.\n(9) If no action has been taken to begin development of the property in accordance with the approved conditional use permit within 24 months of its approval by city\ncouncil, the Conditional Use District zoning shall be null and void, the property shall revert to its previous zoning classification and the conditional use permit shall be\ndeemed revoked, all without further action of the city council.\n(10) If the use or uses commenced pursuant to a permit issued under this section are deemed abandoned or discontinued pursuant to sections-17-5 or 7-17-6, then the\nconditional use permit issued pursuant to this section shall be deemed revoked, the Conditional Use District zoning shall be null and void, and the property shall revert to\nits previous zoning classification, without action by the city council.\n(c) Application procedure. Applications for Conditional Use District zoning and for issuance of a conditional use permit shall be processed, considered, and voted upon using the\nsame procedures and subject to the same requirements as those established by sections 7-7 and 7-5-5 of this chapter, except as otherwise provided below:\n(1) The application shall include site plans, landscape plans, building elevations, floor plans, and such other information required to provide the approving bodies with a\ncomplete and accurate description of the proposed development.\n(2) The application and supporting materials shall be reviewed by the technical review committee in accordance with the procedures set forth in section7-5-5 of this\nchapter prior to the meeting of the planning and zoning commission at which the application is to be considered. Notice of this meeting shall be provided as the same is\nrequired for a public hearing for rezoning property as set forth in subsection 7-5-20(a)(4) of this chapter. The recommendations and comments of the technical review\ncommittee shall be reported to the planning and zoning commission.\n(3) In establishing conditional districts, the city council may prescribe dimensional requirements (height, setback, etc.) that are different from the requirements of the\ncorresponding general zoning classification, and may prescribe development and design standards that are different from those set out in article XI; provided, that any\nrequest for a modification to a dimensional requirement or development and design standards (landscape, parking, etc.) that is less restrictive than would be applicable for\nthe corresponding general zoning classification must be specifically described in any notices required for the public hearing on the conditional zoning application, if it is\npart of the application, and must be set out separately in any ordinance establishing said conditional zoning district, together with an explanation of the reason for the\nmodification. Except as modified pursuant to this paragraph, or pursuant to paragraph (6), below, all standards and requirements of the corresponding general zoning\ndistrict must be met. Variances to the standards established for any conditional zoning shall not be allowed.\n(4) Upon receipt of the recommendations from the planning and zoning commission, the city council shall hold a public hearing on the requests for Conditional Use\nDistrict zoning and issuance of a conditional use permit. Notice of the public hearing shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of section 7-5-20 of this chapter.\nThe city council shall take separate actions on consideration of the zoning request and the conditional use permit request.\n"}, {"page": "184", "text": "(5) The Asheville City Council shall not approve the conditional use permit unless and until it has approved the rezoning request. The standards for granting conditional\nuse permits under this section shall be the same as for conditional use permits issued pursuant to subsection 7-16-2(c).\n(6) Upon review of the requests for approval of Conditional Use District zoning, the Asheville City Council may authorize the amendment of the official zoning map of\nthe\nCity of Asheville to add the Conditional Use District zoning and issue the conditional use permit for the proposed development; deny the requests for the zoning and\nissuance of the conditional use permit; or continue the consideration of the requests in order to receive further information regarding the requests.\n(7) In approving the conditional use permit, the Asheville City Council may impose such conditions and requirements as it deems necessary in order for the purpose and\nintent of this chapter to be served.\n(8) The Conditional Use District zoning and conditional use permit authorized and approved as provided herein shall be perpetually binding upon the affected property\nunless subsequently changed or amended as provided for in this chapter.\n(Ord.

Charlotte Street Transition Overlay District.\n(a) General description. The Charlotte Street Transition Overlay District is established to assist in the advancement and implementation of the Charlotte Street Corridor Plan\n(the \"Plan\"). The district provides for and encourages a mixture of uses, including medium density business and service uses serving several residential neighborhoods, and\nmedium to high density residential uses. Additionally, the district encourages development which is compatible with its surroundings and provides incentives for property owners\nto develop property in a manner that is consistent with the goals and recommendations of the plan. This district may serve as a workplace and/or residence for many individuals\nand should be sensitive to a significant pedestrian population, but also provide for adequate and safe vehicular access.\n(b) Permitted uses. The uses permitted within the Charlotte Street Transition Overlay District shall be those listed as permitted uses within the underlying general use zoning\ndistrict(s).\n(c) Prohibited uses. The uses prohibited within the Charlotte Street Transition Overlay District shall be those listed as prohibited uses within the underlying general use zoning\ndistrict(s).\n(d) Uses by right subject to special requirements. The uses by right subject to special requirements within the Charlotte Street Transition Overlay District shall be those listed as\nuses by right subject to special requirements within the underlying general use zoning district(s).\n(e) Conditional uses. The conditional uses within the Charlotte Street Transition Overlay District shall be those listed as conditional uses within the underlying general use\nzoning district(s).\n(f) Development standards.\n(1) Structure size standards.\na. New structures in the Charlotte Street Transition Overlay District may have a building footprint of not more than 6,000 square feet. The gross floor area of new\nstructures shall not exceed 12,000 square feet.\nb. Existing structures may not be expanded to exceed a footprint or gross floor area of 12,000 square feet.\nC. Structures may exceed the permitted structure size indicated in subsection a. above, up to 25 percent above the maximum structure size if the specific design\ncriteria set forth in paragraph (2)b. below, are met.\n(2) Design criteria.\na. General principles and intent of the design criteria:\nThe intent of the following design criteria is to maintain and strengthen the unique historic character of Charlotte Street by helping to ensure that new buildings are\narchitecturally compatible with the historic character of the street and that design characteristics are employed which are consistent with the historic architectural\nvocabulary of the area. These characteristics include historic building forms and silhouettes, proportions, treatments, exterior materials, massing and/or\narchitectural style. Additionally, it is intended that the front elevations and overall massing of new buildings be pedestrian scaled and related to the street.\nIt is not the intent that new buildings mimic historic designs, but rather that they combine elements from the historic design palette in new ways to achieve a design\nwhich is compatible with and complementary to the historic character of the street.\nIn\ngeneral, the predominant historic style of architecture within the boundaries of the overlay district is of a residential form with pitched roofs, porches and paned\nwindows and is less urban than the structures south of E. Chestnut Street. To a lesser degree, brick historic commercial structures exist in the corridor and these\nhave pitched roofs and sometimes use a combination of brick and stucco.\nWhen developing designs for new buildings, it is advisable to reference existing historic buildings or other documentation to identify elements that are to be used in\nthe project.\nb. Specific design criteria:\n1. The proposed structure shall be two stories as measured from the Charlotte Street side of the building.\n2. Roof forms shall be similar to those used historically within the boundaries of the overlay district. The dominant roof shapes shall be gabled or hipped.\nThe minimum roof pitch shall be 5:12. Gable ends shall face the street. The addition of dormers is permitted. Areas of flat roofs are discouraged and shall not\nexceed 25 percent of the primary fa\u00e7ade and shall be located behind a sloped roof or parapet.\n3. All rooftop equipment shall be fully screened from view and the method of screening shall be integrated into the overall building design, for example\nwithin or behind pitched roofs. Ground mounted equipment shall be located to the rear of buildings and shall be screened with an enclosure compatible with\nthe architectural style of the structure and/or evergreen plant material that provides an opaque screen.\n4. Where new building fa\u00e7ades will be wider than 35 feet, the fa\u00e7ade surface shall be subdivided into portions not exceeding this distance by varying\nsetbacks, roof forms and perhaps materials. This subdivision of the fa\u00e7ade surface will break up the fa\u00e7ade into increments similar to historic fa\u00e7ade widths\nfound within the boundaries of the overlay district.\n5. Use building materials that are similar to those used historically. These include \"pebbledash\" or \"rough-cast\" stucco, wood shingles, and horizontal wood\nsiding for buildings which are residential in character. Brick was typically used for original historic commercial structures, sometimes in combination with\nstucco above or as a foundation material for structures which are residential in character. Stone was also used, to a lesser degree, as a material at the\nfoundation or first floor level with shingles or stucco above.\n6. A minimum of 40 percent of the first floor and 20 percent of the upper floor(s) on the front fa\u00e7ade shall have window/door fenestration. Windows shall be\nset to the inside of the building face wall. Tinted or mirrored glass is not permitted.\n7. Skylights shall not be used on the front fa\u00e7ades.\n(3) Additional design standards. Structures which incorporate all of the design criteria in subsection (2)b. above, may further exceed the permitted structure size indicated\nin subsection (1) above, according to the total number of points received for incorporating the following elements in the proposed development.\nDevelopments accumulating between 50 and 79 points shall be allowed to exceed the permitted structure size indicated in item (1) up to 50 percent above the maximum\nstructure size. Developments accumulating 80 or more points shall be allowed to exceed the permitted structure size indicated in subsection (1) above, up to 75 percent\nabove the maximum structure size.\na. The proposed structure is a \"mixed use\" building, housing two or more distinct use types (i.e. retail, office, residential, etc.); and (point totals are cumulative):\n1. No single use type exceeds 75 percent of the total gross square footage of the building: 30 points.\n2. If residential uses are provided which occupy at least 40 percent of the total gross square footage of the building: 40 points.\n3.\nIf residential uses are provided which occupy at least 40 percent of the total gross square footage or the building and at least 25 percent of those units\nare designed to have a total net square footage of 600 square feet or less: 45 points.\nb. The proposed structure contains one or more of the following uses with an operable storefront entrance facing the street:\nBakeries\nBarber shops and salons\nBicycle shops\n"}, {"page": "185", "text": "Bookstores\nCandy, pastry, ice cream and snack shops\nDelicatessens\nFlorists\nFruit and vegetable markets\nGift shops\nGrocery stores\nHardware/garden supply stores\nPharmacies\nRestaurants\nTailors/dressmaker shops\nVideo rental stores\nOther similar uses which serve the surrounding community and which may generate significant pedestrian activity: 20 points\nC.\nThe landscaping for the proposed development exceeds the requirements of subsections7-11-3(f) and (g) of this Code by at least 50 percent. (Hardscape\nwhich incorporates features that are pedestrian oriented may be used in combination with or instead of landscaping along the street frontage of the lot). Examples\nof these features include benches, outdoor dining, planting boxes, etc. Street trees and hardscape features shall be consistent with any approved streetscape plan\nfor the area: 20 points.\nd.\nA connection is made between the parking area of the developing property and the parking area of one or both adjoining properties which allows for internal\ncirculation between properties and results in there being only one drive entrance on Charlotte Street to access the developing property: 15 points.\ne. Entrances to the proposed structure are defined either by front porches, if designed with a residential character, or are recessed from the primary fa\u00e7ade and\ndefined with lawnings or canopies: 15 points\nf. The proposed development is designed to sensitively preserve the principal historic structure(s) on the site. For the purposes of this section, historic buildings\nshall be defined as contributing structures within the boundaries of a National Register Historic District or those that are eligible for listing in the National Register of\nHistoric Places: 20 points.\nDemolition of a historic structure: Minus 20 points.\ng. A minimum of 25 percent of the total number of residential dwelling units provided in a proposed single-use residential development are designed to have a total\nnet square footage of 600 square feet or less: 20 points.\n(g) Setback standards. The following minimum setbacks shall be required for uses in the Charlotte Street Transition Overlay District.\nThe landscape and buffering standards (section 7-11-3) may require additional setback; if so, the most restrictive requirement shall apply. The minimum spacing between\nstructures shall, in addition, be as per the Asheville Fire Prevention Code.\n(h) Other standards. All other development standards for the Charlotte Street Transition Overlay District shall be the same as those required within the underlying general use\nzoning district(s).\n(Ord. No. 2690, \u00a7 1, 4-25-00; Ord. No. 4361, \u00a7 1y, 3-23-21)\nSec. 7-9-11. Adaptive Reuse Overlay District.\n(a) General description. The Adaptive Reuse Overlay District is created to implement several infill development, community compatibility, and economic development goals and\nstrategies of the comprehensive plan through an overlay district that allows and provides incentives for adaptively reusing valuable existing buildings. Asheville has a stock of fine\nolder buildings that greatly contribute to the city's quality of life and urban character. Due to design, location, and/or condition, these buildings may become physically or\nfunctionally obsolete for use under their current zoning. The application of an Adaptive Reuse Overlay District to properties containing these buildings permits a wider range of\nland uses to be available to these existing buildings for the purpose of extending their useful life.\n(b) Permitted uses. Those uses allowed as permitted uses under the underlying zoning district. Additionally:\n(1) In single-family residential districts, multi-family and professional office uses are allowed as permitted uses subject to the development and design standards provided\nin this section; multifamily uses are not subject to the density limitations of the underlying zoning districts.\n(2) In multi-family residential districts, except the urban residential district, professional office and gift shop uses are allowed as permitted uses subject to the\ndevelopment and design standards provided in this section; multi-family uses are not subject to the density limitations of the underlying zoning districts.\n(3) In urban residential districts, those office/business uses allowed as permitted uses in the Neighborhood Business District are allowed as permitted uses subject to the\ndevelopment and design standards provided in this section; multi-family uses are not subject to the density limitations of the underlying zoning district.\n(4) In office districts, those office/business uses allowed as permitted uses in the Neighborhood Business District are allowed as permitted uses subject to the\ndevelopment and design standards provided in this section; multi-family uses are not subject to the density limitations of the underlying zoning districts.\n(c) Prohibited uses.\nOutdoor storage.\nUses with drive-through facilities.\nUses with outdoor loud speaker systems.\nAny use not specifically listed in this section or specifically listed as a permitted use or a use by right, subject to special requirements, or a conditional use in the underlying\nzoning district is prohibited.\n(d) Uses by right, subject to special requirements. Those uses allowed as uses by right, subject to special requirements, under the underlying zoning district.\n(e) Conditional uses. Those uses allowed as conditional uses under the underlying zoning district.\n(f) Development and design standards.\n(1) Application. The provisions of the adaptive reuse overlay district shall be limited to the reuse of existing principal structures and shall not apply to new construction of\nprincipal structures or to accessory structures.\n(2) Multistory structures. For multistory structures in single-family and multi-family zoning districts, including the urban residential district, at least one story shall be\ndevoted to residential use.\n(3) Reduction in required off-street parking. There shall be a 25 percent reduction in the minimum amount of required off-street parking for adaptive reuse projects;\nin\naddition to this provision, flexible development standards, as applicable, may also be utilized to further reduce the amount of required parking.\n(4) Location of off-street parking. Parking shall be located in the rear of the site and shall be screened with vegetation from adjacent single-family uses. The vegetative\nscreening shall consist of the planting required for a Type A buffer or its equivalent as determined through the alternative landscape compliance process. On-street parking\nor parking in the front or side of the lot may be approved by the planning and development director provided that any off-street parking area can be adequately screened\nfrom adjacent residential uses and:\nCELL (1, 1): \nFront:\nCELL (1, 2): \n5 ft. minimum 20 ft. maximum\nCELL (2, 1): \nSide:\nCELL (2, 2): \nNone required\nCELL (3, 1): \nRear:\nCELL (3, 2): \nNone required\nCELL (4, 1): \nCorner lot, street side:\nCELL (4, 2): \n10 ft.\n"}, {"page": "186", "text": "The topography of the site or the placement of the principal structure makes it impractical to access the rear of the property; or\nThe majority of the residentially-zoned properties on both sides of the street on the block on which the proposed use is to be constructed have parking located in the front\nor side; no more than three parking spaces shall be provided in front using this option in single-family zoning districts.\n(5) Maintenance of architectural character. The architectural character of the principal structure, including its fenestration (i.e., door and window openings), shall be\nmaintained with regard to any fa\u00e7ade that faces a street or is prominently visible from adjoining properties.\n(6) Expansion. The gross floor area of the principal structure may be increased by up to 25 percent provided that such expansion maintains the architectural character of\nthe structure pursuant to subsection (5) above.\n(7) Compliance with building and life safety codes. The structure or use shall comply with all applicable building and life safety codes.\n(8) Buffer and landscaping requirements. The planning and development director may reduce or waive buffer and landscaping requirements to maintain consistency in\nappearance with the surrounding neighborhood.\n(9) Compatibility. The planning and development director may establish conditions regarding lighting, landscaping, hours of operation, and other operational and site\ndesign features necessary to maintain compatibility with surrounding properties.\n(Ord.

There shall be no limit on the number of principal buildings on an individual lot, except as indicated in (b) below, and, provided that all other requirements set forth\nin this chapter or other federal, state, or local laws are met.\n(b) Single-family dwellings. There shall be no more than one single-family dwelling on an individual lot in a single-family residential zoning district, unless otherwise provided in\nthis chapter. This requirement does not affect the use of accessory dwelling units in conjunction with the standards set forth in this chapter.\n(Ord. No. 2369, \u00a7 1, 5-27-97; Ord.

Required setbacks; allowable encroachments into required setbacks.\n(a) General. A building, structure, or lot shall not be developed, used, or occupied unless it meets the minimum setback requirements set forth in article VIII and article X of this\nchapter for the use or overlay zoning district in which it is located, except as otherwise established in this chapter for particular uses or for encroachments as set forth in (f) below.\nSee also section 7-10-4, Requirements for Lots Along Thoroughfares.\n(b) Method of calculation.\n(1) Minimum setback. Minimum setback is the space defined by measuring perpendicularly from and along the entire boundary of the lot (property line) to the building\nline. Front setbacks shall be measured from the street right-of-way line, except, on streets greater than 45 feet in travel lane width, the setback shall be measured from the\nedge of the travel lane. The accompanying corner lot, street side setback shall also be measured from the edge of the travel lane. In no case shall the minimum setback\nbe closer to the street than the right-of-way line. A setback may be the front, rear, or side setback. For illustrations of the location of front, rear, or side setbacks, see\nFigure 10-1. Except as set forth for through lots in subsection 7-10-2(d) below, there shall be one front setback area which is determined at the time of site plan approval or\nzoning permit issuance.\nMinimum Rear Setback\nMinimum\nSide Setback\nMinimum Side Setback\nStructure\nProperty Line\nMinimum Front Setback\nRight-of-way Line\nStreet\nfig. 10-1\n(2) Overlap of setbacks.

Asheville's location on the habitable edge of the Appalachian Mountains (one of the oldest ranges in the world); its truly fascinating cultural heritage; the\naccidents of history that endowed the city with more of than its share of memorable architecture; its site on the French Broad River (one of the country's oldest rivers-and the\nonly one in the Southeast that flows north); and its location in the center of a geographical area that includes four neighboring states, make Asheville truly different from all other\nAmerican cities. The landscape and buffering standards set forth below require landscaping between dissimilar zoning, along public rights-of-way, in and around parking lots and\noutdoor storage areas, and on properties supporting new development or extensive re-development, in order to:\n(1) Encourage the preservation and health of existing trees, tree canopies, and other existing vegetation, and to replenish removed vegetation;\n(2) Improve and protect the visual quality of the City of Asheville, city forests, and forested view sheds, and minimize potential negative impacts of development such as\nnoise, dust, glare of lights, parking lots, traffic, heat, overcrowding, and odor;\n(3) Provide environmental benefits, such as climate modification, decreased energy consumption, reduced stormwater runoff, decreased erosion, improved water and air\nquality, and protection of wildlife habitat;\n(4) Provide a transition between dissimilar zoning districts to protect abutting properties from potential negative impacts of neighboring development, particularly between\nresidential-commercial interfaces, and to preserve the character and value of a property and provide a sense of privacy;\n(5) Improve standards for quantity, location, size, spacing, protection, and maintenance of plants and other screening materials to assure a high level of quality in the\nappearance of Asheville while allowing flexibility to promote well designed and creative landscape plantings.\n(6) Enforce the maintenance of landscaping installed to meet the requirements of these high standards to ensure that the landscaping continues to thrive and enhance\nthe visual quality of the City of Asheville.\n(b) Applicability. Landscape standards are required for developments within the City of Asheville's zoning jurisdiction, including the extraterritorial jurisdiction. Applicants are\nadvised to meet with planning and development department staff prior to submitting a site plan to discuss applicable landscape requirements, other ordinance requirements, and\ncoordination of plantings with utility plans. A landscape plan drawn to scale must be submitted with the site plan and prepared in accordance with the standards established by\nthe planning and development department. Separate landscape requirements are considered cumulative unless noted otherwise.\n(1)\nDevelopment of property as referenced in section7-11-1 must bring the entire site into full compliance with the requirements of article XI of this chapter (parking,\nloading, access, landscape and buffering, open space and traffic impact analysis).\n(1.1) The following types of development must only comply with the landscape and buffering standards that are specifically defined in each of the following sections:\na. Existing unpaved vehicular use areas of which less than 50 percent is paved or existing paved vehicular use areas of which less than 50 percent is demolished\nand repaved must meet the parking lot landscape requirements in subsection 7-11-3(d)(4) only for the disturbed area. For properties where the area of disturbance\nis located along the perimeter of the vehicular use are the following landscape standards shall also be required adjacent to the disturbed area, if applicable:\nproperty line buffer, street buffer, street trees. Maintenance and repair of disturbed areas less than 500 square feet are exempt from this requirement with an\nexception that any landscaping removed to accommodate the maintenance or repair of such areas must be replaced with vegetation equivalent to that which was\nremoved.\nb. Building expansions or additions that are less than 50 percent of the pre-expansion floor area must meet the landscaping requirements only in the area around\nthe addition which is parallel to any edge of the expansion area and extending to the property line or street pavement edge (see illustration below):\nEXPASION\nPROPERTY\nAREA AROUND ADDITION to BE BROUGHT\nINTO\nLANDSCAPE\nexpansion /addition\nC.\nBuilding expansions or additions occurring on properties zoned Commercial Industrial or Industrial that result in an expansion of less than five percent of the\npre-expansion floor area or 3,000 square feet in size whichever is less, are not required to meet additional landscape standards. Cumulative expansions occurring\nover a three-year period that exceed this threshold shall have to meet all applicable landscape standards.\n(2)\nCentral business district alternatives. In order to preserve and promote existing development patterns within the Central Business District specific landscape\nrequirements are described below:\na. The CBD areas within the Downtown Design Review Overlay District are exempt from building impact landscaping and property line buffers;\nb. Other CBD areas are exempt from building impact landscaping but developers will be required to provide a property line buffer which may be the standard\nbuffer outlined in [section] 7-11-3 or an alternative buffer described in the ordinance for the district [in section]7-8-18;\nC. All CBD areas may modify the requirement for a street buffer by placing a wall at a minimum height of three feet in place of the required shrubs;\nd. Street tree, parking lot and screening requirements shall apply as described in the ordinance.\n(3) Urban zoning district exemption. In order to promote a high density, urban form of development within these districts, the tree save requirements of this subsection\nshall not apply to properties zoned Urban Village (UV), Neighborhood Corridor (NCD), Urban Residential (URD), and Urban Place (UP).\n(c) Preservation and protection of existing vegetation. Preserving existing vegetation protects the visual quality of the City of Asheville's urban landscape and should be\nencouraged.\n(1) Credits and other incentives to preserve vegetation. Projects intending to preserve existing vegetation in order to receive credit for required landscaping must\ngraphically show the location of each tree on a the landscape plan and must note the dbh (diameter at breast height) and species of each tree. Any development that\n"}, {"page": "197", "text": "proposes to preserve existing vegetation will receive credit for that vegetation at the rate of:\nIn order to receive credit, preserved vegetation must be in good health and condition and must meet the spacing requirements of the standards it is intended to satisfy.\nProtective barriers must also be shown on the landscape and grading plans in accordance with the requirements of this section. If a preserved tree dies within 24 months\nof completion of the project, it must be replaced with the total number of trees which were credited to the existing tree. No credit will be given to invasive-exotic species.\n(2) Protection of existing trees during construction. No grading or other land-disturbing activity can occur on a site with existing trees which are designated to be\npreserved in order to meet the landscaping requirements until protective barriers are installed by the developer and inspected by the planning and development director.\nThe dbh of the preserved trees and the location of protective barriers must be shown on the landscape and grading plans with the dimension between the tree trunk and\nbarrier indicated.\na.\nPlacement of protective barriers. Barricades shall be placed around the critical root zone of preserved trees that are within 50 feet of any grading or\nconstruction activity. The critical root zone is a circle extending around the tree with a one-foot radius for every one inch of tree diameter. All protective barriers\nmust include clear and visible signage that describes the delineated area as a \"Tree Protection Area\", or equivalent. All protective barriers and signs must be\nmaintained throughout the building construction process.\nb. Protective barriers shall consist of either:\nA fence which is at least three feet high and constructed in a post and rail configuration, using two by four posts and one by four rails; or\nTREE\n15'-0\"\ntree/fence\ntree/fence\nC. Prohibited activities. All contractors must be made aware of the areas designated for protection. No disturbance can occur within the tree protection area\nincluding:\nGrading\nFilling\nParking\nStorage of debris or materials, including topsoil\nSedimentation and erosion control measures\nDisposal of hazardous wastes or concrete washout\nAttaching of nails, ropes, cables, signs, or fencing to any preserved tree.\nd. Permissible encroachments. Where physical site constraints exist, utilities may encroach into the tree protection area provided they are tunneled at least two\nfeet directly below the tree roots to minimize root damage. A construction detail shall be required.\nOther encroachments various in nature may be permitted provided that the contractor follows- through on the written recommendation of a certified arborist or\nconsulting arborist to minimize any potential impact and certify that the activity will not damage the tree under normal circumstances.\ne. Silt fencing. If silt fencing is required to control sedimentation, the fencing must be placed along the uphill edge of a tree protection zone in order to prevent\nsediment from accumulating in the critical root zone area (refer to the City of Asheville's Standards and Specifications Manual for details).\n(d) Standards. Landscape requirements are broken down in the following categories:\na. Property line buffer - Landscaping along property lines separating different zoning districts.\nb. Street buffer - Landscaping along street rights-of-way between parking areas and pedestrian zones.\nC.\nStreet trees - Shade trees planted along street frontages to improve the pedestrian environment and enhance the urban streetscape.\nd. Parking lot landscaping - Landscaping in and around vehicular use areas.\ne. Building impact landscaping - Landscaping used to enhance the site.\nf. Screening - Landscaping around utility use, outdoor storage, and loading areas.\n(1) Property line buffer. Some land uses may create an adverse impact when developed adjacent to other less intensive land uses commonly found in certain zoning\ndistricts. Bufferyards shall be required for proposed developments adjacent to parcels of dissimilar zoning designations to provide a transition between districts of varying\nintensities. The bufferyard width and number of plantings required will vary depending on the degree of difference between the zoning designations and shall be the\nresponsibility of the property owner developing or changing the land use.\na. Bufferyard types. The amount of plant material required in a bufferyard area is measured per 100 linear feet and is based on the following table.\n* 50 percent of all shrubs must be evergreen.\nb. Buffer determination. The type of buffer required is based on the following table.

Buffer location. Buffers shall extend along the entire property line which is adjacent to the properties of dissimilar zoning designation. Buffers are to be located\non the property of the person developing the new or changing land use, between the property line and any vehicular use areas, buildings, storage, service areas, or\nother area of activity.\nd. Species composition. Plantings in buffer areas shall be an appropriate mix of native species or other species suitable to naturalizing in woodland settings.\nBuffers in the river district shall be composed of species appropriate to a river environment. Consult the City of Asheville Recommended Species List for a list of\napproved species.\ne. Placement of buffer plantings. The exact placement of the required plants shall be the decision of the developer or designer, but shall be approved by the\nplanning and development director. Plants should be placed in a manner to serve as an effective and attractive screen year-round when viewed from any area\naccessible to the public or from adjacent properties. Trees or shrubs should be planted at least five feet away from the property line to ensure maintenance access\nand to avoid encroaching upon neighboring property.\nf. Setbacks. Wherein a setback and bufferyard are required along the same property line that with the greatest dimensional width shall be applicable. If the\nsetback is greater than the bufferyard, the total number of required plant material shall be distributed throughout the wider setback.\ng. Corner lots and through lots. No buffer will be required along the front property line of any lot; however, a lot with more than one street face will require a buffer\nalong the secondary street face when it is adjacent to a dissimilar zoning district. Buffer requirements are waived in lieu of street trees and street buffers, as\napplicable, provided the building fa\u00e7ade is that street frontage is pedestrian oriented with functioning pedestrian entrances that open onto public sidewalks.\nh. Encroachments. The following site features may be permitted to penetrate or encroach into a required buffer area provided that the total number of required\nplantings is still met.\nApproved driveway openings\nPedestrian or bicycle paths\nDesignated greenways\nUtilities\nWalls/fences\ni.\nProhibitions in a buffer. The following are specifically prohibited from encroaching into required buffer areas:\nLoading areas\nStorage areas\nParking areas\nDriveways and drive aisles, other than approved openings\nDumpsters\nStormwater retention/detention structures\nj. Buffer along the Blue Ridge Parkway. In order to preserve views and mitigate the impacts of adjacent development from the Blue Ridge Parkway or other scenic\ncorridors officially designated by city council or the North Carolina Department of Transportation, new developments adjacent to these corridors shall provide a\nType 'B' buffer as required by this subsection.\nk. Grading activity in the bufferyard. When possible, grading should not occur within a required bufferyard. If grading within the required bufferyard proves\nnecessary then the developer is required to plant trees and shrubs which are 50 percent larger than otherwise required in order to quickly re-establish a visual\nbuffer. Grading in the required bufferyard shall not exceed a 3:1 slope.\nI. Overlapping requirements. Fifty percent of buffer plants that are within 15 feet of a vehicular use area may also be counted towards the parking lot landscaping.\n(2) Street buffers. Street buffers are designed to provide for a separation of activities and a more comfortable pedestrian environment. The street buffer is required in\naddition to the street trees planted in a ten-foot planting strip as required in subsection 7-11-2(d)(3)(c).\na. Street buffer determination. Vehicular use areas greater than 4,000 square fee that are located within 50 feet of the edge of a street must be buffered from the\nstreet.\nb. Calculating the requirement.

The physical conditions or constraints are not a result of the applicant's own actions.\niii. The proposed alternative will not present a safety hazard.\niv. That proposed alternative will, upon maturity, provide landscaping that is equal to or better than the standards requirements.\nV. The proposed alternative is designed to address plant health and vigor.\nvi. The proposed alternative is reasonably compatible with the natural and topographic features of the site.\nvii. The proposed alternative supports the purpose statement noted in7-11-2(a).\nb. Alternative compliance with existing structures and utilities. The Asheville Tree Commission may recommend (and the planning director may approve)\nlandscape alternatives with a greater than 50 percent reduction where the location of existing structures or utilities creates a situation where an applicant wishing to\nreuse/rehabilitate a structure is unable to comply. In these situations, the tree commission may recommend any degree of reduction but shall also consider on-site\nalternatives to the landscape standards in order to mitigate the loss of the required landscaping. Mitigation measures should be considered by the commission in\naddition to the alternative compliance standards set forth in subsection a. above.\n(f) Compliance and maintenance. Vegetation shall be planted and maintained to ensure the best chance of survival and to reduce the potential expense of replacing damaged\nplant materials\n(1) Certificate of compliance. Landscaping must be installed and inspected by the City of Asheville prior to receiving a certificate of compliance. If the season or weather\nconditions prohibit planting the materials, the developer may provide a bond, an irrevocable letter of credit, or other financial surety in an amount equal to one and one-half\ntimes the estimated cost of installing the required landscaping to guarantee the completion of the required planting. Upon approval of the financial surety, the certificate of\ncompliance shall be issued. The financial surety shall be for a period not to exceed 12 months. The surety shall be canceled and/or returned upon completion of the\nrequired landscaping.\nIf a developer provides satisfactory evidence that a bond or surety as required by this paragraph has been requested and that the developer and project otherwise qualify\nfor said bond or surety, and that said request has been turned down by two or more financial institutions for reasons unrelated to the qualifications of the developer or\nproject, the planning director may enter into an agreement with the developer for the delayed completion of the required work; provided, that said agreement may not\napply to improvements or features that are required for safety purposes, or are prescribed by statute or state codes or regulations. By way of illustration and not limitation,\nsaid agreement (1) shall establish a schedule for the completion of improvements, (2) shall contain provisions relating to enforcement of its terms, and (3) shall specify\npenalties for breach, (4) shall be subject to approval of the city attorney, and (5) may be recorded in the office of the register of deeds wherein the property is located.\n(2) Maintenance. The owner or lessee of the property where landscaping is required shall be responsible for the maintenance and protection of all required and\npreserved plant and screening material. Landscaped areas shall be maintained in good condition and kept free of debris. When street trees planted to satisfy the\nrequirements of 7-11-3(d)(3) are located in the public right-of-way, they shall be maintained by the owner of the property that originally installed said street trees for\na\nperiod of two years after planting.\n(3) Plant specifications.\na. Recommended plant species. Plants may be chosen from the recommended plant species list as maintained by the City. Specific riparian species, as identified\nin the recommended species list, trees and shrubs for damp sites and river districts, shall be required for developments located within the 100-year flood plain. The\nlist encourages the use of plant materials which are indigenous to this region and are readily available from local nurseries. Plant materials which are not on the list\nmay also be used following approval from the director of Development Services or designee.\nb.\nMinimum plant size requirements. All required vegetation shall meet the following minimum size requirements at planting. Additionally, all plants must meet the\nrequirements of the most recent edition of the American Standards for Nursery Stock, ANSI 260.1.

Minimum size at planting shall be two inches caliper and 12 to 14-foot height.\nii.\nSmall-maturing deciduous tree: Smaller than 35 feet at maturity. The minimum tree size shall be at least one and one-half inch caliper or eight to ten feet\nhigh at time of planting.\niii. Evergreen tree: Minimum height of six feet at time of planting.\niv. Large shrub: Minimum five gallon container or ten-inch root ball with a height of 24 inches at time of planting.\nV.\nSmall shrub: Minimum three gallon container or eight-inch root ball with a height of 18 inches at time of planting.\n(4) Tree pruning standards. Trees located within the city's public right-of-way cannot be pruned or removed without a permit from the Asheville Public Works Department\nas\nrequired by chapter 20 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Asheville. All other required trees shall be pruned in accordance with the American National Standard\nfor Tree Care operations A300 published by the American National Standards Institute. Tree owners and their agents are encouraged to hire businesses that employ\ncertified arborists who can supervise the pruning work on site and ensure that proper pruning is being performed (See the City of Asheville Standards and Specifications\nManual for details). In addition, the following standards shall apply to required trees:\na. Co-dominant stems less than four inches in diameter at the fork shall be pruned off and one main stem shall remain.\nb. Pruning shall be done such that a tree's natural form is maintained by the greatest extent possible.\nC. Tree topping or heading is not permitted.\nd. Reasons for which tree pruning is not permitted include, but are not limited to:\nSign installation, clearance, or visibility; excluding traffic, directional, warning, or information signs owned by any public or semi-public agency.\nVisibility of a structure and/or outdoor display area.\nClearance for equipment traffic or storage, the erection of temporary structures, or materials storage within the tree protection zone.\n(5) Failure to maintain. Failure to maintain or replace dead, damaged, or diseased material or failure to maintain or repair a fence or wall installed as a buffer shall\nconstitute a violation of this chapter and shall be subject to the penalty provisions in section 7-18-2 if not corrected or replaced within 30 days of notification. If an act of\nGod or other catastrophic event occurs which destroys a large quantity of vegetation, the owner or lessee shall have 120 days to replant. Replaced plant material must be\nin compliance with the minimum size, spacing, and quantity standards of this chapter.\n(6) Un-approved removal or noncompliant pruning. Removing required landscaping or undertaking pruning actions that do not conform to the requirements of this section\nshall constitute a violation of this chapter and shall be subject to the penalties described in chapter 10, appendix B. Additionally, all affected areas must be replanted to\ncurrent standards.\n(g) Clearing of land time limit. In districts where speculative grading is prohibited and land is cleared through issuance of a grading permit; the owner shall be required to replant\nthe cleared property to its original state based on tree counts and other information originally submitted to the City of Asheville if construction does not begin within six months\nfrom the date that the grading activity ceases.\n(Ord.

The open space standards contained herein are established to provide for the reservation and protection of open spaces in both residential and non-residential\ndevelopments located in the City of Asheville. Providing open space serves a variety of purposes, including promoting an environmental ethic by creating comfortable,\nwelcoming, accessible spaces that provide for refuge, recreation, and contemplation in an outdoor environment. Open spaces support a livable city by providing places and tree\ncover for shade, stormwater mitigation, heat island mitigation, air quality, a diversity of wildlife habitat, social opportunities, and the associated mental health benefits.\n(b) Applicability. These standards shall apply to:\n1. Major or minor subdivisions\n2. New construction meeting the threshold of a level I, II, or III development project\n(c) Exemptions. The following are exempted from open space requirements.\n1. Projects located in the following zoning districts: CBD, CBD EXP, River Arts Form District.\n2. Properties with historic landmark designations.\n3. Residential developments of seven or less units or lots\n4. Building expansions or additions that are less than 50% of the pre-expansion gross floor area.\n5. Major subdivisions that, as an alternative to providing open space, increase areas dedicated to Tree Canopy Preservation by an additional 10 percent.\n(d) General.\n1. Open space typologies.\na. Recreational open space. Open space may include active or passive recreation such as outdoor swimming pools, playgrounds, sport courts, dog parks, community gardens,\nparks, pavilions, courtyards, seating areas, outdoor dining areas, plazas or upper-level facilities such as shared or common balconies, rooftop decks or rooftop gardens.\nb. Natural open space. Up to 50% of the required open space may include naturally-occurring resources such as open water, streams, riparian areas, wetlands, forested areas,\ntree canopy preservation areas, aquatic buffers/floodplains and designated steep slope areas. In order to qualify, natural open space areas must also provide pedestrian access on a\npath that must meet the following:\ni. In addition to the path, at least one other amenity must be provided such as seating/ benches, picnic tables, or viewing platforms;\nii. The average slope of the path shall be less than 15 percent;\niii. Paths must measure at least 80% of the longest distance (length or width) of the open space or 500 feet, whichever is less.\nC. Public amenities. Land set aside for public use including greenways, sidewalks, streetscape and hardscape areas that allow for public gathering such as sidewalk cafe areas,\nareas containing public art, and similar urban amenities that measure at least 14 feet wide may be counted in their entirety.\nd. Stormwater control measures. Above ground land used for stormwater management (provided such land is not separately fenced) that is developed using stormwater green\ninfrastructure design methods and integrated into the pedestrian experience (e.g. rain gardens, bioswales, green roofs or similar features). Dry and wet detention basins, constructed\nwetlands, or similar structures that have no pedestrian access (e.g. integrated trail, bench, overlook, or other similar feature) shall not count for more than 25% of the required open\nspace.\ne. Property line buffer. Land designated as a property line buffer when providing pedestrian access and with an average slope of less than 15 percent.\n2. Designation of open space. Areas that are shown as open space shall be identified and recorded. Recorded documents may include: approved site plans, subdivision\nplats, easements, or deeds.\n3. Subdivisions. Open space shall be located on its own lot, without any homes, and commonly owned and/or deed restricted as open space.\n4. Availability. Open spaces may be restricted to owners, residents, or members of a community or organization that is related to the development for which the open\nspace was required. If the open space is designated as a public amenity, it shall be made available to the public but may be privately maintained unless otherwise agreed\nto by the city.\n5. Maintenance. The owner or lessee of the property designated as the open space shall be responsible for the maintenance of the open space area. Open space areas,\nfurniture, and required vegetation, shall be maintained in good condition and shall be kept clear of debris and graffiti. Failure to maintain the area shall constitute a violation\nof this chapter and subject the violator to the penalty provisions of section 7-18-2. Alternatively, if approved and accepted by the city, the land may be dedicated for public\nuse and thereafter maintained by the city.\n6. Open space in perpetuity. All required open space shall be maintained in perpetuity in accordance with the approved plan, unless an amendment to the plan is\napproved.\n(e) Standards. Open space shall be provided based on the following.\n1. Quantity. The amount of required open space shall be based on the total parcel area, except that for subdivisions road rights-of-way shall be subtracted.\n2. Dimensions.\na. Minimum dimension. The minimum dimension of any open space shall measure at least 10 feet in all directions, except that rooftop or balcony open spaces\nshall have a minimum dimension of seven feet in all directions.\nb. Minimum area. The minimum size of individual areas designated as open spaces shall not be less than 400 square feet.\nC.\nSetbacks. Required setbacks may be counted towards open space but shall not constitute more than 50 percent of the open space requirement.\nd.\nSubdivisions. In residential subdivisions, open spaces shall have at least one side along street frontage that measures an average of at least 40 feet wide for\na\nminimum depth of 20 feet. As an alternative, a path or trail measuring a minimum of 12 feet in width may be used to connect the street frontage to a designated\nopen space. In this alternative of a path to open space, the required open space is increased to 120 percent of the required open space and must provide\npedestrian access that shall be identified and recorded as such on the subdivision plat.\ne. Greenways. Greenways that are constructed for open space shall meet the dimensional requirements as defined in the Standards and Specifications Details\nManual (SSMD). Fee-in-lieu may be applied for greenway areas that do not provide sufficient open space on site.\nf. Contiguity. Open space should adjoin any neighboring areas of open space, tree preservation areas, or other protected areas and non-protected natural areas.\nIn addition, open space shall meet the following requirements:\ni. At least 50 percent of the required open space must be located in one contiguous area.\nii. Open spaces containing retaining walls over 18 inches in height must provide a walkable connection that is a minimum of six feet wide.\n3. Permeability. Open space areas shall not include surfaces that are more than 50 percent impervious. This shall not apply to greenways. For open space purposes,\nimpervious surfaces that drain into designated open spaces using stormwater green infrastructure techniques (e.g. disconnected impervious surfaces, infiltration strip,\nbioswale, etc.) shall be considered pervious.\nCELL (1, 1): \nDEVELOPMENT TYPE\nCELL (1, 2): \nPERCENT OPEN SPACE\nCELL (1, 3): \nPERCENT OPEN SPACE\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nLess than 1 acre\nCELL (2, 3): \n1 acre or more\nCELL (3, 1): \nSubdivisions (8+ lots)\nCELL (3, 2): \n15%*\nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (4, 1): \nMultifamily Residential\nCELL (4, 2): \n8-19 units: 10%\n20-49 units: 15%\n50+ units: 20%\nCELL (4, 3): \n50%*\nCELL (5, 1): \nNon-Residential\nCELL (5, 2): \n10%\nCELL (5, 3): \n50%*\nCELL (6, 1): \nMixed-use\nCELL (6, 2): \n10%\nCELL (6, 3): \n50%*\nCELL (7, 1): \n* See Permitted reductions, below\nCELL (7, 2): \nCELL (7, 3): \n"}, {"page": "204", "text": "4. Special open space standards.\na. Projects in the Haywood Road Form District shall be subject to the open space standards enumerated in that district alone.\nb. Projects located in the UV, NCD, and URD zoning districts shall follow the standards enumerated above in addition to the special standards identified in those\nzoning districts.\n(f) Permitted reductions of required open space. As an incentive for design alternatives providing other public benefits, the open space requirements may be reduced according\nto the options below.\n1.\nFor development projects encompassing parcels one acre or more in size, open space requirements may be reduced to the standards assigned to parcels that are\nless than one acre if either:\na. Stormwater. A project elects to meet the stormwater requirements found in Sec.7-12-2(f) or is otherwise required to meet those same requirements; in cases\nwhere the pre-development runoff coefficient value or curve number of the site is greater than 0.35 or 55, respectively, the pre-development runoff coefficient\nvalue/curve number to be applied shall be 0.35/55, or\nb. Affordable housing. The project is predominantly (at least 50 percent) residential and over 30 percent of the units meet the city's affordable housing standard of\nbeing affordable to those at or below the percentage of area median income specified in the City's Land Use Incentive (LUIG) policy with half of the affordable units\naccepting rental assistance/housing choice vouchers.\n2. Open space requirements may be reduced by five percent when meeting the following design elements:\na. Cohesion. At least 70 percent of the required open space is contiguous.\nb. Slope. All required open space shall have an average slope of less than 15 percent with at least 50 percent of the open space maintaining an average slope\nthat is five percent or less.\nC. Shape. The shape of the open space shall be rectangular with the longest dimension less than 160 percent of the shortest dimension, unless the average width\nis greater than 40 feet.\nd. Seating. Seating shall be provided for the open space. For every 250 square feet of required open space, one linear foot of seating shall be provided. Seating\nshall provide a mix of seating types, such as conventional seating with armrests and backs as well as informal seating (i.e. steps, edges of raised planters, boulders,\netc).\n3. Greenways. If any portion of the site of the proposed development is identified on the greenway master plan, and if the developer/applicant agrees to dedicate all of\nthe land necessary to complete the section of the greenway through the subject property at no cost to the City, the open space requirement may be reduced per the\nfollowing:\na. When the greenway easement is over ten percent of the site area, the open space requirement shall be satisfied.\n1.\nWhen the greenway easement is less than ten percent of the site area, additional open space shall be provided to meet a cumulative total of at least\nten\npercent, with a preference for the provision of open space to be adjacent to the greenway.\n(g) Prohibitions. In no case shall open space contain any of the following:\n1. Streets, driveways, or parking areas\n2. Above-ground utility cabinets larger than two square feet\n3. Fenced stormwater ponds\n4. Structures, other than recreation community facilities such as outdoor pools, playgrounds, and open air gazebos and pavilions\n5. Hazardous or toxic waste or materials as defined by state or federal regulations (except if covered by a city-approved mitigation plan)\n6. Overhead electric transmission lines or their rights-of-way\n7. Natural gas transmission line rights-of-way\n8. Interior parking lot planting islands\n(h) Fee-in-lieu for open space. For open space requirements of 5,000 square feet or less where the property does not contain a designated greenway as shown on the\nGreenway Master Plan, a property owner may elect to pay a fee-in-lieu of open space instead of providing the open space. In accordance with North Carolina Statutes, this fee\nshall be calculated by using the pro rata value of the designated open space based on the tax assessed value of the development or subdivision as established by Buncombe\nCounty and shall be used to acquire or develop recreation or open space areas serving residents of the development or subdivision for which the fee was collected or more than\none subdivision or development within the immediate area. For open space requirements of more than 5,000 square feet, fee in lieu may not be used to satisfy the requirements.\n(Ord. No. 2369, \u00a7 1, 5-27-97; Ord. No. 3328, \u00a7 1(I), 1-24-06; Ord.

In these instances, compliance to the maximum extent practicable is required and a\nfee is paid for the balance of sidewalk not constructed.\n(2) The sidewalk is a part of a publicly funded project that includes sidewalks and construction is scheduled to begin within two years of permitting. In this case, the\ndeveloper would pay the fee based on the public agency's design.\n(3) The total project costs are less than $100,000.00 and the cost of the construction of the sidewalk would exceed 15 percent of the total cost of the approved project.\n(4) The traffic volumes on an existing road, including any added trips expected as a result of the project, do not exceed 500 vehicles per day and the required sidewalk is\nmore than 1,320 feet (one-fourth mile) from an existing sidewalk, measured from the closest points along the road frontage.\n(5) When the sidewalk would require the relocation of multiple public utility facilities or structures.\n(6) The sidewalk would be located in a floodway and a no rise certification can not be obtained and a CLOMR cannot be approved without the requirement of purchasing\nadditional affected properties.\n(7) The sidewalk would require construction and/or grading to occur on adjacent property to connect to future sidewalk and where there is no right-of-way or easement\navailable. In these instances, compliance to the maximum extent practicable is required and a fee is paid for the balance of sidewalk not constructed. Additionally, an\neasement sufficient to provide future connections shall be provided.\nThe fee shall be based on the amounts identified in the city's Fees and Charges Manual and may be prorated based on partial compliance. In no case shall the fee in lieu of\nconstructing the sidewalk exceed 15 percent of the total cost of the approved project. The total cost of the project shall include all construction costs associated with the\nimprovement as approved by the city.\nIn the event that a fee in lieu of constructing a sidewalk is approved, the developer must provide a recorded easement if necessary for the future development of the sidewalk. All\nfees shall be paid prior to the issuance of the zoning permit and shall not transfer to future projects on the same property.\nThe developer wherever practical shall grade for the future development of a sidewalk.\n(f) Use of fees. All fees collected by the city pursuant to these provisions shall be accounted for separately from other monies, shall be expended only for the construction or\nrehabilitation of sidewalks or other pedestrian improvements in the city.\n(Ord.

Stormwater, soil erosion and sedimentation control, illicit discharge and connection ordinance.\n(a) Authority, purpose, objective, findings, jurisdiction, applicability, exemptions.\n(1) Authority: This section is adopted pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 143-214.7 and applicable rules promulgated by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission\n(NCEMC) thereunder; Session Law 2006-246; chapter 160A (Cities and Towns), article 14; chapter 160D (Local Planning and Development Regulation) article 9; section\n5 of the North Carolina Constitution; chapter 113A, article 4 (Sedimentation Pollution Control); article 21, part 6 (Floodway Regulations).\n(2) Purpose: It is the purpose of this section to comply with the federal and corresponding state stormwater discharge National Pollution Discharge Elimination System\n(NPDES) regulations; to protect, maintain and enhance the environment of the City of Asheville (City), by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control\nthe potential adverse effects of increased stormwater runoff associated with both future development and existing developed land and non-point and point source pollution\nassociated with new development and redevelopment as well as illicit discharges into municipal stormwater systems; to regulate the clearing, grading, excavation, filling\nand manipulation of the earth and the moving and storing of waters in order to control and prevent accelerated soil erosion and sedimentation; and to establish decision-\nmaking processes for development that protect the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources.\n(3) Objectives: To assure the city of the authority to take any action required by it to obtain and comply with its NPDES permit for stormwater discharges. Among other\nthings, these regulations require the city to establish legal authority which authorizes or enables the city at a minimum to:\na. Control the contribution of pollutants to the city's MS4 and receiving waters by stormwater discharges associated with residential, commercial, industrial, and\nrelated facility activity and the quality of stormwater discharged from sites of residential, commercial, industrial, and related facility activity; and\nb. Prohibit illicit discharges and illicit connections to the city's MS4 and receiving waters; and control the discharge to the city's MS4 and receiving waters, of spills,\ndumping or disposal of materials other than stormwater; and\nC. Control through intergovernmental agreements, contribution of pollutants from one municipal stormwater system to another; and\nd. Control accelerated erosion and sedimentation; and\ne. Require compliance with conditions in ordinances, permits, contracts or orders as follows:\n1. To establish and implement all inspection, surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to determine compliance and noncompliance with permit\nconditions including the prohibition of illicit discharges and illicit connections to the city's MS4 and receiving waters;\n2. To require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as\npracticable for the applicable design storm in order to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, non-point source pollution and increases in stream temperature,\nand to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats for biological/ecological function and drainage;\n3. To encourage the use of better management and site design practices, such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of\ngreen space and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable (MEP);\n4. To establish provisions for the short-term and long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural and non-structural stormwater BMPs to ensure\nthat they continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose no threat to public safety; and to minimize public and private property\ndamage resulting from erosion, sedimentation and flooding; and to regulate developments that create demand for public investment in flood control works.\n(4) Findings:\na. Stormwater runoff can have a significant adverse impact on the health, safety and general welfare of the city and on the quality of life of its citizens. These\nimpacts can be in the form of pollution to our water bodies, erosion and sedimentation, flooding and other degrading impacts.\nb. The sedimentation of streams, lakes, wetlands and other waters of this State constitute a major pollution problem.

Design storm protection: Erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices shall be planned, designed, and constructed to provide\nprotection from the calculated maximum peak rate of runoff from the ten-year storm. Runoff rates shall be calculated using the procedures in the USDA, Soil\nConservation Service's \"National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices\", or other acceptable calculation procedures. If an area has been listed on\nthe watershed overlay zone inventory by the stormwater administrator, erosion control measures for such sites or specific measures on a site shall be designed for,\nat a minimum, the 25-year storm. The watershed overlay zone inventory is available from the office of the stormwater administrator. The watershed overlay zone\ninventory shall be subject to a bi-annual review, the process and method for such a review shall be established by policy of the stormwater administrator.\nb. Innovative measures: Erosion and sedimentation measures applied alone or in combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if they are\nsufficient to prevent adverse secondary consequences. Innovative techniques and ideas will be considered and may be used following approval by the stormwater\nadministrator if it can be demonstrated that such techniques and ideas are likely to produce successful results.\nC. Watershed overlay zone: In watershed overlay zones, the following design standards shall apply:\n1. Uncovered areas in watershed overlay zones shall be limited at any time to a maximum total area of 20 acres within the boundaries of the site. Only the\nportion of the land disturbing activity within a watershed overlay zone shall be governed by this section.

Intent: Stream banks and channels downstream from any land disturbing activity shall be protected from increased degradation by accelerated erosion caused\nby increased velocity of runoff from the land disturbing activity.\nb. Performance standard: Persons engaged in land disturbing activity shall conduct such activity so that the post-construction velocity of the ten-year storm runoff\nin the receiving watercourse to the discharge point does not exceed the greater of:\n1.\nThe non-erosive velocities for the downstream channel conditions as specified in the North Carolina Erosion and Sediment Control Planning and Design\nManual, or\n2. The velocity of the ten-year storm runoff in the receiving watercourse prior to development.\nC. Acceptable management measures: Measures applied alone or in combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if there are no objectionable\nsecondary consequences. The city recognizes that the management of stormwater runoff to minimize or control downstream channel and bank erosion is a\ndeveloping technology. Innovative techniques and ideas will be considered and may be used when shown to have the potential to produce successful results.\nSome alternatives, while not exhaustive, are to:\n1. Avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including measures to promote infiltration to compensate for increased runoff from areas\nrendered impervious;\n2. Avoid increases in stormwater discharge velocities by using vegetated or roughened swales and waterways in place of closed drains and high velocity\npaved sections;\n3. Provide energy dissipaters at outlets of storm drainage facilities to reduce flow velocities to the point of discharge;\n4. Protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving cross sections and/or providing erosion-resistant lining; and\n5. Upgrade or replace the receiving device structure, or watercourse, such that it will receive and conduct the flow to a point where it is no longer subject to\ndegradation from the increased rate of flow or increased velocity.\nd. Non-applicability: This subsection pertaining to stormwater outlet protection shall not apply where the applicant can demonstrate through engineer analysis on\nthe sealed plans that stormwater discharge volumes and velocities will not create an erosion problem in the receiving watercourse.\n(5) Operations in lakes or natural watercourses: Land disturbing activity in connection with construction in, on, over, or under a lake or natural watercourse falls within the\njurisdiction of appropriate state and federal agencies, including but not limited to INCDENR-Division of Water Quality and the Army Corps of Engineers. Developers\nshould consult with the appropriate state and/or federal agencies to obtain the necessary permits and requirements. In all cases and to the maximum extent practicable,\noperations in lakes and natural watercourses shall minimize the extent and duration of disruption of the stream channel. Where relocation of a stream forms an essential\npart of the proposed activity, the relocation shall minimize unnecessary changes in the stream flow characteristics.\n(6) Uncovered areas:\na. Ground cover: Whenever land disturbing activity is undertaken on a site, the person conducting the land disturbing activity shall install erosion and\nsedimentation control devices and practices that are sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the land disturbing activity within the boundaries of the site\nduring construction upon and development of said site, and shall plant or otherwise provide a permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion after completion\nof construction or development. Provisions for a ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be accomplished within 14 days following completion of\nconstruction or development. To the maximum extent practicable, native or indigenous plant species shall be used for permanent ground cover.\nb.

Clean up requirements: When sediment is transported onto a public road surface, the road shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day. Sediment shall\nbe removed from the roads by shoveling or sweeping and transported to a sediment control disposal area. Street washing shall be allowed only after sediment is\nremoved in this manner.\nd.\nCost of clean-up by city: If the city must clean-up off-site sedimentation or mitigate other erosion related public safety and environmental hazards, the person in\nviolation will be charged for the cost of the cleanup in addition to the civil penalty. The cleanup cost shall include personnel wages, equipment usage, and related\nadministrative overhead costs. If the violator does not pay for the cleanup cost, revoked permits shall not be re-issued. Additionally, the city shall proceed in\naccordance with the enforcement provisions of this section to collect the cost of the clean up.\ne. Restoration of land and waters: The city may require a person who engaged in a land disturbing activity and failed to retain sediment generated by the activity,\nas required by NCGS 113A-57(3), to restore the waters and land affected by the failure so as to minimize the detrimental effects of the resulting pollution by\nsedimentation. This authority is in addition to any other civil penalty or equitable relief.\nf.

The stormwater administrator may require control to pre-development rates for the 25-year, 24-hour storm, if by\nusing existing watershed master plan analysis it is found that that additional flow reduction is required to protect downstream properties, natural and built drainage\nfacilities due to the additional peak flows from the 25-year 24-hour storm event.\nb. Provide extended detention for the difference between the pre-development and post development volume of the 2-year 24-hour SCS Type II design storm.\nThe increase in runoff volume must be detained between 24-hours to 72-hours. Provided that the stormwater administrator may require volume control for the\ndifference between the pre-development and post development volume of the 25-year 24-hour storm if by using existing watershed master plan analysis it is found\nthat that additional volume reduction is required to protect downstream properties, natural and built drainage facilities due to the additional runoff volumes from the\n25- year 24-hour storm event.\n(2) Standards for stormwater quality control: All development and redevelopment to which this subsection applies shall comply with the standards herein. The design of\nfacilities to accomplish these standards shall be based on procedures contained in the stormwater BMP manual or approved by the stormwater administrator.

The stormwater\nadministrator shall determine whether they will be adequate to meet the requirements of this section.\nC. Determination of adequacy; presumptions and alternatives: Stormwater treatment practices that are designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with\nthe criteria and specifications in the stormwater BMP manual will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality and quantity performance standards of this\nsection. Whenever an applicant proposes to utilize a practice or practices not designed and constructed in accordance with the criteria and specifications in the\nstormwater BMP manual, the applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that the practice(s) will satisfy the minimum water quality and quantity performance\nstandards of this section. The stormwater administrator may require the applicant to provide such documentation, calculations, and examples as necessary to\ndetermine whether such an affirmative showing is made.\n(7) Locations and dedication of BMPs, facilities and improvements:\na. Upon review and recommendation of the stormwater administrator and the director of public works, city council may approve BMPs being located within the\ncity's public rights-of-way. In determining whether to allow a BMP within a city public right-of-way, the factors to consider shall consist of, but not be limited to,\nwhether the BMP is a public benefit, the annual cost to the city to maintain the BMP, the potential liability the BMP exposes to the city, and any other related\nfactors.\nb. The city may accept dedication, subject to final approval from city council, of any existing or future BMPs and stormwater management facilities for\nmaintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this section and any other policies of the city and includes adequate and perpetual access and\nsufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance. The city may require as a condition of public acceptance, that the owner arrange\nfor funding costs associated with future maintenance of the BMP or stormwater management facility. Nothing herein shall require the city to accept maintenance of\nany BMP or stormwater management facility.\n(8) Operation and maintenance of structural BMPs:\na. Operation and maintenance agreement: The applicant or owner of a site that is required to have a structural BMP pursuant to this section must execute an\noperation and maintenance agreement prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for development or redevelopment. The form \"Operation and Maintenance\nAgreement,\" shall be provided by the office of the stormwater administrator.\nb. Content of operation and maintenance agreement: The operation and maintenance agreement shall require the property owner(s) to maintain, repair, and, if\nnecessary, reconstruct the structural BMP, and shall state the terms, conditions, and schedule of maintenance for the structural BMP, and the right of the city to\nabate a violation. Additionally, it shall grant the city a right of entry in the event the stormwater administrator has reason to believe it has become necessary to\ninspect, monitor, maintain, repair, or reconstruct the structural BMP. In no case, however, shall the right of entry confer an obligation on the city to assume\nresponsibility for the structural BMP. Additionally, the agreement shall include language to bind the parties thereto and all subsequent owners, successors and\nassigns, of the site, portions of the site, and lots or parcels served by the structural BMP.\nC. Maintenance responsibility: The final responsibility for complying with the operation and maintenance agreement provided herein remains with the property\nowner.\nd. Failure to maintain: If the owner fails to maintain the structural BMP in accordance with the operation and maintenance agreement, the city shall proceed in\naccordance with subsection 7-12-2(i). Any costs incurred by the city to abate such failure shall be recovered by the city at 120 percent of the actual cost.\ne. Recordation: The operation and maintenance agreement shall be referenced on the final plat; and if there is no final plat, then the agreement shall be\nreferenced on an as-built record drawing and also recorded in the Buncombe County Register of Deeds Office, so as to appear in the chain of title of all subsequent\npurchasers under generally accepted searching principles, at the expense of the owner/applicant prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.\nf. Deed restrictions and protective covenants: Upon conveyance of real property that is subject to or should be subject to a recorded operation and maintenance\nagreement, the property owner shall include in the deed of conveyance, deed restrictions, and protective covenants, imposing upon the new owner the\nresponsibility for maintenance of the structural BMPs. Failure to know of the existence of structural BMPs on property prior to purchase is not an excuse from\nthe\nobligation to maintain the structural BMPs. A failure to include deed restrictions and protective covenants as required by this subsection constitutes negligence per\nse.\n(g) Inspections and investigations.\n(1) City inspections:\na.

No. 2369, \u00a7 1, 5-27-97)\nSec. 7-12-4. Steep slope and ridgetop development.\n(a) Purpose. Asheville is in a unique geographic location where mountains, valleys, and hills constitute significant natural topographic features. The mountains and hillsides of\nAsheville are visible from many places in the city, adding to the quality of life for residents, and improving tourism opportunities for visitors. These areas are sensitive to\ndevelopment activities and measures must be taken to maintain slope stability and to control erosion and stormwater. In order to ensure the preservation of this character and\nthe appropriate use of the hillsides, the regulations of this section are established to recognize that development of land in steep or mountainous areas involves special\nconsiderations and unique development standards.\n(b) Goals and objectives. This section is intended to achieve the following goals and objectives:\n(1) To promote public safety by ensuring that development on steep slope and ridgetop areas addresses slope stability issues in an effective manner;\n(2) To provide greater design flexibility and efficiency in the location of development and infrastructure, including the opportunity to reduce length and width of roads,\nutility runs, and the amount of grading and paving;\n(3) To reduce erosion and sedimentation by the retention of existing vegetation, and the minimization of development on steep slopes and ridgetops;\n(4) To provide for the conservation and maintenance of steep slope and ridgetop areas within city jurisdiction to achieve the above-mentioned goals;\n(5) To provide opportunities for developers to minimize impacts on steep slope and ridgetop areas;\n(6) To provide standards reflecting the varying circumstances and interests of individual landowners, and the individual characteristics of their properties;\n(7) To preserve scenic views and vistas that are inherent to Asheville's character and to minimize perceived density by minimizing views of new development from within\nand outside of the development; and\n(8) To provide mechanisms to effectively enforce the requirements of this section.\n(c) Steep slopes and ridgetops designated.\n(1) Steep slopes are designated as those areas at or above 2,220 feet in elevation above mean sea level and having an existing grade of 15 percent or more. For the\npurpose of applying specific development standards, steep slope areas have been separated into different zones:\nZone A Areas between 2,220 and 2,349 feet in elevation and having an existing grade of 15 percent or more;\nZone B Areas at or above 2,350 feet in elevation and having an existing grade of 15 percent or more;\n(2) Ridgetops are designated on the official City of Asheville Ridgetops Map (which is hereby made a part of this section by reference). Designated ridgetops are:\nProtected mountain ridges as defined in subsection7-12-3(e) of this Code regardless of whether such ridges have been otherwise designated on maps filed in\naccordance with subsection 7-12-3(g) of this Code.\nAll land within 100 vertical feet of any ridgeline or ridgeline segment that is part of a designated watershed area containing a minimum of 100 acres and is located 500 or\nmore feet above the adjacent valley floor. If any part of a ridgeline qualifies under this definition, any segments of the same ridgeline that are of higher elevation than the\nqualifying ridgeline shall also be considered ridgetops for the purposes of this section.\n(3) For the purpose of applying the geotechnical analysis of this section, all areas having an existing grade of 36 percent or more, regardless of elevation, or are located\nin areas designated as High Hazard or Moderate Hazard on the Buncombe County Slope Stability Index Map prepared by the North Carolina Geological Survey are\nsubject to the standards set forth in subsection 7-12-4(I).\n(d) Application. The provisions of this section apply in the following circumstances. Any portion of a lot, parcel, or tract of land which has been approved for development or\nsubdivision prior to the date of adoption of this section {'{}}July 10, 2007{'}'} shall not be required to comply with the provisions of this section if no further development or change\nto\nthe approved subdivision or development plan is proposed within that portion of the lot, parcel, or tract of land. For the purpose of applying this provision, approval of a\nsubdivision plat shall not constitute approval of a development plan for the individual lots in the subdivision.\n(1) Where new development is proposed for a one or two family dwelling, or for a development requiring Level I, II or III site plan review pursuant to section-5-9 of this\nchapter or subdivision review pursuant to section 7-5-8 of this chapter.\n(2) Additions to structures greater than 1,000 square feet or new site disturbances encompassing more than 1,000 square feet of disturbed area. These additions and\nsite disturbances shall include smaller additions or disturbances over a three-year period that accumulate to exceed the above limitations.\n(3) Substantive amendments to an approved subdivision or development plan shall require full compliance with the requirements of this section. For the purpose of this\nsection, \"substantive amendments\" shall include increases in the number of lots or density or intensity of development by more than ten percent over that previously\napproved, location of a structure or structures in areas of steeper slopes than originally approved, and similar amendments that substantively increase the extent of\ndevelopment impact.\n(4) Regardless of the provisions of this section, lawfully-established lots in existence on {'{}July 10, 2007{'}'} may be developed with a single-family home provided that\nthe requirements of subsections (f), (g), (h) and (I) are met, except that subsection (f) shall not apply to such lots where extent of grading has been previously designated\nand approved on a preliminary plat or approved development plan.\n(5) For areas located in zone A, the development standards set forth in subsections (g), (h) and (k) shall not apply except that the front setback reduction specified in\nsubsection (h) is available to properties located in zone A.\n(e) Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the meaning as ascribed to them below:\nArtificial slope shall mean any land-disturbing activity that creates or changes any slope or attempts to do so.\nCut slope shall mean the exposed ground surface resulting from excavation of material.\nExisting grade shall mean the vertical elevation of the land as it exists on {'{'}July 10, 2007{'}'}.\nFill slope shall mean the exposed ground surface resulting from deposition of material.\nSlope shall mean the extent to which a land form deviates from the perfectly horizontal as expressed in percent, degree or ratio.

However, where\nmultiple water and sewer accounts exist for a single parcel, the bill for stormwater service charges may for good cause shown at the discretion of the city be sent to\nthe property owner. Additional policies concerning billing will be developed by the stormwater administrator.\nb. Owners of property may, with the consent of the city, designate each occupant of the property as the party to receive the bill for stormwater management\nservice charge by completing and properly executing a form provided by the city. Such designation shall fairly allocate the impervious surfaces actually used by the\nbilled party, and it shall be binding for the period of time specified by the city. Such transfer does not relieve either the owner or occupant from liability for\nstormwater service charges if they are not paid by the party billed.\nC.

The owner of each parcel of land containing impervious surface shall be obligated to pay\nsuch fee.\n(5) Minimum stormwater service charge: In no event will any property owner owning developed property pay less than the rate equivalent of one ERU except for zoning\nlots or tracts with 225 square feet or less of impervious surface area.\n(g) Delinquencies and charges.\n(1) Combined utility billing: Where stormwater service charges appear on a combined utility bill, and a customer does not pay the service charges for all the utilities on the\nbill, the partial payment will be prorated and applied to the respective utilities in the following order: delinquent stormwater management service charges, delinquent\nrecycling service charges, delinquent combined sewer and water charges, current stormwater charges, current recycling service charges and current combined sewer and\nwater charges.\n(2) Non-combined and/or separate stormwater utility billing:A stormwater utility fee, charge or other billing for rents, rates, fees, charges and penalties associated with\nthe stormwater utility shall be declared delinquent and subject to the delinquent fees and charges as set forth in the city's fees and charges manual.\n(3) No criminal penalty: A violation of this section subjects the offender to a civil penalty pursuant to the authority granted by N.C.G.S., sec. 160A-175 and does not\nsubject the offender to the criminal penalty provisions of N.C.G.S., sec. 14-4 and section 1-5 of chapter 1 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Asheville.\n(4) Back billing: If property is incorrectly billed, or not billed, or a bill is sent to the wrong party, the city may back bill a property for up to a three-year period.\n(h) Appeals.\n(1) Disputed bills: If a property owner disputes the stormwater utility charges assessed to that owner's property, that owner must first attempt to resolve the dispute with\nthe city engineer's office.

Revenues generated from stormwater services utility fees, charges, rents, rates and penalties shall be assigned and dedicated solely\nto the stormwater services enterprise fund in the city's budget and accounting system, which shall be and remain separate from other funds, and shall be used only to fund\nstormwater management programs and structural and natural stormwater and drainage systems. The service charges and fees paid to and collected by virtue of the provision\nof\nthis section shall not be used for general or other government or proprietary purposes of the city except to pay for costs incurred by the city in rendering services to the\nstormwater services utility.\n(j) Limitations of responsibility.\n(1) The city shall be responsible only for the portions of the drainage system which are in city maintained street rights-of-way and permanent storm drainage easements\nconveyed to and accepted by the city.\n(2) The city's acquisition of storm drainage easements and/or the construction or repair by the city of drainage facilities does not constitute a warranty against stormwater\nhazards, including but not limited to flooding, erosion or standing water.\n(Ord.

Conditional uses are uses which are generally compatible with other land uses permitted in a zoning district but which, because of their unique characteristics or\npotential impacts on the surrounding neighborhood and/or the city as a whole, require individual consideration of their location, design, configuration, and/or operation at the\nparticular location proposed. Such individual consideration may also call for the imposition of individualized conditions in order to ensure that the use is appropriate at a particular\nlocation and to ensure protection of the public health, safety, and welfare.\nAll conditional uses shall, at a minimum, meet the conditions set forth in this chapter. Any use identified as a conditional use in a zoning district shall not be permitted without the\napproval of city council.\nThe approval procedure for conditional uses is set forth in section7-5-5 of this chapter.\n(b) Conditional uses listed (by zoning district)\n(1) Historic landmark conditional use.\n(2) Reserved.\n(3) Telecommunications towers.\n(4) Telecommunication tower/support structure, concealed.\n(5) Reserved.\n(6) Reserved.\n(7) Reserved.\n(8) Adult establishments.\n(9) Those uses listed as uses by right subject to special requirements in the Montford Transition Overlay District that exceed a gross floor area of 5,000 square feet.\n(10) Reserved.\n(11) Ancillary non-residential uses in residential districts.\n(12) Detention centers, jails, and related correctional facilities.\n(13) Government buildings and uses.\n(14) Motor vehicle and boat sales, new and used.\n(15) Drive through facilities.\n(16) Group homes.\n(17) Electrified security fences.\n(c) Conditional use standards. The Asheville City Council shall not approve the conditional use application and site plan unless and until it makes the following findings, based\non the evidence and testimony received at the public hearing or otherwise appearing in the record of the case:\n(1) That the proposed use or development of the land will not materially endanger the public health or safety;\n(2) That the proposed use or development of the land is reasonably compatible with significant natural and topographic features on the site and within the immediate\nvicinity of the site given the proposed site design and any mitigation techniques or measures proposed by the applicant;\n(3) That the proposed use or development of the land will not substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property;\n(4) That the proposed use or development of the land will be in harmony with the scale, bulk, coverage, density, and character of the area or neighborhood in which it is\nlocated;\n(5)\nThat the proposed use or development of the land will generally conform with the comprehensive plan, smart growth policies, sustainable economic development\nstrategic plan, and other official plans adopted by the city;\n(6) That the proposed use is appropriately located with respect to transportation facilities, water supply, fire and police protection, waste disposal, and similar facilities;\nand\n(7) That the proposed use will not cause undue traffic congestion or create a traffic hazard.\n(d) Additional conditional use standards.\n(1) Historic landmark conditional use.\na. Use districts: All districts.\nb. Property must be designated by the city council as a historic landmark.\nC. Property owner must show that the current permitted uses or restricted uses of the property in the zoning district in which it is located are such that the property\ncannot be preserved and the granting of a conditional use permit enables its preservation.\nd. Uses which may be permitted shall be limited to uses that are not inconsistent with the design and/or uses for which the structure(s) on the property had been\ndesigned or used during the life of the structure(s).\ne. Prior to consideration of the request for the conditional use permit by the city council, the historic resources commission of the Asheville and Buncombe County\nshall submit to city council a written recommendation relative to the appropriateness of the applications being considered.\n(2) Reserved.\n(3) Telecommunication towers.\na. Use districts: Office/Business, Community Business II, Resort, Institutional, Highway Business, Regional Business Commercial Industrial, River, Industrial, Light\nIndustrial. In addition, where the city council determines that a concealed telecommunication support structure is not feasible or not an available alternative, a\ntelecommunications tower shall be allowed as a conditional use in residential districts at schools, fire stations, publicly-owned housing complexes, recreation\ncenters, community centers; provided: (i) said use is not otherwise non-conforming, (ii) the property is not subdivided for the purpose of accommodating a\ntelecommunication tower and, (iii) the application meets the standards set forth in subsections 7-16-2(c) and (d) of this chapter.\nb. The applicant for a conditional use permit for a telecommunication tower shall bear the burden of demonstrating by substantial evidence in a written record that\n"}, {"page": "270", "text": "a bona fide need exists for the proposed telecommunication tower and that no reasonable combination of locations, techniques or technologies will obviate the\nneed for, or mitigate the height or visual impact of, the proposed telecommunication tower.\nC. Application fees for a conditional use for a telecommunication tower shall be in accordance with the City of Asheville's Fees and Charges Manual.\nd.\nThe city may elect to retain outside consultants or professional services to review a conditional use application for a telecommunication tower and to make\nrecommendations on relevant issues including, but not limited to, verification of the applicant's due diligence, analysis of alternatives, conditions of approval, and\ncompliance with state and federal rules and regulations at the applicant's expense. An application shall not be deemed complete until the applicant has posted a\n$5,000.00 cash bond, or other security satisfactory to the city, guaranteeing payment of such expenses. Private business users operating a single wireless\ntelecommunication facility at their principal place of business and governmental users are exempt from the bond requirement.\ne. In addition to the notice requirements of section7-5-20 of this chapter, the applicant for a conditional use permit for a telecommunication tower shall be required\nto notify by regular mail all property owners within a one-quarter mile (1,320 feet) radius of the proposed location of any public hearing on the application at least ten\ndays prior to the hearing. The planning and development director may require the applicant to conduct a crane or balloon test to simulate the height of the proposed\ntower. Notice of the dates and times of such tests shall be mailed by the applicant to all property owners within a one-quarter mile (1,320 feet) radius of the\nproposed location at least ten days prior to the primary test date. The notice shall state primary and alternate test dates, as well as a range of dates for testing in\nthe event of extended periods of inclement weather. The planning and development director shall review and approve the sufficiency of the notice prior to mailing\nand, as part of its application, the applicant will be required to submit a certificate of mailing and attach a copy of the notice and a list of the addresses to which it\nwas sent. In the event the applicant shall seek to increase the height of a proposed tower, or move its location more than 50 feet laterally, from that stated in the\noriginal notices, additional notice shall be required to be given in accordance with the above provisions and all time periods shall run from the date of supplemental\nnotification.\nf. Applicants for telecommunication towers shall first be encouraged to consider properties owned by the city or Buncombe County, or instrumentalities thereof,\nbefore considering private properties. Public properties shall be subject to the same restrictions and standards of appropriateness as private properties. All such\npublic agencies or instrumentalities shall retain discretion as to whether to make a specific property available for wireless telecommunication facilities and to make\ndeterminations with respect to site capacity, aesthetics, or suitability of such facilities.\ng. Telecommunication towers proposed on properties under the ownership or control of the North Carolina Department of Transportation shall simulate typical\nhighway lighting towers in height and appearance and shall be clustered amongst or near such towers so as to be unobtrusive. If due to topography, existing\nvegetative canopy, or other local conditions, the city council determines that a tower disguised as a coniferous tree is a preferable aesthetic alternative to a\nsimulated lighting tower, it may require such camouflage treatment as a condition of approval. If any portion of a telecommunication tower located on such\nproperties is used to mount cameras, instruments, sensors or antennas for governmental use, and the same structure supports or incorporates commercial wireless\ntelecommunication facilities, the governmental use shall be deemed incidental or accessory to the commercial use and the entire facility shall be treated as a\ncommercial use for purposes of this section.\nh. It is the policy of the city to encourage co-location and the use of existing structures where appropriate. In furtherance of that policy objective, the following\nprovisions shall apply to an application for a conditional use permit for a telecommunication tower:\n1. A conditional use for a telecommunication tower shall not be approved unless the tower is designed structurally, electrically, mechanically and in all\nrespects to accommodate at least two additional users. An application shall not be deemed complete until the applicant submits:\na. A letter of intent agreeing to make all of its wireless telecommunication facilities (including existing facilities) within the city available to providers of\nfunctionally equivalent services at commercially reasonable rates.\nb. A copy of an executed lease for the proposed tower site that allows co-location or leasing or subleasing to other providers of functionally\nequivalent services.\n2. Applicants are encouraged to meet co-location requirements by using dual-band/multi- band antennas to allow sharing of antennas or antenna arrays by\nwireless providers using different frequency bands or by using combiners to allow antenna sharing by users of the same frequency band.\n3. A conditional use application for a telecommunication tower shall not be approved if an electric transmission tower is located above, or no less than 25\nfeet below, the ground elevation of and within the search radius of a proposed telecommunication tower, unless the applicant can demonstrate one or more\nof the following:\na. That sufficient easements or other interests in real property cannot be obtained to accommodate the wireless telecommunication facility;\nb. That the electric utility owning the electric transmission tower is unwilling to allow its use for wireless facilities;\nC. That the applicant is unable to gain sufficient ingress and egress to the electric transmission tower;\nd. That the existing use of the electric transmission tower would interfere with the operations of the applicant as documented by a qualified and\nlicensed North Carolina engineer, and the interference cannot be prevented;\ne. That the planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the electric transmission tower as documented by a qualified and licensed\nNorth Carolina professional engineer, and the electric transmission tower cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned or\nequivalent equipment at a reasonable cost.\nElectric transmission towers may be increased in height to that allowed for telecommunication towers in the district in which the electric transmission tower is\nlocated if the city council determines such height extension is preferable to placement of a new telecommunication tower in that area.\n4. A conditional use application for a telecommunication tower shall not be approved unless the equipment planned for the proposed tower cannot be\naccommodated on existing or approved towers, buildings or alternative structures more than 30 feet in height (after first considering electric transmission\ntowers) within a one-quarter mile (1,320 foot) radius of the proposed telecommunication tower due to one or more of the following reasons:\na. The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or approved tower, building or alternative structures, as documented by a\nqualified and licensed North Carolina professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower, building or structure cannot be reinforced, modified or\nreplaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost.\nb. The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment on the towers, buildings or\nalternative structures, as documented by a qualified and licensed North Carolina engineer, and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.\nC. Existing or approved towers, buildings or other structures within the search radius, or combinations thereof, cannot accommodate the planned equipment\nat a height necessary to function reasonably as documented by a qualified and licensed North Carolina professional engineer.\nd. Other unforeseen reasons that make it infeasible to locate the planned telecommunication equipment upon existing or approved towers, buildings or\nalternative structures.\n5. Antennas associated with a wireless telecommunication facility may not be co-located on a tower or other support structure used by an amateur radio\noperator.\ni. No wireless telecommunication facility shall interfere with usual and customary radio and television reception excepting broadcast facilities as provided for in the\nregulations of the FCC.\nj. All telecommunication towers must comply with FCC and FAA regulations.\nk. A copy of the applicant's FCC license must accompany its application. If the applicant is not an FCC licensee, the applicant must demonstrate that it has binding\ncommitments from one or more FCC licensees to utilize the wireless telecommunication facility and must submit a copy of each such wireless service provider's\nFCC license. If FCC licenses have previously been filed with the city in conjunction with other wireless telecommunication facilities, the applicant may certify that\nsuch licenses remain in full force and effect.\nI.\nAs part of its application, each applicant for a telecommunication tower shall be required to execute a standard maintenance/removal agreement binding the\napplicant and its successors and assigns to maintain properly the exterior appearance of and ultimately remove the facility within 180 days of the abandonment or\ncessation of operations of the facility. Such agreement shall require the applicant to pay all costs for monitoring compliance with, and enforcement of, the\nagreement and to reimburse the City of Asheville for all costs it incurs to perform any work required of the applicant by the agreement that it fails to perform.

Use districts: All zoning districts except the Central Business District. In residential districts, concealed telecommunication support structures may only be\npermitted as a conditional use at schools, places of worship, fire stations, publicly-owned housing complexes, recreation centers, community centers, or other\nproperties not used for residential purposes; provided that the existing or current use is not otherwise non-conforming, and that the property is not subdivided for\nthe purpose or accommodating a telecommunications tower.\nb. Concealed telecommunication support structures are a narrowly limited alternative means for providing wireless service to parts of the community, such as\nresidential areas, where conventional telecommunication towers would be aesthetically unacceptable. In order to encourage design creativity and to assure that\nsuch structures are in harmony with their setting, the city council shall not approve the conditional use application for a concealed telecommunication structure\nunless it finds that:\n1. The structure is a work of public art that enhances and is compatible with its surroundings; or\n2. On developed parcels, that the structure appears integral to or complements the design of any building or complex of buildings located on the same\nparcel and is not readily discernible or distinguishable as a telecommunication structure; and\n3. That the overall location, design, and configuration is appropriate to the particular proposed location.\nC. The applicant for a conditional use permit for a concealed telecommunication support structure shall bear the burden of demonstrating by substantial evidence in\na\nwritten record that a bona fide need exists for the proposed structure and that no reasonable combination of locations, techniques or technologies will obviate the\nneed for, or mitigate the height or visual impact of, the proposed structure.\nd. Application fees for a conditional use for a concealed telecommunication support structure shall be in accordance with the City of Asheville's Fees and Charges\nManual.\ne. The city may elect to retain outside consultants or professional services to review a conditional use application for a concealed telecommunication support\nstructure and to make recommendations on relevant issues including, but not limited to, verification of the applicant's due diligence, analysis of alternatives,\nconditions of approval, and compliance with state and federal rules and regulations at the applicant's expense. An application shall not be deemed complete until\nthe applicant has posted a $5,000.00 cash bond, or other security satisfactory to the city, guaranteeing payment of such expenses. Private business users\noperating a single wireless telecommunication facility at their principal place of business and governmental users are exempt from the bond requirement.\nf. In addition to the notice requirements of section 7-5-20 of this chapter, the applicant for a conditional use for a concealed telecommunication support structure\nshall be required to notify by regular mail all property owners within a one-quarter mile (1,320 feet) radius of the proposed location of any public hearing on the\napplication at least ten days prior to the hearing. The planning and development director may require the applicant to conduct a crane or balloon test to simulate the\nheight of the proposed structure. Notice of the dates and times of such tests shall be sent by the applicant by regular mail to all property owners within a one-\nquarter mile (1,320 feet) radius of the proposed location at least ten days prior to the primary test date. The notice shall state primary and alternate test dates, as\nwell as a range of dates for testing in the event of extended periods of inclement weather. The planning and development director shall review and approve the\nsufficiency of the notice prior to mailing and, as part of its application, the applicant will be required to submit a certificate of mailing and attach a copy of the notice\nand a list of the addresses to which it was sent. In the event the applicant shall seek to increase the height of a proposed structure, or move its location more than\n50 feet laterally, from that stated in the original notices, additional notice shall be required to be given in accordance with the above provisions and all time periods\nshall run from the date of supplemental notification.\ng. Applicants for a conditional use for a concealed telecommunication support structure shall first be encouraged to consider properties owned by the city or\nBuncombe County, or instrumentalities thereof, before considering private properties. Public properties shall be subject to the same restrictions and standards of\nappropriateness as private properties. All such public agencies or instrumentalities shall retain discretion as to whether to make a specific property available\nfor\nwireless telecommunication facilities and to make determinations with respect to site capacity, aesthetics, or suitability of such facilities.\nh. It is the policy of the city to encourage co-location and the use of existing structures where appropriate. In furtherance of that policy objective, the following\nprovisions shall apply to an application for a conditional use permit for a concealed telecommunication support structure:\n1. A conditional use for a concealed telecommunication support structure shall not be approved unless the tower is designed structurally, electrically,\nmechanically and in all respects to accommodate at least one additional user. An application shall not be deemed complete until the applicant submits:\na. A letter of intent agreeing to make all of its wireless telecommunication facilities (including existing facilities) within the city available to providers of\nfunctionally equivalent services at commercially reasonable rates.\nb. A copy of an executed lease for the proposed tower site that allows co-location or leasing or subleasing to other providers of functionally\nequivalent services.\n2. Applicants are encouraged to meet co-location requirements by using dual-band/multi- band antennas to allow sharing of antennas or antenna arrays by\nwireless providers using different frequency bands or by using combiners to allow antenna sharing by users of the same frequency band.\ni. A conditional use application for a concealed telecommunication support structure shall not be approved if an electric transmission tower is located above, or no\nless than 25 feet below, the ground elevation of and within a one-quarter mile (1,320 feet) radius laterally of a proposed structure, unless the applicant can\ndemonstrate that sufficient easements or other interests in real property cannot be obtained to accommodate the wireless telecommunication facility, or that the\nelectric utility owning the electric transmission tower is unwilling to allow its use for wireless facilities. Such electric transmission towers may be increased in height\nto that allowed for concealed telecommunication support structures in the district in which the transmission tower is located (other than in residential districts) if the\ncity council determines such height extension is preferable to placement of a new concealed telecommunication support structure.\nj. A conditional use application for a concealed telecommunication support structure shall not be approved unless the equipment planned for the proposed tower\n"}, {"page": "273", "text": "cannot be accommodated on existing or approved towers, buildings or alternative structures more than 30 feet in height (after first considering electric transmission\ntowers) within a one-quarter mile (1,320 foot) radius of the proposed structure due to one or more of the following reasons:\n1. The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or approved tower, building or alternative structures, as documented by a\nqualified and licensed North Carolina professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower, building or structure cannot be reinforced, modified or\nreplaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost.\n2. The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment on the towers, buildings or\nalternative structures, as documented by a qualified and licensed North Carolina engineer, and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.\n3.\nExisting or approved towers, buildings or other structures within the search radius, or combinations thereof, cannot accommodate the planned equipment\nat a height necessary to function reasonably as documented by a qualified and licensed North Carolina professional engineer.\n4. Other unforeseen reasons that make it infeasible to locate the planned telecommunication equipment upon existing or approved towers, buildings or\nalternative structures.\nk. Antennas associated with a wireless telecommunication facility may not be co-located on a tower or other support structure used by an amateur radio operator.\nI. Before approving a concealed telecommunication support structure, the city council may consider the desirability of relocating wireless facilities located on other\nstructures to the proposed new structure in order to facilitate reductions in visual impacts or the decommissioning of other structures.\nm. No wireless telecommunication facility shall interfere with usual and customary radio and television reception excepting broadcast facilities as provided for in\nthe regulations of the FCC.\nn.

Adult establishments, because of their very nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics,\nparticularly when they are located near a residential zoning district or certain other districts which permit residential, educational, religious, or recreational uses.\nStudies have shown that lower property values and increased crime rates tend to accompany and are brought about by the concentration of adult establishments.\nThe city council finds that regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects do not contribute to the blighting of surrounding neighborhoods\nand to protect the integrity of the city's residential areas, schools, places of worship, libraries, child care centers, and public parks and playgrounds which are typical\nareas in which juveniles congregate.\nTo address the purposes set forth above, the following restrictions are established:\n1.\nNo lot containing an adult establishment shall be located within a 1,000 foot radius of any lot containing another adult establishment.\n2. No lot containing an adult establishment shall be located within a 1,000 foot radius of any residential zoning district. Provided, however, the establishment\nof a residential zone subsequent to the lawful commencement of an adult establishment will not render the adult establishment non-conforming.\n3. No lot containing an adult establishment shall be located within a 1,000 foot radius of any church, school, library, licensed child care center, public\nrecreation center, or public park or playground. Provided, however, the establishment of any place of worship, school, library, licensed child care center,\npublic recreation center, or public park or playground subsequent to the lawful commencement of an adult establishment will not render the adult\nestablishment non-conforming.\n4. The required distance shall be measured from the closest edge of the property occupied by an adult establishment to the closest edge of the property\noccupied by a protected use, zone, or by another adult establishment. Provided, however, that an adult establishment is located in a multi-tenant facility,\nthe\ndistance shall be measured from the closest edge of the portion of the facility occupied by such establishment.\n5. Except for permitted business identification signage, no printed material, slide, video, photograph, written text, live show, or other visual presentation\nshall be visible, nor shall any live or recorded voices, music, or sounds be heard from outside the walls of the establishment.\n6. Any external lighting shall be arranged so as not to be directed toward any residential area.\n(9) Those uses listed as a use by right, subject to special requirements which exceed a total floor area of 5,000 square feet.\na.

Automobiles needing repair shall be stored within an enclosed building or, alternately, screened from all public rights-of-way.\ne. Lighting shall comply with the standards of the City of Asheville.\nf. If a new structure is proposed in the areas covered by the design review guidelines, the ability of the structure's design to comply with the downtown design\nreview guidelines for new construction shall be a factor in the review of the request. New structures in these areas must substantially comply with the design\nguidelines as determined by the Asheville City Council.\n(15) Drive through facilities and uses.\na. Use districts: Neighborhood Corridor.\nb. The purpose of this section is to ensure the pedestrian character and safety along the corridor are protected but allow drive through facilities at locations that\nwill not detract from the rest of the district.\nC. Drive through facilities will generally operate with a single window and will be located to the side or rear of the structure. City Council may consider other\nproposals with more than a single window for locations that are appropriate for this use.\nd. Drive through facilities shall not be placed on the street side of a building on a corner lot but shall be located to the side or rear of the structure.\ne. Outdoor speakers and lighting must be designed and used in such a way to eliminate both noise and light trespass to neighboring properties.\nf.\nHours of operation may also be limited by City Council to ensure compatibility with neighboring uses in the vicinity of the drive through.\ng. For new structures in the Neighborhood Corridor district, compliance with items in the Design and Operation Standards in article 12 of the Neighborhood\nCorridor District shall be a requirement of this conditional use review as determined by City Council.\n(16) Group homes.\na.

The\nvegetative screening shall consist of the planting required for a Type A buffer or its equivalent as determined through the alternative landscape compliance process.\nParking in the front or side of the lot may be approved by the planning and development director provided that the parking area can be adequately screened from\n"}, {"page": "276", "text": "adjacent residential uses and:\nThe topography of the site makes it difficult to access the rear of the property; or\nThe property on the opposite side of the street is developed with non-residential uses; or\nThe majority of the residential properties on both sides of the street on the block on which the proposed use is to be constructed have parking located in the front\nor side; no more than two parking spaces shall be provided in front using this option for a group home located in an RS-8 zoning district.\nd. It is the intent of these standards to ensure that group home structures resemble other residential structures in the neighborhoods where they are to be located.\nPursuant to this intent, a group home structure shall be architecturally compatible with residential structures in the area in which it is to be constructed. Architectural\ncompatibility shall be determined based upon compliance with the following standards:\nThe structure shall be oriented on the lot in a manner similar to the residential structures on both sides of the street on the block on which it is to be constructed.\nIn the RS-8 district, the structure shall have a single front entrance and any other entrances as required under various codes shall be located on the side(s) or rear\nof the structure. A corner side of the structure may have a single entrance provided the intent of this section is met.\nThe height of the structure shall be no more than four feet taller than the height of the tallest residential structure located on the side of the street on the block on\nwhich the proposed use is to be constructed.\nThe roof design, pitch and materials proposed for the structure shall be similar to the roof design, pitch and materials of the residential structures on both sides of\nthe street on the block on which it is to be constructed.\nA front porch shall be provided on the proposed structure if a majority of the residential structures on both sides of the street on the block on which the new\nstructure is proposed have front porches.\nUnless precluded by topography, the front yard depth for the proposed structure shall be not less than the average front yard depth for the residential structures on\nthe same side of the street on the block on which the new construction is proposed.\nIn RS-8 districts, the floor area of the group home structure shall not be more than 150 percent larger than the average floor area of single-family residential\nstructures in the same block of the group home structure unless this floor area is provided below the grade of the principal fa\u00e7ade of the group home structure or is\notherwise designed to minimize its difference in size with said residences.\ne. It is the intent of this section that group home uses will be located in areas where employment, goods, and services can readily be reached by a variety of\nmeans of transportation. Transit, a sidewalk network, and/or close proximity to employment, goods, and services shall be required for approval of a conditional use\npermit for a group home unless the intended residents of the group home do not require this service.\nf. The group home structure(s) and the site on which it is located shall be maintained in accordance with standards established by applicable local and state\nregulations, including, but not limited to, the City of Asheville Minimum Housing Code. The City Council may require the submittal and implementation of a specific\nmaintenance plan in order to ensure proper maintenance of the property in accordance with this provision.\"\ng. That the definition of group home in section7-2-5 be amended to read: Group home means a residential home provided by an agency, organization or individual\nfor persons who need sheltered living conditions for rehabilitation, but not including mentally ill persons who are dangerous to others as defined in N.C. Gen. Stat.\nsec. 122C-3(11)b (or its successor). This definition does not include family care home as defined herein.\n(17) Electrified security fences.\na. Use districts: Commercial Industrial.\nb.

XVII, \u00a7\u00a7 17-1-7-17-9 in their entirety. Former Art. XVII, \u00a7\u00a7 7-17-1-7-17-9, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from\nOrd. No. 2428, 23-25 adopted Nov. 11, 1997; Ord. No. 2369, 1, adopted May 27, 1997; Ord. No. 3156, \u00a7 1, adopted Aug. 24, 2004; and Ord. No. 3417, \u00a7\u00a7 1(f), (g), adopted Nov. 28,\n2006.\nSec. 7-17-1. Nonconformities-Purpose application and definitions.\n(a) Purpose. It is recognized that, over time, lawful nonconformities may develop as a result of amendments to the zoning map or unified development ordinance which change\nthe\napplication of city development regulations to particular properties. It is important that such properties, while nonconforming, be adequately maintained and permitted to\ncontinue, but not expanded or enlarged in any fashion that increases the extent of nonconformity. Where possible, such nonconformities should be made, wholly or\nincrementally, conforming.\n(b) Application. The provisions of this section apply only to lawful nonconformities, except as noted below. Nonconformities other than lawful nonconformities shall be\nconsidered violations of the unified development ordinance. This article shall not apply, however, to any feature which is the subject of a variance from particular regulations that\nhas been granted by an authorized reviewing board or commission or to applications of flexible development standards to such features. Where a variance or flexible\ndevelopment determination has been granted for a feature which does not otherwise conform to the requirements of this chapter, that feature shall be deemed conforming.\nNonconformities associated with signs are addressed in section 7-13-8 of this chapter.\n(c) Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have the meaning ascribed to them below:\n(1) Appraised value means the value assigned to a structure by the Buncombe County Tax Assessor or by an MAl-certified real estate appraiser.\n(2) Dimensional nonconformity means any lawful nonconformity involving a dimensional or numerical development requirement except those involving signs or\nlandscaping and buffering which are addressed in article XIII and section 7-11-3, respectively. Dimensional nonconformities may include, without limitation,\nnonconformities associated with lot size, lot width, lot depth, lot coverage setbacks, impervious surface standards, open space, number of parking spaces, or separation\nrequirements between particular uses or zoning districts, and structure size and placement standards including height, gross floor area, footprint area, number of stories,\nbuild-to zone, fenestration, step-back and building frontage.\n(3) Impact means the effect of one land use upon another as measured by traffic or noise generation, site activity, hours of operation, site lighting, vibration, smoke or\nodor emissions, or similar factors.\n(4) Lawful nonconformity means any nonconformity involving a dimensional or numerical requirement or use of property that affects a structure erected or a lot created in\nconformity with the then-applicable development requirements of the city, but subsequently made nonconforming by action of the city through a zoning map or unified\ndevelopment code amendment. For non-construction related purposes such as but not limited to, financing, appraisals, or zoning verification, a lawful nonconformity shall\nbe regarded as conforming.\n(5) Nonconforming use means a nonconformity involving the use of the property when that use was lawfully established. This may include, without limitation,\nnonconformities associated with a use not permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, a use conditionally allowed in the zoning district in which it is located but for\n"}, {"page": "277", "text": "which no conditional use permit has been obtained, or residential density that exceeds the maximum permitted in the zoning district in which it is located.\n(6) Renovation means the repairing or remodeling of a structure in which the exterior walls, foundation and roof are maintained structurally intact.\n(d) Expansions. A lawful nonconformity shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged or increased in any manner that would increase either the degree of the dimensional\nnonconformity, or the extent or intensity of the lawfully established nonconforming use. Such prohibited activity shall include, without being limited to:\n(1) A physical addition to, or expansion of, a structure that creates a new, or increases the extent of an existing, dimensional nonconformity;\n(2) An extension or transference of a nonconforming use into new construction including separate buildings, building additions, or expansions;\n(3) An extension of the use within an existing structure to any floor area not occupied by the use at the time that it became nonconforming;\n(4) An expansion to any outdoor areas used in direct support of a nonconforming use beyond the limits existing at the time that the use became nonconforming.\n(Ord. No. 3478, \u00a7 1, 5-22-07; Ord. No. 4855, \u00a7\u00a7 1(i), (j), 2-23-21; Ord. No. 4404, \u00a7 1g, 9-28-21)\nSec. 7-17-2. Dimensional nonconformities.\n(a) Lawfully established nonconforming lots. Lawfully established nonconforming lots having one or more dimensional nonconformities may be used for any permitted or\nconditional use allowed in the zoning district in which the lot is located provided that any structure or expansion/addition to an existing structure proposed for the use meets\nall\napplicable dimensional and numerical requirements and all applicable procedures are followed. Such lots may be recombined with adjoining lots to increase the extent of their\nconformity provided new nonconformities are not created. A lot that that is only nonconforming due to the fact that it does not comply with access standards can be developed\nwith one single-family residence and typical residential accessory structures if some form of legal access is provided the property.\n(b) Structures. Structures having one or more dimensional nonconformities may be used for any permitted or conditional use allowed in the zoning district in which the structure\nis located, and, upon any change in use, shall comply with the requirements of article XI of this chapter. Such structures may be expanded or enlarged provided the extent of the\napplicable nonconformity is not increased or new nonconformities are not created. Expansions, enlargements, or reconstruction of such structures exceeding 50 percent of the\npre- expansion floor area, shall require such structures to meet all applicable dimensional and numerical requirements, except density, which may be retained at the prior\nnonconforming level but not increased. For the purpose of this section, the value of any expansion, enlargement, or reconstruction of such structures over a three-year period\nshall be used when calculating the 75 percent threshold. A structure undergoing renovation, as defined in section 7-17-1 above, shall not be subject to the above provisions and\nshall only be required to meet the provisions of article XI if the renovation cost exceeds 75 percent of the structure's appraised value as determined by Buncombe County Tax\nAssessor or by an MAl-certified real estate appraiser.\n(c) Overcoming presumption of discontinuation of use. A presumption that a nonconforming use of structure has ceased, based solely on the length of time the structure has\nremained vacant or inactive, may be rebutted if the structure has not been vacant for more than two years. Such a presumption may be overcome, upon demonstrating that\nsubstantial good faith efforts have been made to re-establish the use during this period. Obtaining permits to maintain the existing use or providing documentation that shows\ncontinuous marketing of the property for sale or lease for the existing use (e.g. MLS listing, realtor contract, etc.) shall be regarded as substantial good faith efforts.\n(Ord. No. 3478, \u00a7 1, 5-22-07; Ord. No. 3791, \u00a7\u00a7 1h, i, 9-22-09)\nSec. 7-17-3. Nonconforming uses.\n(a) Discontinuation of nonconforming uses. A nonconforming use is allowed to continue unless the use is discontinued for a period of 180 or more consecutive days, and there\nare no substantial good faith efforts to re-establish the use during this period. Obtaining permits to maintain the existing use or significant continuous efforts to market the\nproperty for sale or lease for the existing use (e.g., MLS listing, realtor contract, etc.) shall be regarded as substantial good faith efforts. A nonconforming use shall be deemed\ndiscontinued after a period of 365 consecutive days regardless of any substantial good faith efforts to re- establish the use. Thereafter, the structure or property associated with\nthe use may be used only for conforming use. Conditional uses discontinued for a period of 365 or more consecutive days shall be regarded as nonconforming uses and shall not\nbe re-established without new conditional use permit approval.\n(b) Replacement of one nonconforming use with another nonconforming use.A nonconforming use may be allowed to be replaced by another nonconforming use of equal or\nlesser impact as provided in subsection (c) below. For uses not listed below, a nonconforming use may be allowed to be replaced by another nonconforming use upon a finding\nby the planning and zoning commission that the proposed use is more nearly compatible with the surrounding properties than the nonconforming use which it replaces, as\nmeasured by traffic or noise generation, site activity, hours of operation, and other factors that the commission finds relevant to compare or differentiate between the existing\nuse(s) and the proposed replacement use(s). The planning and development director or commission, as applicable, may establish conditions to ensure that the compatibility\nfactors are maintained as approved.\n(c) Land use impact table. See Table of Permitted Usesunder columns labeled \"Land Use Impact\" at section7-8-1(d) for a list of land uses and their associated impacts.\n(d) Overcoming presumption of discontinuation of use. A presumption that a nonconforming use of the land has ceased, based solely on the length of time the use of the land\nhas remained vacant or inactive, may be rebutted if the use of the land has not ceased for more than two years. Such a presumption may be overcome, upon demonstrating that\nsubstantial good faith efforts have been made to re-establish the use during this period. Obtaining permits to maintain the existing use or providing documentation that shows\ncontinuous marketing of the property for sale or lease for the existing use (e.g. MLS listing, realtor contract, etc.) shall be regarded as substantial good faith efforts.\n(e) Conforming uses becoming nonconforming. No use may be established if it renders another conforming use to become nonconforming.\n(f) Nonconforming short-term vacation rentals. All lawfully existing nonconforming lodging facilities which would now be classified as a \"short-term vacation rental\" may continue\nin operation until such time that the lodging use is discontinued for a period greater than 180 consecutive days. In addition, the short-term vacation rental annual permit will be\nrequired for all nonconforming short-term vacation rentals and failure to renew said permit before its expiration will also constitute a conclusory presumption that the lawful\nnonconformity has ceased for more than 180 consecutive days, and will result in the voluntary forfeiture of all rights and claims to operate a short-term vacation rental at the\naddress noted on the permit under this provision.\n(Ord. No. 3478, \u00a7 1, 5-22-07; Ord. No. 3700, \u00a7 1o, 2-10-09; Ord. No. 3791, \u00a7 1j, 9-22-09; Ord. No. 3793, \u00a7 1f, 9-22-09; Ord. No. 4448, \u00a7 1c, 9-8-15; Ord.

In the interest of the public safety and health, structural alterations or renovations of lawfully nonconforming structures, conforming structures on lawfully\nnonconforming lots, or conforming structures devoted in whole or in part to a lawfully established nonconforming use, which are required by any public law, and so ordered by a\npublic officer in authority, shall be permitted.\n(b) Ordinary repair and maintenance. Routine maintenance and incidental repair or replacement shall be permitted for lawfully nonconforming structures provided that the repair\nor maintenance shall neither create a new nonconformity, nor increase the degree of the existing nonconformity.
