FINDINGS.\nThe General Assembly recognizes that local government approval of development\ntypically follows significant investment in site evaluation, planning, development\ncosts, consultant fees, and related expenses. The General Assembly finds that it is\nnecessary and desirable to provide for the establishment of certain vested rights in\norder to ensure reasonable certainty, stability, and fairness in the development\nregulation process, to secure the reasonable expectations of landowners, and to foster\ncooperation between the public and private sectors in land-use planning and\ndevelopment regulation. The provisions of this section strike an appropriate balance\nbetween private expectations and the public interest.\nB. PERMIT CHOICE.\nIf an application made in accordance with local regulation is submitted for a\nPage 21\n"}, {"page": "22", "text": "development approval required pursuant to this Chapter and a development\nregulation changes between the time the application was submitted and a decision is\nmade, the applicant may choose which version of the development regulation will\napply to the application. If the development permit applicant chooses the version of\nthe rule or ordinance applicable at the time of the permit application, the\ndevelopment permit applicant shall not be required to await the outcome of the\namendment to the rule, map, or ordinance prior to acting on the development permit.\nThis section applies to all development approvals issued by the State and by local\ngovernments. The duration of vested rights created by development approvals is as\nset forth in subsection D. of this section.\nC. PROCESS TO CLAIM VESTED RIGHT.\nA person claiming a statutory or common law vested right may submit information\nto substantiate that claim to the zoning administrator or other officer designated by\na development regulation, who shall make an initial determination as to the existence\nof the vested right. The decision of the zoning administrator or officer may\nbe\nappealed under G.S. 160D-405. On appeal, the existence of a vested right shall be\nreviewed de novo. In lieu of seeking such a determination, a person claiming a vested\nright may bring an original civil action as provided by G.S. 160D-405(c).\nD. TYPES AND DURATION OF STATUTORY VESTED RIGHTS.\nExcept as provided by this section and subject to subsection B. of this section,\namendments in local development regulations shall not be applicable or enforceable\nwith regard to development that has been permitted or approved pursuant to this\nChapter SO long as one of the types of approvals listed in this subsection remains\nvalid and unexpired. Each type of vested right listed in this subsection is defined by\nand is subject to the limitations provided in this section. Vested rights established\nunder this section are not mutually exclusive. The establishment of a vested right\nunder this section does not preclude the establishment of one or more other vested\nrights or vesting by common law principles. Vested rights established by local\ngovernment approvals are as follows:\n1.\nSix months - Building permits. - Pursuant to G.S. 160D-1109, a building permit\nexpires six months after issuance unless work under the permit has commenced.\nBuilding permits also expire if work is discontinued for a period of 12 months\nafter work has commenced.\n2. One year - Other local development approvals. - Pursuant to G.S. 160D-403(c),\nunless otherwise specified by statute or local ordinance, all other local\ndevelopment approvals expire one year after issuance unless work has\nsubstantially commenced. Expiration of a local development approval shall not\naffect the duration of a vested right established under this section or vested rights\nestablished under common law.\n3. Two to five years - Site-specific vesting plans.\n(a) Duration. - A vested right for a site-specific vesting plan shall remain vested\nfor a period of two years. This vesting shall not be extended by any\namendments or modifications to a site-specific vesting plan unless\nexpressly provided by the local government. A local government may\nprovide that rights regarding a site-specific vesting plan shall be vested for\nPage 22\n"}, {"page": "23", "text": "a period exceeding two years, but not exceeding five years, if warranted by\nthe size and phasing of development, the level of investment, the need for\nthe development, economic cycles, and market conditions, or other\nconsiderations. This determination shall be in the discretion of the local\ngovernment and shall be made following the process specified for the\nparticular form of a site-specific vesting plan involved in accordance with\nsub-subdivision C. of this subdivision.\n(b)\nRelation to building permits. - A right vested as provided in this subsection\nshall terminate at the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to\nbuildings and uses for which no valid building permit applications have\nbeen filed. Upon issuance of a building permit, the provisions of G.S. 160D-\n1109 and G.S. 160D-1113 shall apply, except that the permit shall not expire\nor be revoked because of the running of time while a vested right under this\nsubsection exists.\n(c)\nRequirements for site-specific vesting plans. - For the purposes of this\nsection, a \"site-specific vesting plan\" means a plan submitted to a local\ngovernment pursuant to this section describing with reasonable certainty the\ntype and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of property. The\nplan may be in the form of, but not be limited to, any of the following plans\nor approvals: a planned unit development plan, a subdivision plat, a site\nplan, a preliminary or general development plan, a special use permit, a\nconditional zoning, or any other development approval as may be used by a\nlocal government. Unless otherwise expressly provided by the local\ngovernment, the plan shall include the approximate boundaries of the site;\nsignificant topographical and other natural features affecting development\nof the site; the approximate location on the site of the proposed buildings,\nstructures, and other improvements; the approximate dimensions, including\nheight, of the proposed buildings and other structures; and the approximate\nlocation of all existing and proposed infrastructure on the site, including\nwater, sewer, roads, and pedestrian walkways. What constitutes a site-\nspecific vesting plan shall be defined by the relevant development\nregulation, and the development approval that triggers vesting shall be SO\nidentified at the time of its approval. At a minimum, the regulation shall\ndesignate a vesting point earlier than the issuance of a building permit. In\nthe event a local government fails to adopt a regulation setting forth what\nconstitutes a site-specific vesting plan, any development approval shall be\nconsidered to be a site-specific vesting plan. A variance shall not constitute\na site-specific vesting plan and approval of a site-specific vesting plan with\nthe condition that a variance be obtained shall not confer a vested right\nunless and until the necessary variance is obtained. If a sketch plan or other\ndocument fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type and intensity\nof use for a specified parcel or parcels of property, it may not constitute a\nsite-specific vesting plan.\n(d)\nProcess for approval and amendment of site-specific vesting plans. - If a\nsite-specific vesting plan is based on an approval required by a local\ndevelopment regulation, the local government shall provide whatever notice\nPage 23\n"}, {"page": "24", "text": "and hearing is required for that underlying approval. If the duration of the\nunderlying approval is less than two years, that shall not affect the duration\nof the site-specific vesting plan established under this subdivision. If the\nsite-specific vesting plan is not based on such an approval, a legislative\nhearing with notice as required by G.S. 160D-602 shall be held. A local\ngovernment may approve a site-specific vesting plan upon such terms and\nconditions as may reasonably be necessary to protect the public health,\nsafety, and welfare. Such conditional approval shall result in a vested right,\nalthough failure to abide by its terms and conditions will result in a\nforfeiture of vested rights. A local government shall not require a landowner\nto waive vested rights as a condition of developmental approval. A site-\nspecific vesting plan shall be deemed approved upon the effective date of\nthe local government's decision approving the plan or such other date as\ndetermined by the governing board upon approval. An approved site-\nspecific vesting plan and its conditions may be amended with the approval\nof the owner and the local government as follows: any substantial\nmodification must be reviewed and approved in the same manner as the\noriginal approval; minor modifications may be approved by staff, if such\nare defined and authorized by local regulation.\n4. Seven years - Multiphase developments. - A multiphase development shall be\nvested for the entire development with the zoning regulations, subdivision\nregulations, and unified development ordinances in place at the time a site plan\napproval is granted for the initial phase of the multiphase development. This right\nshall remain vested for a period of seven years from the time a site plan approval\nis granted for the initial phase of the multiphase development. For purposes of this\nsubsection, \"multiphase development\" means a development containing 100 acres\nor more that (i) is submitted for site plan approval for construction to occur in\nmore than one phase and (ii) is subject to a master development plan with\ncommitted elements, including a requirement to offer land for public use as a\ncondition of its master development plan approval.\n5. Indefinite - Development agreements. - A vested right of reasonable duration\nmay be specified in a development agreement approved under Chapter 160D of\nthe N.C.G.S.\nE. CONTINUING REVIEW.\nFollowing approval or conditional approval of a statutory vested right, a local\ngovernment may make subsequent reviews and require subsequent approvals by the\nlocal government to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original\napproval, provided that such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the\noriginal approval. The government may revoke the original approval for failure to\ncomply with applicable terms and conditions of the original approval or the\napplicable local development regulations.\nF. EXCEPTIONS.\nThe provisions of this section are subject to the following:\n1. A vested right, once established as provided for by subdivision 3. or 4. of\nsubsection D. of this section, precludes any zoning action by a local government\nPage 24\n"}, {"page": "25", "text": "that would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the\ndevelopment or use of the property as set forth in an approved vested right, except\nwhen any of the following conditions are present:\n(a) The written consent of the affected landowner.\n(b) Findings made, after notice and an evidentiary hearing, that natural or man-\nmade hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected,\nwould pose a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare if the\nproject were to proceed as contemplated in the approved vested right.\n(c)\nThe extent to which the affected landowner receives compensation for all\ncosts, expenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but\nnot limited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all\narchitectural, planning, marketing, legal, and other consulting fees incurred\nafter approval by the local government, together with interest as is provided\nin G.S. 160D-106.

EFFECT OF DENIAL BY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS\n1. A petition for amendment to the ordinance or for the rezoning of property that has\nbeen denied in whole or in part or has been approved to a higher classification (as\ndefined in Chapter 5) than the one originally requested may not be resubmitted\nwithin six months of the date of action on the original request. However, the\nBoard of Commissioners may choose to allow a re-application if, after a report\nfrom the Planning Board, it determines that there have been substantial changes\nin conditions or circumstances which may relate to the request.\n2.

AUTHORITY\nThe Town may establish conditional zoning districts in accordance with N.C.G.S. \u00a7\n160D-703.\nB. PURPOSE\nOccasionally an owner of a property proposes a specific use for his property that may\nbe a permitted or special use within a specified zoning district and may be compatible\nwith surrounding properties and the comprehensive plan, but other permitted or\nspecial uses in the specified zoning district are not equally compatible. In order to\naccommodate this situation, this section establishes the Conditional Zoning District\nprocess. The process allows the Town of Cedar Point Board of Commissioners to\napprove a rezoning proposal for a specific use within a zoning district with\nreasonable conditions to assure the compatibility of this use with surrounding\nproperties. Any use permitted under this process must also conform to the\ndevelopment regulations for the corresponding specific zoning district.

Recently proposed developments include buildings which are\nmore massive with large big-box stores and expansive parking areas.\nThese developments have lost the human, intimate scale of Cedar Point.\nMany techniques in this regulation provide tools for allowing large\nPage 77\n"}, {"page": "78", "text": "development while reducing their perceived massiveness. While the\nfootprint of new commercial development may remain large, massing\nand organization of building forms can help to retain the human scale of\nCedar Point. There is a difference between massively scaled buildings\nand monumentally scaled buildings. Monumental buildings still relate to\nthe human scale but are carefully made larger to exhibit a sense of\nimportance. Buildings such as churches and institutional buildings are\noften built with this kind of scale in mind. Massive buildings are simply\nhuge buildings that dwarf and are not intended to relate to human scale.\nAirplane hangars, for instance, relate to the scale of an airplane and are\ntherefore massive. When large retail stores become as massive as an\nairplane hangar, they lose their relationship to the human user and feel\nunfriendly.\na. Use techniques to reduce the perceived mass of large buildings.\nWhen making transitions to lower density areas, modulate the mass\nof the building to relate to smaller buildings. Heights can be greater\nif the mass is modulated and other scale techniques are adopted.\nReduce height near low density uses.\nb. Use building mass appropriate to the site. Place buildings of the\ngreatest footprint, massing, and height in activity center core areas\nor at the heart of office developments where the impact on adjacent\nuses is the least.\nC. Floor-to-floor heights of a building can have an impact on the mass\nof a building. For instance, typical ceiling heights in a residence are\n8-9 feet. First floors of office buildings or retail shops can range\nfrom 10-15 feet. Upper floors that include residential or office are\ngenerally 8-12 feet in height. Big-box retailers may have floor to\nceiling heights exceeding 15 feet. When actual or implied floor-to-\nfloor heights exceed these dimensions on the exterior, then a\nbuilding may begin to read more massive than human scaled. When\narticulating large buildings, keep these dimensions in mind.\niii.\nBuilding Size Limitations:\nParcels within the Cedar Point Business Overlay District shall be limited\nto only one commercial structure not to exceed 50,000 square feet of\ntotal structural building area, whether on one floor or multiple floors,\nincluding all attached portions, on any single parcel of land to serve as\nthe principal structure. Any additional buildings on a single lot shall\nfollow the requirements of the underlying zoning district.\niv.\nBuilding Elements and Materials:\nThis section addresses the design elements that impact the exterior\nappearance of a building including:\nroof form and articulation;\nfacade articulation;\narchitectural details;\nmaterials and textures; and\nPage 78\n"}, {"page": "79", "text": "color.\nThese elements contribute to a human scale and provide an interesting\nand coherent architectural character to the Town. Over-scaled features,\nhaphazard designs, and bland use of materials can undermine the overall\ncharacter and quality of the community. Applicants are required to\nsubmit color renderings, color elevation drawings or color photographs\nwith the site plan which must be approved by the Planning Board prior\nto issuance of a development permit.\na. Use designs that contribute to a human scale.\n(1) Avoid large expanses of blank walls where pedestrian\nmovement is desired.\n(2) Avoid oversized design elements.\n(3) Include human-scale elements, particularly at street level\nand on facades with a pedestrian focus.\nb. As appropriate, establish a design theme to give a distinctive\ncharacter to a specific area.\n(1) Establish design themes at the core of Activity Centers that:\nhave a palette of materials, forms and features; create a\ncoordinated but inviting mix of buildings and spaces; and\nestablish a unique identity for each activity center.\n(2) Establish design themes for office and industrial parks.\n(3) These types of developments can take on a \"campus\"\nappearance where roof forms, building heights, materials,\nand details such as windows all relate more closely to one\nanother, creating a very unified appearance.\nC. Provide attractive facade treatments on any elevation that is\nvisible from streets or from any primary elevations of adjoining\ndevelopments. Use the same materials for all building elevations.\nAvoid blank walls on elevations facing arterials and collector\nstreets.\nd. Balance repetition of design elements with room for individuality.\n(1) Similar setbacks and spacing can create a similar character\nwhile allowing diversity among building designs.\n(2)\nUse repetitive design elements enough to provide continuity\nbut avoid having more than two to three identical buildings\nin a row.\n(3) Provide opportunities for different colors or other individual\ndesign elements.\n(4) Consider using different styles, but similar scale, quality of\nconstruction, and siting.\ne.\nWhen making transitions between developments, avoid jarring\ncontrasts in materials or building styles.\nf. Strive for designs and materials that reflect the architectural\ntraditions of the region such as gable roofs, brick and siding.\ng.\nUse roof forms that complement the building design and contribute\nto a human scale.\nPage 79\n"}, {"page": "80", "text": "(1) An articulated roof adds visual interest and human scale.\nAvoid a monolithic expanse of roof on large-scale buildings.\nBreak the roof mass with elements such as gables, dormers,\nor parapets.\n(2)\nSteeper forms are associated with more traditional design\nand can be appropriate in and near neighborhoods.\nh. Architectural details are important tools to create human scale and\narchitectural character. Techniques include highlighting\nfoundations, lintels, sills and cornices with contrasting materials\nand breaking up the mass of the building with bands at floor levels\nor projections at entries. These techniques are only a few of the\nways to transform a massive building into one of human scale.\nConsider the facade design of all buildings; even service buildings\ncan have attractive facades.\ni.\nThe choice of materials and texture has great visual significance.\nUsing different materials for such features as foundations, quoins,\ncornices, and window lintels can add eye catching details. In\naddition, coordinating materials within a development can tie\ntogether buildings of different sizes, uses, and forms. Modern\nconstruction materials offer choices that can provide many\ndifferent looks and textures.\n(1) Use material changes to help reduce mass and provide visual\ninterest.\n(2) Choose materials that offer texture and avoid monotonous\nsurfaces. For example, use wood or brick or stone, or new\nsynthetic materials that approximate the look and dimension\nof these materials. Use these quality materials on all visible\nsides of commercial, office and residential buildings. Avoid\nprefabricated building types except in industrial parks.\n(3) Choose roof materials that contribute texture, patterns, and\ncolor. Standing-seam metal roofs give a traditional feel.\nAsphalt shingles are offered in a wide variety of styles and\ncolors and can approximate many different looks, even slate.\n(4) Use consistent materials on all sides of a building.\nj.\nColor is an integral element of the overall design. Brick, concrete,\nand stone will have an inherent color, created by nature or during\nthe manufacturing process. Other surfaces will get their color from\napplied materials such as paint. Awnings provide another\nopportunity for color.\nk. A coordinated palette of colors should be created for each\ndevelopment. This palette should be compatible with adjacent\ndevelopments.\n(1) Set the color theme by choosing the color for the material\nwith the most area. If there is more roof than wall area in a\ndevelopment, roof color will be the most important color\nchoice and will set the tone for the rest of the colors.\nPage 80\n"}, {"page": "81", "text": "(2) Limit the number of color choices. Generally, there is a wall\ncolor, trim color, accent color, and roof color.\n(3)\nUse natural tints of materials such as reds, browns, tans,\ngrays, and greens as primary colors. Save bright accent\ncolors for awnings and signs on commercial buildings.\nBrighter palettes of colors can be employed on residential\nbuildings.\n(4) Use color variation to break up the mass of a building and\nprovide visual interest.\n(h)\nTraffic Impact Analysis Requirement: A Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA)\nshall be required for commercial/industrial type developments proposed\nwithin Town of Cedar Point's Central Business Overlay District with an\nestimated trip generation of 3,000 vehicles per day or greater during an\naverage weekday based on a five-day national average as defined in the\nInstitute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual.

REQUIREMENTS\nAny new use of land shall provide a buffer if required by this chapter in accordance\nwith the following provisions:\n1. At a minimum, fifty (50) percent of the number of plants shall be locally adapted,\nlive evergreen tree species that are a minimum height of three (3) feet and one (1)\ninch in diameter measured at one-half (1/2) foot above grade when planted and\nare expected to reach or exceed the specified height in the required time period.\nThe remainder of the buffer may be live forbs and shrubs that are a minimum\nheight of one and one-half 1/2) feet when planted and expected to reach or\nexceed the specified height in the required time period.\n2. In the event that existing vegetation of the width required by the Buffer Table in\nsubsection J is of sufficient density to create an effective buffer, and such\nvegetation is left in an undisturbed natural state, the Board may approve the use\nof that natural vegetation to satisfy the requirements of the buffer prescribed for\nthat location.\nE.

PRESERVATION OF EXISTING VEGETATION\nFor uses that are required to install buffers in accordance with the provisions of this\nchapter, the number of trees, forbs, and shrubs required within the buffer may be\nreduced through the preservation of significant specimens of existing native\nvegetation in accordance with the following provisions:\n1. Areas designated for the preservation of existing vegetation shall contain\nexamples of significant native vegetation, which may include clusters of live oaks,\nwax myrtle, yaupon, bayberry, or pine species. Areas designated for the\npreservation of existing vegetation shall be left undisturbed and in their natural\nstate; however, invasive species, weeds, vines and similar ground vegetation\nshould be removed, provided that no land-disturbing activity occurs and that the\nleaf litter, mulch, topsoil and similar material are left undisturbed.\n2. The cumulative number of trees, forbs, and shrubs required by this section may\nbe reduced by preserving a percentage of the area of the site in its natural state.\nThe reduction schedule shall be as follows:\n(a) If ten (10) percent of the area of the site is left undisturbed and in its natural\nstate, the required number of planting material may be reduced by twenty\n(20) percent.\n(b) If twenty (20) percent of the area of the site is left undisturbed and in its\nnatural state, the required number of planting material may be reduced by\nthirty-five (35) percent.\n(c)\nIf thirty (30) percent of the area of the site is left undisturbed and in its\nnatural state, the required number of planting material may be reduced by\nfifty (50) percent.\n3. In no case may the required amount of buffering be reduced by more than fifty\n(50) percent.\n4. Areas designated for the preservation of existing vegetation shall be marked on\nthe site and inspected by the Town Manager or his/her designee prior to planning\nboard review to ensure that the provisions of this subsection can be met.\n5. If at any time the developer/owner desires to make a change in the percentage of\nsite area designated for the preservation of existing vegetation, the\ndeveloper/owner shall first receive written approval from the Town Manager or\nhis/her designee, and the site plan for the development shall be amended, and\napproved by the Town Manager or his/her designee, to reflect the percentage of\nland diverted to the preservation of existing vegetation and the amount of required\nnew buffering.\nG.

Utility lines may not run parallel to and\nwithin required buffers but may cross required buffers as near to perpendicular an\nangle as possible, and in any event at no less than a 60\u00b0 angle. If utilities, storm\nwater drainage channels or piping, and other similar features are placed in a buffer\nany way other than perpendicular or not less than at a 60-degree angle, the area\nmaking up the utility easement or area shall be replaced with an equal amount of\nbuffer area. No canopy trees may be removed for utility installation unless no\nreasonable alternative exists. Storm water BMPs and impoundments may be\nplaced within a required buffer and shall be integrated into the landscaping plan\nby employing rain gardens, bioretention units, constructed wetlands, and\ninfiltration areas, as combined landscaping/storm water management features to\nthe extent that soil permeability, depth to groundwater, or site encumbrances,\nsuch as utilities, allow.\nI.\nMAINTENANCE OF BUFFERS\n1. Where a buffer is owned by a property owners association, the covenants for the\ndevelopment shall require that association to annually maintain the buffers and\nshall include a buffer maintenance plan.\n2. For parcels that contain a buffer as part of a permit requirement, the property owner\nshall annually maintain the buffer.\n3.

INTENT\nIt is the general intent of this section to help protect and preserve the aesthetic\ncharacter of Cedar Point while balancing with those interests the need of businesses,\ngovernment, and the traveling public to safely and accurately identify and read\ninformation on permitted signs. Toward that end, the Town adopts these regulations\nregarding the number, area, location, and other characteristics of signs.\nB. SIGNS SUBJECT TO CONTROL\nAll signs visible from vehicular rights-of-way, both new and existing, shall be erected,\nmaintained, and operated in accordance with this Ordinance and other relevant\ncontrols unless specifically exempted. The definition of \"sign\" also includes those\nmessages inside a building specifically oriented to persons outside the building. The\nprovisions of this section do not apply to window displays of merchandise but do\napply to signs mounted in windows.\nC. SIGN PERMIT REQUIRED\nBefore any sign shall be erected, replaced, converted, changed, structurally altered, or\notherwise modified, a Sign Permit must be obtained except those specifically\nPage 187\n"}, {"page": "188", "text": "exempted from such a requirement.\nIn\nthe case of a multi-tenant development, the Sign Permit shall be issued in the name\nof the owner of the multi-tenant development or his agent rather than in the name of\nany individual tenant thereof, and it shall be the sole responsibility of such owner or\nagent to allocate among the tenants the permissible maximum sign surface area\nestablished by this Ordinance. Upon application by the owner of a multi-tenant\ndevelopment, the Town Manager may issue a master sign permit that allocates\npermissible maximum sign surface area among the various buildings, businesses or\ntenancies in the development according to a formula established and furnished by the\nowner, and thereafter sign permits shall be issued to individual tenants only in\naccordance with the allocation formula on record with the Town Manager. No sign\npermit shall be issued for any sign which conflicts with the allocation formula on\nrecord, and no new freestanding sign may be erected except in accordance with the\nthen existing sign regulations established by this Ordinance, and with the allocation\nformula on record.\nD.

COMPUTATION OF SIGN AREA\nFor the purpose of determining the number of signs permitted, a sign shall be\nconsidered to be a single display device containing elements organized, related, and\ncomposed to form a unit. Without limiting the generality of the above, a multi-sided\nsign shall be regarded as one sign.\n1. The surface area of a sign shall be computed by including the entire area within a\nsingle, continuous, rectilinear perimeter of not more than eight (8) straight lines,\nor a circle or an ellipse, enclosing the extreme limits of the writing, representation,\nemblem or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral\npart of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the\nbackdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting\nframework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the display itself.\n2. If the sign consists of more than one (1) section or module, all of the area, including\nthat between sections or modules, shall be included in the computation of the sign\narea.\n3. Freestanding signs are typically two-sided; therefore, the surface area shall be\ncomputed by calculating each of the two sides independently to determine the\nmaximum square footage allowed.\n4. Generally, parcels and businesses are permitted to have both freestanding and wall\nmounted signs to the extent to which signs can be erected and maintained to be in\nfull compliance with this ordinance. The area of these signs is calculated\nindependently.\nO. PERMANENT SIGNS NOT SUBJECT TO PERMIT REQUIREMENTS\nThe following permanent signs are allowed and are not subject to the permit\nrequirements of this Ordinance but are subject to all other applicable provisions of\nthis Ordinance.\n1. Signs two (2) square feet in area or less posted on private property.\n2. In addition to the signs allowed in Section 7.16.D.(L), TRACT IDENTIFICATION\nSIGNS, above, the owner, property manager, homeowners association, or residents\nassociation of a residential or multi-family development may install a community\nbulletin board at each entrance to the development. A community event bulletin\nboard shall not be located in the public right of way, nor shall it be located in such\na way as to interfere with lines of sight for vehicular traffic on, entering or exiting\nthe public right of way. Each sign shall meet the following criteria: one unlighted,\nsingle-sided sign per entrance, 3' X 4' maximum dimensions, and 6' maximum\ninstallation height. The sign face (i.e., the single side of the sign on which\ninformation may be posted) shall be oriented toward traffic exiting the\ndevelopment, SO that the sign face is not visible from the public right of way\noutside the subdivision or multi-family development it serves. Postings on the\nbulletin board shall be maintained in a neat and orderly condition and monitored\nby the homeowner's association or property manager.\nP. TEMPORARY SIGNS NOT SUBJECT TO PERMIT REQUIREMENTS\nNo temporary sign may be affixed, attached, or painted upon any utility pole, or upon\nany tree, rock, or other natural object. All temporary signs referring to commercial\noperations must include the name of the business entity sponsoring the sign and must\nbe professionally printed.\nPage\n198\n"}, {"page": "199", "text": "The following temporary signs are not subject to the permit requirements of this\nOrdinance but are otherwise subject to the requirements of this Ordinance except as\nspecifically indicated herein:\n1.

A single project that does not disturb more than five thousand (5,000) square feet\nin surface area. In determining the area, lands under one (1) or diverse ownership\nbeing developed as a unit will be aggregated.\n9. Any land disturbing activity occurring on any property over one (1) acre in area\nin connection with a plan previously reviewed and approved by the State of North\nCarolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources and/or the Division\nof Water Quality.\nC. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS\n1.\nPlan required. No person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity without having\nan erosion and drainage control plan approved by either the State or Town. Such\nactivity comprising of less than 1 acre in size shall submit the plan for Town\nreview. Any activity comprising of 1 acre or more shall submit the plan for North\nCarolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources review.\n2. The person conducting the land disturbing activity shall install erosion and\nsedimentation control devices and practices that are sufficient to retain the\nsediment generated by the land disturbing activity within the boundaries of the\ntract during construction upon and development of the tract and shall plant or\notherwise provide a permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion after\ncompletion of construction or development within a time period to be specified\nPage\n207\n"}, {"page": "208", "text": "by the approved plan.\n3. Protection of property. Persons conducting land-disturbing activity shall take all\nreasonable measures to protect all public and private property from damage\ncaused by such activity.\n4. More restrictive rules shall apply. Whenever conflicts exist between federal, state,\nor local laws, ordinances, or rules, the more restrictive provision shall apply.\nD. BASIC CONTROL OBJECTIVES\nAn erosion and drainage control plan may be disapproved pursuant to this section if\nthe plan fails to address the following control objectives:\n1. Identify critical areas. On-site areas that are subject to severe erosion and off-site\nareas that are especially vulnerable to damage from erosion and/or sedimentation\nare to be identified and receive special attention.\n2. Limit time of exposure. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and\nconducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time.\n3. Limit exposed areas. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted\nto minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one (1) time.\n4. Control surface water. Surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas\nshould be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during the period of\nexposure.\n5. Control sedimentation. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted\nSO as to prevent off-site sedimentation damage.\n6. Manage storm water runoff. When the increase in the velocity or quantity of storm\nwater runoff resulting from a land-disturbing activity is sufficient to cause\naccelerated erosion as well as excessive drainage onto adjacent properties, plans\nare to include measures to control the velocity or quantity at the point of discharge,\nSO as to minimize negative secondary impacts.\nE. DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS\n1. Except as provided in this section, erosion and drainage control measures,\nstructures, and devices shall be SO planned, designed, and constructed as to\nprovide protection from anticipated winds and from the calculated maximum peak\nrate of runoff from a 10-year storm event using customary engineering\ncalculations.\n2. Immediately after any land disturbing activity occurs on a given property, the\ndeveloper shall be responsible for installing all previously approved soil erosion\ncontrol methods outlined within the submitted erosion and drainage control plan.\nAcceptable methods are a combination of the following elements:\n(a)\nA silt fence at a minimum of three (3) feet in height.\n(b) The installation/dispersal of temporary grass seed and wheat straw to begin\na base level of grass growth to stabilize the disturbed area and avoid\nunnecessary erosion.\n(c)\nTarps covering any undistributed mounds of fill material or dirt to avoid\nunnecessary erosion.\n(d)\nOnce construction is completed, and final soil erosion mitigations measures\nare adopted, temporary measures shall be allowed to be removed from the\nsubject property.\n3. The use of fill shall be allowed under the following conditions:\nPage 208\n"}, {"page": "209", "text": "(a)\nThe use of fill altering the natural grade of the lot from property line to\nproperty line establishing a slope greater than one (1) to one (1)2 shall not\nbe required to install any drainage control methods.\n(b)\nIf the developer proposes to use fill altering the natural grade of the lot from\nproperty line to property line establishing a slope greater than one (1) to one\n(1) but less than one (1) to two (2) shall be required to install drainage\nswales to keep all storm water runoff onsite and allow for natural diffusion.\nThe drainage swales shall be at a minimum two (2) feet in width and\napproximately one (1) foot in depth at its center.\n(c)\nIf the developer proposes to use fill that alters the natural grade of the lot\nfrom property line to property line establishing a slope greater than one (1)\nto two (2) shall be required to install a bulkhead to restrict the flow of water\nfrom the subject property.\n(d) The bulkhead shall be at a minimum of three (3) feet in height and shall\nabide by all applicable regulations governing the development of fences or\nwalls established within the Town of Cedar Point Zoning Ordinance.\n(e)\nUnder no circumstances shall fill be deposited on a development site in\nexcess of a slope greater than one (1) to three (3).\n(f)\nThese regulations shall not be construed to regulate the use of fill in\nconnection with any requirements associated with the installation and\nnecessary operation of a septic tank as required and approved by the\nCarteret County Health Department.\nF.

NONCONFORMITIES GENERALLY\n1. Uses of land, which do not conform to the requirements of this Ordinance, may\nnot be enlarged, expanded, nor altered, except in conformance with this Ordinance.\n2.\nNonconformities shall not be used as grounds for adding other prohibited uses or\nstructures, nor for the enlarging by means of extension or expansion, except as\nspecifically provided by this Ordinance.\nB. COMPLETION OF NONCONFORMING PROJECTS\n1. For purposes of this Chapter, a nonconforming project shall include any structure,\ndevelopment, or undertaking that is incomplete at the effective date of this\nOrdinance, or amendment thereto, and would be inconsistent with any regulation\napplicable to the district in which it is located if completed as proposed or planned.\n2.\nA nonconforming project for which a completed application has been submitted to\nand accepted by the Town Manager prior to the effective date of this Ordinance\nshall be reviewed in accordance with the standards applicable on the date the\ncomplete application was accepted.\n3. Any nonconforming project for which a permit was issued under the previous\nZoning Ordinance may be completed in accordance with the terms of such permit,\nSO long as it remains unexpired and unrevoked.\n4. If a permit has been issued for a nonconforming project and such permit remains\nunexpired and unrevoked, an applicant may seek modification of such permit from\nthe permit issuing authority that granted the original permit, and such permit\nissuing authority may approve the requested modification if it determines that the\nproposed changes will result in a project that is not more nonconforming in terms\nof the present Ordinance than the project approved under the previous Ordinance.\nC. CLASSIFICATION OF NONCONFORMITIES\nNonconformities are classified as:\n1. Uses of major structures and premises (Section 8.2),\n2.\nCharacteristics of Uses (Section 8.3) which were lawful but would be prohibited,\nregulated, or restricted by the enactment of this Ordinance or a subsequent\namendment thereto,\n3. Structures (Section 8.4) and/or\n4. Lots (Section 8.5).\n8.2\nNONCONFORMING USES\nA. INTENT CONCERNING NONCONFORMING USES: SPECIFICALLY\nDECLARED TO BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH PERMITTED USES\n1. It is the intent of this Ordinance that nonconforming uses of land shall be\nconsidered to be incompatible with the permitted uses within the district(s) in\nwhich they are located. Such nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged or\nextended in any respect.\n2. Once a nonconforming use has ceased to operate or has been discontinued for a\nPage 213\n"}, {"page": "214", "text": "period of 180 consecutive days, it may not be resumed and shall only be replaced\nwith a conforming use.\nB. CHANGE OF USE\n1. GENERAL\nA nonconforming use shall not be changed to any other nonconforming use, except\nas provided in Section 8.2.B.2, EXCEPTIONS.\n2. EXCEPTIONS\nNonconforming residential, office, or personal services uses within an industrial\nor commercial base zoning district may be continued or replaced by another\nnonconforming residential, office, or personal service use, upon the issuance of a\nZoning Compliance Permit based on the standards in Section 8.2.B.3.\nNonconforming non-residential uses within a residential zoning district may be\nreplaced by another nonconforming non-residential use, upon the issuance of a\nZoning Compliance Permit based on the standards in Section 8.2.B.3.\n3. The Town Manager may issue a Zoning Compliance Permit for a replacement use\ndescribed in Section 8.2.B.2, EXCEPTIONS, if the applicant substantiates that:\n(a) The nonconforming use has not ceased for a period of one hundred eighty\n(180) consecutive days.\n(b)\nThe proposed use is a permitted residential, office, or personal service use in\nsome zoning districts;\n(c)\nAll the applicable requirements of this Ordinance must be met to the extent\nreasonably possible.\n(d) Compliance with a requirement of this Ordinance is not reasonably possible\nif compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot\nwhere the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial\nstructure that is on a permanent foundation. Mere financial hardship caused\nby the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking or increased\nlandscaping does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not\nreasonably possible. And in no case may an applicant be given permission\npursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing\nbuilding if additional nonconformities would thereby be created; and,\n(e)\nThe proposed replacement use will have the same or less adverse impact on\nthose most affected by it than the existing or previous nonconforming use\nand will be equal or more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood\nthan the existing or previous nonconforming use applied for.\n(f)\nThe applicant shall provide the following information for both the existing\nand proposed use to demonstrate to the Town Manager or his/her designee\nthe existence of an equal or less adverse impact on the surrounding areas:\ni.\nHours of operation;\nii.\nTraffic generation by vehicle type;\niii.\nNumber of employees;\niv.\nExternal changes to structure;\nV.\nNoxious exposure;\nvi.\nCustomer traffic, including time of day and number of trips; and\nvii.\nNature of use type.\n(g) The cost of any reconstruction or renovation associated with the use change\ndoes not exceed one-third (1/3) of the existing structure's replacement cost\nPage\n214\n"}, {"page": "215", "text": "(new) prior to the reconstruction or renovation. In cases where the\nreconstruction or renovation cost exceeds one-third (1/3) of the structure's\nreplacement cost (new), then the use and structure must conform to the\nrequirements of the district where located.\n(h)\nIn the case of a non-residential use in a residential zoning district, the\nstructure is not reasonably suitable for a use allowed by right in the zoning\ndistrict due to unique or unusual construction or characteristics.\n8.3\nNONCONFORMING CHARACTERISTICS OF USE\nA. Conforming uses with nonconforming characteristics may continue to operate but\nshall not be expanded, altered, changed, or relocated in such a manner as to increase\nthe degree of nonconformity.\nB. Nonconforming characteristics that can reasonably be corrected shall be addressed\nduring the review of a new site plan or special use permit. For example, compliance\nmay not be reasonably possible when compliance cannot be achieved without adding\nadditional land to the lot, moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent\nfoundation, or other significant site work. The permit-issuing authority may consider\nthe cost of eliminating nonconforming characteristics in relation to the total project\ncost and the benefit to the community when determining what improvements are\nreasonable.\nC. MULTIPLE DETACHED DWELLINGS ON A SINGLE PARCEL\n1.\nThe Town recognizes that some of the existing development patterns are part of\nthe character of the Town. The Town finds that when such patterns persist into the\npresent in a way that is consistent with the nearby surrounding development, it\nmay advance the Town's interest in preserving its character to allow the\ninconsistent pattern to remain, but to regulate the inconsistent land use in a manner\nas consistent with the modern requirements as possible to prevent unintended\nconsequences.\n2. Therefore, where two (2) or more detached single-family residential structures\nexist on a single lot in a Residential District as of the original adoption date of this\nordinance, the Town Manager may approve a plat to place each residential\nstructure on an independent lot provided the plat shows:\n(a) That all lots have 25 feet of road frontage and access to a public road;\n(b)\nThat all lots have no more than one single family residential structure on the\nlot;\n(c) That all lots provide for minimum side yard setbacks of at least 2 feet and a\nrear yard setback of at least 2 feet;\n(d) The plat shall evenly divide the space between the existing structures; and\n(e) No more than 10 lots may be created from a single parcel pursuant to this\nsection.\n8.4\nNONCONFORMING STRUCTURES\nA.

That a nonconforming commercial or industrial structure or portion thereof which\nis damaged by causes other than the intentional or reckless acts of the property\nowner or authorized agent to such an extent that the cost to repair does not exceed\nfifty (50) percent of the structure's fair market value, may be reconstructed. If such\na structure is damaged by the intentional or reckless act of the property owner or\nauthorized agent, or is otherwise damaged to such an extent that the cost to repair\nexceeds fifty (50%) percent of the structure's current tax value, or is destroyed,\nthen the structure may not be reconstructed except in accordance with all\nrequirements established by this Ordinance for the zoning district in which it is\nsituated.\n3. That a nonconforming residential structure, or a portion thereof which is totally or\npartially destroyed, may be reconstructed or replaced. The total amount of space\ndevoted to a nonconforming use may not be increased, except that a larger, single-\nfamily residential structure may be constructed in place of a smaller one, a larger\nmobile home intended for residential use may replace a smaller one, and a mobile\nhome may be replaced by a framed structure. The reconstructed residential\nstructure may not be more nonconforming with respect to dimensional restrictions\nsuch as, yard requirements, height limitations, or density requirements, and such\ndimensional nonconformities must be eliminated if that can reasonably be\naccomplished without unduly burdening the reconstruction process or limiting the\nright to continue the nonconforming use of such structure.

This Ordinance may establish other standards for specific\ncircumstances or situations, which specific standards supersede these general\nrules.\nB. DISTANCE MEASUREMENTS, GENERALLY\nUnless otherwise expressly stated, distances between points specified in this\nOrdinance are to be measured as the length of an imaginary straight line joining\nthose points. Unless otherwise expressly stated, measurements determining the\nspacing between uses are to be taken from property line to nearest property line as\na straight-line measurement.\nC. LOT MEASUREMENTS\n1. LOT AREA\nThe total horizontal area within the boundary lines of a lot exclusive of street\nor highway rights-of-way and easements for access to other property. Utility\nand similar easements are included within a lot area.\n2. LOT WIDTH\nLot width is the distance between the side lot lines measured along the front\nbuilding setback line. In cases where a structure is \"condominiumized,\" or the\ninterior floor area of a structure is owned by different owners, the zoning\ndistrict lot width requirements shall apply only to the parent tract or\ndevelopment site, not the individual ownership units.\n3. LOT DEPTH\nThe shortest perpendicular distance from the front lot line to the rear lot line.\n4. LOT WIDTH AND DEPTH FOR CUL-DE-SAC LOTS\nThe permit issuing authority may allow the creation of new residential lots that\ndo not meet the minimum lot width requirement at the front setback line if the\nsole reason for not meeting the minimum width is due to the reduced lot\nfrontage on the public or private road created by the end of a cul-de-sac,\nprovided the required lot width is met within 75' measured from the edge of\nthe right of way.

It is an essential part of\nthe development review process to assist developers and local government agencies in making\nland use decisions involving annexations, subdivisions, rezoning requests, special land uses, and\nother development reviews. The TIA helps identify where the development may have a\nsignificant impact on safety, traffic, and transportation operations and provides a means for the\ndeveloper and the government agencies to mitigate these impacts. Ultimately, the TIA can be\nused to evaluate if the scale of the development is appropriate for a particular site and what\nimprovements may be necessary, on and off the site, to provide safe and efficient access and\ntraffic flow. Mitigation measures may involve strategies other than roadway construction or\nother physical improvements such as changes to traffic signal timing or phasing and\ntransportation management strategies.\nWhen A TIA Is Required\nA TIA shall be required for residential developments proposed within Town of Cedar\nPoint that have an estimated trip generation of 2,000 vehicles per day or greater during an\naverage weekday based on a five-day national average as defined in the Institute of\nTransportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual.\nA TIA shall be required for commercial type developments proposed within Town of\nCedar Point with an estimated trip generation of 3,000 vehicles per day or greater during\nan average weekday based on a five-day national average as defined in the Institute of\nTransportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual.\nA TIA shall be required for Industrial developments proposed within Town of Cedar\nPoint with an estimated trip generation of 3,000 vehicles per day or greater during an\naverage weekday based on a five-day national average as defined in the Institute of\nTransportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual.\nA TIA shall be required for other (i.e. - Office Professional, Church Campus, etc.)\ndevelopments, not listed, proposed within Town of Cedar Point with an estimated trip\ngeneration of 3,000 vehicles per day or greater during an average weekday based on a\nfive-day national average as defined in the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)\nTrip Generation Manual.\nPage 251\n"}, {"page": "252", "text": "A TIA may also be required for proposed accesses within 1,000 feet of an interchange, in\nthe vicinity of a high accident location, on a major arterial roadway, when involvement\nwith an existing or proposed median crossover is necessary, when the project includes\nhighway improvements that are in the Transportation Improvement Program, when\ninvolvement with an active roadway construction project is necessary or at the discretion\nof the District Engineer working with Town of Cedar Point.\nIn certain instances, the need for a TIA may be waived when Town of Cedar Point and NCDOT\nagree a TIA is not needed. In the event a waiver is requested, the applicant must provide\nevidence to show that a waiver is appropriate. Waiver requests shall be handled on a case-by-\ncase basis.\nCalculating Trip Generation\nThe trip generation of a proposed development is the sum of the number of inbound and\noutbound vehicle trips that are expected for the type and size of the proposed land use. For\npurposes of determining the requirement to submit a TIA, no adjustments such as modal split,\npass-by trips, or internal capture rates will be allowed to the site traffic calculation. A TIA will\nvary in range and complexity depending on the type and size of the proposed development.\nWhen mutually agreed upon by the NCDOT, the applicant, and Town of Cedar Point staff, the\nbasic requirements for the TIA may be modified.\nTRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY GUIDELINES\nA. General Information\nWhen required by this Ordinance and/or NCDOT, a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) shall be\nused to review the potential impacts of proposed or revised developments on the State\nHighway System. The TIA covers safety, capacity, and access issues. When required and\ncompleted, a TIA shall be used by Town of Cedar Point and NCDOT to determine the\nrequired improvements to the State Highway System within the vicinity of the development\nto mitigate undesirable impacts of the project.\nThe District Engineer, working together with Town of Cedar Point, will determine the basic\nparameters of the TIA. When mutually agreed upon by the NCDOT, the applicant, and Town\nof Cedar Point in a pre-submittal conference, the basic requirements and parameters for the\nTIA may be modified.\nThe TIA shall be prepared under the direct charge of, and sealed by, a licensed North\nCarolina Professional Engineer with expertise in traffic engineering. All work shall be in\naccordance with NCDOT approved methods and input parameters and shall be of sufficient\nscope and detail to allow Town of Cedar Point and the NCDOT to evaluate the impact of the\ndevelopment with regards to roadway capacity and operational and safety improvements that\nmay be needed.\nPage\n252\n"}, {"page": "253", "text": "B.

Conclusions/Recommendations\n7. Appendix\n(a) All work sheets, traffic counts and other pertinent documents\nC. Base Roadway Network\nAll roadways in the vicinity of the development shall be included as part of the TIA.\nAnalysis of intersections or roadway segments not immediately adjacent to the development\nmay be required by the District Engineer or Town of Cedar Point if significant site traffic\ncould be expected to impact the intersection or roadway segment. If intersections impacted\nby the development are within a coordinated traffic signal system, then the entire traffic\nsignal system shall be analyzed. However, if the traffic signal system is large, a sub-section\nof the system may be analyzed if approved by the District Engineer and agreed upon by\nTown of Cedar Point.\nD. Safety Information\nThe initial submittal may be required to include recent crash experience in the study area.\nWhere proposed access points are in the vicinity of high crash locations or where safety may\nbe impacted, additional safety studies may be required as part of the Traffic Impact Analysis.\nE. Traffic Volumes\nTraffic turning movement counts shall be taken at each existing intersection in the project\narea. Existing traffic counts may be used if taken within twelve months of the TIA submittal.\nAt some intersections, counts older than one year may be used if adjusted to current year.\nThe use of these older counts will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the NCDOT and\nTown of Cedar Point and shall be approved by the District Engineer or his or her agent.\nPage 254\n"}, {"page": "255", "text": "In general, AM and PM peak hour counts should be used. Other peak hour period counts,\nsuch as lunch and weekend periods, may be required if appropriate for the development.\nCounts shall not be taken on a holiday unless specifically needed for the particular analysis.\nThe effects of school, seasonal variation, and special event traffic shall be noted when\nappropriate.\nF. Traffic Capacity Analysis\nAll capacity analysis shall be performed using methodology and software based on the\nHighway Capacity Manual procedures or as approved by the NCDOT District Engineer. All\nsoftware shall be the latest version available unless otherwise approved by the District\nEngineer. If signalized intersections impacted by the project are within a coordinated traffic\nsignal system or may be included in a system because of changes to the network by the\napplicant, then they shall be analyzed as a system rather than as isolated intersections. Where\navailable and appropriate, existing timing information shall be used. All analyses shall\ninclude level of service determination for the entire network and individual intersections and\nroadway segments, as appropriate. Intersection analyses shall include level of service\ndeterminations for all approaches and movements. Intersection analyses shall include queue\nanalysis.\nG. Growth-to-Background Traffic Volumes\nGrowth-to-background traffic volumes are factors of increases in annual traffic volumes\ngenerated outside the project area. These factors shall be applied to the existing traffic before\nadding any approved developments in the area. As deemed appropriate, the volume shall be\ncompounded to the proposed build-out years or completion of development stages. In\ngeneral, these factors will be determined from local or statewide data.\nH. Approved Development Traffic\nApproved development traffic is defined as traffic generated by all developments approved\nby local jurisdictions or submitted to local jurisdictions for approval within the development\nvicinity at the time of the TIA submittal.\nI. Background Analysis\nBackground (no build) analysis shall include existing traffic, traffic signal phasing, and\ntiming, background growth, and all approved developments. The analysis shall take into\nconsideration any improvements to the roadway network that will be in place by the build-\nout year, or staged build-out in development, as appropriate. An analysis shall be performed\nfor each staged build-out year as necessary. This analysis shall be performed for the proposed\nbuild-out year of the development or other year as identified by Town of Cedar Point or\nNCDOT and approved by the District Engineer.\nJ.\nProject Conditions\nSite traffic is the traffic that will be generated by the proposed development. Trip generation\nrates shall be based on trip generation methodology in the latest version of the \"Trip\nGeneration Manual\" by the ITE. When approved by the District Engineer, available local\ninformation may be substituted with appropriate documentation. The District Engineer may\ncoordinate the analysis of the site trip generation with the Division Traffic Engineer. Trip\ngeneration reduction factors, such as pass-by traffic and internal capture, shall be justified.\nPage 255\n"}, {"page": "256", "text": "Total traffic is to be re-calculated after site traffic is generated. All trip generation\ncalculations and supporting documentation shall be included in the report appendix. Project\ntraffic analysis shall include any roadway network improvements that will be in place by the\nproject build-out year, or stage in development, if appropriate. Any improvements planned\nby others shall be identified as such and documentation describing the improvements, the\nentity that is to implement the improvements, and the schedule for such improvements, shall\nbe provided.\nK. Roadway Network Improvements\nThe applicant shall be required to identify mitigation improvements to the roadway network\nif at least one of the following conditions exists when comparing base network conditions to\nproject conditions:\nThe total average delay at an intersection or individual approach increases by 25% or\ngreater;\nThe Level of Service (LOS) degrades by at least one level;\nOr the Level of Service (LOS) is an \"F.\"\nFor turning lanes, mitigation improvements shall be identified when the analysis indicates\nthat the 95th percentile queue exceeds the storage capacity of the existing lane. The District\nEngineer will be responsible for final determination of mitigation improvements required to\nbe constructed by the applicant.\nL. Conclusions/Recommendations\nThis section of the TIA shall summarize the findings of the analysis, identify all potential\nintersections or roadway segments that will be at an unacceptable level of service as\nidentified in Section J, and shall identify all proposed improvements to mitigate potential\nproblems. This includes a description of all of the improvements that the developer shall\nconstruct (or fund) as part of the development proposal. Improvements to roadway segments\nand intersections not immediately adjacent to the project site may be required if significant\ntraffic impacts are identified.\nM. Supporting Information\nThe applicant shall provide all supporting information to the District Engineer and Town of\nCedar Point. This information may include but is not limited to the following:\ntraffic volumes;\nanalysis reports;\nsignal warrant analysis;\ndocumentation of approved developments or proposed roadway improvements by others;\nanalysis data and output.\nIn lieu of printed pages, electronic copies of supporting data may be submitted. The\nsubmitted information may include data from traffic analysis, traffic volume, or signal\nwarrant analysis software packages. If submitted, both input data and output reports shall be\nincluded. Data files should be named to facilitate identification of the contents.\nPage 256\n"}, {"page": "257", "text": "All plans may be submitted electronically, with the exception that a copy of the proposed site\nplan must be printed and included with the application. If SO provided, the plans must be in a\nformat approved by the District Engineer and Town of Cedar Point.\nN. Final Submittal information\nOnce the TIA is approved by NCDOT and Town of Cedar Point, one (1) electronic copy of\nthe entire TIA on CD and one (1) paper copy of the TIA shall be submitted to the Town of\nCedar Point Planning Department for the project file.\nO. Validity of TIA\nResidential Projects\nA TIA shall be valid for a period of two (2) years from the date of the preliminary\napproval by the Planning and Zoning Commission.\nCommercial Projects\nIn the case of commercial projects, if a preliminary plat is required for the project, the\nTIA shall be valid for a period of two (2) years from the date of the preliminary plat\napproval by the Planning Board.\nIn the event a preliminary plat is not required for the project and the project is subject to\nsite plan review only, then the TIA shall be valid for a period of two (2) years from the\ndate of site plan approval by the Town.\nSECTION 2: Improvements Required (Projects Not Requiring TIA)\nIf a project does not require a Traffic Impact Analysis to be performed, the developer/project\nowner is not exempt from completing improvements to mitigate the impacts of the proposed\nproject. For the project to take place, highway infrastructure improvements may be necessary.\nFor example, improvements may be needed for safe and efficient traffic operations if there are\nhigh roadway and/or turning volumes of traffic, when the roadway speeds are moderate or high\nor where limited sight distance exists.\nA. Infrastructure Improvements Defined\nHighway infrastructure improvements include, but are not limited to:\nadditional through lanes\nacceleration lanes\nturn lanes and tapers for left and right turns associated with a driveway connection.\nAs set forth in G.S. 136-18(29), the final determination for the need, extent, location and\ndesign of turn lanes is the responsibility of the NCDOT. The NCDOT may require the\napplicant to provide offsite roadway improvements on public facilities in order to mitigate\nany negative traffic impacts created by the proposed development. Boundaries for offsite\nimprovements, including intersections and public roadways to be considered, will be\ndetermined by the District Engineer in cooperation with Town of Cedar Point.\nB. Right-Of-Way Acquisition\nWhen adequate right-of-way does not exist to provide for the required offsite improvements\nnecessary to maximize the safety of the traveling public, the applicant shall secure the needed\nright-of-way. If the applicant is unsuccessful in obtaining the needed right-of-way and has\ndemonstrated a \"good-faith effort,\" the NCDOT may, but shall not be required to, utilize its\nPage 257\n"}, {"page": "258", "text": "power of eminent domain to secure adequate right-of-way to contain the required\nimprovements. At a minimum, a \"good-faith effort\" shall consist of a copy of a certified\nletter to all affected property owners and all responses received from those property owners.\nThe applicant shall provide copies of the documentation sent to affected property owners and\nany responses received to Town of Cedar Point Planning Services for the project file. In the\nevent the ROW acquisitions services of NCDOT are required for the project, the applicant\nshall be required to reimburse all costs incurred by NCDOT to acquire the additional right-\nof-way.\nC. Local Transportation Plans and Future Right-Of Way\nIn conjunction with the driveway request, the NCDOT and/or Town of Cedar Point may\nrequire the applicant to reserve or dedicate minimum right-of-way needs as identified by\nlocal government transportation plans for the state-maintained roadway along the property\nfrontage. This may require that the driveway design and internal circulation be compatible\nwith the future right-of-way location.\nD. Left and Right Turn Lanes\nGenerally left and right turn lanes and tapers shall be considered when:\nIn accordance with G.S. 136-18(29), the average daily traffic meets or exceeds 4,000\nvehicles per day on any secondary route (the average daily traffic should include both the\nexisting traffic plus traffic generated by the proposed development);\nAny US or NC numbered route is being accessed;\nThe District Engineer determines that such treatment is necessary to avoid congestion or\nunsafe conditions on the state-maintained roadway; or\nA TIA identifies a need for an auxiliary lane or taper.\nLeft and right turn lanes shall be constructed in accordance with the \"North Carolina\nStandards and Specifications for Roads and Structures.\" On an undivided highway or a\ndivided highway with a median width that is inadequate for a left-turn lane, it may be\nnecessary to widen the highway in order to provide for the required turn lanes. For greater\ndetail, see the turn lane nomograph figure in the Exhibits section of the \"Policy on Street and\nDriveway Access to North Carolina Highways.\" Should widening be required to\naccommodate turn lanes or tapers, the applicant shall be required to acquire the necessary\nROW as stated in Section B, Right-of-Way Acquisition.\nE. Channelization\nThe applicant may be required to protect the integrity of the highway network by providing\nchannelization to physically prevent improper or illegal turns into and out of a driveway or\nstreet. Channelization may include medians and raised traffic islands with curbs.\nF. Authority\nThe District Engineer has final authority on decisions regarding infrastructure improvements\nand shall inform Town of Cedar Point of any such decisions regarding infrastructure\nimprovements.\nPage 258\n"}, {"page": "259", "text": "Page | 259\n"}, {"page": "260", "text": "APPENDIX B\nA.
