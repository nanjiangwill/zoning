Urban Residential Districts: location: purposes.\n(1)\nUrban areas are recognized as unique areas with many assets and opportunities. In order\nto foster the urban characteristics of these areas, development here should promote an\nenvironment of diverse uses at higher than normal density which encourages pedestrian\nactivities, needs and movement, while at the same time recognizing the limited supply of\nurban land. As such this requires special zoning classifications in order to implement the\ngoals and objectives of these vital areas of the community. Further it is necessary and\ndesirable to promote the residential nature of these areas through zoning classifications,\nwhich are intended to realize the growing opportunities for new infill development and\nredevelopment. Such residential development, properly located and developed, can\nenhance and support the overall mix of uses characteristic of urban areas. Therefore, the\npurpose of this Section is to establish the urban residential districts.\n(2)\nUrban residential districts are intended for use in special areas of the community and thus\nmay be considered for limited application. Generally, special plans or policy guides will\nbe used to determine applicability. The official Zoning Map of the City of Charlotte will\ndesignate urban residential district boundaries.\n(3)\nThese districts are designed to provide standards and incentives, which will promote the\ndevelopment or redevelopment of urban areas that contain a mix of land uses with a\npredominantly residential character. Emphasis is given to provisions, which will provide\nopportunities for imaginative new urban development compatible with the development\nobjectives of these areas. Accordingly, the development objectives are:\n(a)\nTo maximize residential development potentials in urban areas;\n(b)\nTo establish a predominantly residential character with residential neighborhoods;\n(c)\nTo provide for sufficient local retail and office uses to support residential areas;\n(d)\nTo protect all residential areas from inappropriate and intrusive uses;\n(e)\nTo maximize open space and other amenities within residential areas;\n(f)\nTo protect and enhance existing single family residential areas from uses which by\ntheir scale and characteristics may be inappropriate;\n(g)\nTo provide for the efficient utilization of scarce urban land; and\n(h)\nTo reward development projects through a density bonus system for including\nspecific development features which significantly further the overall goals for\nthese areas and which enhance the urban residential environment.\n9-45\n"}, {"page": "196", "text": "CHARLOTTE CODE\nPART 4 : URBAN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS\nSection 9.402.

These ordinances further require the Mecklenburg County Department of Environmental\nProtection (MCDEP) to develop guidelines and approve plans for any activities that would disturb the\nbuffers. The Watershed Buffer Guidelines for Mecklenburg County (Guidelines) fulfill that\nrequirement setting forth minimum desirable standards and will be used on a case by case basis to\ndirect plan approval. (Note: The zoning and subdivision ordinances of Davidson require buffers but do\nnot reference these guidelines.) Plans will be required under the ordinances in the following situations\nto include but not limited to:\n1) when streambank or shoreline stabilization is proposed;\n2) when removal of existing trees is proposed for access to the lake or stream;\n3) during new development or the expansion of existing development if the buffer requires\nenhancement;\n4) when any disturbance of existing vegetation is proposed within the buffer; and\n5) when any land disturbance occurs within the buffer (i.e. grading, filling, soil tilling, etc.). Plan\napproval will be based on the direct application of these Guidelines as appropriate and on the\nability of the buffer to protect water quality as explained in the purpose statement.\nPurpose: The primary intent of these Guidelines is to maintain or establish and maintain an effective,\nnatural, forested, low maintenance ecosystem, which will function as described below. Watershed\nbuffers are undeveloped areas between perennial streams or lakes, and development. These buffers\nserve a specific purpose of reducing the volume of runoff, thereby reducing erosion and pollutants\ncoming from an area of more intensive land use to a waterbody. The reduction of erosion and\npollutants occurs through natural mechanisms such as deposition, infiltration, adsorption, filtration and\ndecomposition. Natural forested areas have the best capacity for collecting and storing nutrients and\nother pollutants. The tree canopy also protects the soil from erosion and provides shading, which can\nreduce water temperatures and enhance aquatic habitats. (Shallow rooted grasses requiring ongoing\nmaintenance do not fulfill this purpose.)\nI. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND PROHIBITIONS\n1. Applicability\na. Mountain Island Lake: These guidelines are applicable to property in the Mountain Island\nLake watershed as defined in the applicable local subdivision ordinances as follows:\ni.\nAll new subdivisions of land with property adjacent to the lake or a perennial stream,\napproved in Mecklenburg County after March 8, 1993, in Charlotte after June 21, 1993,\nin Cornelius after September 20, 1993 and in Huntersville after October 1,1993,\n1\n"}, {"page": "844", "text": "unless prior approval had been granted as specified in the applicable subdivision\nordinances (i.e. \"they have been grandfathered\").\nii.\nAll new or improved lots adjacent to the lake or a perennial stream in Mecklenburg\nCounty and Charlotte, commencing construction after June 21, 1993, in Cornelius after\nSeptember 20, 1993, and in Huntersville after October 1, 1993, unless prior approval\nhad been granted as specified in the applicable zoning ordinances (i.e. \"they have been\ngrandfathered\").\nb.

Turf grass\nused for temporary erosion control measures as part of an approved plan is allowable (e.g. rye).\nb. Impervious structures such as driveways and boathouses on land are not permitted within the\nbuffer.\nC.\nSeptic tanks, drain fields and repair areas are not permitted within the buffer. Repairs to\nexisting septic systems, that involve no increase in capacity, shall be considered on a case-by-\ncase basis.\nd. Structural best management practices are not allowed in the buffer.\ne. Clearing or grading within the buffer is not allowed. If the existing buffer is disturbed in any\nway, the buffer must be replanted in accordance with these Guidelines.\nII. MAINTENANCE OF EXISTING BUFFER VEGETATION\n1. Ground cover\nExisting, trees, shrubs, ground covers, natural grasses or perennials should be left in place. Where\nthere is not enough vegetation to control runoff and erosion, a mulch cover of 2-inch minimum depth\nshould be maintained over the entire buffer area. This should be, whenever possible, made up of\nnatural leaf litter as is typically found in an undisturbed wooded area. Where this natural\n3\n"}, {"page": "846", "text": "litter is not present at a sufficient depth, it should be supplemented with natural organic mulch such as\nleaves, leaf mold, wood chips, tree bark or pine needles. Removal of natural leaf fall from within the\nbuffer is prohibited as natural leaf litter provides beneficial results such as enriching the soil,\nprotecting tree roots and absorbing water runoff. Perennial ground cover as specified under\n\"VEGETATION IN THE BUFFER\" Section 4 on page 5 can be used in place of mulch as\napproved by MCDEP.\n2. Existing Tree Cover\nExcept as otherwise provided in these Guidelines, existing tree cover should be retained at a\nminimum density of at least 12 healthy trees of a minimum 6 inch caliper per 1000 square feet of\nbuffer area. This minimum tree density should be more or less uniformly distributed over the\nentire buffer area with the exception of approved openings. Pruning of trees within the buffer will\nbe limited to the removal of only lateral limbs from no more than the lower 50 percent of the tree's\ntotal height. Topping is not allowed. The Subdivision Ordinances state that \"No trees larger than 2\ninch caliper are to be removed except for dead or diseased trees.\" Combinations of larger and\nsmaller trees can also provide an effective buffer. For example, where an adequate density of\nnatural tree cover exists, but there are too few trees of the minimum 6 inch diameter size class, then\ntwo trees of at least a 1 1/2 inch caliper may be counted for each deficiency of a larger tree. (As an\nexample, if a buffer contained 2500 square feet, the normal standard would be a minimum of 30,\nsix-inch trees. If the buffer had only 10 trees over six inches and the rest were smaller, then the\nstandard would be met with the 10 six inch trees and 40 (2x20) trees above 1 1/2 inches in caliper.)\n3. Land Clearing\nThe removal of some native vines, shrubs, ground covers and small trees to facilitate a better view\nor a more aesthetically pleasing natural landscape may be allowed. This thinning operation must\nbe done with hand tools and/or minimal use of approved herbicides. No grubbing of tree stumps is\nallowed; however, their removal with a stump grinding machine, which causes minimal soil\ndisturbance, is allowed. Natural leaf litter, humus and soil should remain.\n4. Exceptions\ni.\nSome tree thinning may be permissible with approval where thick cover exists and it is\ndesirable to promote a healthy tree cover and produce the most effective buffer.\nii.\nThe minimum desired tree density standard may be reduced in order to reduce crowding to\nbelow 12 trees per 1000 square feet, if the buffer contains a majority of large diameter trees.\nFor every three trees that have a diameter at chest height of over 12 inches, the total number of\ntrees desired within the buffer is reduced by one tree. As an example, if a buffer is 2500 square\nfeet, it should contain a minimum of 30 healthy trees of a minimum six-inch diameter. Should\n15 of these trees be 12 inches in diameter or above, then the minimum desired standard would\ndrop to 25 trees with the lower density being found in the area where the larger trees were\npredominant.\n4\n"}, {"page": "847", "text": "III. PLANTING NEW/ADDITIONAL VEGETATION IN THE BUFFER\n1. New or Enhanced Tree Cover\nIn areas of the buffer where the density of trees is less than the minimum, it is desirable to plant new\ntrees. Where new or replacement trees are installed to satisfy the minimum standards set forth in\nthese Guidelines, they should be planted to a density of 12 trees per 1000 square feet and have a\nminimum caliper of 1 1/4 inches measured at 6 inches above the rootball. Equivalent combinations\nof permanent tree, shrubs and ground covers may be substituted following MCDEP's approval of a\nbuffer plan (see Appendix A).\n2. Shrubs and Ground covers\nPlanting of additional shrubs, ground covers and perennials may be approved if done SO with minimal\ndisturbance to root systems of existing trees. Addition of nutrients (fertilizers) into these buffer areas\nis prohibited except at planting time when mixing nutrients and soil amendments with the backfill soil\nis acceptable.\nIV. VEGETATION IN THE BUFFER\n1. Benefits of a Vegetated Buffer\nA healthy vegetative cover within the buffer area can provide a stable land surface, which absorbs\nrainfall, cuts down on heat reflectance and noise, and absorbs pollutants washing across the land.\nDense, vigorous vegetation protects the soil from raindrop impact, a major force in dislodging soil\nparticles and moving them down slope. The shielding effect of a plant canopy is augmented by roots\nand rhizomes that hold the soil, improve its physical condition, and increase the rate of infiltration.\nPlants also reduce the moisture content of soil through transpiration, thus increasing its capacity to\nabsorb water. Undisturbed buffer areas can provide low-maintenance landscaping, shade, and\nprivacy screening. Large trees and carefully designed buffers may dramatically increase property\nvalue.\n2. Site Considerations\nSpecies selection should be based on site characteristics including soils, slope, aspect, climate, and\nexpected management of that area.\na. Soils: Piedmont soils are generally low in organic matter and have subsoils high in clay. Deeper\nsubsoils are typically silts, silt loams, and sandy loams. Surface soils vary from sandy loam to\nclay loam, and subsoils are commonly thick with heavy clay texture. Topography is mostly\nrolling hills with well-developed drainage patterns. Piedmont soils generally support a wide\nvariety of plants, including both cool and warm season species.\nb.\nSlope: Slope describes the degree of steepness of the topography on a parcel of land. The steeper\nthe slope, the more essential is a vigorous vegetative cover. This vigorous vegetative cover will\nhelp protect accelerated runoff due to the steep slope by slowing down the velocity of the water\nrunning across that surface.\n5\n"}, {"page": "848", "text": "C. Aspect: Aspect is the actual direction in which the property or specific site faces. Aspect\naffects soil temperature and available soil moisture. South and West facing slopes tend to be\nwarmer and drier, while North and East facing slopes tend to be cooler and more moist. On\nSouth and West facing slopes, mulch is essential to retain moisture and drought tolerant species\nare recommended. South and West facing slopes may also be subject to occasional frost\nheaving due to repeated cycles of freezing and thawing.\nd.\nClimate: The regional climate must be considered when selecting well-adapted species.\nClimatic differences determine the appropriate plant selections based on such factors as cold\nhardiness, tolerance to high temperatures and high humidity, and resistance to insects and\ndisease. Mecklenburg County lies in the southern Piedmont region of the Carolinas, situated\nbetween the Coastal Plain to the east and the Foothills and Mountains to the West. Winter\ntemperatures in the southern Piedmont average 47 degrees. The average low is 30 degrees with\ntemperatures sometimes dropping below 0 degrees. The average summer temperature is 70\ndegrees. The average high is 87 degrees and sometimes tops 100 degrees. The southern\nPiedmont region receives an average of about 45 inches of rainfall annually with the majority\nof rain occurring during the late winter and spring months. Drought conditions may occur\nduring the summer months and must be considered when selecting appropriate species for\nbuffer area planting.\ne.\nManagement: Buffer areas should be established for low to no maintenance. Effective\nbuffers should mimic as closely as possible true natural conditions. Native plants or species\nthat are well adapted to this region should be selected. Longevity of a species is an important\nconsideration, as well as resistance to disease, drought, infestations from pests, etc. Plant\nspecies selected should also require no fertilization on a regular basis.\n3. Approved Plants for Watershed Buffers\nThe following species lists are approved for the Carolinas region in general and need to be matched\nwith local site conditions. This species list is not considered comprehensive and variations from\nthese lists may be permitted with prior approval from MCDEP. The criteria discussed above will\nbe\nused when determining non-listed species for buffer suitability.\na.
