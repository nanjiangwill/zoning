The\nexisting screen must meet the minimum standards for screening established by this\nOrdinance and it must be protected from damage by pedestrians or motor vehicles.\nHowever, the burden to provide the necessary screening remains with the use to be\nscreened and is a continuing obligation that runs with the land so long as the\noriginal use continues in operation.

In order to ensure compliance with this\nOrdinance and reduce the potential expense of replacing landscaping or screening\nmaterials which were installed in an untimely or improper fashion, the developer\nmay provide an adequately secured performance bond or other security to ensure\nthat all of the requirements of this Article will be fulfilled.\n10.24. - 10.29.

When an ordinance\n\"grandfathers\" a luminaire, it means that such already-existing outdoor\nlighting does not need to be changed unless a specified period is specified\nfor adherence to the code.\nHeight of Luminaire: The height of a luminaire shall be the vertical distance from\nthe ground directly below the centerline of the luminaire to the lowest direct-\nlight-emitting part of the luminaire.\nIndirect Light: Direct light that has been reflected or has scattered off of other\nsurfaces.\nLamp: The component of a luminaire that produces the actual light.\n10-39\nArticle 10, Bladenboro Zoning Ordinance\nNovember 13, 2023\n"}, {"page": "279", "text": "Light Trespass: The shining of light produced by a luminaire beyond the boundaries\nof the property on which it is located.\nLumen: A unit of luminous flux.
