The study will enable the City of Boiling Spring Lakes to assess\nthe impact of a proposed development on the highway system when that system is at or near\ncapacity or a safety problem exists. Its purpose is to insure that proposed developments do not\nadversely affect the highway network and to identify any traffic problems associated with\naccess from the site to the existing transportation network. The purpose of the study is also to\nidentify solutions to potential problems and to present improvements to be incorporated into\nthe proposed development.\n7.17.2 Conduct\nA traffic impact study shall be prepared by a qualified professional traffic engineer and/or\ncertified transportation planner with previous traffic study experience. The procedures and\nstandards for the traffic impact study are set forth in Section 7.7.5 of this Article. The traffic\nimpact study shall be referred to NCDOT for review and comment.\nPrior to the preparation of a traffic impact study, a scoping meeting shall be held, including the\nplanning staff, the applicant, and the preparer of the study. The discussion at this meeting\nshould set the study parameters, including the study area, planned and committed roadway\nimprovements (by NCDOT or others), road links and intersections to be analyzed, preliminary\ntraffic distribution, other planned developments to be considered, traffic growth rate, available\ndata, periods for which analysis is to be performed, and other staff concerns.

If an exemption is granted,\ndocumentation of the exemption will be submitted as part of the staff recommendation.\n7.17.4 Capacity Analysis of the Existing System\nAn indication of the adequacy of the existing street system is a comparison of traffic volumes\nversus the ability of the streets to move traffic freely at a desirable speed. The ability of a street\nto move traffic freely, safely, and efficiently with a minimum delay is controlled primarily by the\nspacing of major devices utilized. Thus, the ability of a street to move traffic can be increased\nby restricting parking and turning movements, using proper sign and signal devices, and by the\napplication of other traffic engineering strategies.\nCapacity is the maximum number of vehicles which has a \"reasonable expectation\" of passing\nover a given section of roadway, during a given time period under prevailing roadway and\ntraffic conditions. The relationship of traffic volumes to the capacity of the roadway will\ndetermine the level of service (LOS) being provided. Six levels of service have been selected for\nanalysis purposes. They are given letter designations from A to F with LOS A representing the\nbest operating conditions and LOS F the worst.\n7-26\nCELL (1, 1): \n(A)\nCELL (1, 2): \nLOS A.

Freedom to maneuver is\nnoticeably restricted. Minor incidents may still be absorbed, but the local decline in\nservice will be great. Queues may be expected to form behind any significant blockage.\nMinimum average spacing's are in the range of 220 feet or 11 car lengths.\nCELL (4, 1): \n(D)\nCELL (4, 2): \nLOS D. Borders on unstable flow. Density begins to deteriorate somewhat more quickly\nwith increasing flow. Small increases in flow can cause substantial deterioration in\nservice. Freedom to maneuver is severely limited, and the driver experiences drastically\nreduced comfort levels. Minor incidents can be expected to create substantial queuing.\nAt the limit, vehicles are spaced at about 165 feet or nine car lengths.\nCELL (5, 1): \n(E)\nCELL (5, 2): \nLOS E. Describes operation at capacity. Operations at this level are extremely unstable,\nbecause there are virtually no usable gaps in the traffic system. Any disruption to the\ntraffic stream, such as a vehicle entering from a ramp, or changing lanes, requires the\n"}, {"page": "157", "text": "ARTICLE 7.

At capacity, the traffic stream has no ability to\ndissipate any disruption. Any incident can be expected to produce a serious breakdown with\nextensive queuing. Vehicles are spaced at approximately six car lengths, leaving little room to\nmaneuver.\n(F)\nLOS F. Describes forced or breakdown flow. Such conditions generally exist within\nqueues forming behind breakdown points.\n7.17.5 General Requirements and Standards\nThe traffic impact study shall contain the following information:\n(A)\nGeneral Site Description.

Such uses, structures, lots, signs\nand site features are collectively referred to as \"nonconformities.\" The purpose and intent of\nthis article is to allow nonconformities to continue to exist, but to regulate and limit their\ncontinued existence and expansion so as to bring them into conformity to the extent that is\nreasonably practicable.\n12.1.1 Continuation-MinorRepairs and Maintenance Encouraged\n(A) Continuation. Nonconformities are allowed to continue in accordance with the\nrequirements of this article.\n(B)\nMaintenance Allowed. Nonconformities are allowed and encouraged to receive minor\nrepairs and routine maintenance that are necessary to maintain the nonconformity\nand\nits surroundings in a safe condition and to protect against health hazards.\n(C) Strengthening Allowed. Nothing in this Ordinance shall prevent the strengthening or\nrestoration to a safe or lawful condition of any part of any building or structure declared\nunsafe or unlawful by a duly authorized City official.\n(D) Change of ownership/tenancy. No change of title or possession or right to possession\nof property involved with a nonconformity shall be construed to prevent the continuance\nof such nonconformity.\nSection 12.2 Nonconforming Lots of Record\nThe City of Boiling Spring Lakes has many nonconforming lots of record. These lots were\ncreated prior to a change in the minimum lot size for the subdivision of land - primarily due to\nthe need to provide larger lots for on-site septic systems. Because they are considered to be\nnonconforming does not render them unbuildable nor insinuate a loss of value. Simply, the\nconditions for which subdivision of land occurred in the past is no longer the same. These\nnonconforming lots - which do not meet the minimum lot size or lot width requirements for the\nzoning district in which they are located - are subject to the provisions below. These lots are\nprimarily in residentially zoned areas of the City. NOTE: Please contact the City's Zoning and\nInspections department for specific questions about nonconforming lots.\n12.2.1 Continuation\n(A) Nonconforming Lots under Common Ownership. If the owner of a nonconforming\nlot also owns land that abut said lot, combining a portion of this other land with the\nnonconforming lot will decrease the amount of nonconformity in terms of wide\nand/or area, without thereby creating, or increasing nonconformity on any lot, the\nlots may be combined in accordance with the ordinance.\n(B) Single Lot of Record in a Residential District. When a lot in a residential zoning district\nhas an area or width which does not conform to the dimensional requirements of the\nPage 12-2\n"}, {"page": "271", "text": "ARTICLE 12. NONCONFORMITIES\ndistrict where it is located, but was of record as of the effective date of this ordinance, any use\npermitted in the zoning district within which the lot is located may be constructed, subject to\ncompliance with setback standards and all other requirements of this ordinance.\n(C) Single Lot of Record in a Nonresidential District. When a lot in a nonresidential district\nhas an area or width which does not conform to the dimensional requirements of the\ndistrict where it is located, but was of record as of the effective date of this ordinance,\nthen development on the lot may be permitted, subject to compliance with all required\nsetbacks, and all other applicable development and design standards.\nSection 12.3 Nonconforming Uses\nThe lawful use of building or premises existing at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance\nmay be continued although such use does not conform with the provisions of this Ordinance,\nand such a building may be reconstructed or structurally altered and nonconforming uses\ntherein changed subject to the following regulations:\n(A)\nConversion. No nonconforming use shall be changed to another nonconforming use\nunless the use is determined by the UDO Administrator to be of equal or less intensity or\ndensity. A nonconforming use must continue to occupy the same lot or plot of land. In\ndetermining whether a nonconforming use is of equal or less intensity or density, the\nUDO Administrator shall consider:\n(1) Anticipated traffic of each use\n(2) Parking requirements of each use\n(3) Anticipated number of persons on the premises of each use at a time of peak demand;\n(4) The number of dwelling units\n(5) Off-site impacts of each use, such as noise, glare, dust, vibration, or smoke.\n(B)\nExtension and enlargement. A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any\nportion of a completed building that, when the use was made nonconforming by this\nOrdinance, was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use. A\nnonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings, new buildings, or to\nland outside the original building.\n(C)\nThe structural alterations made in a nonconforming use shall not result in enlargement\nunless the use therein is changed to a conforming use; provided, however, that\nnonconforming uses damaged by fire, explosion, tornado, earthquake, hurricane or similar\nuncontrollable cause, may be repaired or rebuilt within one hundred eighty (180) days\nof the date of such damage, but not thereafter.\n(E) If a nonconforming use of land ceases for more than one hundred eighty (180) days,\nany further use of the land, building, or premises shall be of a use permitted within the zoning\ndistrict for which it is located. This shall be construed to be mean that where a residential or\nnonresidential use in unoccupied for a period of more than one hundred eighty (180), then any\nfurther use of the premise shall be in accordance with the uses permitted within the zoning\ndistrict for which it is located.\nPage 12-3\n"}, {"page": "272", "text": "ARTICLE 12.

Nonconforming residential development subject to damage\nby fire, explosion, tornado, earthquake, hurricane or similar uncontrollable cause may\nbe reconstructed in the same location and with the same footprint as existed prior to\ndamage. In no instance shall replacement of a nonconforming residential structure\nincrease the nonconformity or result in a larger structure than existed prior to\ndamage.\n(B) Nonresidential Development\n(1) After Damage in Excess of 50 Percent of Building Value. In the event of damage\nby fire or other causes to an extent exceeding 50 percent of its building value\nprior to such damage, as established by the applicable County tax listing,\nreconstruction of a nonconforming structure shall be permitted only in\ncompliance with the applicable dimensional requirements of this Ordinance.\n(2) After Damage Less Than 50 Percent of Building Value. In the event of damage\nby fire or other causes to an extent not exceeding 50 percent of its building\nvalue prior to such damage, as established by the applicable County tax listing,\nreconstruction of a nonconforming structure shall be permitted, provided it is\nconstructed:\n(a) In accordance with a previously approved site plan or building permit,\nas applicable.\n(b) In the same location and up to the same dimensions as originally\nexisted.\n(c) In compliance with the current dimensional requirements.\n12.4.2 Enlargement and Relocation\n(A)\nNo such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity.\n(B)\nShould such a structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall\nhereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.\nPage 12-4\n"}, {"page": "273", "text": "ARTICLE 12. NONCONFORMITIES\nSection 12.5 Nonconforming Sites\n(A) For purposes of this section, the term \"nonconforming site features\" includes the following:\n(1) Nonconforming off-street parking\n(2) Nonconforming sidewalks\n(3) Nonconforming landscaping\n(4) Nonconforming perimeter buffers\n(5) Nonconforming screening walls or fences\n(6) Nonconforming lighting.\n(B) If an application is filed for a building permit (including mechanical, electrical, HVAC, or\nother typical permit) for the remodeling or expansion of a structure and the development\nsite contains one or more nonconforming site features identified in Subsection (A) above,\nand the value of the proposed improvements totals at least 25 percent of the assessed\nvalue of the existing structure, the applicant shall be required to address the\nnonconforming site feature as provided in this section.\n(C) For purposes of determining if upgrading of nonconforming site features is required by this\nsubsection, the cost of the remodeling shall be as shown on the approved building permit\napplication. Assessed value shall be based on the most recently available Brunswick County\ntax records.\n12.5.1 Remodeling of Buildings or Structures\nIf a building permit is required for interior or exterior remodeling of the building or structure,\nthe remodeling or redevelopment shall require correction of existing on-site nonconforming\noff-street parking, landscaping, perimeter buffer, screening, and signage in accordance with\nthis section.\n(A) 25 Percent or Less of Structure Value. Remodeling in any continuous one-year period that\ncosts 25 percent or less of the current assessed value of the structure shall not require any\ncorrection to nonconforming site aspects.\n(B) More Than 25 Percent but Less Than 75 Percent of Structure Value. Remodeling in any\ncontinuous one-year period that costs more than 25 percent but less than 75 percent of\nthe current assessed value of the structure shall require that a corresponding percentage\nof the off-street parking, landscaping, perimeter buffer, screening, and signage standards\nof this Ordinance be installed or upgraded on the site, until the site achieves 100 percent\ncompliance. Sidewalk installation, if applicable, is not required.\n(1) Example: A hypothetical building is required to provide at least 40 off-street\nparking spaces, but the building site only includes 20 spaces. If the building is\nPage 12-5\n"}, {"page": "274", "text": "ARTICLE 12. NONCONFORMITIES\nremodeled such that the cost of remodeling equals 30 percent of the building's assessed value,\nthe remodeling project must add 12 parking spaces (30% X 40 required spaces). This increases\nthe development's degree of compliance with off-street parking standards from 50 percent (20\nof 40 required spaces) to 80 percent (32 of 40 required spaces).\n(C) 75 Percent or More of Structure Value. Remodeling projects that cost 75 percent or\nmore of the current assessed value of the structure shall require 100 percent\ncompliance with the off-street parking, sidewalk, landscaping, perimeter buffer,\nscreening, and signage standards of this Ordinance.\n(D) Five or Fewer Additional Parking Spaces. When five or fewer additional off-street\nparking spaces are required under this subsection as a result of a remodeling project,\nsuch additional off-street parking is not required to be installed.\n12.5.2 Additions or Expansions\nAdditions and expansions to structures on nonconforming sites shall require correction of\nexisting on-site nonconforming off-street parking, landscaping, perimeter buffer, screening,\nand signage standards in accordance with this section. Additions to, and expansions of, existing\nstructures which are nonconforming as to setbacks must meet current setback requirements.\n(A) Expansion of 50 Percent or Less of Gross Square Footage Over One Year. Expansions\nin any continuous one-year period, which result in a 50 percent or less increase in the\ngross square footage of the existing structure (measured at the beginning of the one-\nyear period), require that a corresponding percentage of the off-street parking,\nlandscaping, perimeter buffer, screening, and signage standards of this Ordinance be\ninstalled or upgraded on the site, until the site achieves 100 percent compliance.\nSidewalk installation, if applicable, is not required.\n(1) Example: if the addition is 25 percent of the area of the existing structure and\nthe site contains only 50 percent of the required landscaping, 25 percent of the\nrequired landscaping for the entire site must be provided, thereby bringing the\nlandscaping on the site to 75 percent of the total required. Existing landscaping\non the site shall be retained or replaced but shall not count toward the required\npercentage of new landscaping.\n(B) Expansion of Greater Than 50 Percent of Gross Square Footage Over One Year.\nExpansions over any continuous one-year period, which result in a greater than 50\npercent increase of the gross square footage of the existing structure (measured at the\nbeginning of the one-year period), require the entire property to meet all of the off-\nstreet parking, sidewalk, landscaping, perimeter buffer, screening, and signage\nstandards of this Ordinance.\nSection 12.6 Nonconforming Signs\nSigns which were in existence prior to the effective date of this ordinance, which do not conform\nto the provisions of this article are declared nonconforming signs.
