Section 18.4.2, Use Classifications, Categories, and Types, organizes principal uses by\nuse classifications, use categories, and use types to provide a systematic basis for identifying, describing,\ncategorizing, consolidating, and distinguishing land uses to determine whether a specific use is permitted in a\nparticular zoning district.\n1.\nUse Classifications. The use classifications identify broad classifications of land use and include residential\nuses, institutional uses, commercial uses, and industrial uses. Use classifications are further broken down into\na series of general \"use categories\" and specific \"use types.\"\n2.\nUse Categories. The use categories describe the major sub-groups of the respective use classifications and\nare based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity,\nthe type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site conditions. For\nexample, the Residential Use Classification is divided into the Household Living and Group Living use\ncategories. Use categories are further broken down into a series of individual \"use types.\"\n3.\nUse Types. The specific use types are included in the respective use category. They identify the specific\nprincipal uses that are considered to fall within characteristics identified in the use category. For example,\nsingle-family detached dwellings, duplex dwellings, multi-family dwellings, manufactured homes, and upper-\nstory residential are use types in the Household Living use category.\n4.\nDevelopments with Multiple Principal Uses. When all principal uses of a development fall within one (1) use\ncategory, the entire development is assigned to that use category. When the principal uses of a development\nfall within different use categories, then each principal use is classified in the applicable use category and\neach use is subject to applicable regulations for that use category. Developments with multiple principal uses,\nsuch as shopping centers, shall incorporate only those use types allowed in the applicable zoning district.\n5.\nTable Organization. The characteristics use types, and exceptions of each of the use categories Table 18.4.1.G,\nPrincipal Use Table, are listed in the following tables. Table 18.4.2, Use Classification, below shows how the\ninformation is organized.\n18.4.3. - Residential Use Classification.\nTable 18.4.3, Residential Use Classification, sets out the use categories and use types included in the\nresidential use classification in Table 18.4.1.G, Principal Use Table.
