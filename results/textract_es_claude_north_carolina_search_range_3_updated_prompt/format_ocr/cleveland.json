That notwithstanding, only the\nCleveland Town Board shall have the authority to issue a conditional use permit in association\nwith a request for a reclassification to a CU zoning district. The Conditional Use Permit\napproved by the Town Board shall contain conditions and site-specific standards limited to those\nthat assure conformance of the development and the use of the site to this Ordinance and other\nplans adopted by the Town Board and to obtain sufficient compatibility with surrounding\nproperties. Any use permitted under this process must also conform, at a minimum, to the\ndevelopment regulations for the corresponding general zoning district.

Rezoning of property to a\nparallel conditional use district is a voluntary procedure on the part of the property owner and is\nintended for firm development proposals.

No parallel conditional use\ndistrict shall be established until (1) the owner(s) of the property(ies) in question (or his\nauthorized agent) proposing the district has submitted an application for the rezoning of the\nproperty and issuance of a conditional use permit and (2) the Town Board has approved both the\nrezoning of the property to a CU district and the issuance of a conditional use permit.\nFollowing the approval of a parallel conditional use district and conditional use permit, the\n54\nCELL (1, 1): \nCU-R15\nCELL (1, 2): \nCU-M1\nCELL (2, 1): \nCU-CBD\nCELL (2, 2): \nCU-M2\nCELL (3, 1): \nCU-GBD\nCELL (3, 2): \nCU-A1\n"}, {"page": "55", "text": "Zoning Ordinance of the Town of Cleveland, N.C.\nArticle VI\nproperty for which approval was granted shall be identified on the Official Zoning Map by the\nappropriate parallel conditional use (CU) district designation (i.e., CU-M1)\nPlans and Other Information to Accompany Petition\nEvery application for the rezoning of property to a parallel conditional use district and\nissuance of a conditional use permit shall be accompanied by a site plan, drawn to scale, and any\nnecessary supporting information together which conform to all the requirements set forth in\nArticle XI, Section 10.1, and, when requested, such additional information that may be required\npursuant to Article XI, Section 10.2.
