Purpose\nConditional Zoning districts are zoning districts in which the development and use of the\nproperty is subject to predetermined ordinance standards and the rules, regulations, and\nconditions imposed as part of the legislative decision creating the district and applying it to the\nparticular property.\nSome land uses are of such a nature or scale that they have significant impacts on both the\nimmediate surrounding area and on the entire community, which cannot be predetermined and\ncontrolled by general district standards. The review process established in this Ordinance\nprovides for accommodation of such uses by a reclassification of property into a conditional\nzoning district, subject to specific conditions, which ensure compatibility of the use with\nneighboring properties. A conditional zoning district is not intended for securing early zoning\nfor a proposal, except when that proposal is consistent with an approved land use plan or the\nproposal can demonstrate that public infrastructure needed to serve the development will be\nmade available within a reasonable time period.\n5.2\nConditional Zoning Districts\nA.

It affords\nan opportunity to soften the impact of new development. Therefore, it is important that the\nlandscape plan demonstrate clearly thought-out goals. There are many possible approaches to\nachieving the degree of screening necessary for the various conditional zoning districts. A\nclearly stated rationale should accompany the landscaping plan that explains how the plan both\nserves the needs of the project and fits in with the rural Chatham County setting. For example,\nsome factors that may be addressed are as follows:\nSite conditions such as the amount of sun or shade, slope, and wet or dry areas\nRepresentative native species of both canopy and under story trees to provide continuity\nwith wooded areas nearby\nPlants that provide screening in cold seasons\nCost and maintenance considerations\nGrowth rates\nFlowering species that can benefit both passersby and beneficial insects.\nLandscaping plants shall be selected from the Chatham County Design Guidelines that are, for\nthe most part, a naturally occurring species and arrangement for the area. The use of non-\nnaturally occurring and rare plantings is not discouraged for \"specimen\" and \"contrast\" plantings.\nA landscaping plan must be submitted to the County with every non-residential\napplication. Landscaping refers to topography, trees, shrubs, grass, and\nvegetation.

Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance. It\nshall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no\nreasonable use can be made of the property.\nb. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as\nlocation, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as\nwell as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or\nthe general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance.\nC. The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner.\nThe act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may\njustify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.\nd. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the\nordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.\n2. Furthermore, the board of adjustment must make such findings of fact to substantiate all\nof these requirements. In considering applications for variances from the provisions of\nthis Ordinance, demonstration of financial disadvantage alone shall not constitute\nconclusive evidence of unnecessary hardship.\n3.

Permit Choice\nIf a land development regulation is amended between the time a development permit application\nwas submitted and a development permit decision is made or if a land development regulation\nis\namended after a development permit decision has been challenged and found to be wrongfully\ndenied or illegal, G.S. 143-755 applies.\nB. Vested Rights\nAmendments in land development regulations are not applicable or enforceable without the\nwritten consent of the owner with regard to any of the following:\n(1) Buildings or uses of buildings or land for which a development permit application has\nbeen submitted and subsequently issued in accordance with G.S. 143-755.\n(2) Subdivisions of land for which a development permit application authorizing the\nsubdivision has been submitted and subsequently issued in accordance with G.S. 143-\n755.\n(3) A site-specific vesting plan pursuant to G.S. 160D-108.1.\n(4) A multi-phased development pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.\n(5) A vested right established by the terms of a development agreement pursuant to\n160D-403.\nThe establishment of a vested right under any subdivision of this subsection does not preclude\nvesting under one or more other subdivisions of this subsection or vesting by application of\ncommon law principles. A vested right, once established as provided for in this section or by\ncommon law, precludes any action by a local government that would change, alter, impair,\nprevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the property allowed by the\napplicable land development regulation or regulations, except where a change in State or federal\nlaw mandating local government enforcement occurs after the development application is\nsubmitted that has a fundamental and retroactive effect on the development or use.\nC. Duration of Vesting.\nUpon issuance of a development permit, the statutory vesting granted by subsection (B) of this\nsection for a development project is effective upon filing of the application in accordance with\nG.S. 143-755, for SO long as the permit remains valid pursuant to law. Unless otherwise specified\nby this section or other statute, local development permits expire one year after issuance unless\nwork authorized by the permit has substantially commenced. A local land development\nregulation may provide for a longer permit expiration period. For the purposes of this section, a\npermit is issued either in the ordinary course of business of the applicable governmental agency\nor by the applicable governmental agency as a court directive. Except where a longer vesting\nperiod is provided by statute or land development regulation, the statutory vesting granted by this\nsection, once established, expires for an uncompleted development project if development work\nis intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than 24 consecutive months,\nand the statutory vesting period granted by this section for a nonconforming use of property\nexpires if the use is intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than 24\nconsecutive months. The 24-month discontinuance period is automatically tolled during the\npendency of any board of adjustment proceeding or civil action in a State or federal trial or\nappellate court regarding the validity of a development permit, the use of the property, or the\nexistence of the statutory vesting period granted by this section. The 24-month discontinuance\nPage 113\n"}, {"page": "122", "text": "Chatham County Zoning Ordinance\nperiod is also tolled during the pendency of any litigation involving the development project or\nproperty that is the subject of the vesting.\nD. Multiple Permits for Development Project\nSubject to subsection (C) of this section, where multiple local development permits are required\nto complete a development project, the development permit applicant may choose the version of\neach of the local land development regulations applicable to the project upon submittal of the\napplication for the initial development permit. This provision is applicable only for those\nsubsequent development permit applications filed within 18 months of the date following the\napproval of an initial permit. For purposes of the vesting protections of this subsection, an\nerosion and sedimentation control permit or a sign permit is not an initial development permit.\nE. Multi-Phased Development\nA multi-phased development is vested for the entire development with the land development\nregulations then in place at the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the\nmulti-phased development. A right which has been vested as provided for in this subsection\nremains vested for a period of seven years from the time a site plan approval is granted for the\ninitial phase of the multi-phased development\nF. Continuing Review\nFollowing issuance of a development permit, a local government may make subsequent\ninspections and reviews to ensure compliance with applicable land development regulations in\neffect at the time of the original application.\nG. Process to Claim Vested Right\nA person claiming a statutory or common law vested right may submit information to\nsubstantiate that claim to the zoning administrator or other officer designated by a land\ndevelopment regulation, who shall make an initial determination as to the existence of the vested\nright. The decision of the zoning administrator or officer may be appealed under G.S. 160D-405.\nOn appeal, the existence of a vested right shall be reviewed de novo. In lieu of seeking such a\ndetermination or pursuing an appeal under G.S. 160D-405, a person claiming a vested right may\nbring an original civil action as provided by G.S. 160D-1403.1.\nH. Miscellaneous Provisions\nThe vested rights granted by this section run with the land except for the use of land for outdoor\nadvertising governed by G.S. 136-131.1 and G.S. 136-131.2 in which case the rights granted by\nthis section run with the owner of a permit issued by the North Carolina Department of\nTransportation. Nothing in this section precludes judicial determination, based on common law\nprinciples or other statutory provisions, that a vested right exists in a particular case or that a\ncompensable taking has occurred. Except as expressly provided in 160D-108, nothing in this\nsection shall be construed to alter the existing common law.\n19.13 Vested Rights and Site Specific Vesting Plans\nA. Site-Specific Vesting Plan -\nConsists of a plan submitted to a local government in which the applicant requests vesting\npursuant to this section, describing with reasonable certainty on the plan the type and intensity of\nuse for a specific parcel or parcels of property. The plan may be in the form of, but not be limited\nto, any of the following plans or approvals: a planned unit development plan, a subdivision plat,\na preliminary or general development plan, a special use permit, a conditional district zoning\nplan, or any other land-use approval designation as may be utilized by a local government.\nUnless otherwise expressly provided by the local government, the plan shall include the\napproximate boundaries of the site; significant topographical and other natural features affecting\nPage 114\n"}, {"page": "123", "text": "Chatham County Zoning Ordinance\ndevelopment of the site; the approximate location on the site of the proposed buildings,\nstructures, and other improvements; the approximate dimensions, including height, of the\nproposed buildings and other structures; and the approximate location of all existing and\nproposed infrastructure on the site, including water, sewer, roads, and pedestrian walkways.\nWhat constitutes a site-specific vesting plan under this section that would trigger a vested right\nshall be finally determined by the local government pursuant to a development regulation, and\nthe document that triggers the vesting shall be SO identified at the time of its approval. A variance\ndoes not constitute a site-specific vesting plan, and approval of a site-specific vesting plan with\nthe condition that a variance be obtained does not confer a vested right unless and until the\nnecessary variance is obtained. If a sketch plan or other document fails to describe with\nreasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property, it\nmay not constitute a site-specific vesting plan.\nB. Establishment of Vested Right -\nA vested right is established with respect to any property upon the valid approval, or conditional\napproval, of a site-specific vesting plan as provided in this section. Such a vested right confers\nupon the landowner the right to undertake and complete the development and use of the property\nunder the terms and conditions of the site-specific vesting plan, including any amendments\nthereto.\nC. Approval and Amendment of Plans -\nIf a site-specific vesting plan is based on an approval required by a local development regulation,\nthe local government shall provide whatever notice and hearing is required for that underlying\napproval. A duration of the underlying approval that is less than two years does not affect the\nduration of the site-specific vesting plan established under this section. If the site-specific vesting\nplan is not based on such an approval, a legislative hearing with notice as required by G.S. 160D-\n602 shall be held. A local government may approve a site-specific vesting plan upon any terms\nand conditions that may reasonably be necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.\nConditional approval results in a vested right, although failure to abide by the terms and\nconditions of the approval will result in a forfeiture of vested rights. A local government shall\nnot require a landowner to waive the landowner's vested rights as a condition of developmental\napproval. A site-specific vesting plan is deemed approved upon the effective date of the local\ngovernment's decision approving the plan or another date determined by the governing board\nupon approval. An approved site-specific vesting plan and its conditions may be amended with\nthe approval of the owner and the local government as follows: any substantial modification\nmust be reviewed and approved in the same manner as the original approval; minor\nmodifications may be approved by staff, if such are defined and authorized by local regulation.\nD. Continuing Review -\nFollowing approval or conditional approval of a site-specific vesting plan, a local government\nmay make subsequent reviews and require subsequent approvals by the local government to\nensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval, provided that these\nreviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original approval. The local government\nmay, pursuant to G.S. 160D-403(f), revoke the original approval for failure to comply with\napplicable terms and conditions of the original approval or the applicable local development\nregulations.\nE. Duration and Termination of Vested Right -\n(1) A vested right for a site-specific vesting plan remains vested for a period of two years. This\nvesting shall not be extended by any amendments or modifications to a site-specific vesting plan\nunless expressly provided by the local government.\nPage 115\n"}, {"page": "124", "text": "Chatham County Zoning Ordinance\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, a local government may\nprovide for rights to be vested for a period exceeding two years but not exceeding five years\nwhere warranted in light of all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the size and\nphasing of development, the level of investment, the need for the development, economic cycles,\nand market conditions or other considerations. These determinations are in the sound discretion\nof the local government and shall be made following the process specified for the particular form\nof a site-specific vesting plan involved in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.\n(3) Upon issuance of a building permit, the provisions of G.S. 160D-1111 and G.S. 160D-1115\napply, except that a permit does not expire and shall not be revoked because of the running of\ntime while a vested right under this section is outstanding.\n(4) A right vested as provided in this section terminates at the end of the applicable vesting\nperiod with respect to buildings and uses for which no valid building permit applications have\nbeen filed.\nF. Subsequent Changes Prohibited; Exceptions-\n(1) A vested right, once established as provided for in this section, precludes any zoning action\nby a local government which would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay\nthe development or use of the property as set forth in an approved site-specific vesting plan,\nexcept under one or more of the following conditions:\na. With the written consent of the affected landowner.\nb. Upon findings, by ordinance after notice and an evidentiary hearing, that natural or\nman-made hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would\npose a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare if the project were to\nproceed as contemplated in the site-specific vesting plan.\nC. To the extent that the affected landowner receives compensation for all costs, expenses,\nand other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but not limited to, all fees paid in\nconsideration of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and other\nconsulting fees incurred after approval by the local government, together with interest as\nprovided under G.S. 160D-106. Compensation shall not include any diminution in the\nvalue of the property which is caused by the action.\nd. Upon findings, by ordinance after notice and an evidentiary hearing, that the\nlandowner or the landowner's representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information\nor made material misrepresentations that made a difference in the approval by the local\ngovernment of the site-specific vesting plan or the phased development plan.\ne. Upon the enactment or promulgation of a State or federal law or regulation that\nprecludes development as contemplated in the site-specific vesting plan or the phased\ndevelopment plan, in which case the local government may modify the affected\nprovisions, upon a finding that the change in State or federal law has a fundamental effect\non the plan, by ordinance after notice and an evidentiary hearing.\n(2) The establishment of a vested right under this section does not preclude the application of\noverlay zoning or other development regulations which impose additional requirements but do\nnot affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations which are general in\nnature and are applicable to all property subject to development regulation by a local\ngovernment, including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical\ncodes. Otherwise applicable new regulations become effective with respect to property which is\nsubject to a site-specific vesting plan upon the expiration or termination of the vesting rights\nperiod provided for in this section.\nPage 116\n"}, {"page": "125", "text": "Chatham County Zoning Ordinance\n(3) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the establishment of a vested right does not\npreclude, change, or impair the authority of a local government to adopt and enforce\ndevelopment regulations governing nonconforming situations or uses.\nG. Miscellaneous Provisions -\n(1) A vested right obtained under this section is not a personal right, but attaches to and runs with\nthe applicable property. After approval of a site-specific vesting plan, all successors to the\noriginal landowner are entitled to exercise these rights.\n(2) Nothing in this section precludes judicial determination, based on common law principles or\nother statutory provisions, that a vested right exists in a particular case or that a compensable\ntaking has occurred. Except as expressly provided in this section, nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued to alter the existing common law.\n(3) In the event a local government fails to adopt a development regulation setting forth what\nconstitutes a site-specific vesting plan triggering a vested right, a landowner may establish a\nvested right with respect to property upon the approval of a zoning permit, or otherwise may\nseek appropriate relief from the Superior Court Division of the General Court of Justice.'\nPage 117\n"}, {"page": "126", "text": "Chatham County Zoning Ordinance\nSECTION 20\nENFORCEMENT\n20.1.
