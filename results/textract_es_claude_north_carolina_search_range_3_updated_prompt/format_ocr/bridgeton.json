Front setback distances shall be measured from the right-of-way along a line perpendicular thereto; and at the\nrequired distance a line parallel to the right-of-way shall set off an area (the front yard) within which no structure is\npermitted. For irregular lots, the front setback shall be measured at the midpoint of the lot by a line perpendicular\nto the building front; the intersecting line at right angles marks the front yard. Similarly, side setbacks shall be\nidentified by lines parallel to the sidelines and mark side yards. The rear setback line shall be parallel to the front\nsetback line at the prescribed distance from the rear lot line; if the lot where a line perpendicular to the front\nsetback shall be measured at the center of the lot where a line perpendicular to the front setback line intersects\nthe rear lot line. No structure except for fences or walls plus accessory structure in side or rear yards is permitted\nin front, side or rear yards. See 155.017 and Appendix B, including Note 11.\n2. See 155.017. Corner lot setbacks shall be not less than 20 feet. This is to ensure a safe line of sight distance\nby motorists approaching the intersection.\n3. Exception is made for flagpoles, chimneys, antennas, air conditioning and heating equipment, satellite dishes,\nand parapet walls not exceeding 3 feet above the roof line.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (1, 6): \nSetbacks - feet\nCELL (1, 7): \nCELL (1, 8): \nCELL (1, 9): \nMax Lot\nCover\nCELL (1, 10): \nCELL (2, 1): \nDistrict\nCELL (2, 2): \nFront\n(Ft.)\nCELL (2, 3): \nArea\n(Sq.
