Water and/or\nwastewater allocations are only required for projects proposing to establish new water and/or\nwastewater connections or to increase the volume of existing water and/or wastewater\nconnections.\nB. The grant of a water and/or wastewater allocation does not create a property right in the\nallocation. Once granted, an allocation is not transferrable to any other person or entity without\nthe express consent of the SGWASA Board, provided, however, that once a project is completed\nno allocations shall be forfeited solely on account of a change in ownership in a project or part\nthereof, except as otherwise provided in the Allocation Policy.\nC.\nWater and wastewater allocations shall be issued on a first-come-first-served basis.\nD.\nThe City shall concur in each allocation request prior to approval by SGWASA if,\n1.\nA complete allocation request form has been submitted along with all other required\ndocuments, and all applicable fees have been paid;\n2.\nThe requested development complies with all applicable City ordinances; and\n3.\nThe SGWASA system continues to have sufficient capacity to adequately provide the\nrequested service(s);\n7-14.2 Allocation Process.\nA.

Except as allowed under Minor Modifications below, all changes to approved\nlarge site plans, conditional zoning districts, special use permits, and/or other development approvals are major\namendments and shall follow the same process applicable for the original approval.\n7.15-2 CHANGES TO INDIVIDUAL PARCELS WITHIN A CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICT. For a conditional zoning\ndistrict applicable to multiple parcels, the owners of individual parcels may apply for minor modification or\nmajor amendment so long as the change would not result in other properties failing to meet the terms and\nconditions of the conditional zoning district. Any approved changes shall only be applicable to those properties\nwhose owners petitioned for the change.\n7.15-3 MINOR MODIFICATIONS. The Planning, Zoning and Subdivision Administrator is authorized to review\nand approve administratively a minor modification to an approved large site plan, conditional zoning district,\nspecial use permit, and/or other development approval, subject to the following limitations.\nA. GENERAL LIMITATIONS. The minor modification:\n1. Does not involve a change in uses permitted or the density of overall development\npermitted;\n2. Does not increase the impacts generated by the development on traffic, stormwater runoff,\nor similar impacts beyond what was projected for the original development approval;\n3. Meets all other ordinance requirements and can not deviate from Creedmoor Development\nOrdinance standards enforced throughout the City of Creedmoor and its planning and zoning\njurisdiction; and\n4. Must be petitioned for through a formal application to the Planning, Zoning and Subdivision\nAdministrator. The application must present a sound, reasonable basis for requesting the\nminor modification.\nB. SITE DESIGN. Site design minor modifications are limited adjustments to the terms or design of an\napproved development plan or plat, including a site plan attached as a condition to a conditional zoning\nor special use permit. In addition to the general limitations for minor modifications, a site design minor\nmodification must:\n1. Comply with underlying zoning standards and other applicable conditions of the approval;\n2. Be limited to a minor change such as, without limitation, a minor adjustment to road\nconfiguration or internal circulation, a minor adjustment to building location, or a minor\nadjustment to utility alignment.\nC. DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS. Dimensional standard minor modifications are adjustments to the\ndimensional standards of the zoning ordinance. Dimensional standards may only be modified upon a\nfinding by the Planning, Zoning and Subdivision Administrator, based on evidence from the permit\nholder, that the modification is needed to address a site characteristic or technical design consideration\nnot known at the time of initial approval. In addition to the general limitations for minor modifications,\ndimensional standard minor modifications are limited to:\n1. An adjustment to parking requirements up to the greater of two (2) parking spaces or ten\npercent (10%).\n2. An adjustment to setback requirements up to the greater of two (2) feet or ten percent\nArticle 7 - Page 23\n"}, {"page": "91", "text": "(10%) of the standard setback.\n3. An adjustment to landscape standards up to ten percent (10%) of required landscaping.\n7.15-4 APPEALS AND VARIANCES. A decision on minor modification may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment as an\nadministrative determination. An application for a minor modification does not preclude an applicant from seeking a\nvariance from the Board of Adjustment.\n7.16\nNotices and Public Hearings\n7.16-1 GENERAL NOTICE REQUIREMENTS.\nA. All notices which this chapter requires for public hearings or public meetings shall identify the date,\ntime and place of the public hearing/public and the nature and character of the proposed\naction. Where the action being taken concerns a particular property or properties, the notice shall\nalso identify the location of the subject property.\nB.\nWhere specific notice requirements are set forth in the North Carolina General Statutes for a\nparticular type of public hearing, the requirements set forth in the North Carolina General Statutes\nshall be followed. Where these requirements conflict with procedures as stipulated in this\nsubsection or elsewhere in this chapter, the requirements contained in the North Carolina General\nStatutes will control.\n7.16-2 NOTICE PROCEDURE. The following guidelines detail the notification procedure to be followed for\npublic hearings or public meetings required by this chapter unless otherwise set forth in this chapter.\nFailure to follow procedures set forth in this section, other than those required by the North Carolina\nGeneral Statutes, shall not affect the validity of any action taken at a public hearing or public meeting.\nA.

The State of North Carolina recognizes that the approval of development typically follows\nsignificant investment in site evaluation, planning, development costs, consultant fees, and related expenses. The State\nfinds that it is necessary and desirable to provide for the establishment of certain vested rights in order to ensure\nreasonable certainty, stability, and fairness in the development regulation process, to secure the reasonable expectations\nof landowners, and to foster cooperation between the public and private sectors in land-use planning and development\nregulation.\n7.17-2 PERMIT CHOICE. If a development permit applicant submits a permit application for any type of\ndevelopment and a rule or ordinance is amended, including an amendment to any applicable land\nArticle 7 - Page 24\n"}, {"page": "92", "text": "development regulation, between the time the development permit application was submitted and a\ndevelopment permit decision is made, the development permit applicant may choose which adopted\nversion of the rule or ordinance will apply to the permit and use of the building, structure, or land\nindicated on the permit application, per G.S. 160D-108(b) and G.S. 143-755. If the development permit\napplicant chooses the version of the rule or ordinance applicable at the time of the permit application,\nthe development permit application shall not be required to await the outcome of the amendment to\nthe rule, map, or ordinance prior to acting on the development permit. If an applicable rule or\nordinance is amended after the development permit is wrongfully denied or after an illegal condition\nis imposed, as determined in a proceeding challenging the permit denial or the condition imposed, the\ndevelopment permit applicant may choose which adopted version of the rule or ordinance will apply\nto the permit and use of the building, structure, or land indicated on the permit application. Provided,\nhowever, any provision of the development permit applicant's chosen version of the rule or ordinance\nthat is determined to be illegal for any reason shall not be enforced upon the applicant without written\nconsent of the applicant. An application for one development permit triggers permit choice for permits\nunder any development regulation; such permit choice is valid for eighteen (18) months after approval\nof the initial application.\nIf a permit application is placed on hold at the request of the applicant for a period of six (6) consecutive\nmonths or more, or the applicant fails to respond to comments or provide additional information\nreasonably requested by the City of Creedmoor for a period of six (6) consecutive months or more, the\napplication review is discontinued and the development regulations in effect at the time the permit\nprocessing is resumed apply to the application.\n7.17-3 VESTED RIGHTS. A vested right, once established as provided for in G.S. 160D-108, precludes any action\nby the City of Creedmoor that would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the\ndevelopment or use of the property allowed by the applicable land development regulation, except\nwhere a change in State or federal law mandating local government enforcement occurs after the\ndevelopment application is submitted that has a fundamental and retroactive effect on the\ndevelopment or use.\nAmendments in land development regulations are not applicable or enforceable without the written\nconsent of the owner with regard to any of the following:\n1. Buildings or uses of buildings or land for which a development permit application has been submitted\nand subsequently issued in accordance with G.S. 143-755.\n2. Subdivisions of land for which a development permit application authorizing the subdivision has\nbeen submitted and subsequently issued in accordance with G.S. 143-755.\n3. A site-specific vesting plan pursuant to G.S. 160D-108.1.\n4. A multi-phased development pursuant to G.S. 160D-108(f).\n5. A vested right established by the terms of a development agreement authorized by G.S. 160D-1001-\n1012.\nA. DURATION OF VESTING. Upon issuance of a development permit, the statutory vesting for a\ndevelopment project is effective upon filing of the application in accordance with G.S. 143-755, for so\nlong as the permit remains valid pursuant to law. Unless otherwise specified, local development\npermits expire one (1) year after issuance unless work authorized by the permit has substantially\ncommenced. A local land development regulation may provide for a longer permit expiration period.\nFor the purposes of this section, a permit is issued either in the ordinary course of business of the\napplicable government agency or by the applicable government agency as a court directive.\nExcept where a longer vesting period is provided by statute or land development regulation, the\nstatutory vesting granted by this section, once established, expires for an uncompleted development\nproject if development work is intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than\ntwenty-four (24) consecutive months, and the statutory vesting period granted by this section for a\nArticle 7 - Page 25\n"}, {"page": "93", "text": "nonconforming use of property expires if the use is intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a\nperiod of not less than twenty-four (24) consecutive months.\nB. MULTIPLE PERMITS FOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. Where multiple local development permits are\nrequired to complete a development project, the development permit applicant may choose the\nversion of each of the local development regulations applicable to the project upon submittal of the\napplication for the initial development permit. This provision is applicable only for those subsequent\ndevelopment permit applications filed within eighteen (18) months of the date following the approval\nof an initial permit. For purposes of the vesting protections of this section, an erosion and\nsedimentation control permit or a sign permit is not an initial development permit.\nC. MULTI-PHASED DEVELOPMENT. A multi-phased development is vested for the entire development\nwith the land development regulations then in place at the time a site plan approval is granted for the\ninitial phase of the multi-phase development. A right which has been vested as provided for in this\nsubsection remains vested for a period of seven years from the time a site plan approval is granted for\nthe initial phase of the multi-phased development, per G.S. 160D-108(f).\nD. SITE-SPECIFIC VESTING PLANS. A site-specific vesting plan consists of a plan submitted to the City of\nCreedmoor in which the applicant requests vesting pursuant to this section, describing with reasonable\ncertainty on the plan the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of property. The plan\nmay be in the form of, but not be limited to, any of the following plans or approvals: a planned unit\ndevelopment plan, a subdivision plat, a preliminary or general development plan, a special use permit,\na conditional zoning district plan, or any other land-use approval designation as may be utilized by the\nCity of Creedmoor. Unless otherwise expressly provided by the City of Creedmoor, the plan shall\ninclude the approximate boundaries of the site; significant topographical and other natural features\naffecting development of the site; the approximate location on the site of the proposed buildings,\nstructures, and other improvements; the approximate dimensions, including height, of the proposed\nbuildings and other structures; and the approximate location of all existing and proposed infrastructure\non the site, including water, sewer, roads, and pedestrian walkways. What constitutes a site-specific\nvesting plan under this section that would trigger a vested right shall be finally determined by the City\nof Creedmoor pursuant to a development regulation, and the document that triggers the vesting shall\nbe so identified at the time of its approval. A variance does not constitute a site-specific vesting plan,\nand approval of a site-specific vesting plan with the condition that a variance be obtained does not\nconfer a vested right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained. If a sketch plan or other\ndocument fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specified parcel\nor parcels of property, it may not constitute a site-specific vesting plan.\n1. Establishment of Vested Right. A vested right is established with respect to any property\nupon the valid approval, or conditional approval, of a site-specific vesting plan as provided in\nthis section. Such a vested right confers upon the landowner the right to undertake and\ncomplete the development and use of property under the terms and conditions of the site-\nspecific vesting plan, including any amendments thereto.\n2. Approval and Amendment of Plans. If a site-specific vesting plan is based on an approval\nrequired by City of Creedmoor regulation, the City of Creedmoor shall provide whatever notice\nand hearing is required for that underlying approval. A duration of the underlying approval\nthat is less than two (2) years does not affect the duration of the site-specific vesting plan\nestablished under this section. If the site-specific vesting plan is not based on such an approval,\na legislative hearing with notice as required by G.S. 160D-602 shall be held.\nThe City of Creedmoor may approve a site-specific vesting plan upon any terms and conditions\nthat may reasonably be necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.\nConditional approval results in a vested right, although failure to abide by the terms and\nconditions of the approval will result in a forfeiture of vested rights. The City of Creedmoor\nArticle 7 - Page 26\n"}, {"page": "94", "text": "shall not require a landowner to waive the landowner's vested right as a condition of\ndevelopment approval. A site-specific vesting plan is deemed approved upon the effective\ndate of the City of Creedmoor's decision approving the plan or another date determined by\nthe Creedmoor Board of Commissioners upon approval. An approved site-specific vesting plan\nand its conditions may be amended with the approval of the owner and the City of Creedmoor\nas follows: any substantial modification must be reviewed and approved in the same manner\nas the original approval; minor modifications may be approved by the Planning, Zoning and\nSubdivision Administrator.\n3. Continuing Review. Following approval or conditional approval of a site-specific vesting\nplan, the City of Creedmoor may make subsequent reviews and require subsequent approvals\nby the City of Creedmoor to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original\napproval, provided that these reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original\napproval. The City of Creedmoor may, pursuant to G.S. 160D-403(f), revoke the original\napproval for failure to comply with applicable terms and conditions of the original approval or\nthe Creedmoor Development Ordinance.\n4. Duration and Termination of Vested Right. A vested right for a site-specific vesting plan\nremains vested for a period of two (2) years. This vesting shall not be extended by any\namendments or modifications to a site-specific vesting plan unless expressly provided by the\nCity of Creedmoor\nNotwithstanding the provisions above in subsection (4), the City of Creedmoor may provide\nfor rights to be vested for a period exceeding two (2) years but not exceeding five (5) years\nwhere warranted in light of all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the size\nand phasing of development, the level of investment, the need for the development,\neconomic cycles, and market conditions or other considerations. These determinations are in\nthe sound discretion of the City of Creedmoor and shall be made following the process\nspecified for the particular form of a site-specific vesting plan involved.\nUpon issuance of a building permit, the provisions of G.S. 160D-1111 and G.S. 160D-1115\napply, except that a permit does not expire and shall not be revoked because of the running\nof time while a vested right under this section is outstanding.\nA right vested as provided in this section terminates at the end of the applicable vesting period\nwith respect to buildings and uses for which no valid building permit applications have been\nfiled.\n5. Subsequent Changes Prohibited; Exceptions. A vested right, once established as provided\nfor in this section, precludes any zoning action by the City of Creedmoor that would change,\nalter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of property as set\nforth in an approved site-specific vesting plan, except under on or more of the following\nconditions:\n(a) With the written consent of the affected landowner.\n(b) Upon findings, by ordinance after notice and an evidentiary hearing, that natural\nor man-made hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected,\nwould pose a serious threat to public health, safety, and welfare if the project were\nto proceed as contemplated in the site-specific vesting plan.\n(c) To the extent that the affected landowner receives compensation for all costs,\nexpenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including but not limited to,\nall fees paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing,\nlegal, and other consulting fees incurred after approval by the City of Creedmoor,\ntogether with interest as provided under G.S. 160D-106.

Otherwise applicable new regulations become effective with respect to\nproperty which is subject to a site-specific vesting plan upon the expiration or termination of\nthe vesting rights period provided for in this section.\nNotwithstanding any provision of this section the establishment of a vested right does not\npreclude, change, or impair the authority of the City of Creedmoor to adopt and enforce\ndevelopment regulations governing nonconforming situations or uses.\nE. PROCESS TO CLAIM VESTED RIGHT. A person claiming statutory or common law vested right may\nsubmit information to substantiate that claim to the Planning, Zoning and Subdivision Administrator,\nwho shall make an initial determination as to the existence of the vested right. The decision of the\nPlanning, Zoning and Subdivision Administrator may be appealed under G.S. 160D-405. On appeal, the\nexistence of a vested right shall be reviewed de novo. In lieu of seeking such a determination or\npursuing an appeal under G.S. 160D-405, a person claiming a vested right may bring an original civil\naction as provided by G.S. 160D-1403.1.\nF.

Vested rights shall run with the land except for the use of land\nfor outdoor advertising governed by G.S. 136-136.1 and G.S. 136-131.2 in which case the rights granted\nrun with the owner of the permit issued by the North Carolina Department of Transportation. Nothing\nin this section precludes judicial determination, based on common law principles or other statutory\nprovisions, that a vested right exists in a particular case or that a compensable taking has occurred.\n7.18\nDevelopment Agreements\n7.18-1 IN GENERAL. The State of North Carolina finds that development projects often occur in multiple phases\nover several years, requiring a long-term commitment of both public and private resources. Such developments often\ncreate community impacts and opportunities that are difficult to accommodate within traditional zoning processes.\nBecause of their scale and duration, such projects often require careful coordination of public capital facilities planning,\nfinancing, and construction schedules and phasing of the private development. Such projects involve substantial\ncommitments of private capital, which developers are usually unwilling to risk without sufficient assurances that\ndevelopment standards will remain stable through the extended period of the development. Such developments\noften\npermit communities and developers to experiment with difference or nontraditional types of development concepts and\nstandards, while still managing impacts on the surrounding areas. To better structure and manage development\napprovals for such developments and ensure their proper integration into local capital facilities programs, local\ngovernments need flexibility to negotiate such developments.\nThe City of Creedmoor may enter into development agreements with developers, subject to the procedures of this\nsection and pursuant to G.S. 160D-1001-1012. In entering into such agreements, the City of Creedmoor may not exercise\nArticle 7 - Page 28\n"}, {"page": "96", "text": "any authority or make any commitment not authorized by general or local act and may not impose any tax or fee not\nauthorized by otherwise applicable law.\nThis section is supplemental to the powers conferred upon the City of Creedmoor and does not preclude or supersede\nrights and obligations established pursuant to other law regarding development approvals, site-specific vesting plans, or\nother provisions of law. A development agreement shall not exempt the property owner or developer from compliance\nwith the State Building Code or State or local housing codes that are not part of the City of Creedmoor Development\nOrdinance. When the governing board approves the rezoning of any property associated with a development agreement\nexecuted and recorded pursuant to this section, the provisions of G.S. 160D-605(a) apply.\nDevelopment authorized by a development agreement shall comply with all applicable laws, including ordinances,\nresolutions, regulations, permits, policies, and laws affecting development of property, including laws governing\npermitted uses of property, density, intensity, design, and improvements.\n7.18-2 APPROVAL OF BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS REQUIRED.\nA. The City of Creedmoor may establish procedures and requirements to consider and enter into\ndevelopment agreements with developers. A development agreement must be approved by the\nCreedmoor Board of Commissioners as a legislative decision, following the procedures specified in G.S.\n160D-1005.\nB. The development agreement may, by ordinance, be incorporated, in whole or in part, into any\ndevelopment regulation adopted by the City of Creedmoor. A development agreement may be\nconsidered concurrently with a zoning map or text amendment affecting the property and\ndevelopment subject to the development agreement. A development agreement may be concurrently\nconsidered with and incorporated by reference with a sketch plan or preliminary plat required under a\nsubdivision regulation or a site plan or other development approval required under the Creedmoor\nDevelopment Ordinance. If incorporated into a conditional district, the provisions of the development\nagreement shall be treated as a development regulation in the event of the developer's bankruptcy.\n7.18-3 SIZE AND DURATION.

Mini Farm Overlay (MFO)\n2. Scenic Corridor Overlay (SCO)\n3. Hazardous Industry Overlay (HIO)\n8.3\nDESCRIPTION OF ZONING DISTRICTS\nThe zoning districts created by this ordinance are described as follows:\nThe AGRICULTURE DISTRICT (AG) is established to protect lands used for agricultural production,\nagricultural based businesses and related activities. Farm land is a defining element of\nCreedmoor's identity and the protection of these lands aids in preserving the character of the City.\nPermitted uses are limited, with an emphasis on uses that are agricultural in nature. Development\ndensity is very low to encourage preservation of agricultural lands while discouraging large lot\nresidential development. The Agriculture District can also be used to protect open spaces.\nThe SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT (SFR) provides for the completion of existing\nresidential neighborhoods and the development of new residential neighborhoods in a pattern\nthat encourages the wise use of land. Allowed building/lot types in the Single Family District are\nDetached House and Civic Building. Permitted uses are restricted to single family homes and their\naccessory uses, a limited number of related uses that serve the residential neighborhoods, and\ncivic uses. Neighborhoods in this district are the dominant land use in Creedmoor and are a major\nelement in defining the character of the community. The Single Family Residential District permits\nthe completion and conformity of conventional residential subdivisions already existing or\napproved in sketch plan form by the City of Creedmoor prior to the effective date of these\nregulations.\nArticle 8 - Page 1\n"}, {"page": "100", "text": "The RESIDENTIAL /MAIN STREET TRANSITIONAL DISTRICT (R/MST) provides for the completion\nof existing residential neighborhoods in the residential area(s) surrounding the Main Street and\nMain Street Periphery District through in-fill development. The intent of this district is to recognize\nthat most of the area surrounding the core of the downtown developed prior to the adoption of\nstandards such as zoning and subdivision regulations. The gradual transformation of existing\ndevelopment to high quality mixed density residential development is needed to support the\ncentral core of the City. Higher density residential development allows a greater number of\nhouseholds to walk or bike, thus reducing the parking demand and providing environmental and\nhealth benefits. Allowed building/lot types in these districts are the Detached House, Attached\nHouse, Multi-family Building, and Civic Building. Streets in the Residential/Main Street Transitional\nDistrict should be interconnected, with streets and sidewalks providing a connection from\nCreedmoor's downtown to the Single Family Residential districts surrounding these\nneighborhoods. A range of housing types is encouraged.\nThe MAIN STREET PERIPHERY DISTRICT (MSP) provides for the development and maintenance of\na range of uses in areas adjacent to Creedmoor's core downtown area. Allowed building/lot types\nin these districts are Multi-Family, Detached House, Attached House for both residential and/or\nnon-residential permitted uses, and Civic Building. In this district, the development pattern\nintegrates limited service, limited retail, office, civic, educational, religious, and residential uses in\nan environment that is pedestrian friendly while acknowledging the role of the automobile as a\nmeans of transportation. Street and sidewalk networks providing multi-modal transportation\noptions connect the Periphery District to the downtown and to surrounding neighborhoods. The\nPeriphery District provides an area for the expansion of the Main Street District.\nThe MAIN STREET DISTRICT (MS) provides for new development, revitalization, reuse, and infill\ndevelopment in Creedmoor's core downtown. A broad array of uses is permitted to enable the\nneeds of residents and visitors to be met. Allowed building/lot types in this district are Urban\nWorkplace, Shop-front, Detached House, attached House, and Civic Building. The development\npattern seeks to integrate shops, restaurants, services, work places, civic, educational, and\nreligious facilities, and higher density housing in a compact, pedestrian-oriented environment. The\nMain Street District serves as the hub of the surrounding neighborhoods and of the broader\ncommunity. The Main Street District may be expanded over time to meet the needs of the growing\ncommunity for downtown facilities and services. Expansion of the Main Street District shall be\ncontiguous and not separated from the primary district area.\nThe CIVIC DISTRICT (CIV) provides a location for large educational, medical, and public uses in a\ncampus like environment. Large developments in the Civic District are encouraged to provide a\nmaster plan to the City. Institutional uses in the Civic District are required to provide pedestrian\nconnections on their campuses and, to the extent possible, develop an internal street system with\nstructures fronting on the streets. Parking should not be the dominant visible element of the\ncampuses developed for institutional uses.\nThe NC 56 COMMERCIAL DISTRICT (C-56) is established to provide opportunities for compatible\nand sustainable development where the dominant mode of transportation is the automobile. The\nauto-oriented street, lot, and building designs can create uncomfortable pedestrian environments.\nAllowed building/lot types are Highway Commercial, and Civic Building. Dominant uses in this\ndistrict are retail and office. The NC 56 Commercial District is expected to serve Creedmoor\nresidents as well as persons who travel from surrounding communities. The development pattern\nin this district acknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access provided to\nensure safety for the motoring public. Development standards in the NC 56 Commercial District\nensure the creation of a pleasant auto-oriented environment while enabling a compatible\ntransition to uses in adjacent districts.\nThe US 15 COMMERCIAL DISTRICT (C-15) is established to provide opportunities for compatible\nand sustainable development along the US Hwy 15 corridor where future Creedmoor\nArticle 8 - Page 2\n"}, {"page": "101", "text": "neighborhoods will interconnect with this Bypass type roadway corridor without negatively\ndissecting the community. Development standards in the US 15 Commercial District acknowledge\nthat the automobile is the primary mode of transportation. Development and design standards\nencourage pedestrian scale development along a secondary street network serving larger projects.\nGoals of the US 15 Commercial District include providing a pleasant environment for motorists, a\nsafe environment for pedestrians along the secondary network of streets and pedestrian facilities;\nensuring the safety of motorists and pedestrians; and preserving the capacity of the Bypass to\naccommodate high traffic volumes at higher speeds. Uses in this district include services,\nemployment, residential and industrial. Allowed building/lot types include Urban Workplace,\nShop-front Commercial, and Civic Building.\nThe INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT (IND) is established to provide locations for industrial uses that, due to\nthe scale of the buildings and/or the nature of the use, cannot be integrated into the community.\nUses within the Industrial District are buffered from adjacent uses. The dominant uses in this\ndistrict are manufacturing and warehouse storage. Small scale manufacturing and storage that is\ncompatible with less intensive uses can and should be located in other non-residential or mixed\nuse districts. The Industrial District is reserved for uses which require very large buildings and/or\nlarge parking and loading facilities. Allowed building and lot types are Highway Commercial and\nCivic Building.\nThe OPEN SPACE PRESERVE DISTRICT (OSP) is established to preserve and protect\nenvironmentally sensitive lands (e.g. floodways, wetlands, undisturbed buffers, slopes in excess\nof 10%), or properties already under public or private ownership otherwise restricted by\nconservation easements. This district is reserved for publicly held lands under permanent\nconservation easements or for privately held lands owned by one or more land trust(s) where\nrecorded conservation easements restrict development potential. [Amended December 6, 2016\nper Ord. 2016-0-22]\nThe MINI FARM OVERLAY DISTRICT (MFO) permits buildings to be grouped on a site, parcel, or\nproperty in order to optimize the use of land and resources for both residential and agricultural\npurposes. By clustering development at a density no greater than one unit per developed acre,\nprojects developed in accordance with these standards preserve unique natural features for\nagricultural use. The Mini Farm Overlay District mandates the dedication of both agricultural land\nand open space. It is the intent of this district to be used for new development in undeveloped\noutlying areas of the City and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. Allowed building/lot type is Detached\nHouse.\nThe SCENIC CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT (SCO) is established to protect the pastoral scenes and\nopen spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and visitors traveling the major entrance\nroads and gateways to the City. The pastoral scenes and undeveloped property along the entrance\nroads and gateways contribute significantly to Creedmoor's community character and sense of\nplace. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District provides development options for the owners of the\nproperty abutting the entrance roads and gateways. The goal of this district is to protect the scenic\nvalue of the corridors through a mix of incentives and development standards. These standards\nwill preserve the rural character of the City by maintaining the sense of a rural corridor in an urban\nenvironment; provide an aesthetically appealing experience for those traveling the corridor;\nprovide multi-modal transportation options for travel; and ensure a safe transportation corridor\nfor motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. The Detached House lot/building type is allowed in this\ndistrict.\nThe HAZARDOUS INDUSTRY OVERLAY DISTRICT (HIO) is established to protect all environments\nfrom the negative impacts of certain activities and types of development. It is the intent of this\nsection to provide and permit certain public and private heavy industrial uses and facilities that\nincorporate hazardous materials and/or scientific technology, including: wholesale, distribution,\nstorage, processing, manufacturing and production. However, it is required that industries in this\nArticle 8 - Page 3\n"}, {"page": "102", "text": "district take all necessary actions including but not limited to installation of apparatus and\ntechnological equipment available to prevent negative impacts on the environment and the\ncommunity from the emissions of smoke, dust, fumes, noise and vibrations and other activities\nand/or products resulting from such hazardous industrial activities in accordance with federal,\nstate and local regulations.\n8.4\nZONING DISTRICT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nThe following development standards are established for each of the following primary general use zoning\ndistricts to ensure the orderly development of the City of Creedmoor.\n8.4-1\nAGRICULTURE DISTRICT (AG)\nA.\nINTENT.

The SCENIC CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT (SCO) is established to protect the pastoral\nscenes and open spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and visitors traveling the\nmajor entrance roads and gateways to the City. The pastoral scenes and undeveloped\nproperty along the entrance roads and gateways contribute significantly to Creedmoor's\ncommunity character and sense of place. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District provides\ndevelopment options for the owners of the property abutting the entrance roads and\ngateways. The goal of this district is to protect the scenic value of the corridors through\ndevelopment standards. These standards will preserve the rural character of the City by\nmaintaining the sense of a rural corridor in an urban environment; provide an aesthetically\nappealing experience for those traveling the corridor; provide multi-modal transportation\noptions for travel; and ensure a safe transportation corridor for motorists, bicyclists, and\npedestrians.

A corridor that serves as an entrance way to a place that is\nunique and different from other communities in the area. The gateway corridor provides\na sense of arrival to a place that is special and different from the typical places. The\ngateway scenic corridor may be more developed than the rural scenic corridor, but the\ncharacter of the development is such that those using the corridor are aware they are in\na special place.\n3.\nBYPASS SCENIC CORRIDOR. A corridor providing for buffering of the bypass to protect the\ntraffic carrying capacity of the road and to provide for a pleasant experience for motorists\nusing the bypass. The bypass scenic corridor requires an undeveloped setback from the\nbypass, ensuring that the bypass through Creedmoor is unique and portrays the character\nof the community while enhancing the safety of motorists using the road.\nC.\nGENERAL REQUIREMENTS\n1.\nDEVELOPMENT PATTERN.

The multi-family building is a residential building accommodating several households\nand built in accordance with the NC Building Code - Commercial. In traditional Cities, this building\ntype coexists with a variety of other building types and is located in or near a mixed use district. A\nsuccessful contemporary design permits its integration with other building types through the\ncoordination of site and building design. The multi-family building type helps to build the residential\ndensity necessary for mixed- use areas to function properly by helping to create a base of people who\ncan walk to goods and services. Where possible, structures shall be designed to terminate vistas.\nStructures should be designed to establish the design template and serve as a key focal point in the\nneighborhood. Within the limits described below and unless the zoning district standards require\ngreater measures, these regulations shall apply to all multi-family houses built on public streets.\nThese photographs of multi-family buildings are for illustration purposes only\nand are not intended to regulate lot/building styles, patterns, or forms.\nArticle 9 - Page 4\n"}, {"page": "122", "text": "9.4-2\nMULTI-FAMILY LOT TYPE STANDARDS.\nMIN.\nPARKING\n20' MIN./\n60 MAX\nROW\n(TYP)\nSIDEWALK\nSTREET\nBuilding Placement/Parking/Vehicle Access\nA.

The scale of buildings must be such\nthat street edges are defined and relate to the human proportions. This scale can be\nachieved through the use of architectural detailing on the first floor of buildings so that\nlarger buildings are broken up into smaller units, by maintaining height limits, by using large\npicture windows along front facades and by using plantings around the buildings.\n2. A range of roof forms is acceptable as long as they are compatible with the architectural\ncharacter, scale, and height of surrounding buildings.\nD.

A\nhierarchical street network should accommodate a variety of uses, including bicycle, pedestrian, motor-vehicle\nand transit routes. All streets should connect to help create a comprehensive network that enables the free\nmovement of automobiles, bicyclists, and pedestrians. In order for this street network to be safe for motorists\nand pedestrians, design elements must consistently be applied to calm automobile traffic.\nWhere discrepancies occur between the text of this Ordinance and the City of Creedmoor Technical Standards\nand Specifications Manual, the Technical Standards and Specifications Manual shall prevail.\n13.2\nStreet Standards\n13.2-1\nINTERCONNECTION.

Preservation of open space in developing areas serves a variety of purposes, including meeting the\nrecreational needs of residents, improving the aesthetic character of the community, reducing stormwater\nrunoff, improving stormwater runoff water quality, and enhancing air quality. The standards set forth below\nestablish regulations for open space in residential and non-residential developments.\n21.2\nOpen Space.\nAlthough open space can be agricultural or natural in character, open space is typically planned active play areas,\ngreenways, or walking trails that are developed as part of a residential and/or non-residential development.\nThe following standards are hereby established for open space, with the exception of the Main Street (MS)\nDistrict, which shall be exempt from the requirements of this section.\n21.2-1 OPEN SPACE LAND AREA REQUIREMENTS. Open space shall be provided in accordance with the\nfollowing table for:\nA. initial residential development containing five or more units,\nB. redevelopment or additional development that adds five or more units,\nC.\ninitial nonresidential or mixed use development greater than 0.6 acres, and\nD.\nredevelopment or additional development that adds 25 percent more nonresidential or mixed use\nfloor area on a site that exceeds 0.6 acres within any 36 consecutive month period.\nTABLE 21.1\n21.2-2 LAND DESIGNATED AS FUTURE OPEN SPACE. Regardless of the requirements and exemptions of this\nsubsection, any portion of the site of the proposed development that is designated as future open\nspace or greenway in the City Plan 2030 -Land Use and Comprehensive Master Plan adopted by the\nCity of Creedmoor, as amended from time to time, shall be reserved for open space. This area may be\ncounted toward the total amount of open space required for the development.\nIf the total amount of land required proposed as future open space or greenway is less than the total\namount of open space required for the development by the above table, then the developer shall\nprovide additional open space to meet the requirement of the above table. If the amount of land\ndesignated as future open space or greenway exceeds the total amount of open space required by the\nabove table, then the developer must still provide the open space designated in the official adopted\nplan.\n21.2-3 MINIMUM OPEN SPACE AREA.

With the exception of Natural and Agricultural Open Space, open\nspace shall be planned and improved, accessible and usable by persons living nearby. Improved shall\nmean cleared of underbrush and debris and shall contain landscaped areas designated for both active\nand passive recreational pursuits. At least 25% of the improved open space land shall be dedicated to\nactive recreation purposes such as playgrounds, tennis courts, ball fields, volleyball courts, etc. The\nbalance of the open space park area may be designed for passive recreation.\n21.2-4 DESIGN AND LOCATION. In major subdivisions and multi-building developments in all zoning districts\nexcept Agricultural, open space shall be integrated into the design of the site. In subdivisions where\n50% or more of the lots are less than 0.75 acre in size, open space shall be located within 1/4 mile of at\nleast 90% of the building lots, as measured along the rights-of-way of streets providing access between\nthe two. In subdivisions where 50% or more of the lots are 0.75 acre or more in size, open space shall\nbe located within 1/2 mile of at least 90% of the building lots, as measured along the rights-of-way of\nstreets providing access between the two.\n21.2-5 FOCAL POINT. Open space features should provide focal points for the neighborhood. A central square\nor green, for example, may comprise a majority of the open space. There should be a hierarchy of open\nspace within new neighborhoods so that open space serves the needs of multiple age groups.\n21.2-6 TYPES OF OPEN SPACE. Open space types include Squares, Parks, Forecourts, Plazas, Greenways, and\nNatural and Agricultural. Standards for these open space types are set forth below.\nA. SQUARES\nSquares are areas for passive recreational use. Squares shall be bounded by streets on a minimum of\nthree sides or 75% of their perimeter.\nSquares should be used in tight urban environments where residents have little yard space. Squares\nare used to bring a more natural landscape into an urban environment. As such, not more than 25%\nof a square should be impervious surface coverage. Hardscaping should be decorative (example brick\npavers instead of asphalt for walkways).\nMin size: 500 sq. feet\nMax Size: 2 acres\nB. PARKS\nParks are areas for passive or active recreational use. Parks should be bounded by streets on a\nminimum of two sides or 50% of their perimeter.\nMinimum Size: 6,500 square feet\nArticle 21 - Page 2\n"}, {"page": "281", "text": "Maximum Size: 8 Acres. Maximum size may exceed eight acres if the park serves multiple\nneighborhoods or preserves environmental features.\nParks should be areas where passive and active recreation occur simultaneously (example: park\nbenches for elderly and a tot-lot for young children), encouraging intergenerational interactions among\npark users.\nC. FORECOURT\nForecourts are open spaces that act as buffers between residential buildings and streets or non-\nresidential buildings. Forecourts are entirely bounded by buildings or streets. It is recommended that\nforecourts be planted parallel to all street right-of-ways.\nMinimum Size: 500 sq. feet\nMaximum Size: 1.5 acre\nD. PLAZA\nA plaza is an open area adjacent to a civic or commercial building. Plazas should be planted with\ndeciduous trees to provide shade in the summer (example: the NC State Capital Building lawn in\nRaleigh, NC). Plazas function as gathering places and may incorporate a variety of non-permanent\nactivities such as outdoor farmers markets or craft fairs. Limited parking is permissible on plazas.\nPlazas should match the architectural style of the buildings that they are adjacent to regarding\nmaterials and design. Plazas shall be level or gently sloping.\nMinimum Size: none\nMaximum Size: none\nE. GREENWAYS\nGreenways are spaces designed to incorporate natural settings such as creeks and significant stands of\ntrees within a neighborhood. Greenways shall have streets or pedestrian ROWs parallel to or\nintegrated into at least 75% of their length. Greenways are used for walking, jogging, biking, and they\nare used as wildlife corridors. Greenways may have infrequent small-scale active recreational facilities\nArticle 21 - Page 3\n"}, {"page": "282", "text": "such as playgrounds, although the majority of greenways shall be for passive, pedestrian and/or bicycle\nrecreation.\nF.\nNATURAL AND AGRICULTURAL OPEN SPACE\nNatural and Agricultural Open Space preserves agricultural lands, environmentally sensitive areas,\nscenic views, cultural features, and rural character that would likely be lost through conventional\ndevelopment approaches. To accomplish this goal, the City of Creedmoor encourages creativity and\nallows for greater flexibility in the design of developments through use of the Mini-Farm Overlay\nDistrict and conditional zoning districts (Article 8).\nNatural and Agricultural Open Space shall be placed in preserves, which may adjoin housing areas that\nhave been designed more compactly to create larger areas that may be enjoyed equally by all residents\nof the neighborhood.\n21.2-7 OPEN SPACE OWNERSHIP AND CONSERVATION EASEMENT. Open space shall be owned or\nadministered by one or a combination of the following methods: fee simple ownership by a private\nnon-profit land conservancy; owned by a homeowners association; or by individual private ownership\nsuch as a farmer, developer or other private entity that maintains the open space (i.e. farming,\nequestrian facility, etc.)\nAll lands within areas required to be maintained as open space shall be protected by a permanent\nconservation easement, prohibiting further development, and setting other standards safeguarding the\nsite's special resources from negative changes.\nPublic use of the open space may be limited to residents of the development, except for land used for\npublic sidewalks and multi-use trails, provided that such open space is held in private or association\nownership.\n21.2-8 MAINTENANCE. The owner or lessee of the property designated as the open space shall be responsible\nfor the maintenance of the open space area. Landscaped areas shall be maintained in good condition\nand the entire area shall be kept clear of debris. Failure to maintain the area shall constitute a violation\nof this ordinance and subject the violator to the penalty provisions of Article 23 if not corrected within\n30 days of notification.
