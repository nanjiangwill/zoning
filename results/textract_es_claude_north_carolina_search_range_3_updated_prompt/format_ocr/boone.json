Regulations in these districts are intended to preserve and\nmaintain a small town, high country atmosphere. Preservation and adaptive reuse of\nexisting historic buildings are encouraged and new construction shall be appropriately\nscaled to be sympathetic to the existing built environment. Design and regulatory\nstandards for these districts reinforce the character of the downtown as a pedestrian\nfriendly area by encouraging architectural solutions that are visually interesting, and are\ncompatible in scale and character to the surrounding area. To help accomplish this, the\narea is divided into two (2) districts, each with its own character and scale which contribute\nto the overall vitality of the downtown area. Identification of the districts is listed below:\nA. B1 Downtown Core District: The Downtown Core District is the center of the\ndowntown area and contains the greatest concentration of historic commercial\nbuildings. This district establishes a continuous building facade at the street frontage\nto strengthen the identity of downtown as a pedestrian destination where pedestrians\nfeel comfortable through the careful selection of building materials, human scale\ndesign, and ground floor fenestration. Standards in this district reinforce the historic\nnature of the existing built environment through regulation of appearance, height,\nscale and mass.\nB. B1 Downtown Interface District: The Downtown Interface District serves as a gateway\ninto the downtown area and as the transition between the B1 Downtown Core District\nand adjacent zoning districts. Development in this district must be sensitive to issues\nof compatibility with the Downtown Core District as well as surrounding zoning\ndistricts, many which are low-density residential.\n14.19.02\nRelationship to Other Regulations:\n14-37\n"}, {"page": "188", "text": "Town of Boone\nUnified Development Ordinance\nArticle 14 Zoning Districts Regulations\nA.

Rooftop Additions: Rooftop additions to existing commercial buildings,\nincluding those intended to accommodate elevator shafts, bars, decks, kitchen\nprep areas, social areas, or to otherwise enable recreational use of open\nrooftops, are generally not appropriate if any portion of the rooftop addition is\nvisible from the street-level right of way adjacent to the primary facade.\ni.\nFor buildings located on corner lots, additions should not be visible from\nthe street-level secondary facade, either. In the vast majority of cases, this\nwill mean positioning the addition within the one-third portion of the\nrooftop located closest to the non-primary or non-secondary facade of the\nexisting building.\nii.\nRooftop additions should never destroy or damage character-defining\nfeatures of an existing building, and they should be designed to be\ncompatible with both the size, scale, color, material, form, style, and\ncharacter of the building on which they are erected. Rooftop additions\nshould be subordinate to the existing building in size and design, and\ncompatible with its massing, scale, materials, and features. Nevertheless,\nadditions should be sufficiently differentiated as new elements from\noriginal components of the existing building.\niii.\nRooftop additions should maintain the lowest possible profile in their\nconstruction, so that walkways, decks, seating areas, solar arrays, and\nsimilar components are built as close as functionally possible to the original\nroof surface of the existing building.\niv.\nThe additions shall not be visible when viewed at eye level (5'-6\" from\ngrade) from the opposite side of the right-of-way adjacent to the primary\nfa\u00e7ade (directly in front of the building; for corner properties, said\nadditions shall also not be visible when viewed at eye level (5'6\" from\ngrade) from the opposite side of the side of the right-of-way adjacent to\nthe secondary fa\u00e7ade directly in front of the secondary facade.\nA. When a building on a corner lot has more than one secondary fa\u00e7ade,\nthis standard shall only apply to the secondary fa\u00e7ade with the higher\nlevel of vehicular traffic.\nI.\nDesign Standards for Renovation of Existing Buildings.\n1.

Renovations to existing buildings shall be consistent with guidelines set\nforth herein.\n2.\nApplicants should exercise caution when undertaking renovations of buildings and\nbuilding facades within the B1 Districts because once a nonconforming material or\nfeature has been removed, the applicant will only be able to proceed with new\nmaterials and features which meet the requirements of this Section.

The storefront materials (including wood, masonry, metals, ceramic\ntile, clear glass, and pigmented structural glass) and the configuration of the\nstorefront are significant, as are features, such as, but not limited to: display\nwindows, base panels, bulkheads, signs, doors, transoms, clerestory windows, kick\nplates, corner posts, piers, and entablatures. The removal of inappropriate, non-\nhistoric cladding, false mansard roofs, and other more recent, non-historic or\ninsignificant alterations can help reveal the historic character of the storefront. If\nthe original fa\u00e7ade has been covered, then it should be uncovered if structurally\nfeasible.\n7.\nDeteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the\nseverity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinct feature, the new\nfeature will match the old in design, color, texture, and where possible, materials.\nMissing features will be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence and\n14-63\n"}, {"page": "214", "text": "Town of Boone\nUnified Development Ordinance\nArticle 14 Zoning Districts Regulations\nshall only be replaced with new materials that match the existing historic material\nin composition, size, shape, texture, pattern, color and detail.\n8.\nMaterials that are not visually compatible with the original fa\u00e7ade, such as shiny\nmetals, mirror glass, plastic panels, and vinyl windows or doors are prohibited,\nunless they can be documented through historic images or similar documentation.\n9.\nA historic material found on the existing building used for the same purpose or\nlocation will be found to be acceptable. Where necessary or desirable due to lack\nof historic materials, equivalency of alternative materials, or other reasons\ndemonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator, applicants may use a\ncompatible substitute material that reproduces the overall appearance and\naesthetic of the historic material.\n10.

This existing square footage of impervious surface will be\nsubtracted from the total land area of the property to calculate how much of the\nremaining property can be disturbed.
