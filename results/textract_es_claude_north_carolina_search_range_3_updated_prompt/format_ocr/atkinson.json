This note is not\nintended to be exhaustive or legally binding; it is intended to give the reader an\nunderstanding of what this ordinance means when referring to the various classes of\nfactory-built structures.\nMobile homes or \"trailers\"\nMobile homes are often referred to as \"trailers.\" A mobile home is any re-locatable\nstructure or unit, either single or multi-sectional, which is built on a permanent steel\n(truck like) chassis, and fitted with axels and a towing tong and towed to its destination.\nFor purposes of this ordinance, a mobile home is a unit built prior to June 15, 1976 which\nis before the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Code came into effect. A mobile\nhome does not qualify for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation financing. Mobile\nhomes are not allowed within the town of Atkinson.\nManufactured Home\nA manufactured home is similar in structure to a mobile home. It too is built on a steel\n(truck-like) chassis fitted with axels and towed to its destination. It is sold as real\nproperty and unlike a \"Trailer\" can qualify for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation\nfinancing. A manufactured home meets the HUD code and by law municipalities in\nNorth Carolina cannot exclude them although they may restrict them to specific zoning\ndistricts. Manufactured homes include single, double, and triple wides.\nModular Home\nWhereas manufactured homes are built in accordance with a national HUD standard, a\nmodular home meets all applicable local building codes. For example, modular homes\nbuilt in a hurricane prone area must have any additional bracing and tie downs needed to\nmeet local building codes. Modular homes are not built on a steel frame fitted with axels,\nalthough they are towed in sections to their locations on trailers or flat-bed trucks. Once\nit has reached its final destination it is fitted to a permanent foundation.\n"}, {"page": "15", "text": "ARTICLE 4.
