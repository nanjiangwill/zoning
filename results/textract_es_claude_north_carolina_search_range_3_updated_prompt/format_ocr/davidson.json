DESCRIPTION\nThe Village Infill Planning Area comprises Davidson's traditional, residential\nneighborhoods and provides for infill development surrounding the historic town\ncenter. Streets, sidewalks and greenways in the Village Infill Planning Area must be\ninterconnected. A range of housing types is encouraged: For Master Plan projects on\nlots over three acres a mix of at least two different building types is encouraged.\nAdditionally, small retail establishments are permitted on corner lots, with restrictions.\nThis encourages the provision of small-scale retail and service uses for surrounding\nresidential areas. Buildings are restricted in size to promote a local orientation, to be\npedestrian-oriented, to be compatible with the scale of surrounding residences, and to\nlimit any adverse impacts on residential development.\nB.

USAC Checklist Evaluation\nThe Town will evaluate the appropriateness of annexation of lands into the Town\nand extension of public utilities to new areas using the USAC. These criteria serve as\nthe primary guide for making annexation and utility extension decisions. The criteria\nprovide a framework for ensuring decisions are made consistently and in accordance\nwith the Comprehensive Plan. They are complemented by the Growth Management\nTiers Map and encourage community and stakeholder collaboration on development\ndecisions through a fair and transparent process, especially engagement of all\nstakeholders early in the development process (Davidson Comprehensive Plan, p. 33).\nApplicable development projects shall submit required information and\ndocumentation per the adopted USAC policy. Evaluation is based on the project's\napplication date, though consideration may be given to project features supporting\ncommunity aims and adopted policies after that date. Points are not automatic\nbut may be based on the extent of alignment, implementation, and innovation\ndemonstrated in the proposal. For example, planting street trees is required in the\nDavidson Planning Ordinance and should not be construed as a project benefit of\nexceptional merit in meeting the town's expressed aims.\nAll USAC point totals will be verified by the Planning Department.
