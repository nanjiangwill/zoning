The impact of one homeowner's\nactivities on his neighbor will be less than if the property owners were located side by side in a\nsubdivision. Consequently, the property owner may have more freedom to use his land as he\nsees fit.

Because development\nwill be on smaller lots than in the R-A District, more restrictions will be imposed on\nlandowners. Generally, these areas are not served by municipal water or sewer.\nR-15 Residential District\nThe intent of the R-15 Residential District is to provide a quiet, medium-density residential\nneighborhood inside the corporate limits that is served by both public water and sewer.\nR-8A Residential Multifamily District\nThe intent of the R-8A Multifamily Residential District is to provide areas for high density\nresidential development such as apartments and condominiums. It is expected that both\npublic water and sewer will be available within the corporate limits.\nR-MH Manufactured Home Residential District\nThe intent of the R-MH Manufactured Home Residential District is to insure that\nmanufactured home parks meet minimal development standards in order to protect the\nresidents of these parks as well as neighboring land owners.\nPR-CD Planned Residential Conditional District\nThe purpose of the PR-CD Planned Residential Conditional District is to encourage the\ndevelopment of environments which provide certain development privileges in exchange for\npreplanning and design considerations. The PR-CD provides an alternative to conventional\nsubdivision design by promoting the conservation and creation of viable, connected open\nspace and more flexible lot design options while minimizing development costs.\nO-I Office-Institution District\nThe intent of the Office-Institution District is to provide locations primarily for office and\ninstitutional development, although single-family dwellings are also permitted. Normally this\ndistrict provides a buffer between nonresidential and residential zoning districts.\nB-1 Central Business District\nThe intent of the B-1 Central Business District is to provide an area near the center of Dobson\nwhere compatible commercial and governmental uses may be established that do not infringe\non neighboring residential uses.\nB-2 Highway Business District\nabout:blank\n28/167\n"}, {"page": "29", "text": "6/3/24, 7:55 PM\nDobson, NC Code of Ordinances\nThe intent of the B-2 Highway Business District is to provide areas along thoroughfares and\ncollector streets for commercial uses, particularly the sales of retail goods and provision of\nservices.\nL-I Light Industrial District\nThe intent of the L-I Light Industrial District is to provide sites for manufacturing,\nwarehousing, processing, and related uses whose operating characteristics limit their effects\non adjacent uses.\nH-I Heavy Industrial District\nThe intent of the H-1 Heavy Industrial District is to provide sites for industrial, processing, and\nrelated operations whose external effects could be detrimental to certain classes of uses.

Some land uses are of such a\nnature and scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediate area and on the entire\ncommunity, which cannot be predetermined and controlled by the standards of a general use district. In\naddition, this process will ensure compatibility with the Town's Land Use Plan and other adopted plans. The\nreview process established in this Article provides for a specific review process subject to specific conditions\nwhich mitigate concerns with the proposed development and ensure compatibility of the use with the\nsurrounding community.\n8.2 - General Requirements.\nProperty may be placed in a conditional district only in response to a petition by the owners of all the\nproperty to be included.

Conditional zoning districts do not have any inherent permitted or conditional uses;\ndevelopment activities are only allowed through specific conditions approved by the Town Board. Those\nuses permitted and conditions approved by the Town Board shall be reflected on the Conditional Zoning\nDistrict Supplement issued by the Zoning Administrator. Proposed development activities shall be consistent\nwith the established permitted and conditional uses of the corresponding general use zoning district. The\npetitioner shall meet all of the requirements of the corresponding general use zoning district.

The purpose of the Planned Residential Conditional District (PR-CD) is to encourage the\ndevelopment of environments which provide certain development privileges in exchange for\npreplanning and design considerations. The PR-CD provides an alternative to conventional\nsubdivision design by promoting the conservation and creation of viable, connected open space\nand more flexible lot design options while minimizing development costs. The Planned Residential\nConditional District (PR-CD) provides flexibility in utilizing new development concepts, including\nthe incorporation of a limited amount of non-residential uses. In return for development\nflexibility, additional site plan information and development conditions may be required of the\ndeveloper to assist in evaluating the suitability of a proposed PR-CD. While maximum open space\npreservation and high-quality residential development is the primary goal of PR-CDs, open space\nwithin PR-CDs must balance the need for open space preservation with an increased need for\nintegration with surrounding developments through street connectivity and compatibility with\nadjacent and internal land uses.\n(B) Minimum Size. A PR-CD shall be located on a site containing at least five (5) contiguous acres.\n(C)\nabout:blank\n59/167\n"}, {"page": "60", "text": "6/3/24, 7:55 PM\nDobson, NC Code of Ordinances\nPre-Application Conference Required.

PR-CDs do not have any inherent permitted or conditional uses and\ndevelopment activities are only allowed through specific conditions approved by the Board of\nCommissioners; however PR-CDs are primarily intended for single-family developments. A\nmaximum of ten percent (10%) of the total land of the development may be utilized for non-\nresidential uses. The compatibility and appropriateness of any non-residential uses proposed\nshall be carefully considered. Those uses permitted and conditions approved by the Board of\nCommissioners shall be reflected on the Conditional Zoning District Supplement issued by the\nZoning Enforcement Officer.\n(E) Relationship to Other Applicable Regulations. A PR-CD shall be subject to all applicable standards,\nprocedures, and regulations of this Ordinance unless otherwise set forth in this section.\n(F) Maximum Density.
