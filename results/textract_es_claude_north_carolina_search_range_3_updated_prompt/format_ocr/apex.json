In granting relief, the hearing officer may recommend and the\nBoard of Adjustment may adopt any legally available incentive or\nmeasure reasonably necessary to offset any substantial economic\nhardship, and may condition such incentives upon approval of specific\ndevelopment plans. If there is a finding that the denial of the application\nwould create a substantial economic hardship, the hearing officer may\nrecommend and the Board may consider additional relief to provide an\nappropriate increase in market value or other benefit or return to the\napplicant sufficient to offset the substantial economic hardship. The types\nof incentives that the hearing officer may recommend and the Board of\nAdjustment may consider includes, but are not limited to, the following:\na)\nA rezoning of property to a more appropriate classification,\nissuance of a variance, approval of a development plan, or other\nappropriate land use regulatory action that will enable the\napplicant to realize a reasonable return on the property;\nb)\nAn opportunity to transfer density or cluster development on\nother property;\nc)\nA waiver of permit fees;\nd)\nDevelopment finance assistance;\ne)\nApproval of development on some portion of the property; or\nf)\nAcquisition of all or a portion of the property at market value.\n3)\nMinimum increase. In granting relief, the landowner shall be given the\nminimum increase in use density/intensity or other possible concessions\nfrom this Ordinance and Sec. 2.3.13.D.2 in order to permit an\neconomically viable use of the land or a use that is determined to be\nrequired by law. The highest use, or even an average or generally\nreasonable expectation, is not required or intended as the appropriate\nremedy. The following guidelines shall be used for determining the\nminimum economically viable use of land and, therefore, the amount of\nrelief to be granted a landowner in order to reach that minimum.\na)\nA minimum economically viable use of the land should be one\nthat does not have any governmental subsidy attached to the\nlong-term safe occupation of the land. If such a subsidy is\nneeded, then that should be reflected by lowering the use\nintensity that is considered a minimum economically viable use\non a market valuation basis.\nb)\nA use common to the Town, although it may not involve further\ndevelopment of the land, is considered an economically viable\nuse. Attention shall also be given to land uses that are\nconsidered to be the lowest intensity in the Town but which uses\nstill provide for occupation and living within the Town.

The primary goal is to define the \"finishing\ntouches\" that provide the structure with a sense of permanence, style, and\ncompatibility. The Town actively discourages proposals that have not taken\nthese matters into account. The Town desires that all development be\ntreated as a lasting contributor to the community and as a \"good neighbor\"\nto its surroundings.
