The source of each\nsection is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of\nsuch a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption\nof the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can\nlocate any section of the 1973 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein.\nThe chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the\nvarious sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie\nrelated sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A\ntable listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at\nthe back of this Code.\nChapter and Section Numbering System\nThe chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in\nmany state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by\na dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash\nrefers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is\nnumbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is\nidentified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place\nby using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one\nsection that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new\nsection would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same\nway or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject,\nand, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The\nnext successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be\nincluded by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the\nalphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters.\nPage Numbering System\nThe page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the\ncolon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the\nright of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the\nCode, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an\nappendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the\nappendix.\nvii\n"}, {"page": "5", "text": "Indexes\nThe indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been\nplaced under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal\nterminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and\nemployees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as\nguideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.\nLooseleaf Supplements\nA special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental\nservicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date.\nSubsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be\nreprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with\ninstructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.\nKeeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the\npublication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to\nhave the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended\nby the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid\nmisplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference\npurposes.\nAcknowledgments\nThis publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor,\nand Ron McLaughlin, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.
