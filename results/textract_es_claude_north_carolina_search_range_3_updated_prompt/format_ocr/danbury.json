Building permits also expire if work\nis discontinued for a period of 12 months after work has commenced.\n(b)\nOne year - Other local development approvals. - Pursuant to NCGS 160D-403(c), unless\notherwise specified by statute or local ordinance, all other local development approvals expire one year\nafter issuance unless work has substantially commenced.

Upon issuance of a building permit, the provisions of NCGS\n160D-1109 and NCGS 160D-1113 shall apply, except that the permit shall not expire or be\nrevoked because of the running of time while a vested right under this section exists.\n2024\n12-6.4 Process for Approval and Amendment of Site-Specific Vesting Plans\n(a)\nNotice and hearing - If a site-specific vesting plan is based on an approval required by the Town\nof Danbury development regulations, a notice and hearing is required for that underlying\napproval. If the duration of the underlying approval is less than two years, that shall not affect the\nduration of the site-specific vesting plan established under this subsection.\n(b)\nIf the site-specific vesting plan is not based on such an approval, a legislative hearing with notice\nas required by NCGS 160D-602 shall be held.
