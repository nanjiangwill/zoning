Conditional Use District.\n(A) Purpose.\n(1) This section contains regulations which establish zoning districts and assign land uses\nto one or more of those districts. The section also provides standards for development\nwhich regulate lot size, yards, parking and open space. There are, however, certain\ncircumstances which occasionally arise when a general zoning district designation\nwould not be appropriate for a certain property, but a specific use permitted under the\ndistrict would be consistent with the objectives of this section. In order to\naccommodate this situation, this section establishes the conditional use zone and\ndescribes the rezoning process relating to the conditional use zone.\n(2) The conditional use district is established to address those situations involving a\nrezoning when a particular use may be acceptable, but the general classification which\nwould allow that use would not be acceptable. It allows the Board of Commissioners to\napprove a rezoning proposal for a specific use with reasonable conditions to assure\nthe compatibility of the use with surrounding properties and with the land use plan.\nAny use permitted in a conditional use zone must be a permitted use in a general\nzoning district of the Town. At a minimum, the land use restrictions in the general\nzoning classification allowing the proposed use must be complied with in all particulars\n87 of 211\n4/13/24, 12:22\n"}, {"page": "88", "text": "Cape Carteret, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nprior to approval of a conditional use zone.

It is not intended to be utilized except where specific\ndevelopment criteria have been established for a particular piece of property by its\nowner, and the owner is prepared to commence construction within six months\nfollowing approval of the conditional use rezoning application.\n(B) Application and review process.\n(1) Application. Rezoning petitions to establish a conditional use district must be\nsubmitted to the Planning Board and will be processed in accordance with the\nprocedure for processing zoning amendments to the extent not in conflict with the\nprovisions of this section.

Therefore, the Planning\nBoard and/or Board of Commissioners may request additional information as they\ndeem necessary.
