On-site areas which are subject to severe erosion, and off-site areas which are\nespecially vulnerable to damage from erosion and/or sedimentation, are to be identified and receive special\nattention;\n(2) Limit Time of Exposure. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to limit exposure\nto the shortest feasible time;\n(3) Limit Exposed Areas. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to minimize the size\nof the area to be exposed at any one time;\n(4) Control Surface Water. Surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas should be\ncontrolled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during the period of exposure;\n(5) Control Sedimentation. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted SO as to prevent\noff-site sedimentation damage. The disturbance of one acre or more requires a sedimentation and erosion control\nplan.\n(6) Manage Storm Water Runoff. When the increase in the velocity of storm water runoff resulting from\na land-disturbing activity is sufficient to cause accelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse, plans are to\ninclude measures to control the velocity at the point of discharge SO as to minimize accelerated erosion of the site\nand increased sedimentation of the stream.\n(7) Manage Wetlands. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted SO as to prevent wetland\ndamage. Wetland mitigation may be required.\n$154.038 CEMETERIES EXEMPT FROM AREA, LOT AND YARD REQUIREMENTS.\nAll cemeteries shall be exempt from the area, lot and yard requirements of any zoning district in which they are\npermitted as a use, but shall remain a minimum of thirty feet from any road right-of-way or property line.\n\u00a7 154.039 LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING REQUIREMENTS.
