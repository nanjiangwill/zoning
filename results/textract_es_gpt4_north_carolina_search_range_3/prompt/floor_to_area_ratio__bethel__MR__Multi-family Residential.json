You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Multi-family Residential\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"MR\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"floor_to_area_ratio\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: . Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer.
