You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Residential Office\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-O\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: max building height, max height, area and bulk requirements, dimensional requirements, lot and building requirements, area requirements, height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. For max_height in residential districts, we are only\ninterested in the answer as it pertains to single-family homes.\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted.

Where the applicant for rezoning desires property to be rezoned\nto such a district in such situations, the Conditional Zoning District is a means by which such\nspecial conditions can be imposed in the furtherance of the purpose of this Ordinance. The\nConditional Zoning District classification will be considered for rezoning only upon request of a\nproperty owner or authorized agent.\nTherefore, the following Conditional Zoning Districts (CD) which correspond to each of the\ndistricts authorized by this ordinance are established: RA-CD, RU-R-CD, R-20-CD, R-O-CD, O-\nI-CD, N-B-CD, H-B-CD, M-1-CD.\nSection 4.9.2 Uses\nWithin a CD, only those uses authorized as permitted uses in the zoning district with which the\nCD corresponds shall be permitted, and all other requirements of the corresponding district shall\nbe met as minimum standards.\nSection 4.10 Permitted Uses\nSection 4.10.1 General\nThe Table of Permitted Uses and Special Uses which follows contains a listing of uses which may\nbe permitted in one or more of the various Zoning Districts established by this Ordinance. Uses\nare listed in alphabetical order in nine functional categories. The categories in the order of listing\nare:\nAgricultural and Residential Uses\nRecreational Uses\nEducational and Institutional Uses\nBusiness, Professional and Personal Services\nRetail Trade\nWholesale Trade\nManufacturing and Industrial Uses\nPublic Works Facilities, Utilities and Infrastructure\nOther\nSection 4.10.2 Entries\nThe District or Districts in which a particular listed use may be permitted is indicated by an \"X\"\nor \"S\" in the District column(s) opposite the listed use.\n20\n\nNEW PAGE 91\n1. The adjoining parcel has the same ownership as the parcel being developed and the\nadjoining lot is of sufficient width to meet the minimum lot widths established in this\nOrdinance per Chapter 4.\n2. The parcel is a legal non-conforming use and there is not sufficient land area to install\nbuffers, due to existing building, parking, septic areas, etc.\n3. Where topography exists such that the effect of the screening or buffering cannot be\nachieved.\n4. The adjoining parcel is identified as a non-residential classification in the Land Use Plan\nand is vacant or used commercially.\n5. The adjoining parcel has either a commercial or industrial use as identified in the Table of\nPermitted and Special Uses.\nB. Emergency services located in any district may be exempt from part of these requirements in\nthis chapter where installing the landscaping may interfere with visibility when exiting the site.\nExceptions above do not apply if a Performance Requirement in Chapter 5 includes buffering\nand screening.\nSection 8.6 Buffering and Screening\nA. The requirement for the installation of a buffering or screening device shall be initiated by the\noccurrence of any one or more of the following activities on the non-residential property:\n1. The initial use, development or occupancy of the non-residential property;\n2. Any change in use of a non-residential property which requires a site plan review\n(such as but not limited to requiring additional parking or other requirements from\nChapter 5);\n3. Any change of occupancy of a non-residential property which requires a change in\nthe zoning classification; and/or\n4. Any building expansion that increases the floor area of the non-residential use or any\naddition of parking that provides ten (10) or more spaces, whether required or not.\nB. Buffering and screening devices shall be provided along the full length of any property line or\naround the perimeter of the operational area as shown on the site plan.\nC. The buffering and screening devices shall be provided by the non-residential use even if the\nabutting residentially zoned land is vacant.\n86\n\n\nNEW PAGE 92\nD. Buffering and screening devices apply to non-residential uses that adjoin the R-A, RU-R, or\nR-20 zoning districts. See Table 8.1 to determine which device applies.\nTable 8.1 Buffering & Screening Applications\nSection 8.6.1 Buffering Requirements\nA. Any non-residential use located in either the R-O, O-I, N-B, or H-B districts and located on\nproperty abutting any R-A, RU-R, or R-20 district, unless separated by a public street or\nrailroad right-of-way, shall provide a buffering device as described below.\nB. The buffering device is intended to minimize visual contact and to create an impression of\nspatial separation between uses which are incompatible in nature. The buffer may be\ncomposed of a wall, fence, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation.\n1. Where planted vegetation is used, a buffer strip shall be planted. This strip shall be free of\nall encroachment of structures, parking areas, or other impervious surfaces (except\ndriveways). The amount of buffer materials to be planted per one hundred (100) linear feet\nshall be as indicated in the diagrams below.\na. Uses in HB district must provide a thirty (30) foot wide buffer using the following\nplantings (see Figure 5.1):\n4 Canopy Trees,\n3 Understory Trees, and\n24 Shrubs.\nFigure 5.1 Thirty (30) Foot Buffer\n100'\nb.

Where an existing buffer area exists, further planting and/or improvements shall not be\nrequired, provided said buffer area is of sufficient width and depth and contains adequate\nand sufficient materials to meet the requirements of this Ordinance. If the buffer area is\ndeficient, the developer shall make needed improvements and/or additions to satisfy the\nbuffering requirements and intent of this Ordinance.\nSection 8.6.2 Screening Requirements\nA. Any non-residential use located in either the M-1 district or any outdoor storage associated\nwith any non-residential use in either O-I, N-B, H-B, or M-1 districts and located on property\nabutting any R-A, RU-R, R-20, or R-O district, unless separated by a public street or railroad\nright-of-way, shall provide a thirty (30) foot landscaping buffer containing a screening device\nas described below.\nB. The screen is intended to block visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression\nof spatial separation. A screening device shall be at least ninety (90%) percent opaque from\nthe ground to a height of at least six (6) feet. The screen may be composed of a wall, fence,\nplanted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural\nvegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of\nthe subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. Planted vegetation must be a\nminimum of eighteen (18) inches high when planted.\nC. In any case where vegetation, either existing or proposed, is to be used as the required screening\ndevice, if the vegetation is to be less than ten (10) feet in width (thickness), a fence, wall or\nsimilar device at least fifty (50%) percent opaque and six (6) feet in height shall be used in\ncombination with the vegetation. In all cases, the screen must be at least ninety (90%) percent\n88\n\n\n Output:"}]}
