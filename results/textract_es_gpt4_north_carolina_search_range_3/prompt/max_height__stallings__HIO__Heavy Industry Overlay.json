You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Heavy Industry Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"HIO\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_height\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: max building height, max height, area and bulk requirements, dimensional requirements, lot and building requirements, area requirements, height, stories, story. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. For max_height in residential districts, we are only\ninterested in the answer as it pertains to single-family homes.\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted.

In the event that the property owner\nprovides a scenic easement wider than required by this ordinance, the\ndensity bonus may be increased up to seventy-five (75%) percent for the\narea located within the scenic easement.\nFor example, the Jones family own a ten (10) acre property zoned Single Family Residential\n(SFR). Two (2) acres of the property are within the Scenic Corridor Overlay. The density is\ncalculated as follows:\nBase density @ 3 units/acre x 10 acres = 30 units 50% density bonus for 2 acres in scenic\ncorridor easement\n50% of (2 acres x 3 units/acre) = 3 unit bonus Total Density = 33units\nIf the Jones' provide an easement wider than required, then they would receive a seventy-five\n(75%) density bonus for the area within the easement:\nBase density @ 3units/acre x 10 acres = 30 units 75% density bonus for 2 acres with wider\neasement 75% of (2 acres x 3 ts/acre) = 4.5 unit bonus Total Density = 35 units\n(c.)
