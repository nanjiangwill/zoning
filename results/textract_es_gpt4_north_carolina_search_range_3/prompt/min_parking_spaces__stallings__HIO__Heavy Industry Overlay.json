You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Heavy Industry Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"HIO\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, single family residence, single family, single-family, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer.

This listing is in order of\nintensity of development listed within the district, from least intense to most\nintense: (Amended September 26, 2022)\n(1.) Agriculture (AG)\n(2.) Single Family Residential (SFR-1)\n(3.) Single Family Residential (SFR-2)\n(4.) Single Family Residential (SFR-3)\n(5.) Single Family Residential Mobile Home (SFR-MH)\n(6.) Multi-Family Residential Transitional (MFT)\n(7.) Town Center (TC)\n(8.) Civic (CIV)\n(9.) Mixed Use (MU-1)\n(10.) Mixed Use (MU-2)\n(11.) US Highway 74 Commercial (C 74)\n(12.)Interstate Highway 485 Corporate Park (CP 485)\n(13.) Vehicle Service and Repair (VSR)\n(14.) Business Center (BC)\n(15.)

Heavy Industry Overlay (HIO)\nStallings Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 12\n\n\nNEW PAGE 172\n(19.) Conditional Zoning (CZ)\n8.3\nDescription of Districts\nThe districts created by this ordinance are described as follows:\nThe Agriculture District (AG) is established to protect lands used for agricultural\nproduction, agricultural-based businesses, and related activities. Farmland is a\ndefining element of Stallings's traditional identity and the protection of these lands\naids in preserving the character of the Town. Listed uses are limited, with an\nemphasis on uses that are agricultural in nature.\nDevelopment density is very low to encourage preservation of agricultural lands\nwhile discouraging large lot residential development. The Agriculture District can\nalso be used to protect open spaces.\nThe Single-Family Residential Districts (SFR-1, SFR-2, SFR-3, and SFR-MH)\nprovide for the completion of existing residential neighborhoods and the\ndevelopment of new residential neighborhoods. Allowed building/lot types in the\nSingle-Family Districts are Detached House. Listed uses are restricted to single\nfamily homes and their accessory uses. Neighborhoods in these districts are the\ndominant land use in Stallings and are a major element in defining the character of\nthe community. Standards for the Single-Family Residential Districts promote that\nnew development maintains the character of the community. The Single-Family\nResidential Districts permit the completion and conformity of conventional\nresidential subdivisions already existing or approved in sketch plan form by the\nTown of Stallings prior to the effective date of these regulations.\nThe Multi-Family Residential Transitional District (MFT) provides for the\ncompletion of existing multi-family residential neighborhoods in the residential\narea(s). The intent of this district is to recognize that gradual transformation of\nexisting development to high quality mixed density residential development is\nneeded to support the central core of the Town. Higher density residential\ndevelopment allows a greater number of households to walk or bike, thus reducing\nthe parking demand and providing environmental and health benefits. Allowed\nbuilding/lot types in these districts are the Detached House, Attached House, and\nMulti-family Building. Streets in the Multi-Family Residential Transitional District\nshould be interconnected, with streets and sidewalks providing a connection from\nStallings's Town Center and other mixed-use districts to the Single-Family\nResidential districts surrounding these neighborhoods. A range of housing types is\nencouraged. Criteria for the mix of building types establishes compatibility.\nStallings Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 13\n\nNEW PAGE 199\nsignificant.\n(b.) The width of the scenic easement within the Gateway Scenic Corridor\nshall be ten (10%) percent of the lot depth but no more than fifty (50') feet\nfrom the edge of the highway right-of-way. The Development\nAdministrator may require an additional depth of up to twenty-five (25')\nfeet in order to preserve structures and/or vegetation deemed to be\nsignificant.\n(c.) The width of the scenic easement within the Bypass Scenic Corridor shall\nbe ten (10%) percent of the lot depth but no more than seventy-five (75')\nfeet from the edge of the public right-of-way The Development\nAdministrator may require an additional depth of up to twenty-five (25')\nfeet in order to preserve structures and/or vegetation deemed to be\nsignificant.\n(4.) Scenic Corridor Provisions. The following provisions shall govern\ndevelopment within a designated scenic corridor:\n(a.) The area within the scenic easement may be dedicated to the Town as a\nconservation easement, provided it meets the standards for such an\neasement as established by applicable state and federal standards.\n(b.) Development density shall be calculated for the entire property, including\nthe area within the scenic easement, with the exception that development\ndensity bonuses of up to fifty (50%) percent are given for the portion of the\nproperty within the scenic easement. In the event that the property owner\nprovides a scenic easement wider than required by this ordinance, the\ndensity bonus may be increased up to seventy-five (75%) percent for the\narea located within the scenic easement.\nFor example, the Jones family own a ten (10) acre property zoned Single Family Residential\n(SFR). Two (2) acres of the property are within the Scenic Corridor Overlay. The density is\ncalculated as follows:\nBase density @ 3 units/acre x 10 acres = 30 units 50% density bonus for 2 acres in scenic\ncorridor easement\n50% of (2 acres x 3 units/acre) = 3 unit bonus Total Density = 33units\nIf the Jones' provide an easement wider than required, then they would receive a seventy-five\n(75%) density bonus for the area within the easement:\nBase density @ 3units/acre x 10 acres = 30 units 75% density bonus for 2 acres with wider\neasement 75% of (2 acres x 3 ts/acre) = 4.5 unit bonus Total Density = 35 units\n(c.) Development may be clustered on the portion of the property located\noutside the scenic easement.\nStallings Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 40\n\n\nNEW PAGE 200\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \n(5.) Curb Cuts. There shall be a minimum separation of five hundred (500')\nbetween curb cuts in the suburban scenic corridors. This separation\nrequirement may be waived by the Development Administrator if the width\nof the property frontage would preclude a second curb cut meeting this\nspacing requirement.\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \n(6.) Lot Requirements. The lot type standards and building type standard listed\nin the underlying district, as set forth in Section 8.4 and further described\nin Article 9, shall apply in the Scenic Corridor Overlay District.\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \n(D.) Open Space. The provision and design of open space shall comply with the\nrequirements set forth in Article 21.
