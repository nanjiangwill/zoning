You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Highway Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"HB\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_parking_spaces\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: min parking spaces, offstreet parking & loading, off street parking, parking requirements, parking and loading requirements, parking spaces required, single family residence, single family, single-family, per dwelling, per family dwelling unit, for each dwelling unit. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below.

The intent is to create mixed-\ndensity residential areas that complement commercial districts with physical proximity and pedestrian\nconnectivity.

The Neighborhood Mixed-Use District is intended to\naccommodate pedestrian-scaled, higher-density residential homes, and opportunities for limited-scale\ncommercial activities along existing mixed-use corridors, in areas of transition, and at the functional\ncenter of new neighborhoods. Development in this district should encourage pedestrian activity through\nconstruction of mixed-use buildings and connections to adjacent neighborhoods.

The Highway Business District is intended to provide and encourage the\ndevelopment of high-intensity offices, services, retailing of durable and convenience goods, facilitate\nconvenient access, minimize traffic congestion, and reduce the visual impact of excessive signage and\nparking lots.\nK. Business Office District. The Business Office District is intended to accommodate both large-scale\nbuildings with employees for one business and areas with one or more buildings for multiple businesses\nthat support and serve one another.\nL.\nManufacturing and Industrial District. The Manufacturing and Industrial District is intended to\naccommodate the development and operation of industrial and/or flex space uses that are typically too\nlarge in scale to fit within a neighborhood environment and should be buffered from surrounding\nneighborhood uses. In the interest of economic development, this District is reserved for non-residential\nuses only to preserve adequate opportunities for future relocation and expansion of employment-based\nuses.\nM. Mining and Quarrying District. The Mining and Quarrying District is intended to recognize the unique\ncharacteristics and predominant extractive nature of mines and quarries which do not fit the application\nof most development standards promulgated in a UDO. Due to this unique nature, however, it is\nimportant to establish specific provisions for the protection of the general welfare of adjacent properties\nand the community at large.\n2.3. Purpose and Intent of Conditional Districts\nConditional Districts provide for orderly and flexible development under the spirit and intent of the general\npolicies of the General District without the constraints of the principal structure dimensional standards.\nConditional Districts are constructed in a comprehensive manner and, therefore, establish their own street,\nblock, and lot pattern which may be unique from other surrounding blocks or neighborhoods. Conditional\nDistricts may be self-imposed as detailed in Section 12.2 (G)(3)(f).\nTown of Knightdale\nChapter 2 - Establishment of Districts\nKnightdale Next UDO Update\nPage 4 of 5\n\nNEW PAGE 116\nParking\nb.\nNonresidential uses with off-street parking for motorized vehicles of more than forty (40) spaces shall\nprovide electric vehicle charging stations at a rate of one (1) electric vehicle charging station for every forty\n(40) motorized vehicle spaces; however, no fewer than two (2) and no more than fifteen (15) total electric\nvehicle charging stations shall be required for any single development.\n3.\nUse of Parking Areas. Required parking areas shall be available for the parking of operable vehicles of\nresidents, customers, and employees, and shall not be used for the storage of vehicles or materials, or for the\nparking of vehicles used for loading or unloading, or in conducting the use.\nJ.\nAlternatives to Provision of On-Site Parking.

The Land Use Administrator may exempt up to seventy-five (75) percent of the required employee\nparking spaces in the MI District from the paving requirements of the Section. To qualify for the\nexemption, the parking spaces may not be visible, either by effective buffer screening or because of\nthe grade of the site, from any public right-of-way or a residentially or commercially zoned property.\nC.\nCurbing Required. All vehicle accommodation areas shall be curbed using standard curb and gutter with\na minimum width of one-and-a-half (1.5) feet.

A circulation drive may be permitted around the front of the building but may not encroach into the\nfront setback or any required landscape area.\n2.\nWidth. Circulation drives shall not exceed ten (10) feet in width, except that they may be up to twenty (20) feet\nwide when adjacent to an arterial and located in an MI, BO, or HB district or if on-street parking spaces are\nprovided.\n3.\nPaving Treatments. Circulation drives shall be enhanced with alternative paving treatments such as unit\npavers, stamped concrete, or stamped asphalt. At a minimum, two (2) ten (10) foot long treatments must be\nincluded at the beginning and the terminus of the drive as an indicator to the driver that they are entering and\nleaving a pedestrian area. Additional treatment locations will be required if and where pedestrian crossings of\nthe circulation drive are anticipated.\nM. Specific Motorized Vehicle Parking Area Design Standards.\n1.\nLocation. Parking areas are prohibited from being located in the front yard of a lot as well as from in front of\na building's primary fa\u00e7ade unless otherwise permitted in Chapter 6: Building Type Standards.\n2.\nLandscaping.

Parking spaces should be dimensioned in accordance with Architectural\nGraphics Standards, latest edition.\n4.\nSpecial Event Parking. Off-street areas used for special event parking (to accommodate occasional overflow\nvolumes) may be constructed of a dust-free, compacted, pervious ground cover such as grass or mulch.
