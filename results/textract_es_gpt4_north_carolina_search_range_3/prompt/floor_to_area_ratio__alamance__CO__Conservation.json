For the purpose of promoting the health, safety and the general welfare of the Village of\nAlamance, the Village is divided into districts within which are regulated and restricted\nthe\nerection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair and use of buildings, structures and\nland, the height, number of stories and size of buildings and other structures, the\npercentage of lot that may be occupied, the size of yards, courts and other open spaces, the\ndensity of development and the location and use of buildings, structures and land for\nbusiness, industry, residence or other purposes.\nB.

Such regulations have been made with reasonable\nconsideration, among other things, to the character of each district and its peculiar\nsuitability for particular uses and with a view to encouraging the most appropriate use of\nland throughout the municipality.\nSection 4-2. Removal of Territory from Village; Annexation\nIn the event of changes in Village limits removing territory from the Village, district boundaries\nshall be construed as moving with Village limits. In the event of annexation of new areas to the\nVillage, such areas shall be zoned as recommend by the Planning Board and approved by the\nBoard of Aldermen.\nSection 4-3. Establishment of Districts\nThe purpose of this section is to list and describe the zoning districts herein adopted. For the\npurpose of this ordinance, the Village of Alamance and its one-mile extraterritorial jurisdiction\nare hereby divided into the following use districts:\nVillage of Alamance Zoning Ordinance\nPage 23\nCELL (1, 1): \nRA\nCELL (1, 2): \nResidential Agriculture (low density)\nCELL (2, 1): \nR20\nCELL (2, 2): \nResidential District (low density)\nCELL (3, 1): \nR15\nCELL (3, 2): \nResidential District (moderate density)\nCELL (4, 1): \nRM\nCELL (4, 2): \nResidential Manufactured Housing District\nCELL (5, 1): \nH\nCELL (5, 2): \nHistoric District\n\n\nNEW PAGE 26\nDraft #7\nZONING ORDINANCE\nChapter 4 District Regulations\nResidential/Agriculture District RA - The RA Residential/Agriculture District is established as a\nlow density district in which the principal use of land is for single family residences and\nagriculture. Requirements in this district are designed to ensure that a rural character is\nmaintained.\nResidential District, Low Density R20 - The R20 Residential District is established as a low\ndensity residential district in which the principal use of land is for single family residences.\nResidential District, Moderate Density R15 - The R15 Residential District is established as a\nmoderate density district in which the principal use is single family residences.\nResidential Manufactured Home District - The R-M district shall permit Class A and Class B\nmanufactured homes as well as all uses permitted in the R-A district.

Parallel Conditional Districts Established for Each Zoning District - A Conditional District,\nbearing the designation CD (e.g., MU-CD), is hereby established as a parallel district for every\ndistrict established in the list of General Use districts.\nC.\nOwner must request; Village may identify certain uses requiring CD - In all cases, the\nproperty owner must request rezoning to a Conditional District. This may be done under\nany circumstances when the owner believes a site-specific development plan will increase\nthe potential compatibility of the proposed use. In some cases, the Village may identify in\nadvance certain uses, shown on the Table of Permitted Uses, that require rezoning to the\nparallel Conditional District.\nSection 4-5. Submissions\nReview and approval of conditional zoning petitions involve a legislative hearing and legislative\ndecision by the Board of Aldermen. The review of conditional district zoning petitions shall be\nundertaken in accordance with the normal rezoning procedure with the following additions:\nA. Submissions: The property owner(s) must request the conditional zoning and shall submit a\nmaster site plan that includes:\n1. A boundary survey, with metes and distances showing the property's gross acreage,\ncurrent zoning classification(s), the location of adjacent public streets, railroad right-of-way,\nbodies of water (ponds, lakes, streams, rivers, creeks), date of submittal, north arrow, and\nvicinity map;\n2.
