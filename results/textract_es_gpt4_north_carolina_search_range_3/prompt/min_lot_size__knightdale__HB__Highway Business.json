Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed!

The Mining and Quarrying District is intended to recognize the unique\ncharacteristics and predominant extractive nature of mines and quarries which do not fit the application\nof most development standards promulgated in a UDO.

Purpose and Intent of Conditional Districts\nConditional Districts provide for orderly and flexible development under the spirit and intent of the general\npolicies of the General District without the constraints of the principal structure dimensional standards.\nConditional Districts are constructed in a comprehensive manner and, therefore, establish their own street,\nblock, and lot pattern which may be unique from other surrounding blocks or neighborhoods.
