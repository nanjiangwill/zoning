You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Highway Business\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"HB\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage_pavement\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: lot coverage by impervious surfaces, lot coverage, impervious surface, coverage, maximum imperv. coverage, maximum impervious coverage. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. For max_lot_coverage_pavement in residential districts, we are only\ninterested in the answer as it pertains to single-family homes.\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted.

These\nsecond and third points shall be open and functioning prior to the issuance of the 100th and 501st\nCertificate of Occupancy respectively for the development.\nb. Multi-family Residential Developments. At a minimum, a second point of open and functioning\nvehicular access from the existing public street system (not a stub-out) is required for multi-family\nresidential developments that exceed 100 dwelling units. However, if all buildings are equipped with an\napproved automatic sprinkler system, multi-family projects with up to 200 dwelling units may have a single\nopen and functioning vehicular access. Regardless of automatic sprinkler systems, all multi-family\ndevelopments with more than 200 dwelling units shall have two separate open and functioning vehicular\naccess roads.\n7.\nConnectivity Index. A Connectivity Index shall be used to determine the adequacy of street layout design.\nThis is calculated as the ratio of the number of street links (road sections between intersections) in the project's street\nlayout divided by the number of street nodes (intersections and cul-de-sac heads). For comparison purposes, a\nperfect grid has a Connectivity Index of 2.00 or higher, while a conventional cul-de-sac subdivision is often\n1.00 or less. The accompanying illustration exhibits a connectivity index of 1.22 (links are shown as circles and\nnodes are shown as stars). Street links on existing adjacent streets that are not part of the proposed subdivision\nare not included in the connectivity index calculation. The illustration has eleven (11) links and nine (9) nodes\nfor an index of 11 / 9 = 1.22. Any development shall be required to achieve a Connectivity Index as shown in\nthe following table.\nTown of Knightdale\nChapter 11 - Subdivision Standards\nKnightdale Next UDO Update\nPage 13 of 18\n\n\nNEW PAGE 250\nCirculation and Connectivity\nFigure 11.5: Connectivity Index\nLegend\nLinks 11\nNodes 9\nConnectivity Index = 11/9 = 1.22\nChapter 11 - Subdivision Standards\nPage 14 of 18\nTown of Knightdale\nKnightdale Next UDO Update\nCELL (1, 1): \nTable 11.3(E)(3): Connectivity Index\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (1, 6): \nCELL (1, 7): \nAll Buildings\nCELL (1, 8): \nAll Buildings\nCELL (1, 9): \nCELL (1, 10): \nCELL (1, 11): \nCELL (1, 12): \nCELL (1, 13): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (2, 5): \nCELL (2, 6): \nCELL (2, 7): \nCELL (2, 8): \nCELL (2, 9): \nNMX\nCELL (2, 10): \nTC\nCELL (2, 11): \nHB\nCELL (2, 12): \nBP\nCELL (2, 13): \nMI\nCELL (3, 1): \nStandards\nCELL (3, 2): \nOSP\nCELL (3, 3): \nRT\nCELL (3, 4): \nRR\nCELL (3, 5): \nGR3\nCELL (3, 6): \nGR8\nCELL (3, 7): \nUR12\nCELL (3, 8): \nRMX\nCELL (3, 9): \nCELL (3, 10): \nCELL (3, 11): \nCELL (3, 12): \nCELL (3, 13): \nCELL (4, 1): \nConnectivity Index (Min.)\nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (4, 3): \nCELL (4, 4): \nCELL (4, 5): \nCELL (4, 6): \n1.40\nCELL (4, 7): \n1.40\nCELL (4, 8): \n1.40\nCELL (4, 9): \n1.50\nCELL (4, 10): \n1.60\nCELL (4, 11): \nn/a\nCELL (4, 12): \nn/a\nCELL (4, 13): \nn/a\nCELL (5, 1): \nIndex Score\nCELL (5, 2): \nn/a\nCELL (5, 3): \n1.30\nCELL (5, 4): \n1.30\nCELL (5, 5): \n1.40\nCELL (5, 6): \nCELL (5, 7): \nCELL (5, 8): \nCELL (5, 9): \nCELL (5, 10): \nCELL (5, 11): \nCELL (5, 12): \nCELL (5, 13): \n\nNEW PAGE 251\nCirculation and Connectivity\n8.\nLand Use Administrator-Awarded Modifications. The Land Use Administrator may award reductions to\nthe minimum index value if it is determined that more than sixty (60) percent of any \"side\" of a development\n(four [4] sides total) faces impracticalities for connectivity to adjacent properties due to the presence of\ncontrolled-access highways, railroad rights-of-way, NRBs or existing developments that have not provided\nstreet stub-outs for connection purposes. In addition, the Land Use Administrator may award bonuses to a\ndevelopment's index score where pedestrian greenways are provided to link any cul-de-sac to another street or\ncul-de-sac within the development.\n9. Cross Access. All developments featuring on-site parking lots shall be designed to allow for cross-access to\nadjacent properties to encourage shared parking (Section 7.1 (J)(3)). When cross access is deemed impractical\nby the Land Use Administrator on the basis of severe topography, environmental constraints, or vehicular\nsafety factors, the requirement may be deviated from provided that appropriate bicycle and pedestrian\nconnections are provided between adjacent developments or land uses. Development plans shall provide cross-\naccess easement and complete the connection if completing the link can derive an immediate benefit. If no\nimmediate benefit can be derived, development plans shall provide cross access and construction easements\nand arrange the site design SO when the adjoining property owner extends the connection to the property line,\nthe link will be completed. If the link is to be completed in the future, the grade of the connection, parking,\nlandscaping, and other improvements must be set to allow for extension into the adjacent property.\n10. Bicycle Amenities. In North Carolina, a bicycle has the legal status of a vehicle and is permitted to operate on\nany roadway where NC Board of Transportation policy does not expressly prohibit non-motorized vehicles (i.e.\ninterstates and other fully-controlled, limited access highways). In addition to the preceding requirements of\nthis Section:\na. Bicycle amenities in the form of bike lanes shall be incorporated in the design of all arterials, collector\nstreets and roads with bicycle routes identified on Appendix A: Roadway Network Plan and Appendix B:\nSidepaths and Greenways Plan; and\nb. Bicycle parking shall be provided according to the requirements established in sections 7.1 (F) and (N).\nTown of Knightdale\nChapter 11 - Subdivision Standards\nKnightdale Next UDO Update\nPage 15 of 18\nCELL (1, 1): \nTable 11.3(E)(4): Administrator-Awarded Modifications\nCELL (1, 2): \nTable 11.3(E)(4): Administrator-Awarded Modifications\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nRights of Way\nCELL (2, 3): \nRights of Way\nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (3, 1): \nStandards\nCELL (3, 2): \nControlled-Access Highway, Railroad\nRight-of-Way or Adjacent Developments\nwith No Street Stub-Outs\nCELL (3, 3): \nNeuse River\nBuffer\n(NRB)\nCELL (3, 4): \nPedestrian Greenway\nCELL (4, 1): \nAdministrator-Awarded Reductions\nCELL (4, 2): \nAdministrator-Awarded Reductions\nCELL (4, 3): \nCELL (4, 4): \nCELL (5, 1): \nIndex Value\nCELL (5, 2): \n-0.05\nCELL (5, 3): \n-0.03\nCELL (5, 4): \n-\nCELL (6, 1): \nAdministrator-/ Awarded Bonuses\nCELL (6, 2): \nAdministrator-/ Awarded Bonuses\nCELL (6, 3): \nCELL (6, 4): \nCELL (7, 1): \nIndex Value\nCELL (7, 2): \n-\nCELL (7, 3): \n-\nCELL (7, 4): \n0.03\n\n\nNEW PAGE 252\nCirculation and Connectivity\nF.\nPedestrian Circulation & Connectivity. In order for walking to be a viable transportation choice for local trips,\ncirculation routes must be safe, convenient, and highly connected. Pedestrian circulation and connectivity should\nprimarily take place adjacent to planned streets within the right-of-way; however, a considerable amount of\npedestrian activity also takes place on-site, where vehicle speeds are lower but the numbers of potential conflict\npoints are much higher. As such, the following standards shall be met when designing a connected pedestrian\ncirculation system:\n1.\nAll pedestrian walkways shall be designed to comply with the design standards outlined in Chapter 7.\n2.\nPedestrian crossings shall be made safer for pedestrians whenever possible by shortening crosswalk distances\nwith roadway designs including, but not limited to, curb extensions, reduced curb radii, and the elimination of\nfree right-turn lanes. Traffic calming devices may only be installed according to the Town's \"Traffic Calming\nPolicy\" as most recently adopted by the Town Council and approved by the Fire Code Official. Pedestrian\ncrossings at mid-block or unsignalized locations shall be accompanied by Rectangular Rapid Flash Beacon\n(RRFP) signals. If a mid-block pedestrian crossing is not granted by NCDOT, the bicycle and pedestrian\ninfrastructure shall be modified to account for a crossing at a bordering signalized intersection that is\ndetermined to be the most suitable by the entity or entities owning the intersection roadways.\n3.\nPedestrian walkways shall form an on-site circulation system that minimizes the number of points of conflict\n(where pedestrian networks and bicycle/vehicle networks intersect) between pedestrians and vehicles,\nparticularly where pedestrians access on-site parking and building entrances.\n4.\nPedestrian walkways shall connect building entrances and building entrances with public sidewalk connections\nand existing or planned transit stops.\n5.\nAll developments that contain more than one (1) building shall provide walkways between the principal\nentrances of the buildings.\n6.\nMulti-purpose paths, whether required by Appendix B or built to satisfy the recreational requirements of\nSection 11.2, shall connect to the street system in a safe and convenient manner. These paths should be used to\nenhance pedestrian and bicycle travel where the existing circulation system does not serve these patrons well.\n7.\nTrunk line greenways, as shown in Appendix B, shall be designed in a way that minimizes roadway and alley\ncrossings to the maximum extent possible. Trunk line design shall adhere to natural features such as creeks, as\nshown in Appendix B, even if that entails providing creek and smaller tributary bridge crossings. Signage shall\nalso be provided where trunk line greenways intersect other greenways, and where trunk line greenways\nintersect bicycle and pedestrian destinations such as parks, open space, schools and activity centers. Signage\nshall be in accordance with Town of Knightdale Standard Specifications & Detail Manual.\n8.\nIf a development site includes public greenways on the Comprehensive Transportation Plan Appendix B\nSidepaths and Greenways Plan, any private greenways on the development site shall directly connect to the\npublic greenway network unless deemed not possible by the Land Use Administrator.\n9.\nPublic and private greenways shall not overlap with Stormwater Control Measure (SCM) primary access\neasements, unless approved by the Stormwater Administrator:\nTown of Knightdale\nChapter 11 - Subdivision Standards\nKnightdale Next UDO Update\nPage 16 of 18\n\n\n Output:"}]}
