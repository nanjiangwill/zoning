You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Residential Agricultural\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-A\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage_pavement\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: lot coverage by impervious surfaces, lot coverage, impervious surface, coverage, maximum imperv. coverage, maximum impervious coverage. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. For max_lot_coverage_pavement in residential districts, we are only\ninterested in the answer as it pertains to single-family homes.\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted.

The\ndensity is determined by dividing the total square feet in the parent tract, excluding\nstreet right-of-ways, by the minimum lot size requirement for the underlying zoning\ndistrict.\nb. Cluster developments in watershed areas shall not exceed the allowed density or\nbuilt upon area for the balance of watershed as set forth in Chapter 11 of this\nOrdinance.\n4. Development Standards\na. Development in a Cluster Development shall be exempt from the minimum required\nlot width, lot size, front yard, side yard and rear yard requirements of the Schedule\nof District Regulations and from Section 3.1 and 3.2 relating to relationship of\nbuildings to lots and access to streets provided that the following development\nstandards are followed:\ni.\nAny residential lot with an on-site septic system shall meet the minimum lot\nsize required by the underlying zoning district.

Cluster developments may include property across existing or proposed public\nstreets provided that the property is directly adjoining. Existing public streets shall\nnot count as part of the gross area of the project for determining density.\nC. Cluster developments in the Town of Harmony shall provide a twenty-five (25) foot\nvegetative buffer setback around the development that can be counted towards the\nopen space.\n33\n\n\nNEW PAGE 39\nd. Property containing a proposed bike or pedestrian facility shown in a plan approved\nby the County or Town Governing board must plat and reserve right-of-way for the\nfacility in the location and width recommended in the plan or negotiated to move to\nanother area per Planning Staff approval\ne. All built-upon areas shall be designed and located to minimize stormwater runoff\nimpact to the receiving waters and minimize concentrated stormwater flow.\n5. Open Space\na. In all Cluster Developments at least thirty (30) percent of the area of the overall site\nshall be set aside and dedicated as permanent open space. This shall be land that is\nnot contained in lots, in rights-of-way or parcels devoted to accommodating\nnecessary roads and utilities, or in parcels reserved for future development. Such\nopen spaces shall be conveyed to a homeowners association, public agency,\nnonprofit organization; or be placed in a permanent conservation or farmland\npreservation easement that is organized for, capable of, and willing to accept the\nresponsibility for managing the open space for its intended purpose. Where a\nproperty association is not incorporated, a maintenance agreement shall be filed\nwith the property deeds. In consideration of the purposes served by a cluster\ndevelopment, the title to such open space property shall be preserved to the\nperpetual benefit of the private properties in the development and shall be restricted\nagainst private ownership for any other purposes. If the organization desires,\nimprovements may be made within the open space provided that the maximum\ncoverage of each type of improvement shall not exceed the following:\ni.\nAboveground improvements, three (3) percent of the open space.\nii.\nLevel or below ground improvements, twenty (20) percent of the open space.\nb. Open space shall be dedicated or reserved for one or more of the following uses:\ni.\nConservation of, and avoidance of development in, any readily identifiable\nnatural hazard areas - i.e., areas that potentially pose a significant hazard to\npeople or property (e.g., designated floodways, other perennially wet lands,\nand lands whose slope and/or soils make them particularly susceptible to\nerosion when disturbed by development activities);\nii.\nConservation and protection of any identified significant natural areas (e.g.,\nrare plant communities, important wildlife habitat) or other environmentally\nsensitive areas where development might threaten water quality or\necosystems (e.g., watershed buffers, groundwater recharge areas);\niii.\nConservation and protection of any identified important historic resources\n(e.g., homesteads, mills, barns, archeological sites);\niv.\nProvision of active and/or passive outdoor recreation opportunities (e.g.,\nballfields, playgrounds, tennis courts, swimming pools, basketball courts, golf\ncourses, bikeways, walking trails, nature trails, and picnic areas), either for\n34\n\n\n Output:"}]}
