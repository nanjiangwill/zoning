You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Business Waterfront\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"B-W\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: max lot coverage, building coverage, lot coverage, pervious surface, building area as % of lot, coverage, maximum lot coverage. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. For max_lot_coverage in residential districts, we are only\ninterested in the answer as it pertains to single-family homes.\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted.
