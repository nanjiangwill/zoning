The adjoining parcel is identified as a non-residential classification in the Land Use Plan\nand is vacant or used commercially.\n5. The adjoining parcel has either a commercial or industrial use as identified in the Table of\nPermitted and Special Uses.\nB. Emergency services located in any district may be exempt from part of these requirements in\nthis chapter where installing the landscaping may interfere with visibility when exiting the site.\nExceptions above do not apply if a Performance Requirement in Chapter 5 includes buffering\nand screening.\nSection 8.6 Buffering and Screening\nA. The requirement for the installation of a buffering or screening device shall be initiated by the\noccurrence of any one or more of the following activities on the non-residential property:\n1. The initial use, development or occupancy of the non-residential property;\n2. Any change in use of a non-residential property which requires a site plan review\n(such as but not limited to requiring additional parking or other requirements from\nChapter 5);\n3. Any change of occupancy of a non-residential property which requires a change in\nthe zoning classification; and/or\n4. Any building expansion that increases the floor area of the non-residential use or any\naddition of parking that provides ten (10) or more spaces, whether required or not.\nB. Buffering and screening devices shall be provided along the full length of any property line or\naround the perimeter of the operational area as shown on the site plan.\nC. The buffering and screening devices shall be provided by the non-residential use even if the\nabutting residentially zoned land is vacant.\n86\n\n\nNEW PAGE 92\nD. Buffering and screening devices apply to non-residential uses that adjoin the R-A, RU-R, or\nR-20 zoning districts. See Table 8.1 to determine which device applies.\nTable 8.1 Buffering & Screening Applications\nSection 8.6.1 Buffering Requirements\nA. Any non-residential use located in either the R-O, O-I, N-B, or H-B districts and located on\nproperty abutting any R-A, RU-R, or R-20 district, unless separated by a public street or\nrailroad right-of-way, shall provide a buffering device as described below.\nB. The buffering device is intended to minimize visual contact and to create an impression of\nspatial separation between uses which are incompatible in nature. The buffer may be\ncomposed of a wall, fence, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation.\n1. Where planted vegetation is used, a buffer strip shall be planted. This strip shall be free of\nall encroachment of structures, parking areas, or other impervious surfaces (except\ndriveways). The amount of buffer materials to be planted per one hundred (100) linear feet\nshall be as indicated in the diagrams below.\na. Uses in HB district must provide a thirty (30) foot wide buffer using the following\nplantings (see Figure 5.1):\n4 Canopy Trees,\n3 Understory Trees, and\n24 Shrubs.\nFigure 5.1 Thirty (30) Foot Buffer\n100'\nb.

Where a wall or fence is used, it shall be constructed of brick, stone, masonry, durable wood,\nor vinyl material and shall be at least six (6) feet in height with a ten (10) foot wide buffer\n(See Figure 5.3) of evergreen shrubbery planted on the side of which faces the adjoining\nproperty and completely blocks the view from one land-use to another.\nFigure 5.3 Wall or Fence Buffer\n100'\n3. Where an existing buffer area exists, further planting and/or improvements shall not be\nrequired, provided said buffer area is of sufficient width and depth and contains adequate\nand sufficient materials to meet the requirements of this Ordinance. If the buffer area is\ndeficient, the developer shall make needed improvements and/or additions to satisfy the\nbuffering requirements and intent of this Ordinance.\nSection 8.6.2 Screening Requirements\nA. Any non-residential use located in either the M-1 district or any outdoor storage associated\nwith any non-residential use in either O-I, N-B, H-B, or M-1 districts and located on property\nabutting any R-A, RU-R, R-20, or R-O district, unless separated by a public street or railroad\nright-of-way, shall provide a thirty (30) foot landscaping buffer containing a screening device\nas described below.\nB. The screen is intended to block visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression\nof spatial separation. A screening device shall be at least ninety (90%) percent opaque from\nthe ground to a height of at least six (6) feet. The screen may be composed of a wall, fence,\nplanted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural\nvegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of\nthe subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. Planted vegetation must be a\nminimum of eighteen (18) inches high when planted.\nC. In any case where vegetation, either existing or proposed, is to be used as the required screening\ndevice, if the vegetation is to be less than ten (10) feet in width (thickness), a fence, wall or\nsimilar device at least fifty (50%) percent opaque and six (6) feet in height shall be used in\ncombination with the vegetation. In all cases, the screen must be at least ninety (90%) percent\n88\n\n\nNEW PAGE 94\nopaque in all seasons of the year. Existing vegetation must be a minimum of four (4) feet high\nupon issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the use.\nSection 8.7 Parking Lot Landscaping\nA. In any Zoning District where parking spaces for twenty-five (25) cars are required or provided\nfor a use or uses on a site, the parking lot shall be landscaped with canopy trees as required by\nthis Section at the rate shown below. This requirement shall be initiated by the initial use or\ndevelopment of the property. In addition, in any case where ten (10) parking spaces are added\nto an existing development, whether required or not, the entire parking lot including existing\nparking areas shall be landscaped if the total on the site then equals twenty-five (25) or more.\nB. Canopy trees shall be provided at a rate of one (1) canopy tree for each twelve (12) spaces.\nRequired canopy trees shall be distributed throughout the parking area and shall be located\nwithin or adjacent to parking lots as tree islands, at the end of parking bays, inside medians or\nbetween rows of parking spaces. In no instance shall canopy trees required in this section be\nlocated more than ten (10) feet from the parking area. Canopy trees must be a minimum of six\n(6) feet high.\nC. Parking lots for uses permitted in residential districts that are located within 200 feet of a lot\nused for residential purposes are required to provide a ten (10) foot landscaping buffer with a\ncontinuous screen. This includes parking lots where the property is zoned residential across a\nroad right-of-way. The screen shall consist of evergreen shrubs that are a minimum of eighteen\n(18) inches high when planted and will grow to at least four (4) feet high at maturity. Where\nan existing buffer area exists, further planting and/or improvements shall not be required,\nprovided said buffer area contains adequate and sufficient materials to meet the requirements\nof this Ordinance. If the buffer area is deficient, the developer shall make needed\nimprovements and/or additions to satisfy the buffering requirements and intent of this\nOrdinance.\nSection 8.8 Landscape Roadway Yard\nA. A landscaped roadway yard is a landscaped area parallel to the public roadway designed to\nprovide continuity of vegetation along the right-of-way and a pleasing view from the road.
