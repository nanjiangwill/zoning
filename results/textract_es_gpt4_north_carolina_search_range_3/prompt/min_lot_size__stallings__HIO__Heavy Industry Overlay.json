You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Heavy Industry Overlay\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"HIO\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"min_lot_size\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: min lot size, min lot coverage, min parcel size, min lot and building, area and bulk, min dimensional, min lot area, lot area, min area, min lot area, min lot and area, min lot, min lot requirements, min parcel area, lot size, lot and building, dimensional, min lot, lot requirements, lot and building requirements, area requirements, area and bulk requirements, dimensional requirements. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer. For min_lot_size in residential districts, we are only\ninterested in the answer as it pertains to single-family homes.\n\n# Schema\n{\n    \"extracted_text\": list[str], // The verbatim text from which the result was extracted.

In order to preserve the aesthetic\nquality of the scenic corridors, uses and activities within the designated\nscenic corridors shall be limited to the following:\n(a.) The scenic corridor easement may be used for passive recreation,\nagricultural uses, and equestrian uses. No other use shall be listed within\nthe scenic corridor easement.\n(b.) No building construction, parking, land disturbing activity, signs, tree\nremoval, lighting (other than street lighting provided by the Town of\nStallings and driveway or private road lighting provided that said lighting\nis provided by full cutoff fixtures), or other development activity shall\noccur within the scenic corridor easement except as follows:\n(i.) A bikeway, greenway, and/or other pedestrian/bicycle facility may be\nlocated within the scenic corridor easement.\n(ii.)

Buildings used primarily for agricultural and/or equestrian related\nactivities may be built in the scenic corridor easement upon approval\nby the Town Council as a Special Use. Parking shall be located\nbehind the building, shall not be located within the scenic easement,\nand shall be buffered from the scenic corridor. The Town Council\nshall consider the following items in making the decision to allow\naforesaid buildings in the scenic easement:\n1. The building's visual impact on the scenic corridor;\n2. The building's size; and\n3. The compatibility of the building's architecture with\ncommunity character and the purposes of the scenic corridor\noverlay district.\n(3.) Scenic Corridor Dimensions. The designated scenic corridors shall meet the\nfollowing dimensional standards:\n(a.) The width of the scenic easement within the Suburban Scenic Corridor\nshall be ten (10%) percent of the lot depth but no more than one hundred\n(100') feet from the edge of the public right-of-way. The Development\nAdministrator may require an additional scenic depth of up to fifty (50')\nfeet in order to preserve structures and/or vegetation deemed to be\nStallings Development Ordinance - Article 8 - Page 39\n\n\nNEW PAGE 199\nsignificant.\n(b.)

In the event that the property owner\nprovides a scenic easement wider than required by this ordinance, the\ndensity bonus may be increased up to seventy-five (75%) percent for the\narea located within the scenic easement.\nFor example, the Jones family own a ten (10) acre property zoned Single Family Residential\n(SFR). Two (2) acres of the property are within the Scenic Corridor Overlay. The density is\ncalculated as follows:\nBase density @ 3 units/acre x 10 acres = 30 units 50% density bonus for 2 acres in scenic\ncorridor easement\n50% of (2 acres x 3 units/acre) = 3 unit bonus Total Density = 33units\nIf the Jones' provide an easement wider than required, then they would receive a seventy-five\n(75%) density bonus for the area within the easement:\nBase density @ 3units/acre x 10 acres = 30 units 75% density bonus for 2 acres with wider\neasement 75% of (2 acres x 3 ts/acre) = 4.5 unit bonus Total Density = 35 units\n(c.)
