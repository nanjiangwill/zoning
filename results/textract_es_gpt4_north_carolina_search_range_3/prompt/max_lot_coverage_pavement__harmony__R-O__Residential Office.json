You are looking for facts inside a\ndocument about a Zoning District with the name \"Residential Office\" and with an\nabbreviated name \"R-O\".\n\nYou are looking to find the value for \"max_lot_coverage_pavement\", which also goes by the\nfollowing other names: lot coverage by impervious surfaces, lot coverage, impervious surface, coverage, maximum imperv. coverage, maximum impervious coverage. Only output values that are seen in the\ninput and do not guess! Output MUST be valid JSON, and should follow the schema\ndetailed below. Ensure that the field \"extracted_text\" does not span multiple\nlines and that it is a real substring of the input. You CANNOT make up a value\nfor \"extracted_text\", and it MUST be a substring! \"extracted_text\" will be used\nin the python statement `extracted_text in input` and if that returns False, the\nuniverse will be destroyed! If you cannot extract reasonable text, then you\nshould not return an answer.

If the buffer area is\ndeficient, the developer shall make needed improvements and/or additions to satisfy the\nbuffering requirements and intent of this Ordinance.\nSection 8.6.2 Screening Requirements\nA. Any non-residential use located in either the M-1 district or any outdoor storage associated\nwith any non-residential use in either O-I, N-B, H-B, or M-1 districts and located on property\nabutting any R-A, RU-R, R-20, or R-O district, unless separated by a public street or railroad\nright-of-way, shall provide a thirty (30) foot landscaping buffer containing a screening device\nas described below.\nB. The screen is intended to block visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression\nof spatial separation. A screening device shall be at least ninety (90%) percent opaque from\nthe ground to a height of at least six (6) feet. The screen may be composed of a wall, fence,\nplanted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural\nvegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of\nthe subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. Planted vegetation must be a\nminimum of eighteen (18) inches high when planted.\nC. In any case where vegetation, either existing or proposed, is to be used as the required screening\ndevice, if the vegetation is to be less than ten (10) feet in width (thickness), a fence, wall or\nsimilar device at least fifty (50%) percent opaque and six (6) feet in height shall be used in\ncombination with the vegetation. In all cases, the screen must be at least ninety (90%) percent\n88\n\n\nNEW PAGE 94\nopaque in all seasons of the year.
