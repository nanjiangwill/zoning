In considering all proposed variances to this chapter, the Board shall, before making any\nfinding in a specific case, first determine that the proposed variance will not allow the establishment of\na use not otherwise permitted in a district by this chapter; extend in area or expand a non-conforming\nuse of land; change the district boundaries shown on the zoning map; impair any adequate supply of\nlight and air to adjacent property; materially increase the public danger of fire; materially diminish or\nimpair established property values within the surrounding area; or in any other respect impair the\npublic health, safety, morals and general welfare.\n26 of 59\n3/29/2024, 12:46\n"}, {"page": "27", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/d8c417d1-3884-4c04-aa\n(3) In granting a variance, the Board may attach thereto such time and conditions regarding the\nlocation, character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it may deem\nadvisable in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.\n(4) Before a variance is granted, it shall be shown that special circumstances attach to the\nproperty which do not generally apply to other property in the neighborhood. A variance may be\ngranted only when the practical difficulty or undue hardship complained of is due to the particular\ncharacteristics of the property and not to the general conditions of the neighborhood which may reflect\nan undue stringency of the ordinance itself. A hardship peculiar to the applicant, as distinguished from\nothers affected by the general rule, must be shown. The fact that property may be utilized more\nprofitably will not be considered adequate to justify the Board in granting a variance.\n(5) Findings of fact. When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter\nof a zoning regulation, the Board of Adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of the zoning\nregulation upon a showing of all the following:\n(a) Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the regulation. It is not\nnecessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the\nproperty;\n(b) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size,\nor topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from\nconditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for\ngranting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate to make a\nreasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a person with a disability;\n(c) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The\nact of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a\nvariance is not a self-created hardship; and\n(d) The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the regulation,\nsuch that public safety is secure and substantial justice is achieved.\n(Ord. passed 7-1-1980; Res.

In these cases, a special use permit must be obtained. Special\nuse permits may be granted by the Stoneville Board of Adjustment as permitted by G.S. \u00a7 160D-705.\nThe Board shall follow quasi-judicial procedures pursuant to G.S. \u00a7 160D-406.\n(B) Procedures.

The Board of Adjustment\nmay waive a particular requirement if in its opinion the inclusion is not essential to a proper decision of\nthe project. The Board of Adjustment may impose reasonable conditions in addition to those listed in\nthis section or in other parts of this chapter. Applications for special use permits may be made by the\nlandowner, a lessee or person holding an option or contract to purchase or lease land, or an\nauthorized agent of the landowner.

The applicant, the town, and any person who would have standing\nshall have the right to fully participate including presenting competent, material, and substantial\nevidence relevant to the case at the evidentiary hearing, cross-examining witnesses, objecting to\nevidence, and making legal arguments. Other witnesses may present competent, material, and\nsubstantial evidence that is not repetitive as allowed by the Board. Opinion testimony from a lay\nwitness shall not be considered evidence for technical matters such as property values and traffic\nimpacts.\n(4) Action by the Board.\n(a) The Board of Adjustment shall consider the application and competent, material, and\nsubstantial evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing and may grant or deny the special use\npermit requested.

Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or\naccessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the\ninstallation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of\na tower or antenna complies with district development regulation, including but not limited to set-back\nrequirements, lot-coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire\nlot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such\nlots. Towers that are constructed and antennas that are installed in accordance with the provisions of\nthis subchapter shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.\n(C) Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant, for an administrative approval or a special use\npermit, shall provide to the Zoning Administrator an inventory of its existing towers that are either\nwithin the jurisdiction of the governing authority or within one-quarter mile of the border thereof,\nincluding specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower.

To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a\ntower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local\nbuilding codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries\nAssociation, as amended from time to time. If upon inspection, the governing authority concludes that\na tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or\nproperty, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the governing authority shall not\nissue a certificate of occupancy and power will not be permitted until such non-compliances are\ncorrected.\n(G) Coverage-need.
