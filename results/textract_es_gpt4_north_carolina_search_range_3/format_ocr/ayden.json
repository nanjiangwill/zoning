Should the Administrator determine that a materially\nsimilar use does exist, the regulations governing that use shall apply to the particular use not listed\nand the Administrator's decision shall be recorded in writing.\nD. Similar Uses\nThe Administrator may determine that a use is materially similar if a permitted use is similarly\nclassified by one or more of the following use classification systems:\n1. Land Based Classification Standards (LBCS) of the American Planning Association (APA)\n2. North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS)\nE. Use Table\nUses listed as (P) or (PS) which require a Transportation Impact Analysis (according to Article 7 -\nSubdivisions & Infrastructure), multi-family dwelling developments and all subdivision\ndevelopments with 10 lots or more, are subject to the Major Site/Major Subdivision Preliminary\nPlan Review Process established in Article 8 - Development Processes.

Height\n1. Other than the provisions listed in this Section, buildings and structures shall not exceed the\nmaximum heights established in Article 3 - Zoning Districts of this ordinance.\n2. The height of a building is the vertical distance measured from the mean elevation of finished\ngrade at the front of the building to the highest point of the building.\n3. A story includes any floor above the mean elevation of finished grade at the front of the\nbuilding. Where floor levels are staggered, the number of stories is the number of floors\ncounting vertically from the point of the mean elevation of finished grade at the building front.\n4. Roofs with slopes greater than seventy-five (75) percent are regarded as walls.\n5. Chimneys, church spires, water tanks, elevator shafts, scenery lofts\n6. and similar structural appendages not intended as places of occupancy are exempt from the\nheight limitation set forth in this Section,\n7. provided that not more than one-third (1/3) of the roof area is covered by such structures.\n8.

Screen or parapet walls shall\n10. be constructed to the height of any fixture taller than three (3) feet in height that would be\nvisible from a street or residential property abutting the property.\n11. The height requirements for wireless telecommunications towers & facilities are provided in\nArticle 3 - Zoning Districts & Article 4 - Individual Use Standards of this ordinance.\n12. Light standard heights shall not exceed the limits established in this ordinance.\n13. Flagpoles and similar devices shall be limited to thirty-five (35) feet in height.\nB. Setbacks\n1. Setbacks Required. No portion of any building, excluding leaves, decks, patios, steps and\nuncovered porches may be located on any lot closer to any lot line or to the street right-of-\nway line than is authorized in Article 3 - Zoning Districts of this ordinance. All setbacks are\nexpressed in feet and are minimum setbacks unless otherwise noted. Additional setbacks\nmay be required to meet parking, landscaping, buffers or other standards specified in this\nArticle, the specific use standards of Article 4 - Individual Use Standards of this UDO.\n2.\nAllowed Setback Encroachments. A step, stoop, open porch, lawnings or other\nappurtenances may extend up to five (5) feet into the front setback, provided such features\ndo not impede pedestrian circulation or extend more than twenty-five (25) percent into the\nminimum setback. Attached and detached carports are permitted in the front yard setback\nand must meet the front setback requirements of the underlying zoning district and have an\nimproved driveway surface.

If the street right-of-way line is readily determinable (by reference to a recorded map, set\nirons, or other means), the setback shall be measured at a right angle to such right-of-\nway line. If the right-of-way line is not so determinable, the setback shall be measured\nfrom the street centerline.\nC. All setbacks are subject to compliance with adopted applicable fire code provisions.\nC. Relationship of Building to Lot\nIn no case shall there be more than one principal building and its customary accessory buildings\non a lot except in the case of a designed complex of professional, residential or commercial\nbuildings in an appropriate zoning district.\nD. Street Access\nNo building shall be erected on a lot which does not abut a street or have access to a street,\nprovided that in a planned development, a building may be erected adjoining a parking area or\ndedicated open space which has access to a street used in common with other lots.\nE. Infill Development Standards\nInfill development is any new development on land that has been previously developed or vacant\nland where development has occurred around the vacant land.\n1.\nStreet Frontages. New structures should orient windows, main entrances, and other\nprimary building fa\u00e7ade elements toward the street. Care should be taken to avoid the\nappearance of buildings turning their backs or sides toward the street.\n2.\nFront Setback Pattern. The minimum front setback required may be reduced by the\nAdministrator for any lot where the average established front yard setback on developed lots\nlocated within 300 feet on each side of such lot, and fronting on the same street as such lot,\nis less than the minimum required yard setback. In such cases, the minimum front or street\nyard setback may be less than that required but not less than the average of the existing\nfront yard setbacks on the developed lots within 300 feet of each side. In addition, for new\nlots created from existing larger lots, the lot width at the frontage line and the side yard\nsetbacks shall be consistent with the immediately adjacent neighboring parcels on the same\nside of the street.\nTOWN OF AYDEN, NC\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-3\nADOPTION DATE: JANUARY 13, 2020\n"}, {"page": "59", "text": "GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\n3.\nDriveways.

It is the purpose of this section to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and\nto minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within the flood prone areas\nby provisions designed to:\na. restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to\nwater or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood\nheights or velocities;\nb. require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be\nprotected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;\nC. control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective\nbarriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;\nd. control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion\nor flood damage; and\ne. prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood\nwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\n2.

Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and\nincreases stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream channel\nerosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and sediment transport and deposition, as\nwell as reducing groundwater recharge;\n2. These changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of waterborne\npollutants and alterations in hydrology which are harmful to public health and safety as\nwell as to the natural environment and these effects can be managed and minimized by\napplying proper design and well-planned controls to manage stormwater runoff from\ndevelopment sites.\n3. Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 and federal Phase Il Stormwater\nRules promulgated under it, as well as rules of the North Carolina Environmental\nManagement Commission promulgated in response to federal Phase Il requirements,\ncompel certain urbanized areas, including this jurisdiction, to adopt the minimum\nstormwater controls such as those included in this chapter.\n4.
