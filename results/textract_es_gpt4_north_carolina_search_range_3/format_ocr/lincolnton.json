Users are responsible for obtaining and renewing permits, if required.\n(B) Permit limits. Users are responsible for maintaining compliance with all effluent limits. The POTW will\nevaluate the extent of the limits violation(s). In determining the extent of violation(s), significant non-compliance\n(SNC) as defined by state and EPA regulations will be determined.\n(C) Self-monitoring violations. A user who fails to adequately conduct all the monitoring required in the permit,\nincluding monitoring frequencies and sampling methods specified, is in violation. This includes a user who does\nnot resample per their permit when a limit violation occurs.\n(D) Reporting violations. A user who fails to provide information (such as, self monitoring reports) required in\ntheir permit or this chapter in the required time frame is in violation. Late or incomplete reports will also be\nconsidered violations. A SIU who submits a report more than 30 days late is possibly considered in SNC.\n(E) Permit conditions. Failure to apply or reapply for a permit is considered a violation. Users who violate the\ngeneral or other conditions (such as, slug loading, dilution prohibition) outlined in their permits or this chapter\nshall be considered to be in violation.\n(F) Enforcement orders. Failure to meet the requirements of an order (such as, interim limits, milestone\ndates), whether the order was entered into voluntarily or mandated by the POTW, shall be considered a\nviolation. Missing a scheduled compliance milestone by more than 90 days is considered SNC.\n(Ord. passed 7-29-2008)\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/downloa\n61/501\n"}, {"page": "62", "text": "6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n\u00a7 52.189 RESPONSES: TIMEFRAMES, RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS, ESCALATED ACTIONS.\n(A) The following chart further outlines types of violations and specifies POTW actions (initial and escalated),\ntimeframes, and the officials responsible for completing the actions.

This would allow the minimum requirements of the Insurance Service Office. Pipe\nsystems should be arranged in loops whenever possible. The City Public Works Department will be in charge of\nmaking the decision on the minimum water supply piping size to ensure the city has the necessary water\npressure needed to meet the water flow requirements at the hydrant. The size of the pipe is recommended to be\nas follows: no pipe less than six inches in diameter is to be used as a main water supply line; no less than six-\ninch pipe to be used for two outlet hydrants or to supply the hydrant from the main; eight-inch or larger pipe to be\nused if possible it is a dead-end main or if more than one hydrant is to be supplied; 12-inch or larger pipe to be\nused for the primary main as much as possible. Hydrants should be set plumb with the centerline of their outlets\nabout 18 inches above the ground. When hydrants are installed before grading is complete, the final grade line\nand accessibility should be considered.\n(E) Although the installation of fire hydrants is usually performed by Water Department personnel, the Water\nDepartment shall check with the Fire Marshal's office for the location, spacing and distribution of the fire hydrant.\nThis will ensure that the city is meeting the NFPA standards and the Insurance Service Office requirements. By\nmeeting these two requirements, the city will be providing the most adequate water supply for fire protection for\nthe citizens of the city who live and work in that area. The maximum distance between hydrants shall not exceed\n1,000 feet. In closely built areas, subdivisions, townhouses, commercial/industrial with lot frontage 100 feet or\nless than 500 feet or less will be the maximum distant between hydrants. Hydrants should be located as close to\nthe street and intersections as possible. Hydrants that must be located in areas subject to heavy traffic need\nprotection against damage from collision. (Hydrants must be inspected and approved prior to final plot approval.)\n(F) Hydrant testing and maintenance. Due to requirements by the insurance rating services and other\nrequirements by the insurance industry, the hydrants shall be serviced a minimum of once a year. The Water\nDepartment and/or Fire Department will be overseeing this section. The following is a list of guidelines to go by\nto perform those requirements:\n(1) Clean around hydrant (this would include removing weeds and the like);\n(2) Remove small caps and check gaskets in caps (rotate or replace as necessary);\n(3) Open hydrant slowly and flush hydrant with caps off;\n(4) Close hydrant slowly (do not over-tighten the hydrant when closing);\n(5) Brush or clean hydrant cap threads as needed and lubricate the cap threads;\n(6) Oil hydrant (lubricant used to oil hydrant and cap threads will be a food grade grease);\n(7) Replace caps and energize (open slowly) hydrant. Completely open hydrant slowly and wait ten to 15\nseconds before closing hydrant;\n(8) Check for any leaks;\n(9) Close hydrant slowly;\n(10) Fill out proper paperwork (hydrant maintenance sheet). Make any notes of work that needs to be done;\nand\n(11) Proceed to next hydrant.\n(G) Fire flow testing and marking of hydrants.\n(1) Fire flow tests are conducted on water distribution systems to determine the rate of flow available at\nvarious locations for fire fighting purposes.\n(2) Additional benefit derived from fire flow tests is the indication of possible deficiencies (such as\ntuberculation of piping or closed valves or both), which can be corrected to ensure adequate fire flows as\nneeded.\n(3) All hydrants in each fire district shall be flow tested. All equipment used and the testing procedure need\nto be done by NFPA Standards.\n(H) Marking of hydrants. Once all flow tests have been completed and the flows for each hydrant have been\ndetermined, then each hydrant will need to be marked according to the NFPA Standards.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n245/501\n"}, {"page": "246", "text": "6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n(I) Public hydrants.\n(1) All barrels are to be chrome yellow except in cases where another color has already been adopted.

Hazardous materials disclosure shall be as specified in G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 95-173 through 95-218.\n(B) Hazard identification signs.\n(1) The increasing use of a wide variety of chemicals, many of which introduce problems other than\nflammability, lead to the need for a simple hazard identification system. The purpose of a system would be to\nsafeguard the lives of those individuals who may be concerned with fire and spills occurring in these facilities or\nbusinesses. This system provides simple, readily recognizable and easily understood markings, which will give,\nat a glance, a general idea of the inherent hazards of any material and the order of severity of these hazards as\nthey relate to fire prevention, exposure and control. Its objectives are to provide an appropriate alerting signal\nand on the spot information to safeguard the lives of the Fire Department, rescue squad, EMS members and law\nenforcement during emergencies at these facilities. It will also make employees aware of the potential hazards\nand bring the facility into compliance with Hazardous Chemicals Right To Know Act.\n(2) The 704 symbols are usually seen on the exterior surfaces of buildings and aboveground storage tanks.\nThe 704 symbols shall be required to identify any area that is deemed to be a hazard. This determination is to\nbe made by the Fire Marshal.\n(a) Signs required. Per the Fire Code, hazard and identification signs as outlined in NFPA 704 shall be\nplaced accordingly at all entrances to and in locations where hazardous materials are stored, handled or used in\nexcess of the exempt amounts.\n(b) Size of signs and types.

During plan reviews the Fire Marshal's office will use both single hydrant and two hydrant\nmethods for testing purposes.\n2. Definition. Water is the most available tool used for the extinguishments of fires. The purpose of a Fire\nDepartment performing hydrant flow test is to determine whether the water system can furnish adequate\namounts of water to meet the fire flow demands, based on the classification of the occupancies in the immediate\narea.\n3. Equipment needed.\nA. Hydrant wrench - two.\nB. Hydrant cap pressure gauge - one.\nC. Pitot flow gauge (blade or barrel type) - one.\nD. Hydrant form (to record information).\n4. Procedure (one hydrant test method, not be used for plan review flow requirements).\nA. Select the hydrant to be tested.\nB. Perform light maintenance.\nC. Hydrant must be flushed prior to beginning flow test.\nD. Choose which two and one-half-inch discharge will affect landscaping, traffic and the like the most and\nplace a pressure cap gauge on this discharge. Open the hydrant fully. Note the pressure on the gauge. This is\nthe static pressure. Record the static pressure on the hydrant report form. Close the hydrant slowly.\nE. Take the two and one-half-inch-cap opposite the pressure cap gauge off the hydrant. Install a barrel type\npitot gauge on this discharge opening if you have one.\nF.

In the event that the unusual topography or elevation of a development\nsite or the location or size of the parcel to be developed would make strict adherence to the requirements of this\nsection serve no meaningful purpose or would make it physically impossible to install and/or maintain the\nrequired screen, the Administrator may alter the requirements of this chapter provided the spirit and intent of the\nscreening requirement as outlined in this section are maintained. An alteration may occur only at the request of\nthe developer, who shall submit a plan to the Administrator showing existing site features that would screen the\nproposed use and any additional screen materials the developer will plant or construct to screen the proposed\nuse.

The location of required front, side and rear yards on irregularly shaped lots shall be\ndetermined by the Administrator. The determination will be based on the spirit and intent of this chapter to\nachieve and appropriate spacing and location of buildings and structures on individual lots.\n(B) Front yards and rear yards on corner lots.\n(1) On corner lots, the front yard shall be measured perpendicular from the street lot line having the\nshortest linear footage. If both street lot lines have equal linear footage and no principal structure is located on\nthe lot, the property owner shall determine the location of the front yard. On lots having equal frontage and there\nis a principal structure located on the lot the front yard shall be based on the architectural orientation of the\nhouse. Once the front yard is determined the rear yard shall be the yard opposite the front yard.\n(2) A graphic example of this is as follows:\nFigure B\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n335/501\n"}, {"page": "336", "text": "6/26/23. 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n(C) Front yards and rear yards on through lots.\n(1) On through lots, the required front and rear yards shall each equal or exceed the greater of either the\nrequired front or rear yard setback that would normally be applied in that zoning district. For example, if a\nthrough lot were located in a zoning district which normally required a 35-foot front setback and a 25-foot rear\nsetback, both front and rear setbacks would have to equal or exceed 35 feet. For the purpose of placing\naccessory structures, however, the rear yard shall be deemed to be the yard opposite the street-side yard which\nthe architectural front of the building faces.

The purpose of establishing supplementary requirements for development in the Central\nBusiness (CB) and Central Business Transitional (CBT) Districts is to protect and enhance the visual character\nof development and to preserve the unique streetscape of downtown by encouraging compatibility among\ndowntown structures.\n(B) Development standards.\n(1) Buildings within the CB and CBT Districts exhibit design elements that contribute to the unique sense of\ncharacter of downtown Lincolnton. Specifically, older retail style buildings tend to have flat or low pitch roofs\nconcealed by the front fa\u00e7ade parapet, no front or side yard setback, large storefront windows on the first floor\nand strong horizontal separations between the first and any upper floors created by window and/or changes in\nfa\u00e7ade materials. Adjacent retail structures should embrace that style when possible. The many churches exhibit\nprimarily two distinct styles, late gothic revival and classic (Greek) revival. Perimeter buildings and residential\nbuildings convey a more common pitched roof, with styles of colonial, revival and craftsman (among others)\nintermingled. Some of the older structures have or had steep pitched metal roofs in neutral or muted colors. New\nor renovated structures in CB and CBT zones are expected to compliment the nearby structures, extending\nstyles that adjoin or creating an aesthetic blend from style to style where adjoining styles transition, particularly\nat the zoning district edges where blending from style to style is important.\n(2) In order to continue, recreate and, in some cases, replicate (such as in the CBT District) the historic\ndevelopment pattern of downtown Lincolnton, the following standards shall apply to all new construction,\nadditions, and substantial modifications to existing structures; except that the Board of Adjustment may waive or\nmodify one or more requirements whenever, in its opinion, the waiver or modification is consistent with the intent\nof this section and results in a development which meets the findings of fact required herein. For the purposes of\nthis section, SUBSTANTIAL MODIFICATION shall be defined as any work which involves the alteration of the\nbuilding's footprint, construction of additional stories, changes in roof pitch, modification of building fenestration\nand entryways, material changes to the building fa\u00e7ade, or painting which does not use natural material colors.\n(a) Awnings and canopies. When used, lawnings and canopies shall be placed at the top of window\nopenings and shall relate to the shape of the top of the window. Awnings shall be made of canvas or treated\ncanvas material; or standing seam prefinished metal on open metal framing. Awnings, where existing conditions\nare in place and subject to staff review, can be recovered with slate or simulated slate, shingles, or standing\nseam metal in neutral or earth tone colors. In new construction the above standards may be incorporated when\ndetermined by staff that it is appropriate, based on review of other nearby structures, generally within\napproximately 300 feet of the new building and within the same zoning district. Vinyl lawnings are not permitted.\nNo lawning shall extend more than two-thirds the width of the sidewalk or nine feet, whichever is less. Awnings\nand canopies must be self-supporting from the wall; no supports shall rest on or interfere with the use of\npedestrian walkways or street. In no case shall any lawning extend beyond the street curb or interfere with street\ntrees or public utilities. The use of metal or other rigid roofing material is not intended to be used as a vertical\nfacade for lawnings or canopies. A vertical drop of acceptable scale is permitted. Metal is not permitted as a\nvertical wall face or screen.\n(b) Building height. In no case shall any structure in the downtown exceed the height of the base of dome\non the Lincoln Cultural Center.\n(c) Building presentation. In individual commercial buildings, building entrances shall face the street and\nbe accessible from the public sidewalk. Any portion of a building that faces an adjacent street right-of-way shall\nbe considered a building front and shall be subject to the presentation entrance and fenestration requirements of\nthis section. For non-commercial buildings (residential, religious, etc) or for commercial cluster group\ndevelopment, when approved, the street facade shall be addressed via fenestration requirements or design\nelements and entrances shall be accessible via walkways or plazas from the public sidewalk.\n(d) Building width. Additions and new construction located in the CB or CBT Districts shall maintain the\nexisting building wall by extending the building front from side lot line to side lot line, except that an appropriate\narchitectural wall or similar design feature may be used instead of a building extension. Where penetration\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download\n338/501\n"}, {"page": "339", "text": "6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\nthrough the lot line is required, such as access for pedestrians or vehicular access to an area behind the front,\nsuch as rear yard parking or courtyards, the penetration shall be appropriately visually framed, by use of a fence\ntermination feature, walls, replicated or existing building walls, or scalable landscaping where appropriate,\nsubject to staff review.\n(e) Color. Additions and new construction shall relate paint colors to natural material colors found on\nneighboring historic buildings and nearby buildings. Contrasting colors, which accent architectural details and\nentrances may be used. (A pallet of suggested colors is available.)\n(f) Fenestration. New construction and remodeling of existing buildings in the CB and CBT Districts shall\nmaintain the prevalent pattern and spacing of the windows and doorways on downtown buildings. Windows on\nthe street level front of buildings shall constitute at least 20% and not more than 50% of the fa\u00e7ade. Window on\nsubsequent levels shall be a minimum of 15 square feet. Windows must be clear, transparent glass (not mirrored\nor tinted dark) and shall not be lower than two feet above grade. Double-hung windows with a height-to-width\nratio of 2:1 are preferred for upper stories. No window or door shall be horizontally separated by more than 15\nfeet from the nearest other window or door in the same fa\u00e7ade. Frames and sashes for windows shall be of\nwood, vinyl or pre-finished metal and may have stone, brick or cast concrete lintels and stills. Window glass shall\nalways be set back from the building face rather than flush.\n(g) Front build-to-line.\n1. The fronts of all new commercial buildings constructed in the CB District shall abut existing\nsidewalks, where provided, except for outdoor caf\u00e9-type uses when a low wall or other architectural articulation\nis carried across the right-of-way to continue the visual continuity of building faces.\n2. The fronts all new commercial buildings constructed in the CBT District may vary from zero to 20 feet\n(i.e., thus creating a maximum front yard setback of zero to 20 feet) as measured from the street right-of-way\nboundary. Variable front yard setbacks are encouraged in the CBT District to allow for building articulation. Any\nsetback areas shall be geared for pedestrian use. No off-street parking shall be allowed in these areas. Outdoor\nstorage of retail goods (during daylight hours) shall be permitted, as shall outdoor seating areas.\n(h) Horizontal rhythms. Downtown building patterns traditionally emphasized a strong horizontal design\nelement. New construction and additions to or remodeling of existing buildings shall maintain a clear visual\ndivision between street level and any upper architectural feature used to accomplish this effect.\n(i) Materials. Fa\u00e7ade materials found in the downtown district include wood, brick and stone. Additions\nand new construction shall use facing materials that are compatible in quality, color, texture, finish, and\ndimension to those common in the downtown area. Acceptable materials include, but may not be limited to brick,\nstone or wood. Under no circumstances shall metal siding, unfinished concrete block or vinyl siding be allowed.\n(j) Roofs. Additions and new construction using flat pitch or low pitch roof design (anything under 3:12)\nmust install parapet walls on all sides or cap the walls with a cornice treatment that provides articulation to the\nroofline. When the roof drains to the rear of the building and is guttered the parapet may be eliminated upon staff\napproval.\n(k) Signs. Signs should relate in placement and size to other building elements and shall not obscure\nbuilding elements such as windows, cornices or decorative details. Sign material, style and color shall\ncomplement the building fa\u00e7ade in terms of design, scale, color and materials. Individual shop signs in a single\nstorefront shall relate to each other in design, size, color, placement on the building, and lettering style. Canvas\nsigns placed on the outside of buildings, excluding canopy signs, whether for permanent or temporary use are\nprohibited. Signs placed on the inside of window areas shall conceal no more than 20% of the area of the\nwindow on which the signs are located.\n(I) Streetscape protection. Any damage to the existing streetscape design, including street trees, by\ndevelopment, use, or condition or private property shall be corrected by the proper owner at the owner's\nexpense to the satisfaction of the city's Public Works Department, prior to the release of a certificate of\noccupancy. Any damage not corrected by the owner shall be corrected by the city, the cost of which is to be\nbilled to the owner, including city administrative costs. For the purposes of this section, STREETSCAPE shall be\ndefined to include any public improvement adjacent to private property.\n(m) Walls and entrances. Walls and entrances in the CB and CBT Districts shall be designated to\nencourage and complement pedestrian-scale activity. Recessed doorways at building fronts are required.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download\n339/501\n"}, {"page": "340", "text": "6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n(C) Demolition.\n(1) No building shall be demolished without the building owner or his or her representative first consulting\nwith the city's Planning Director or his or her designee. Following initial communication from the building owner,\nthe Director shall have 21 days to render a recommendation to the applicant.\n(2) If the property owner so desires, he or she may secure a demolition permit from the Lincoln County\nBuilding Inspector at the end of the 21-day review period. The demolition of any contributing member of the\nNational Register District is strongly discouraged.\n(D) Procedures. Prior to the construction of any new building, structure or parking area or the substantial\nrenovation of that, a zoning permit must be secured from the Administrator.\n(E) Permit applications. Applications for a zoning permit shall be accompanied by supporting material\nsufficient to determine compliance with the standards outlined in this section. The material shall include, but may\nnot be limited to, a detailed site plan, street elevations, a height disclosure statement, and where necessary, the\nlocation of all public utilities. The information shall be sealed by a registered engineer, surveyor, architect or\nlandscape architect licensed in the state. Applications for a zoning permit shall be filed on forms provided by the\nPlanning Department. The Administrator will consider no incomplete applications.

In addition to the\nprimary uses that are permitted by right or subject to prescribed standards, other uses including accessory uses,\noff-street parking and signs are permitted as listed in this chapter.\n(B) The districts are divided into three different categories:\n(1) General zoning districts;\n(2) Overlay districts; and\n(3) Conditional zoning districts.\n(Prior UDO, \u00a7 6.1) (Ord. passed )\n\u00a7 153.091 GENERAL ZONING DISTRICTS.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/downloa\n340/501\n"}, {"page": "341", "text": "6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\nGeneral zoning districts are designated throughout the zoning jurisdiction and include numerous uses that are\nallowed by right subject to those uses meeting yard and height regulations. In addition, some zones allow for\nuses subject to prescribed standards. The following general zoning districts are hereby established.\n(A) R-25 Rural Residential District. This district is intended to accommodate very low density residential and\nagricultural uses in fringe areas of the zoning jurisdiction that generally are non-intensely developed. This district\nis established to accommodate very low-density development where public utilities are nonexistent or partially\nexistent, and to accommodate greater densities where services are present, therefore, density levels are\nvariable to the existence of the facilities. The continuance of agricultural operations is encouraged within this\ndistrict.\n(B) R-15 Single-Family Residential District. This district is established to provide areas consisting primarily of\nsingle-family residences located in both urban and suburban settings. Generally, public water and sewer are\navailable or are readily available. Permitted residential uses consist solely of single-family residences and the\nminimum lot size shall be 15,000 square feet. In addition to single-family residences, a limited number of private\nand public community uses are allowed.\n(C) R-10 Residential District. This district is established to provide primarily for single-family residences. The\nminimum lot size for single-family dwellings on a use by right basis is established at 10,000 square feet. These\nareas are served by water and sewer. Certain public and private community facilities are also allowed.\n(D) R-8 Residential District.\n(1) This district is established to accommodate single-family dwellings on 8,000 minimum square foot lots\nand two-family dwellings on 12,000 minimum square foot lots. These districts are located where water and\nsewer are present. The district accommodates both one- and two-family residences.\n(2) A limited number of private and public community uses are allowed or may be allowed where certain\ncriteria specified in this chapter are met.\n(E) RMF Residential Multi-Family District. This district is intended primarily as a residential district for the\nlocation of detached single-family dwellings, two-family dwellings and multi-family dwellings along with their\ncustomary accessory uses so as to establish areas where development patterns are somewhat more dense\nthan surrounding areas. A limited number of private and public community uses are allowed.\n(F) OR Residential Office District. This district allows for one-, two- and multi-family residential uses and\ncertain commercial, office and institutional uses which would create an area convenient for both residential and\nemployment purposes. In certain areas this district is also established to provide a transition between purely\nresidential areas and primarily commercial areas. In order to enhance the district's residential character, the R-O\nDistrict for purposes of this chapter is deemed a residential district. This classification does require screening\nand buffering from all new uses in adjacent commercial and industrial districts. Small offices, certain community\nfacilities and one and two-family residences are permitted by right.\n(G) O-I Office Institutional District. This district is established to allow for a wide variety of offices, certain\ncommercial uses having minor impacts, certain community facilities, professional and medical service and\ncertain institutions. Single-family residences are permitted, but unlike the R-O Zone, the emphasis of this zone is\non nonresidential uses. This zone may also be established in certain areas to provide an orderly transition\nbetween residential areas and more intensive commercial uses.\n(H) N-B Neighborhood Business District.\n(1) This district is designed primarily for local business centers for retailing of merchandise such as\ngroceries, drugs, and household items and for furnishing certain personal, business and professional services.\nUnlike some of the other commercial zones, this district is established to serve local neighborhoods and other\nrelatively small trading areas. The standards established for these business areas are designed to promote\nsound, permanent business development and also to protect abutting or surrounding residential areas from\nundesirable aspects of nearby business developments. These districts are located at accessible places with\nrespect to traffic circulation in order to conveniently serve the trading population and to promote the grouping of\nseveral places of business at locations so designated. Since this district is established to provide for small\nneighborhood oriented businesses, limitations on gross floor areas are established for certain uses. A\nNeighborhood Business District is typically a relatively small area but shall consist of at least two lots in separate\nownership or at least two acres regardless of ownership.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n341/501\n"}, {"page": "342", "text": "6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n(2) Unlike the CB District, off-street parking, landscaping and yard requirements are established for the NB\nDistrict.\n(I) C-B Central Business District. The purpose of this district is to permit concentrated development of a wide\nvariety of retail establishments, personal services and professional and non-professional offices. In light of the\nconcentrated amount of a development normally found in a downtown area, yard regulations are minimal. Given\nthe lack of space for off-street parking, this requirement has also been eliminated.\n(J) CBT Central Business Transitional District. The purpose of this district is to permit concentrated\ndevelopment of a wide variety of retail establishments, personal services and professional and non-professional\noffices. Like the Central Business District, yard regulations are minimal. However, unlike the Central Business\nDistrict, off-street parking standards must be met for all uses permitted in the district. The number of off-street\nparking spaces required for uses in the Central Business Transitional District is less than that for other Business\nand Commercial Districts since land size limitations restrict parking area availability. Land in this district exhibits\nsome of the same characteristics as land within the Central Business District, but is generally not developed in\nthe same concentrations as the Central Business District.\n(K)\nG-B General Business. The purpose of this district is to provide an array of retail, wholesale and service\nuses to serve the entire community and with access to the uses being primarily by automobile. The districts are\nlocated along major arterial and collector streets and adjacent to the Central Business District in order to have a\nminimal effect on residential neighborhoods.\n(L) H-B Highway Business. The purpose of this district is to provide an array of highway-oriented retail,\nwholesale and service uses to serve the entire community and with access to the uses being primarily by\nautomobile. The districts are generally located along major arterial and collector streets in order to have a\nminimal effect on residential neighborhoods.\n(M) P-B Planned Business. The purpose of this district is to promote orderly and aesthetic commercial\ndevelopment along major highways and entranceways in the Lincolnton area.\n(N) GMC General Manufacturing and Commercial. This district is designed primarily for general commercial\nand industrial land uses, including manufacturing, processing and assembling of parts and products; distribution\nof products at wholesale outlets, retail outlets; transportation terminals; various public and utility uses; and a\nbroad variety of specialized commercial and industrial operations.\n(O) GI General Industrial. This district is designed primarily for general and heavy commercial and industrial\nland uses, including outdoor storage.\n(P) ROS Residential Office Single-Family. This district is established to accommodate both single-family\nresidential uses and other light office and institutional uses in older areas of the city that have developed in a\nmanner that includes those uses. It is important that areas zoned ROS exist in harmony with adjacent\nestablished single-family areas. Like the OR District, the ROS District is a residential district. This classification\nrequires screening and buffering from all new uses in adjacent commercial and industrial districts.\n(Prior UDO, \u00a7 6.2) (Ord. passed ) Penalty, see \u00a7 153.999\n\u00a7 153.092 OVERLAY DISTRICTS.\nOverlay districts are established to provide for certain additional requirements and/or uses for properties\nlocated in one or more general zoning districts. Thus, in addition to the requirements of the underlying general\nzoning district, the provisions of the overlay district and/or any subsequent rezonings may be initiated by an\nindividual, Planning Board or City Council. A zoning map change either establishing or changing any overlay\ndistrict shall be subject to the same procedures and requirements as any other zoning map change.\n(A) MHO Manufactured Home Overlay. The purpose of this district is to provide areas in which Class A\nmanufactured homes can be located on individual lots. In order that these homes, when placed on the lot, are\ncompatible with single-family residences, the MH District does provide certain size, construction and aesthetic\nstandards for manufactured homes by allowing only Class A manufactured homes (as defined in \u00a7 153.031). The\nMH Overlay District supplements the range of uses permitted in the underlying district. All other uses and\nregulations for the underlying district shall continue to remain in effect for properties classified in the MH Overlay\nDistrict. The MH Overlay District may only be located in areas that contain a Residential (R) underlying general\nzoning district. The overlay areas may not consist of an individual lot or scattered lots, but shall consist of a\ndefined area within which additional requirements or standards are placed upon manufactured homes.

In determining these areas, the City Council will give\nclose consideration to whether manufactured homes would be compatible with surrounding land uses.\n(B)\nSH Special Highway Overlay District. The purpose of this district is to protect and preserve the natural\nscenic beauty of the landscape of areas which lie near or adjacent to designated Special Highways and that\ndevelopment which takes place on land which lies near the highways be developed in a manner which\nmaximizes the attractiveness of uses and the safety and order of development of the area through the\napplication of additional development standards. Ensuring that development occurs in a manner, it will in turn\ncontribute to and enhance trade, tourism, capital investment, public safety and the general welfare.\n(C) HO Historic Overlay District. This shall be an additional zone established pursuant to G.S. Chapter 160D,\nArticle 9, Part 4 which may overlay other zoning districts on the official zoning map. That portion of any zoning\ndistrict to which the HO District shall apply shall also be delineated on the official zoning map. The HO District is\nintended as an area in which conservation, preservation, restoration and development of historic character and\nsignificance and be fostered and maintained. No Historic District or districts shall be designated until:\n(1) An investigation and report describing the significance of the buildings, structures, features, sites or\nsurroundings included in any proposed district, and a description of the boundaries of the district has been\nprepared; and\n(2) The State Department of Cultural Resources, acting through the State Historic Preservation Officer or\nhis or her designee shall have made an analysis of and recommendations concerning the report and description\nof proposed boundaries. Failure of the Department to submit its written analysis and recommendations to the\nCity Council within 30 calendar days after a written request for the analysis has been received by the\nDepartment of Cultural Resources shall relieve the city of any responsibility for awaiting the analysis, and the\nCity Council may at any time thereafter take any necessary action to adopt or amend the zoning regulations.\n(Prior UDO, \u00a7 6.3) (Ord. passed - ) Penalty, see \u00a7 153.999\n\u00a7 153.093 CONDITIONAL DISTRICTS.\n(A) A conditional district allows particular uses to be established only in accordance with specific standards\nand conditions pertaining to each individual development project. Some land uses are of such a nature or scale\nthat they have significant impacts on both the immediately surrounding area and on the entire community, which\ncannot be predetermined and controlled by general district standards. There are also circumstances in which a\ngeneral district designation allowing such a use by right would not be appropriate for a particular property even\nthough the use itself could, if properly planned, be appropriate for the property consistent with the objectives of\nthese regulations and the adopted Land Use Plan. The review process established in this Part provides for the\naccommodation of such uses by a reclassification of property into a conditional district, subject to specific\nconditions, which ensure compatibility of the use with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties.\n(B) Conditional zoning districts are zoning districts in which the development and use of the property is\nsubject to predetermined ordinance standards and the rules, regulations, and conditions imposed as part of the\nlegislative decision creating the district and applying it to the particular property. The following zoning district\ncategories are conditional zoning districts:\n(1) Parallel conditional zoning districts. A parallel conditional zoning district is a conditional zoning district in\nwhich the potential permitted use or uses are, except as limited by the conditions imposed on the district, of the\nsame character or type as the use or uses permitted in a general district having a parallel designation or name.\nFollowing the approval of a petition for a parallel conditional district, the subject property shall be identified on\nthe Zoning Maps by the appropriate district designation. A parallel conditional district shall be identified by the\nsame designation as the corresponding general district followed by the letters \"CD\" (for example \"G-B(CD)\").\n(2) Conditional zoning districts as identified in \u00a7\u00a7 153.123 through 153.129:\n(a) Planned Residential District;\n(b) Planned Unit Development District;\n(c) Traditional Neighborhood Development;\n(d) Transitional Infill Development District;\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download\n343/501\n"}, {"page": "344", "text": "6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n(e) Manufactured Home Park District; and\n(f) Commercial Center District.\n(3) The conditional zoning districts allow for the establishment of certain uses, which, because of their\nnature or scale, have particular impacts on both the immediate area and the community as a whole. The\ndevelopment of these uses cannot be predetermined or controlled by general district standards. In order to\naccommodate these uses, this chapter establishes specific development standards for these uses intended to\nprotect existing developed areas. The permitted uses and development standards are contained within each\ndistrict. Each of the conditional zoning districts requires submittal of a site plan as part of the application review\nprocess. In addition, each of the conditional zoning districts is subject to approval by City Council in order to be\nestablished.\n(Ord. passed - )\nZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS\n\u00a7 153.105 R-25 RURAL RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.\n(A) Permitted uses.

The\nboundaries of the Historic Overlay District are as shown on the official zoning map.\n(2) The requirements of the (HO) Historic Overlay District shall be additional to other zoning district\nrequirements and when in conflict with other zoning district requirements, shall prevail over other requirements\nof any zoning district or portions thereof which are within the designated (HO) District.\n(C) Permitted uses. The Historic Overlay District contains several zoning classifications. All uses permitted in\nany district, whether by right or as a use subject to prescribed standards, are allowed in the Historic District\naccording to the procedures established for the uses.\n(D) Required conformance to dimensional regulations; exceptions.\n(1) Structures within the Historic Overlay District shall observe the dimensional and other regulations of this\nchapter, except as follows:\n(a) No structure or part thereof shall extend nearer to or be required to be set back further from the front\nlot line than the average distance of the setbacks of the nearest principal buildings within 100 feet on each side\nof the building and fronting on the same side of the street;\n(b) Height (reserved);\n(c) Side yard (reserved); and\n(d) Rear (reserved).\n(2) It is the intent of this section to supersede, within the Historic Overlay District, the dimensional\nregulations of the basic districts applying to the property.\n(E) Authentic restoration or reconstruction.\n(1) Permitted subject to approval of Historic District Commission and Board of Adjustment, although not\ncomplying with dimensional regulations. Where it is found by the Historic District Commission that an application\nfor a building permit covers activity constituting an authentic restoration or reconstruction in the same location as\nthe original location and in the original conformation of the structure of historic and/or architectural significance\nto the Historic District, the activity may be approved by the Board of Adjustment, following approval by the\nHistoric District Commission.\n(2) Approval subject to conditions. The Board of Adjustment, in approaching the authentic reconstruction or\nrestoration, may attach reasonable and appropriate conditions to the approval, so that the public health, safety\nand general welfare shall be protected.\n(3) Approval, limitation on.\n(a) The Board of Adjustment shall not be authorized, in action undertaken by this section, to approve a\nuse of property that is not a use permitted by right or for which a conditional district has been approved by the\nCity Council.\n(b) In addition to any other conditions the Board of Adjustment may make regarding the authorization, any\nitems restored, reconstructed, or maintained on, over, or within a public sidewalk, public alley area, or other\npublic way shall be the responsibility of the owner, his or her heirs and assigns. The owner's restoration,\nreconstruction, or maintenance of any item within the area shall constitute the owner's agreement to protect and\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n389/501\n"}, {"page": "390", "text": "6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\nhold the city blameless against any and all liability, cost, damage, or expense suffered by the city as a result of\nor growing out of the restoration, reconstruction, or maintenance thereof.

All private streets shall\nmeet the following requirements.\n(a) Private streets must have a minimum right-of-way width of 30 feet, exclusive of parking bay areas,\nand have a minimum pavement width of 20 feet, measured from edge of pavement to edge of pavement.\nAdditional widths will be required where parallel parking is to be provided.\n(b) Angled parking areas directly adjoining private streets will be permitted on one side of the street only\nat any point along the street (i.e., double loaded parking is not permitted along private streets.) the combined\nlength of parking areas along private streets may not exceed 50% of the length of the adjoining roadway. The\nparking areas may be alternated from one side of the street to the other. All other angled parking areas must be\nclearly separated from the private street by at least a barrier island.\n(c) The edge of pavement of any private street shall be no closer than 20 feet to any multi-family principal\nbuilding. However, private streets may be within ten feet of accessory buildings.\n(14) Multi-family units. In projects where multi-family units (dwelling units where more than two units are\nattached) are proposed there shall be an area or areas of improved common open space. The area or areas in\ncombination shall be at least 10,000 square feet in area or 500 square feet in area per multi-family dwelling unit,\nwhichever is greater. (As used in this section the term IMPROVED COMMON OPEN SPACE shall mean land\nand/or water areas within the site designated for development, exclusive of lands occupied by streets, street\nrights-of-way or off-street parking, not individually owned or dedicated for public use, which is designed and\nintended for the common use or enjoyment of the residents of the development and to be inclusive of all\nundeveloped, onsite, side yard areas that are adjacent to multi-family residential buildings that are maintained by\nthe property owner, or areas which have been improved with recreational areas and amenities such as but not\nlimited to playgrounds, ballfields, tennis courts, nature trails, gardens, swimming pools, clubhouses and the like.)\n(15) Screening.\n(a) Screening shall be required at the following locations:\n1. Along major thoroughfares (as shown on the city's thoroughfare plan), but the screen shall not hinder\nsight distance where project streets or entrances intersect with thoroughfares;\n2. Along a property line or a street bounding the project where the property line or street separates\nmulti-family housing areas within the project and existing single-family residential areas outside the project; and\n3. Along a property line or a street bounding the project where the property line or street separates the\nproject from any areas zoned or used for nonresidential purposes.\n(b) The screening shall materially screen the project from the view of the adjoining project from the view\nof the adjoining property, and in the case of divisions (D)(15)(a)1. and 3. immediately above, the adjoining\nproperty from the view of the project. The screening shall otherwise be in compliance with \u00a7 153.046 of this\nchapter.\n(c) In cases where screening is required by this chapter and devices such as existing vegetation or\ntopographical features or extreme size of the tract involved would render the installation of screening\nunnecessary, the City Council is hereby empowered to accept the existing features as meeting the general\nscreening requirements. The decision shall be based on the spirit and intent of this section. The vacancy or non-\nuse of adjacent property shall not negate the necessity for installation of screening. If at any time after the\nexisting features are accepted, the features are altered so as to render them inadequate as screening as\ndescribed in this section, to achieve the required screen, the developer shall be required to make the necessary\nimprovements to achieve the required screen. The following additional requirements apply to multi-family\nprojects.\n(16) Additional requirements for multi-family projects. The following additional requirements apply to multi-\nfamily projects.\n(a) No principal residential building side (front, rear, left or right) shall be located closer than ten feet to\nthe edge of pavement of any private street or off-street parking area within the development.\n(b) Off-street parking areas and all internal streets shall provide safe and convenient access for\nfirefighting and refuse collection vehicles and other service and delivery vehicles.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/downloa\n396/501\n"}, {"page": "397", "text": "6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n(c) The arrangement of buildings shall not create long alleyways between the rear of residential buildings\non the site.\n(d) The front entrance to any residential building shall not directly face the rear of any other residential\nbuilding.\n(e) For provisions regarding stacking of dwelling units, see division (C)(1) above.\n(f) No exterior wall of a building shall run unarticulated for a horizontal distance of more than 40 feet.\n(g) No multi-family principal building shall be located closer than 25 feet to any other principal building\nwithin the development.\n(h) All walls of greater than 200 square feet shall have at least six square feet of window area per 200\nsquare feet of total wall area, however, this requirement shall not apply to walls facing alleyways.\n(17) Phases. Each phase of a multi-phased project shall be able to stand as an independent project unless\nthe initial phase constructed is designed in a manner which will support the entire development upon completion\nof the initial phase. As used in this section, the term PHASE shall refer to that portion of the project for which the\napplicant requests a conditional district rezoning. At no point in the development of a multi-phase project shall\nthe density of residential development in a completed phase of the project area exceed the maximum density\nestablished approved for the project.\n(E) Density bonus.\n(1) A density bonus of up to 40% over the basic density normally allowed may be approved by the City\nCouncil when considering the request for the conditional district. The density bonus must be based upon the\namount of unobstructed open space greater than the minimum 50% and the amount of land area to be used for\nimproved common open space.\n(2) Both the unobstructed open space test and the improved common open space test must be met in\naccordance with the schedule below in order for a project to be considered for the respective density bonus. All\nimproved common open space not covered by buildings or structures shall also be deemed unobstructed open\nspace. The bonuses listed on the schedule shall be maximum bonuses and the City Council, at its discretion\nmay grant a smaller bonus.\n(3) Application for the density bonus must accompany the request for the application for a conditional\ndistrict. Bodies of water shall constitute no more than 25% of the unobstructed open space nor more than 50%\nof the improved common open space used for calculating the maximum allowable density bonus.\n(4) The density bonus schedule shall be as follows:\n* Minimum improved open space shall be 20% when units over units are developed in a PRD project.\n(F) Application requirements and review procedures.

Along major thoroughfares (as shown on the city's thoroughfare plan), but the screen shall not hinder\nsight distance where project streets or entrances intersect with thoroughfares;\n2. Within the project, along the boundaries between areas planned for nonresidential uses, and areas\nplanned for residential uses. The screening shall be located on the nonresidential side of the boundary. Private\nrecreation areas associated with residential uses shall not be required to be screened from residential uses;\n3. Along a property line or a street bounding the project where the property line or street separates the\nproject from any areas zoned or used for residential purposes;\n4. The screening shall materially screen the project from the view of the adjoining property, and from\nthe view of residential areas within the project.

Each phase of a multi-phased project shall be able to stand as an independent project. As\nused in this section, the term PHASE shall refer to that portion of the project for which the applicant is seeking\na\nconditional district rezoning.\n(E) Application requirements and review procedures. Planned unit developments are established through the\nconditional district process outlined in \u00a7\u00a7 153.315 and 153.316 and the site plan submission process outlined in\n\u00a7 153.127 of this chapter.\n(Ord. passed - )\n\u00a7 153.125 TND TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENTS.\n(A) A request for rezoning to the TND district may be approved by the City Council subject to \u00a7\u00a7 153.315 and\n153.316 and only after having first been reviewed by the Planning Board. A traditional neighborhood\ndevelopment (TND) is a type of planned unit development (PUD) that contains both residential and\nnonresidential uses. A TND is a conditional district and is a development that substantially meets the guiding\nprinciples of traditional neighborhood development design as set forth in this section. TNDs, by their very nature,\nare built in a more urban, compact configuration. Accordingly, many of the setback, bulk and off-street parking\nrequirements, requirements dealing with accessory dwelling units, and the one principal use per lot requirement\nthat may otherwise be prescribed are hereby either relaxed or waived. Similarly, many of the subdivision\nstandard requirements found in \u00a7 153.395 of this chapter are also waived.\n(B) The Planning Board shall consider the request only after a completed application has been submitted to\nthe Administrator. (Note: Prior to submission of the site plan and application, and prior to any disturbance of any\nland or vegetation it is recommended that the applicant consult with the Administrator or his or her designee in\norder for the applicant to be briefed on the requirements of this chapter and that consideration be given to\nnatural features of the site.)\n(C) Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this section is to set forth guiding principles for traditional\nneighborhood development design and to allow relief to some of the PRD/PUD district standards in \u00a7\u00a7 153.123\nand 153.124 when the developments are found to substantially meet the guiding principles of this section.\n(D) Guiding principles. For organizational purposes, the guiding principles have been divided into six\ncategories; however, most principles relate to multiple categories. A TND must substantially meet each of these\nprinciples. Where the development application does not meet a particular principle, the applicant shall submit\nwritten justification substantiating why that principle cannot be met, unless the principle is described as optional.\nThe guiding principles are as follows.\n(1) Public realm principles.\n(a) The central element of traditional neighborhood design is the emphasis and weight given to the public\nrealm (the streets and plazas, and the public open spaces such as parks, playgrounds, greens and natural\nareas, together with semi-public spaces which frame the public realm and provide transition between public and\nentirely private spaces).\n(b) TNDs feature well-designed public spaces, special emphasis on public and cultural buildings, and\nspecial design treatment for vista terminations.\n(c) A sense of enclosure is maintained along the public street through an appropriate ratio between the\nheight of building fronts and the distance between buildings on opposite sides of the street. Where the street\nfrontage consists of single story buildings or open space, street trees can be a substitute for front building walls\nto maintain this sense of enclosure.\n(d) Nonresidential buildings are set at or very near the sidewalk. In most situations, the same is true for\nattached housing. Single-family homes have relatively shallow setbacks, typically one-fourth to one-third the lot\nwidth. Encroachments are allowed for porches, steps, bay windows and balconies.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/downl\n400/501\n"}, {"page": "401", "text": "6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download\n(e) The public realm shall be appropriately landscaped. Unless good landscape design would otherwise\ndictate, each street shall be provided with an orderly regimen of street trees of substantial nursery stock, which\nwill grow quickly to provide a street canopy. Planting strips wide enough to accommodate street trees typically\nseparate sidewalks from street roadways. See division (D)(2)(f) below.\n(f) Single-family home lots in TNDs are typically smaller and narrower than in conventional subdivisions. A\nsubstantial amount of land area savings from reduced lot sizes is dedicated toward common areas.\n(g)\n1. Narrower lots necessitate alternative treatment of certain fixtures that can diminish the aesthetic\nquality of the public realm. A system of rear access lanes (alleys) can provide garage access at the rear of the\nlot. This is especially preferred for lots less than 50 feet in width. When built to a 16-foot standard with a 24-foot\nright-of-way, the alley can also serve as an appropriate location for electric, gas, cable television and telephone\nequipment as well as access for garbage pickup and mail delivery. On lots at least 50 feet wide, alternate, less\npreferred methods of garage access include (in descending order of preference):\na. A front driveway accessing a garage behind the house or near the back of the lot;\nb.\nTurning the garage so that it does not face the front (provided the garage is flush with or set\nbehind the front building line);\nC.\nSetting the garage at least 20 feet behind the front of the house; or\nd. Providing special architectural treatment to the house to visually de-emphasize a garage at the\nfront.\n2. Where alleys are not available, other measures shall be taken to hide utility equipment; however, fire\nhydrants are always located on the fronting street, ideally situated on planting strip bulb-outs at intersections.\n(h) TNDs are designed so that there are linkages between the private realm and the public realm while\nprotecting private spaces. Single-family detached homes typically have front porches large enough for sitting\n(with a six- to eight-foot minimum depth), and attached dwellings typically have sitting porches or front stoops.\nAlways for single homes served by alleys, and where feasible and designed appropriately for town homes,\nprivate spaces are protected at the rear using privacy devices according to the development guidelines. The\nbottom floor of any dwelling whose sidewalk-facing wall is within five feet of the sidewalk shall be elevated\nsufficiently above the sidewalk to provide additional privacy inside the dwelling.\n(i) TNDs are designed to feature vista terminations at multiple locations. Vistas can terminate to important\nbuildings, parks and greens, civic features in a \"town\" or \"village\" center, a carefully sited dwelling, a curve in the\nroad, natural green edge, distant objects and scenery, and other features as appropriate. Entry into the\ncommunity usually uses an important vista termination to provide a sense of place arrival.\n(j) Utility wiring shall be underground and decorative street lighting fixtures are encouraged, but not\nmandated.\n(2) Transportation system principles.\n(a) TNDs always have a connecting web of streets, typically provided by a grid or modified grid street\npattern. The street system is organized in a comprehensible network hierarchy that forms an orderly discernable\nneighborhood structure.\n(b) Cul-de-sacs shall be avoided unless natural site or site boundary conditions require them. In those\nsituations, special street design features such as street eyebrows and cul-de-sac loops are encouraged instead\nof standard ball-end cul-de-sacs.\n(c) Curved as well as straight streets are allowed; however, each must contribute to the connecting web.\nWhere possible, curved streets maintain the same cardinal orientation. Long blocks shall be avoided with the\naverage block length in a TND being no greater than 600 feet; the average block perimeter shall be 1,800 feet.\n(d) While the sense of enclosure described in division (D)(1)(c) above will help to reduce traffic speeds,\nadditional design measures will be needed to slow traffic. Examples of the measures include the features as\nbulbing out the curb line at intersections, traffic circles or roundabouts, streets no wider than necessary to\nprovide adequate access, design for and encouragement of on-street parking, and safe but unconventional\nstreet geometrics. The internal streets shall be designed to feel safe driving at a speed no more than 25 mph.\nNote: Street requirements of \u00a7 153.395 of this title are waived in TNDs.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n401/501\n"}, {"page": "402", "text": "6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n(e) 1. Back-to-back street widths within a TND are as follows.\n2. Where possible, streets are encouraged to narrow to 22 to 24 feet at intersections and at mid-block\ncross walks. Curve radii at intersections shall be ten to 20 feet, depending on street function. Standard vertical\ncurb is preferred, and it is required on all residential streets without driveways (auto access is provided via a rear\nalley) and all commercial streets. NOTE: One-way streets, although allowed, are strongly discouraged.\n(f) TNDs shall always be designed to be walkable and pedestrian-friendly communities in the fullest\nsense. They shall contain sidewalks on both sides of the street and, in addition, may contain a network of off-\nroad walking and bike trails. Sidewalks are well separated from the roadway with planting strips that are planted\nwith indigenous, mostly deciduous shade trees (on commercial streets sidewalks may extend to the curb with\nstreet trees planted in grates or other sufficiently sized planting space). Planting strips shall be a minimum of six\nfeet in width, but may be reduced to no less than four feet in width in situations that are both unusual and\ndifficult. Sidewalks shall be a minimum of four feet in width on residential streets, with wider widths on\ncommercial streets.\n(g) TNDs always have multiple points of ingress and egress from collector and arterial roads. The street\nsystem shall also flow seamlessly to adjoining neighborhoods, both existing or planned in the future.\n(h) TNDs are never gated communities.\n(i) Off-street parking lots should generally not front along a public street. On-street parking shall be\nprovided throughout the development and particularly so on streets with commercial buildings and/or attached\nhousing. Where additional parking is needed, it is usually provided behind buildings in the interior of the block.\nThe calculation of parking needs for nonresidential uses will always take into consideration available on-street\nparking. Parking lots shall include shade trees and no space in a parking lot shall be further than 60 feet from\nthe trunk of a large tree. Each large tree shall be planted in a planting area sized and shaped to enable healthy\ngrowth. Pedestrian access from interior block parking area is best provided via a mid-block passageway to the\nstreet front. This passageway can also be used for other activities such as front entrances for small shops,\naccess to second floor apartments, outdoor dining, outdoor vendors and outdoor display of plants, flowers and\nother appropriate items for sale.\n(3) Mixed use principles.\n(a) TNDs shall contain a significant mixture of principal uses (both residential and nonresidential).\n(b) TNDs shall also contain a mixture of residential types.\n(c) TNDs should be designed to offer housing at a variety of affordability levels. Allowing garage\napartments and granny flats at the rear of single home lots, in accordance with the development's private\nguidelines (whether rented or not) is encouraged. These innovative (but historically traditional) housing forms\nhelp to accommodate family situations and promote income diversity within the TND.\n(d) Live-work units (shop or office at the street level and residence at the second level) and upper-story\napartments over ground-floor businesses are encouraged.\n(e) In TNDs, denser housing and live-work units are typically located closer to the neighborhood center\nwith a transition outward to less dense housing such as detached single-family homes. This principle should not\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n402/501\nCELL (1, 1): \nWidth\nCELL (1, 2): \nStreet\nCELL (2, 1): \nWidth\nCELL (2, 2): \nStreet\nCELL (3, 1): \n34-38 feet\nCELL (3, 2): \nA main street in a TND with marked parking on both sides\nCELL (4, 1): \n32-34 feet\nCELL (4, 2): \nSecondary streets with marked parking on both sides\nCELL (5, 1): \n27-29 feet\nCELL (5, 2): \nOther through streets with marked parking on one side\nCELL (6, 1): \n24-26 feet\nCELL (6, 2): \nStandard streets with unmarked parking allowed to stagger from side to side\nCELL (7, 1): \n20-24 feet\nCELL (7, 2): \nLow density local streets with unmarked parking on one side\nCELL (8, 1): \n20 feet\nCELL (8, 2): \nOne-way streets with parking on one side\nCELL (9, 1): \n16 feet\nCELL (9, 2): \nPublic residential alleys with commercial alleys typically being 24 feet\n"}, {"page": "403", "text": "6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download\nbe construed to discourage the careful blending of housing types as this transition occurs.\n(f) Schools and churches are encouraged to locate within a TND as is the provision of pedestrian and\nbicycle routes to connect to the facilities inside or outside the TND.\n(g) Where buildings are on both sides of the street, similar building types should face each other to the\ngreatest degree possible. Single-family detached houses, townhouses, live-work units, apartment buildings and\nstore buildings are examples of building types.\n(h) TNDs are expected to provide some on-site and/or adjacent to site employment opportunities. This\ncan include employment in the services and stores within the TND, live-work units (the owner dwelling over his\nor her shop or office), or larger employment centers such as office buildings.\n(4) Architectural principles.\n(a) The architectural style within a TND shall respond to the surrounding fabric of buildings and spaces\nand to local traditions. The principle that structures should be seamlessly linked to their surroundings (within the\nTND) transcends the issue of style.\n(b) Any principal building within a TND shall exhibit principles of human and pedestrian scale and shall\ncontribute appropriately to the pedestrian life of the street. Front yard setbacks and the amount of off-street\nparking located in a front yard shall be minimal.\n(c) Architecture within a TND shall reflect styles that are complimentary of each other. Private\ndevelopment controls shall assure a variety styles or sub-styles that serve to compliment each other while\nproviding for overall consistency and reflection of the principles of traditional neighborhood design.\n(d) Commercial buildings shall typically take on a \"shop front\" type appearance and shall be joined by\ncommon walls. The buildings shall be set with the front and entrance at the sidewalk along the street. The\nbuildings shall typically be two or more stories high. (Typically, uses on upper floors or occupied by residential\nand offices uses. However, the city may allow \"low-impact\" retail uses such as bookstores, restaurants, music\nstores and the like to occupy a second story.) Commercial buildings shall not face intersecting streets with blank\nwalls.\n(e) Building articulation and setback encroachments for porches, stoops, steps, bay windows, bay\nwindows and lawnings, balconies and other features that form the transition between the public and private\nrealms are encouraged.\n(f) Corner-lot homes should face the front door to the larger street (unless the street is a thoroughfare),\nexcept for an end-unit townhouse or row house, which may turn the corner with its front (unless the side street is\nan alley). Fronting a townhouse on both the primary street and the intersecting street with two doors and/or\nwrap-around porch is encouraged.\n(5) Neighborhood center principles.\n(a) TNDs shall have at least one defined neighborhood center. Neighborhood centers typically feature\nuses such as shops and services, live-work units, attached dwellings, apartments over businesses, a formal\nopen space such as a village square or green, or public/civic buildings (church, community building/center and\npost office are examples).\n(b) Automobile oriented uses are typically not found in a neighborhood center and drive-through facilities\nare strongly discouraged (with exceptions made for bank drive-through windows.)\n(c) A public gathering space such as a plaza, green or square is usually present along with one or more\nfocal features in or near this public space such as a clock tower, fountain, monument, bandstand and/or public\nart which serve to terminate vistas and define the community.\n(d) The TND neighborhood center is ideally located near the geographic center of the development;\nhowever, it may also identify itself jointly with a thoroughfare bordering the TND (and therefore, be located near\nthis major road or be linked to this road with an entrance street) in order that businesses within the center may\nmore easily attract patrons from outside the development. This can serve to improve chances for economic\nsuccess of the TND center. Ideally, the neighborhood center is no farther than one-fourth mile radius of most\ndwellings; however, a neighborhood center that is within 2,400 feet of 80% of the dwellings in the TND is\nacceptable in order to allow the center to identify itself jointly with an adjoining thoroughfare.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download\n403/501\n"}, {"page": "404", "text": "6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n(e) Development form in the center typically reflects the traditional Main Street or town square vernacular\nof Lincolnton as described in division (B)(5)(d) above and parking is provided in accordance with division (B) (2)\n(b) above.\n(f) Other civic uses are encouraged, including schools and day care centers; however, the uses shall take\non design features and lot sizes in keeping with traditional principles and a walkable community. Office\nemployment may occur at the TND center or along major roads adjoining the TND.\n(g) At least one site, prominent in its location, should be reserved at or near the neighborhood center, for\nan important community or civic building such as a community center, church, school, amenity center (club\nhouse and recreation facility) or community hall.\n(6) Open space and natural site characteristic principles.\n(a) A TND shall always have one or more public open space areas such as greens, village squares, parks\nand playgrounds. They may also have substantial amounts of natural or semi-natural open spaces that typically\nfeature more informal amenities such as walking/bicycling trails and picnic areas.\n(b) There is always a significant civic space such as a town square, green, commons or plaza in a\nneighborhood center within the TND.\n(c) Small parks or greens shall be distributed throughout the TND, usually within 1,000 feet walking\ndistance of any dwelling within the TND.\n(d) Pre-existing or natural water features should be retained and made a community asset.\n(e) Major tree stands shall be incorporated into public open spaces, wherever feasible.\n(f) The neighborhood design shall adapt itself, as much as possible, to the existing topography to\nminimize the amount of grading necessary to achieve a viable street network.\n(g) Parks, plazas and commons shall be equipped with proper furnishings and shade trees to encourage\noutdoor sitting, human interaction and people watching; while some common areas should be grassed and left\nopen (except for street trees) to encourage the types of leisure/recreational activities that require open areas.\n(E) TND design standards.\n(1) The TND shall have a minimum area of ten acres and shall be served by public water and sewer.\n(2) The TND may contain the following types of residential dwelling units:\n(a) Single-family detached dwelling units;\n(b) Lot-line houses;\n(c) Village houses;\n(d) Patio houses;\n(e) Twin houses;\n(f) Townhouses;\n(g) Atrium houses;\n(h) Multi-family developments; and\n(i) Dwellings located on the second story (or higher) over ground floor commercial uses.\n(3) The TND can contain the following types of nonresidential uses: all permitted uses and uses subject to\nprescribed standards allowed in the N-B Neighborhood Business Zoning District.\n(4) Where TND commercial uses adjoin residential uses outside the TND, or when TND non-single family\nresidential uses adjoin single-family residential uses outside the TND, screening in accordance with \u00a7 153.046\nshall be provided on the adjoining portion of the TND. Otherwise, screening for a TND shall not generally be\nrequired. Notwithstanding, the City Council may require screening in any other situation along the boundary of a\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n404/501\n"}, {"page": "405", "text": "6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\nTND or inside a TND as a condition for approval wherever it deems appropriate for the protection of adjoining\nproperties or to establish necessary transition.\n(5) Where parking is provided by private drives for individual dwelling units, space shall be provided for\nparking at least two cars at each dwelling unit. This requirement may be reduced to one car per dwelling where\non-street parking is designed into the street system.\n(6) Except for rear access alleys, driveways and parking drives/aisles, private streets are not allowed in\nTNDs.\n(7) Off-street parking areas and all internal streets shall provide safe and convenient access for emergency\nservice and refuse collection vehicles and other service and delivery vehicles.\n(8) Any TND containing 50 or more dwelling units shall have at least one point of ingress and egress onto\na\nmajor or minor thoroughfare as depicted on the most up-to-date version of the city's thoroughfare plan.\n(9) The initiation of the nonresidential phase of a TND may follow at any time after the initiation of\nconstruction of at least 25% of the non-multi-family (i.e., detached) residential dwelling units.\n(10) Nonresidential buildings shall observe setbacks of 30 feet minimum along any external project\nboundary that is not a street and a minimum of zero feet where a street right-of-way is the external boundary.\n(11) TNDs shall follow the same procedures for approval through the conditional district rezoning process\nas set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 153.315 and 153.316 except that the following additional requirements will be required in the\nsite plan submission.\n(a) Typical building front elevations representing the various building types proposed within the\ndevelopment shall be submitted for approval.\n(b) Cross-section drawings of typical street areas from building profile to opposing building profile. A\ntypical profile for each building type is needed.\n(c) A copy of draft or model private building and lot design controls proposed for the TND shall be\nsubmitted for approval. This document will be referenced in the approval action. Actual final design controls to\nbe used can be approved in the formal plan submission.\n(F) Application requirements and review procedures.

For purposes of this section, any retail establishment with a gross floor area of 85,000 plus\nsquare feet GFA shall be identified as a large retail establishment. The following standards shall apply to any\nlarge retail establishment. Notwithstanding, if a large retail establishment or a shopping center that contained a\nlarge retail establishment existed at the time of adoption of these regulations, the regulations contained in this\nsection will only apply to an addition to the large retail establishment if the addition constitutes an increase in\ngross floor area by a factor of greater than 50% and, as a result of the expansion, the large retail expansion has\na GFA of 85,000 plus square feet. The addition shall, to the greatest degree feasible and practical, be made to\nmeet the supplemental regulations contained below.\n(G) Development standards for all large retail establishments.\n(1) (a) Principal buildings shall be substantially parallel to the public road upon which they front. For the\npurposes of this standard, the term FRONT relates to the relationship between the building plane and the street\nor streets and not the arrangement or orientation of the structure and its entrances on the site. When more than\none principal building is located on site, the regulation shall apply to the principal building closest to the adjacent\npublic road. When located on a corner lot, the building shall be parallel with the road with the greatest traffic\nvolumes.\n(b) This standard may be waived by the City Council where, due to practicalities, it would be more\nsuitable to face the building(s) to the lesser traveled road.\n(c) 1. Buildings located on outparcels within a shopping center must substantially address (i.e., be\nparallel to) the adjoining non-limited access highway and be readily accessed via sidewalks and/or walkways\nfrom that adjoining road.\n2. All buildings occupying the outparcel lots shall have their architectural fronts facing the roads and\nshall have a usable door providing access to pedestrians. The fronts all buildings located on outparcels shall\nhave a setback no greater than 20 feet as measured from the edge of the adjoining sidewalk.\n3. Any setback areas shall be geared for pedestrian as opposed to automobile use. No off-street\nparking or loading shall be allowed in this area.\n4. Outdoor storage of retail goods (during daylight hours) shall be permitted, as shall outdoor seating\nareas.\nFigure F\nFigure F\nPROPERTY LINE\nPARKING\nPARKING\nPERMITTED\nLARGE RETAIL\nPERMITTED\nESTABLISHMENT\n<40% LARGE RETAIL\nESTABLISHMENT PARKING\nPERMITTED\nOUTPARCEL\nBUILDING\nNO PARKING\nPERMITTED\n20' FROM EDGE OF SIDEWALK\nSIDEWALK\nNON-LIMITED ACCESS ROAD\n(2) A sidewalk and plant strip shall be placed parallel to all public roads which the development fronts upon\nand where pedestrians could be reasonably expected to access the development. (For instance, if the\ndevelopment adjoined a limited access highway where there was no feasible means for pedestrian access, the\nrule could be waived.) The sidewalk and plant strip shall be constructed in accordance with \u00a7 153.395 of this\nchapter.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n421/501\n"}, {"page": "422", "text": "6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/downloa\n(3) Street trees shall be planted along and parallel to the public road. The trees shall be planted within 25\nfeet of the edge of the road right-of-way, between the right-of-way and any buildings on the lot. The number of\ntrees to be planted shall be as prescribed in \u00a7 153.047(B). Large trees may not be planted under any utility lines.\nThe distribution of trees shall generally be proportionate to the street frontage. While an equal interval between\ntrees is not required, it is the intent of this chapter to not have long intervals without trees. Waivers to these\nregulations may be granted where the adherence of these regulations would interfere or have the potential to\ninterfere with any utility lines.\n(4) Large expanses of off-street parking readily visible from an adjoining public road are strongly\ndiscouraged. Rather, off-street parking in the interior of the development (i.e., behind building fa\u00e7ades) or in\nscreened portions of the side yard is recommended. Notwithstanding, upwards of 40% of the amount of off-\nstreet parking provided for the large retail establishment (or the multi-tenant development) may be located in the\nfront yard of the large retail establishment. The remainder of the parking may be placed in the rear of the\ndevelopment or in screened portions of the side yard. The side-yard screening need not be in full compliance\nwith the screening options provided in \u00a7 153.046(C), but rather shall serve as a means of significantly shielding\nthe parking from the view of motorists and pedestrians from adjacent roads. Alternative techniques such as\nchanges in elevation or from the street and sidewalk can be used to augment the landscaping. The location of\nparking may be shifted to a combination of front, side, and rear yard parking in a single parking field when the\nshape and/or configuration of the site, limited access locations, or other site constraints would prevent a typical\nconfiguration of the site such as is illustrated in division (G)(1) above. In order to minimize the impact of the\nparking field, and notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 153.185(K), the standard for parking for these \"large retail\nestablishments\" shall be one space for each 250 square feet of gross floor area. In addition, and notwithstanding\nthe provisions of \u00a7 153.185(F), the minimum dimensions of parking spaces in parking lots for large retail\nestablishments shall not be less than seven and one-half feet in width nor 17 feet in length. No more than 20%\nof the total required parking may be built utilizing the minimum dimensions.\n(5) Off-street parking lots shall be designed to encourage pedestrian mobility. This can be accomplished by:\n(a) Reducing the number of large parking lots and breaking parking into separate smaller areas of\nparking;\n(b) Locating parking facilities as close as possible to entrance areas into the large retail establishment;\nand\n(c) Other suitable alternative methods.\n(6) The following regulations are designed to create visually distinct and aesthetically appealing structures.\nTo\nthe greatest degree feasible and practical, exterior architectural characteristics shall be designed to\ndifferentiate the structures from similar structures containing the same uses) which may be found outside the\ncity. Accordingly, the external appearances of the front of all buildings (and including any building sides that are\noriented to any public street right-of-way as required in division (G)(1 above whether located within the\ndevelopment or not) shall be governed as follows:\n(a) Seventy-five percent plus of the area below the facia of the building shall be comprised of: brick, brick\nveneer, decorative concrete block, pre-cast or field poured tilt concrete panels with texture; stone or stone\nveneer, flush architectural metal panels; stucco or artificial stucco; glass, wood, or wood materials, or similar\ndecorative materials. Notwithstanding, not more than 50% of the exterior building materials shall include smooth-\nfaced concrete block, or smooth faced tilt-up concrete panels.\n(b) Fa\u00e7ades of buildings having a horizontal length of 150 feet or greater shall have an articulated wall\nplane that incorporated plane projections or recesses to create an interesting and attractive architectural design\nwhich is comprised of more than flat walls with minimal features. Any wall offsets designed to meet this\nrequirement shall have a minimum projection or recess depth of two feet and a minimum width of two feet.\n(c) Rooflines should consist of one or more sloped planes. However, flat roofs may be allowed so long as\nthey are concealed from view by a parapet. The parapet shall not be of a constant height for greater than 150\nlinear feet. Rooftop HVAC equipment shall be concealed by a parapet or via an enclosure consisting of materials\noutlined in division (G)(6)(a) above.\n(d) External ground-level mechanical appurtenances and dumpsters shall be similarly screened.\n(e) Those portions of any roof that is visible from a pubic road shall not have a shiny surface appearance\nsimilar to aluminized or galvanized metal. Notwithstanding, anodized, baked or other nonreflective roof material\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download\n422/501\n"}, {"page": "423", "text": "6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\nshall be allowed.\n(f) Off-street loading docks and facilities shall not be visible from any adjoining public road located entirely\noutside the lot(s) containing the large retail structure (i.e., the requirement shall not apply to roads, public or\nprivate, located entirely within the development containing the large retail structure).\n(g) There shall not be any overnight external (i.e., not contained within a fully or partially enclosed\nstructure) storage of retail goods visible from any adjoining public road not located within the development.\n(h) Ground floor fa\u00e7ades that face public streets shall have arcades, clear display windows and entry\nareas along no less than 40% of their horizontal space.\n(i) Fa\u00e7ade colors shall be of low reflectance, subtle or neutral earth tone colors. High intensity colors,\nmetallic colors, black or fluorescent colors are prohibited.\n(7) Large retail establishments shall provide at least one outdoor space or site amenity to beautify the site\nand to enhance the vehicular and pedestrian entryways to the site and any other buildings on the site. A\npreferred option (although other options may be considered and approved) include a public plaza or courtyard\nthat contains furniture items such as seating walls, benches, drinking and/or decorative fountains, clock towers\nand other features that are designed to external aesthetics of the site. The outdoor spaces can be located in the\nfront yard (and, if so, can be designed to be accessed exclusively through the development rather than from the\nadjoining street) or in the interior portion of the development.\n(8) When located on a lot fronting two or more streets, the primary access to the large retail establishment\nshall be from the more \"auto-oriented street\" (i.e., normally considered to be the street with the higher traffic\nvolume). A secondary access point may be provided from the other street. The second access point may be\ndenied when it is deemed that an undue or unsafe amount of traffic will be generated on the secondary street or\nif the traffic will have a negative impact on surrounding residentially developed neighborhoods.\n(9) Due to the nature of large scale development, the complexity of design, the development design and\nreview process, economic cycles and market conditions, and the time necessary to complete the necessary\ntransactions to secure the property and commence construction, it is recognized that it is appropriate and\nnecessary to allow for additional time for such developments to be commenced. Therefore, and notwithstanding\nother provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, developments that include large retail establishments may be granted\na five-year vesting under the provisions of G.S. \u00a7 160D-108 if such request is included and approved as part of\nthe application for such development. In addition, the time limit for the issuance of a building permit shall be the\nsame as the vesting period that is proposed and approved for the development of the site.\n(H) Reuse/compartmentalization. As part of the conditional district rezoning review process, any large retail\nestablishment constructed after the adoption of this chapter shall be designed to include specific elements for\nadaptation to multi tenant re-use. The elements may include but are not limited to the following:\n(1) Compartmentalized constructions include plumbing, electrical service, heating, ventilation, and air\nconditioning to the extent possible per all applicable codes;\n(2) Building design shall also allow for the interior subdivision of the structure into separate tenancies;\n(3) Fa\u00e7ades shall be readily adaptable to multiple entrances;\n(4) Parking lot schemes shall be designed to enable users of any future tenants to readily walk from their\nvehicles to the storefront; and\n(5) Other design elements that facilitate the multi-tenant re-use of the building.\n(Ord. passed - )\n\u00a7 153.130 SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN USES.\n(A) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to complement the zoning district regulations with supplementary\nrequirements for certain uses to insure these uses are compatible with other development permitted within the\ndistricts.\n(B) Applicability. The following supplementary requirements apply to each of the following uses in addition to\nthe general requirements of the zoning district in which the use is located.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download\n423/501\n"}, {"page": "424", "text": "https://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n424/501\nCELL (1, 1): \n6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nCELL (1, 2): \nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\nCELL (2, 1): \n(1) Arcade or amusement center or game room.\nCELL (2, 2): \n(1) Arcade or amusement center or game room.\nCELL (3, 1): \n(a) If the use is not located in a Class C Shopping Center, it will be located no closer than 300 feet from\nany Residential (R) District.\nCELL (3, 2): \n(a) If the use is not located in a Class C Shopping Center, it will be located no closer than 300 feet from\nany Residential (R) District.\nCELL (4, 1): \n(b) The hours of operation will be limited to the hours between 8:00 a.m. and 12:00 a.m.\nCELL (4, 2): \n(b) The hours of operation will be limited to the hours between 8:00 a.m. and 12:00 a.m.\nCELL (5, 1): \n(c) An approved license in accordance with Chapter 111 of the City Code must accompany the application\nfor a zoning permit for an arcade, amusement center or game room.\nCELL (5, 2): \n(c) An approved license in accordance with Chapter 111 of the City Code must accompany the application\nfor a zoning permit for an arcade, amusement center or game room.\nCELL (6, 1): \n(2) Adult establishments.\nCELL (6, 2): \n(2) Adult establishments.\nCELL (7, 1): \n(a) No business shall locate within 1,000 feet of any other adult establishment as measured in a straight\nline from property line to property line, with no considerations as to intervening structures, roads or\nCELL (7, 2): \n(a) No business shall locate within 1,000 feet of any other adult establishment as measured in a straight\nline from property line to property line, with no considerations as to intervening structures, roads or\nlandforms.\nCELL (8, 1): \n(b) No adult establishment shall be located within 1,000 feet of a church, public or private elementary or\nsecondary school, child day care or nursery school, public park or playground or residentially zoned property.\nThe 1,000-foot distance shall be measured on a straight line from property line to property line, with no\nconsideration as to intervening structures, roads or landforms.\nCELL (8, 2): \n(b) No adult establishment shall be located within 1,000 feet of a church, public or private elementary or\nsecondary school, child day care or nursery school, public park or playground or residentially zoned property.\nThe 1,000-foot distance shall be measured on a straight line from property line to property line, with no\nconsideration as to intervening structures, roads or landforms.\nCELL (9, 1): \n(c) There shall not be more than one adult establishment on the same property or in the same building,\nstructure or portion thereof.\nCELL (9, 2): \n(c) There shall not be more than one adult establishment on the same property or in the same building,\nstructure or portion thereof.\nCELL (10, 1): \n(d) No other principal or accessory use may occupy the same building, structure, property or portion\nthereof with any adult establishment.\nCELL (10, 2): \n(d) No other principal or accessory use may occupy the same building, structure, property or portion\nthereof with any adult establishment.\nCELL (11, 1): \n(e) No printed material, slide, video, photograph, written material, live show or other visual presentation\nshall be visible, nor shall any live or recorded voices, music or sounds be heard from outside the walls of the\nestablishment.\nCELL (11, 2): \n(e) No printed material, slide, video, photograph, written material, live show or other visual presentation\nshall be visible, nor shall any live or recorded voices, music or sounds be heard from outside the walls of the\nCELL (12, 1): \n(f) Wall signs as permitted in \u00a7\u00a7 153. 169(A) and 153.172(B)(1)(b) are permitted as a means for\nadvertising adult establishments.

Any nonconformity created by a change in the classification of property or the text of this chapter\nshall be regulated by the provisions of this subchapter. Many nonconformities may continue and in certain\ncircumstances may make limited expansions, but the provisions of this subchapter are designed to limit or curtail\nsubstantial investment in nonconformities and to bring about eventual elimination and/or lessen the impact upon\nsurrounding conforming uses in order to preserve the integrity of this chapter.\n(B) While the intent of this subchapter prefers the eventual elimination of nonconforming uses, the City\nCouncil hereby finds that zoning in the city has generally not been successful in eliminating nonconformities,\nparticularly viable ones, and that the public interest may be better served by allowing limited expansions of\ncertain nonconformities whereby the impact of the nonconformity on surrounding and uses is lessened.\n(Prior UDO, \u00a7 8.1)\n\u00a7 153.136 NONCONFORMING USES OTHER THAN MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS, SIGNS AND JUNK\nYARDS.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n425/501\nCELL (1, 1): \n6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nCELL (1, 2): \nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\nCELL (2, 1): \n(d) The shooting range shall be the primary use and not be an accessory use to a gun store.

Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that\nare common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance. A variance\nmay be granted when necessary and appropriate to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair\nHousing Act for a person with a disability.\n(3) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner.

ZTA-2-2016, passed 6-2-2016; Ord. O-16-17, passed 11-2-2017; Ord. passed )\nEditor's note:\nSupplementary requirements for rezoning petitions to a conditional zoning district are found in \u00a7 153.316.\n\u00a7 153.316 ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS PERTAINING TO CONDITIONAL ZONING AMENDMENTS.\nThe procedures in this section exist to supplement the procedures set forth in \u00a7 153.315 of this chapter, to\nclarify special requirements for conditional rezonings.\n(A) Purpose. The conditional rezoning process allows particular uses to be established, but only in\naccordance with a specific development project. Some land uses are of a nature or scale that they have\nsignificant impacts on both the immediate surrounding area and/or on the entire community that cannot be\npredetermined and controlled by general district standards or the criteria governing planned developments.\nThere are also circumstances in which a general district designation allowing a use by right would not be\nappropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could, if properly planned, be appropriate for the\nproperty and be consistent with the objectives of these regulations, the adopted land use plan, and other plans\nfor the physical development of the city as adopted by the City Council. Property may be placed in a conditional\ndistrict only in response to a petition by all owners of the property to be included. The review process\nestablished herein provides for the accommodation of the uses by a reclassification of property into a conditional\ndistrict approval process is also established to address those situations when a particular use may be\nacceptable but the general zoning districts which would allow that use would not be acceptable.\n(B) Reclassification required prior to development.\n(1) In order for a property owner to secure privileges for developing property under the conditional district\nprocess, the property must first be rezoned by the City Council to a conditional district. Specific conditions may\nbe proposed by the petitioner or the city, but only those conditions approved by the city and consented to by the\npetitioner in writing may be incorporated into the zoning regulations. Conditions and site-specific standards\nimposed in a conditional district shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the development and\nuse of the site to local government ordinances, the land use plan or the impacts reasonably expected to be\ngenerated by the development or use of the site. Any use permitted under this process must also conform to the\ndevelopment regulations for the corresponding general zoning district.\n(2) Thus, if a property were rezoned to an NB(CD), that use must:\n(a) Be a use allowed in the NB District; and\n(b) Meet all dimensional, screening and related requirements of the NB District.\n(3) Rezoning of property to a conditional district is a voluntary procedure on the part of the property owner\nand is intended for firm development proposals. It is not intended or suited for securing early zoning for tentative\nproposals that may not be undertaken for some time. No conditional district shall be established until the\nowner(s) of the property(ies) in question (or his or her authorized agent) proposing the district has submitted an\napplication for the rezoning of the property and the City Council has approved the application in accordance with\nthe procedures stated herein.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n469/501\n"}, {"page": "470", "text": "6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n(C) Plans and other information to accompany petition. Every application for the rezoning of property to a\nconditional district shall be accompanied by a site plan, drawn to scale, and any necessary supporting\ninformation together which conform to all the requirements set forth in division (D) below and when requested,\nthe additional information that may be required pursuant to division (A) above.\n(D) Submittal to the Administrator.\n(1) Submittal to the Administrator of an application for a conditional district rezoning shall be in accordance\nwith the schedule set forth in \u00a7 153.315(D) of this chapter.\n(2) The application for a conditional zoning amendment can only be initiated by the property owner/owners.\n(E) Procedures. The procedures for requesting rezoning to a conditional district shall be as follows:\n(1) Ten copies of a completed written application for a conditional district shall be filed with the\nAdministrator. The application shall be submitted on official forms provided by the Administrator and shall\nbe\naccompanied by the following items:\n(a) A scaled boundary survey showing the total acreage, and present zoning classifications for the\nproperty(ies) for which the conditional district is sought, date and north arrow. On this survey shall be sketched\nthe information required by this section;\n(b) All existing easements, rights-of-way and required setbacks for the lot(s) for which the conditional\ndistrict is sought;\n(c) Proposed use, size, layout and setbacks of all proposed structures and proposed uses of land. For\nresidential uses this shall include the number of units and an outline of the area where all principal and\naccessory structures will be located.

This requirement may be waived by a unanimous vote of the\nPlanning Board membership present at a meeting of the Planning Board occurring less than 15 days prior to the\ndate of submission. In no case shall the meeting at which the Planning Board initially reviews the application\noccur greater than 60 days after the required number of copies of the completed application have been\nsubmitted by the applicant to the Administrator.\n(4) If the conditional district application is for a property located within an HO-Historic Overlay District the\nAdministrator shall, upon his or her receipt of the application, promptly notify the chairperson of the Historic\nDistrict Commission and submit copies of the application to the Historic District Commission in order that the\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download\n470/501\n"}, {"page": "471", "text": "6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\nHistoric District Commission may review and make a recommendation on the application in accordance with \u00a7\n153.122(G) of this chapter.\n(5) The Planning Board shall have a maximum of 45 days from the date at which it initially met to review the\napplication to submit its recommendation to the City Council. If a recommendation is not made during the 45-day\nperiod, the application shall be forwarded to the City Council without a recommendation.\n(6) (a) When dealing with the conditional district process and with the rezoning of properties to\na\nconditional district, it may be necessary to request information in addition to that listed in this division in order to\nevaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding area. Therefore, the Planning Board (and/or City\nCouncil) may request additional information of the applicant, as it deems necessary.\n(b) A request for additional information shall stay any further consideration of the application by the\nPlanning Board or City Council. This information may include (but not be limited to) the following:\n1. Permanent and construction phase plans for the control of sedimentation and erosion control (for\nprojects subject to State Sedimentation Pollution Control Act) and plans for the control of stormwater drainage\nand run-off;\n2. Existing and proposed topography at four-foot contour intervals or less;\n3. The existing and proposed location of all water and sewer lines and fire hydrants intended to serve\nthe proposed development;\n4. Proposed number, type and location of signs; and\n5. A traffic impact study of the proposed development prepared by a qualified transportation or traffic\nengineer or planner. The traffic impact study shall include the following information:\na. Existing traffic conditions within the study area boundary;\nb. The distribution of existing and proposed trips through the street network;\nC. Analyses of the capacities of intersections located within the study area boundary;\nd. Recommendations for improvements designed to mitigate traffic impacts and to enhance\npedestrian access to the development from the public right-of-way;\ne. Other pertinent information, including but not limited to noise, and impacts on air quality and other\nnatural resources; and\nf. Traffic volumes generated by the existing and proposed development on the parcel, including the\nmorning peak, afternoon or evening peak and average daily traffic levels.\n(F) City Council decision.\n(1) Public hearing. Once a recommendation has been received from the Planning Board, or the 45-day\nPlanning Board review period has expired, the City Council shall hold (after notice) a public hearing concerning\nthe application for a conditional district.\n(2) Special conditions and conditional district. Specific conditions may be proposed by the petitioner or the\ncity, but only those conditions mutually approved by the city and the petitioner may be incorporated into the\nzoning regulations. Conditions and site-specific standards imposed in a conditional district shall be limited to\nthose that address the conformance of the development and use of the site to local government ordinances, the\nland use plan, or the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site. Prior\nto approval of a conditional district rezoning, the application shall be subject to all of the proceduresand hearing\nas set forth in divisions (E) and (F) of this section.\n(G) Effect of approval.\n(1) If a petition for a conditional district rezoning is approved under this subchapter, the conditional district\nthat is established and all conditions which may have been attached to the approval are binding on the property\nas an amendment to these regulations and to the zoning map. All subsequent development and use of the\nproperty shall be in accordance with the standards for the approved conditional district and all conditions\nattached to the approval.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download\n471/501\n"}, {"page": "472", "text": "6/26/23, 6:45 AM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/09577bd8-cf08-40bc-8d09-699341e0ee06/download/\n(2) Following the approval of the petition for a parallel conditional district, the subject property shall be\nidentified on the zoning map by the appropriate district designation. A parallel conditional district shall be\nidentified by the same designation as the corresponding general zoning district followed by the letters CD (for\nexample, \"NB(CD)\".\n(3) Following the approval of the petition for a conditional district as identified in \u00a7\u00a7 153.123 through\n153.129, the subject property shall be identified on the zoning map by the appropriate district designation (PRD,\nPUD, TND, TID, MHP, or CC).\n(H) Alterations to approval.\n(1) Except as provided in(l) below, changes to the approved conditional district or to the conditions attached\nto the approval shall be treated the same as amendments to these regulations or to the zoning map and shall be\nprocessed in accordance with the procedures in this subchapter.\n(2) Minor changes in the detail of the approved conditional district that are in accordance with division (J)\nbelow may be made with the approval of the Administrator. If multiple parcels of land are subject to a conditional\ndistrict, the owners of individual parcels may apply for modification of the conditions so long as the modification\nwould not result in other properties failing to meet the terms of the conditions. Any modifications approved shall\nonly be applicable to those properties whose owners petition for the modification.\n(I) Change in conditional district. Once a petition for rezoning to a conditional district has been approved by\nthe City Council, any request to materially change (any change not authorized by division (J)) the conditional\ndistrict may only be made by the property owner or his or her authorized agent only after a public hearing has\nbeen duly advertised and held in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 153.315 and 153.316 of this chapter. Any amendment to\nthe conditional district shall also be subject to the same considerations as set forth in \u00a7 153.315(F) of this\nchapter.\n(J) Binding effect.\n(1) Any conditional district so authorized shall be perpetually binding to the property unless subsequently\nchanged or amended by the City Council.\n(2) However, minor changes in the detail of the approved plan which:\n(a) Will not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property;\n(b) Will not alter the uses permitted or increase the density or intensity of development; and\n(c) Will not decrease the off-street parking ratio or reduce the yards provided at the periphery of the site\nmay be made with the approval of the Administrator.\n(3) The changes shall not be deemed to materially change the conditional district.\n(4) An increase in building size not to exceed 10% of the existing floor area on the site or 1,000 square feet\nof gross floor area on the entire site, whichever is less, and provided the expansion does not violate any of the\nstandards of this chapter, shall be deemed a minor change as described in this chapter.\n(K) Certificate of occupancy. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any building or land use on a\npiece of property which has been rezoned to a conditional district unless the building is constructed or used, or\nthe land is developed or used, in conformity with the conditional district approved by the City Council. In the\nevent that only a segment of a proposed development has been approved, the certificate of occupancy shall be\nissued only for that portion of the development constructed or used as approved.\n(L) One-year limitation on re-application. If a request for a conditional district is denied by the City Council, a\nsimilar application for the same property or any portion thereof shall not be filed until the expiration of a 12-\nmonth period from the date of the most recent denial by the City Council. This waiting period shall not be\napplicable where the application for a conditional district is substantially different from the application that most\npreviously had been denied.\n(M) Change in conditional district. Any request to materially change (a change other than a minor change as\nset forth in division (J)) the conditional district once it has been issued by the City Council shall first be reviewed\nby the Planning Board in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 153.315 and 153.316 of this chapter. The City Council may\nthereafter change or amend any previously approved conditional district, only after having held a public hearing.\nNotice of the public hearing shall be in accordance with \u00a7 153.315 of this chapter.

It is intended that property be reclassified to a\nconditional district only in the event of firm plans to develop the property. Therefore, no sooner than five years\nafter the date of approval of the petition, the Administrator will examine the progress made toward developing\nthe property in accordance with the approved petition and any conditions attached to the approval. If the\nAdministrator determines that progress has not been made in accordance with the approved petition and\nconditions, the Administrator shall forward to the City Council a report, which may recommend that the property\nbe classified to another district.\n(Prior UDO, \u00a7 20.2) (Ord. passed - - ) Penalty, see \u00a7 153.999\nCross-reference:\nLandscaping, see \u00a7 153.047\nScreening, see \u00a7 153.046\nLEGAL STATUS PROVISIONS\n\u00a7 153.330 CONFLICT WITH OTHER LAWS.\n(A) It is not intended that this chapter repeal, abrogate, annul, impair or interfere with any existing easements,\ncovenants, deed restrictions, agreements, rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued pursuant\nto\nlaw.

Upon default, meaning failure on the part of the subdivider to complete the required\nimprovements in a timely manner as spelled out in the performance bond or escrow agreement, then the surety,\nor the financial institution holding the escrow account, shall, if requested by the City Council, pay all or any\nportion of the bond or escrow fund to the city up to the amount needed to complete the improvements based on\nthe estimate by the Director of Public Works and Utilities. Upon payment, the City Council, in its discretion, may\nexpend a portion of the funds, as it deems necessary to complete all or any portion of the required\nimprovements. The city shall return to the bonding firm any finds not spent in completing the improvements.\nShould the amount of funds needed to complete the installation of all required improvements exceed the amount\nin the bond or escrow account, the subdivider shall nonetheless be responsible for providing the funds to cover\nthe costs. The subdivider shall at all times bear the financial burden for the installation of all required\nimprovements.\n(3) Release of guarantee security. The City Council may authorize the City Manager to release a portion of\nany security posted as the improvements are completed and approved by the city.
