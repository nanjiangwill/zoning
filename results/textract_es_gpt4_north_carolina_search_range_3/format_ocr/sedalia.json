At a minimum, the\nregulation shall designate a vesting point earlier than the issuance of a building permit.

The Town of Sedalia may approve a site-\nspecific vesting plan upon such terms and conditions as may reasonably be necessary to protect the\npublic health, safety, and welfare. Such conditional approval shall result in a vested right, although\nfailure to abide by its terms and conditions will result in a forfeiture of vested rights. The Town of\nSedalia shall not require a landowner to waive vested rights as a condition of developmental approval.\nA site-specific vesting plan shall be deemed approved upon the effective date of the local\ngovernment's decision approving the plan or such other date as determined by the governing board\nupon approval. An approved site-specific vesting plan and its conditions may be amended with the\napproval of the owner and the local government as follows: any substantial modification must be\nreviewed and approved in the same manner as the original approval; minor modifications may be\napproved by the Zoning Administrator if such are defined and authorized by local regulation.\n(D)\nSeven years - Multiphase developments: A multiphase development shall be vested for the entire\ndevelopment with the zoning regulations, subdivision regulations, and unified development ordinances in\nplace at the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multiphase development.

Protected Drainageway means drainage is channeled by pervious devices such as sod waterways, berms, channels, or swales\nwhich have been constructed to resist soil erosion by either vegetating, netting, riprapping, or a combination of those, and which\nallows infiltration of water into the soil.\nDispersed Drainage means spread out, as opposed to collecting the runoff in channels, SO as to effect increased sheet flow and\noverland flow.\nImproved Drainageway means channeled by impervious surfaces such as curb and gutter or concrete (gunite, bituminous,etc.)\nchannels.\nEnhanced Drainage means carried by existing natural drainageways which have been enhanced to resist soil erosion, including\nstream bank degradation.\n6. All slopes are before development.\n7. If all or part of an existing lot containing natural or stabilizing vegetation is dedicated to the public for park and open space\npurposes; such land will count in computing the score.\n8. Stabilizing Vegetation means any vegetation that protects the soil against erosion.\nMaximum Runoff Control means approximately one hundred (100%) percent of built-upon area runoff must pass through\npermanent retention or wet detention pond(s).\nModerate Runoff Control means at least seventy-five (75%) percent of built-upon area runoff must pass through permanent\nretention and/or wet detention pond(s).\nRunoff Control in Excess of Erosion Control Ordinance means at least fifty (50%) percent of built-upon area runoff must pass\nthrough permanent retention of permanent wet detention pond(s).\nRunoff Control Equal to Minimum Requirements means velocity control of runoff.\nDetention Pond means a pond which collects stormwater runoff, filters the water, and releases it slowly over a period of hours or\ndays. It does not have a permanent pool and is sometimes referred to as a dry pond.\nWet Detention Pond means a pond that has a permanent pool and also collects stormwater runoff, filters the water and releases it\nslowly over a period of days.\nRetention Pond means a pond that has a permanent pool.\n9.

Streets running east and west from Main Street shall\nbe numbered starting with the 100 block.\nA-2-2 Odd-Even Numbers\nA-2-3 Vacant Properties\nBecause there is no way of determining how many structures will eventually be built on vacant land within a\nblock, any system which attempts to number structures consecutively does not provide the flexibility to\naccommodate change. A street number is assigned for each one hundred (100) feet of lot frontage.\nA-2-4 Corner Lot\nCorner lots are assigned two (2) numbers since the unit could face either street. The owner or developer shall be\nassigned the street address that accommodates the front entrance of the structure, at the time of permit application.\nA-2-5 Street Address Assignment\nA. Primary Address: Each unit of property will be assigned a primary address. Primary addresses will consist of\nup to four (4) numerals and will be determined by the block in which the property is located. The\ndetermination of block length will be by each municipality.
