Some land uses are of such a nature or scale that\nthey have significant impacts on both the immediately surrounding area and on the entire\ncommunity which cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district standards. There are\nalso circumstances in which a general district designation allowing such a use by-right would not be\nappropriate for a particular property , even though the use itself could, if properly planned, be\nappropriate for the property consistent with the objectives of this chapter and the Making Mills River\n2040 Comprehensive Plan.\n(B) Establishment of a Conditional Zoning District shall only be considered upon the request of\nall the owners and/or their representatives of the property to be included. A Conditional Zoning may\nnot be initiated by the Town Council , the Planning Board, the Board of Adjustment, the Town\nManager, the Zoning Administrator or other Town staff.\n(C) As authorized under G.S. 160D-703, the following conditional districts are established which\nrequire the submission of an application and a master plan as a prerequisite to any development\n57 of 154\n1/18/2024, 9:14 AM\n"}, {"page": "58", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/26df5b17-53b9-4c07-9e.\n(1) A Residential Conditional Zoning District (MR-R-CD).\n(2) Commercial Conditional Zoning District (MR-C-CD).\n(3) Industrial Conditional Zoning District (MR-I-CD).\n(4) Mixed Use Conditional Zoning District (MR-M-CD).\n(D) Each district is subject to applicable standards and conditions imposed by the Town Council\nin the ordinance creating the district.

These conditional districts\nare not intended to relieve hardships that should be resolved by means of a variance.\n(E) The conditional zoning district classification allows projects of innovative design and layout\nthat would not otherwise be permitted under this chapter because of the strict application of\nconventional zoning district standards or other general development standards. Conditional zoning\nencourages innovative land planning and design concepts by:\n(1) Reducing or eliminating the inflexibility that sometimes results from strict application of\nzoning and development standards that were designed primarily for individual lots ;\n(2) Allowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access, light, open space, and\ndesign amenities;\n(3) Allowing greater freedom in providing a mix of land uses in the same development\nincluding a mix of housing types and non-residential uses in a conditional zoning district;\n(4) Promoting quality urban design and environmentally sensitive development by allowing\ndevelopment to take advantage of special site characteristics, locations, and land uses.\n(F) In return for greater flexibility in site design requirements, conditional zoning districts are\nexpected to deliver exceptional quality community designs that preserve critical environmental\nresources, provide high quality open space amenities, incorporate creative design in the layout of\nbuildings open space and circulation; assure compatibility with surrounding land uses and\nneighborhood character; and provide greater efficiency in the layout and provision of roads, utilities,\nand other infrastructure.\n(1) (a) In order to apply for a rezoning to a conditional zoning district, proposed development\nprojects and subject property must meet both of the following minimum requirements:\n(b) Subject property must have Making Mills River Comprehensive Plan, Future Land Use\nMap designation of Community Center, Industrial and Employment, or Community Crossroads\ndistricts.

Prior to\nconducting the TIA, the developer and/or engineer that will be conducting the TIA must meet with\ntown staff and the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) to identify certain\nassumptions and scope that shall be addressed in the TIA, including but not limited to establishing\nthe study area, the trip distribution, the traffic counts to be utilized, approved developments in the\narea, additional hours of analysis (other than A.M. or P.M. peak). and resolve any other questions\nspecific to the site.\n(2) An executive summary shall be provided in the TIA outlining the following: a) detailed\ndescription of the proposed development ; b) number of access points proposed and studied; c)\nexisting and future Level of Service (LOS) for studied intersections and road segments including\nthe LOS at the time of build-out; d) existing traffic counts for road (s) and intersection(s) studied\nand dates/times counts were conducted; e) A.M. and P.M. peak hour vehicle trips for pre-\ndevelopment and post-development conditions; f) average daily vehicle trips for pre-development\nand post-development conditions; g) existing traffic accident counts; h) any recommended\nimprovements.\n(3) The TIA shall address the following: a) proposed land use; b) site access and site\ndistances at all proposed access points; c) impacts on the transportation system from the proposed\ndevelopment ; d) physical improvements or enforceable management strategies to mitigate\nnegative impacts.\n(4) The TIA shall take into consideration proposed and planned NCDOT roadway\nimprovement projects and town roadway and pedestrian/bicycle transportation projects.\n(5) The TIA shall identify the improvements necessary to maintain level of service (LOS) D for\nroads and intersections as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual.\n(6) The TIA shall conduct a pedestrian and bicycle analysis. Continuity and adequacy of\npedestrian and bicycle facilities shall be provided to the nearest attraction (existing or planned)\nwithin 1/4 mile of the boundary of the development site. Destinations of significance include public\ntransportation stops, schools, parks, activity centers, major bicycle facilities and corridors, and high-\ndensity population centers.\n(7) When calculating vehicle counts for commercial and industrial developments where the\nprojected traffic primarily consists of trucks, tractor trailers, and other large commercial vehicles,\nthe following formula shall be used to equate truck trips to regular passenger vehicle trips. A\npassenger car equivalent (PCE) shall be provided in addition to truck traffic counts.

The PCE shall be used to\ndetermine if a TIA is required for developments primarily expected to generate truck traffic.\n(8) The town may require special/specific analysis in the TIA relative to the proposed\ndevelopment\n(D) Improvements required. In those cases where the town or the North Carolina Department of\nTransportation (NCDOT) requires improvements to be constructed in order to accommodate\nadditional traffic generated by the proposed development the improvements shall be funded\nand/or constructed by the developer in accordance with the standards and direction provided by the\ntown or the NCDOT. The improvements shall be complete and in place prior to issuance of any\ncertificate of occupancy or certificate of completion/compliance required for any phase or portion of\nthe project. The town may require additional mitigation, onsite improvements, and/or offsite\nimprovements provided the improvements are acceptable by NCDOT. However, a TIA shall not be\nutilized as a means for the town to require the developer to make needed transportation\nimprovements remote from and not affected by the property for which the TIA is submitted.\n(1) Left turn lane, right turn lane, acceleration/deceleration lanes, and/or right turn taper.\nImprovements may be required based on requirements of the NCDOT Policy on Street and\nDriveway Access to North Carolina Highways or other NCDOT standards.\n(2) Additional right-of-way. If a proposed development falls along a road projected to be\nwidened or improved by NCDOT or an adopted town plan, additional right-of-way along the\ndevelopment's road frontage shall be dedicated as deemed acceptable by NCDOT.\n(3) Offsite improvements. If a road segment or intersection is currently performing at LOS D or\nbetter and is projected to perform at LOS E or F at the time of build-out of the proposed\ndevelopment improvements must be made to maintain the road segment or intersection at LOS D.\nIf a road segment or intersection is currently performing at LOS E or F and is projected to continue\nto perform at the same LOS (E or F) at the time of build-out of the proposed development the TIA\nshall demonstrate how an LOS D could be achieved and also specify what improvements must be\nmade to ensure that the road segment or intersection LOS is not degraded any further than the\ncurrent levels. The town may require improvements be made to preserve the existing LOS.\n(4) Other necessary improvements. Additional improvements may be required based on the\nTIA recommendations related to topographic/environmental conditions, sight distance, street\noffsets, conflicting movements, existing traffic accident counts, circulation, and other potential traffic\nissues resulting from the proposed development Additionally, the town may require additional\nimprovements deemed necessary to ensure the safety and welfare of the town's citizens and\ntransportation network users.\n(Ord. 2018-02, passed 2-8-2018; Am.
