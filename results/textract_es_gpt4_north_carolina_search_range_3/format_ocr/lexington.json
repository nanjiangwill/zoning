The same development review and approval process required for issuance of the development\napproval will be followed in the review and approval of any major modification of that approval. Minor\nmodifications to development approvals, proposed site plans, or proposed plats can be administratively\napproved by the Administrator as follows:\n1) Types of Minor Modifications.\n"}, {"page": "12", "text": "a)\nMinor site design modifications include slight alterations to the design of previously approved\ndevelopment approvals where the development still meets the underlying zoning requirements, but\nthere is a need for flexibility in the design of the site plan or preliminary subdivision plat.\nb)\nMinor dimensional standard modifications include slight changes to the underlying zoning\nstandards. An alteration to a basic ordinance standard is substantially similar to a variance.\n2) Limits of Minor Modification. Minor modifications may include lot configuration, parking design,\nnumber of parking spaces, building location, building mass, landscaping, lighting, fenestration,\nbuilding materials, and similar sight design elements. Minor modifications shall be for no more than a\n10% change to any element or requirement. Any change in use, increase in density, changes that would\nincrease the traffic from the project beyond the levels projected in a Transportation Impact Analysis\n(TIA) or increase the stormwater impacts beyond what was identified in the stormwater analysis\nconducted as part of the original approval, shall be considered Major Modifications.\n3) Application for Minor Modification. The applicant shall provide evidence in writing of why relief is\nneeded. Minor modifications may be allowed to provide relief from a unique physical attribute of the\nproperty not known at the time of initial approval. In the case of minor modification to a conditional\nzoning that involves more than one property, only the owner(s) of the subject parcel(s) may apply for\nthe modifications and said modifications shall not result in other properties failing to meet the terms\nof\nthe conditional zoning. Such a change applies only to the properties whose owners require the change.\n4) Administrative decision-making process.

Any other person with standing to appeal shall\nhave 30 days from receipt from any source of actual or constructive notice of the determination\nwithin which to file an appeal. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, notice given pursuant to\nG.S. 160D-403(b) by first-class mail shall be deemed received on the third business day following\ndeposit of the notice for mailing with the United States Postal Service.\nd) Record of Decision. The Administrator shall transmit to the Board all documents and exhibits\nconstituting the record upon which the decision appealed from is taken. The Administrator shall\nalso provide a copy of the record to the appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject\nof the appeal if the appellant is not the owner.\nADMINISTRATIVE DETERMINATIONS AND APPEALS TO\nADMINISTRATIVE DETERMINATIONS\nWhen there is a question about whether or not a use or development is permitted and/or compliant with\napplicable regulations, an applicant with standing may request a determination in the matter.\n1) The Administrator is charged with making determinations.\n2) The Administrator shall give written notice to the owner of the property that is the subject of the\ndetermination and to the party who sought the determination, if different from the owner. The written\nnotice shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first-class mail. The notice shall\n"}, {"page": "13", "text": "be delivered to the last address listed for the owner of the affected property on the county tax abstract\nand to the address provided in the application or request for a determination if the party seeking the\ndetermination is different from the owner.\n3)\nIt shall be conclusively presumed that all persons with standing to appeal have constructive notice of\nthe determination from the date a sign providing notice that a determination has been made is\nprominently posted on the property that is the subject of the determination, provided the sign remains\non the property for at least 10 days. The sign shall contain the words \"Zoning Decision\" or \"Subdivision\nDecision\" or similar language for other determinations in letters at least 6 inches high and shall identify\nthe means to contact a local government staff member for information about the determination. Posting\nof signs is not the only form of constructive notice. Any such posting shall be the responsibility of the\nlandowner, applicant, or person who sought the determination. Verification of the posting shall be\nprovided to the staff member responsible for the determination. Posting of signs shall not be required.\n4) If the Administrator determines that the subject of the determination is not compliant with the ordinance\nor other applicable regulations, the determination may result in a notice of violation, stop work order,\nor order to correct, or other enforcement remedy.\n5) Appeals to Determinations:\na) Appeal. Appeals of determinations shall be made to the Board of Adjustment.\nb) Standing. Any person who has standing may appeal the determination. An appeal is taken by filing\na notice of appeal with the Administrator. The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for the appeal.\nc) Time to Appeal.

The Administrator shall\nalso provide a copy of the record to the appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject\nof the appeal if the appellant is not the owner.\ne) Stays. An appeal of a determination and/or resulting notice of violation or other enforcement order\nstays enforcement of the action appealed from and accrual of any fines assessed unless the\nAdministrator certifies to the board after notice of appeal has been filed that, because of the facts\nstated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property or, because the violation\nis transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the development\nregulation. In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order,\nwhich may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file\nwith the official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the board shall meet to hear\nthe appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of\ndeterminations affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the development\nregulation shall not stay the further review of an application for development approvals to use such\nproperty; in these situations, the appellant or local government may request and the board may\ngrant a stay of a final decision of development approval applications, including building permits\naffected by the issue being appealed.\nLEGISLATIVE DECISIONS\nAmendments to Regulations, Rezonings, Moratoria\n"}, {"page": "14", "text": "AMENDMENTS\nAmendments are Legislative.

The requirement for a plan consistency statement may also be met by\na clear indication in the minutes of City Council that at the time of action on the amendment city Council\nwas aware of and considered the planning board's recommendations and any relevant portions of an\nadopted comprehensive plan. If a zoning map amendment is adopted and the action was deemed\ninconsistent with the adopted plan, the zoning amendment shall have the effect of also amending any\nfuture land-use map in the approved plan, and no additional request or application for a plan amendment\nshall be required. A plan amendment and a zoning amendment may be considered concurrently.

No moratorium may be subsequently renewed or extended for any\nadditional period unless the City has taken all reasonable and feasible steps proposed to be taken in its\nordinance establishing the moratorium to address the problems or conditions leading to imposition of\nthe moratorium and unless new facts and conditions warrant an extension. Any ordinance renewing or\nextending a development moratorium must include, at the time of adoption, the findings set forth in\nsubdivisions (1) through (4) of subsection (d) of this section, including what new facts or conditions\nwarrant the extension.\n6) Expedited Judicial Review. Any person aggrieved by the imposition of a moratorium on development\napprovals required by law may apply to the General Court of Justice for an order enjoining the\nenforcement of the moratorium. Actions brought pursuant to this section shall be scheduled for\nexpedited hearing, and subsequent proceedings in those actions shall be accorded priority by the trial\nand appellate courts.

Some uses are better located outside of urban areas due to the intrinsic negative impacts on\n"}, {"page": "19", "text": "nearby uses, requiring extremely large setbacks, buffers, barriers, resulting in low density development,\nwhich is contrary to the urban form of a city. In addition to other uses not expressly permitted within this\nordinance, the following uses are expressly prohibited, regardless of the zoning district, within the\nCity of Lexington:\n(1) Animal-based Agricultural Industry\n(2) Automobile Crushing\n(3) Hazardous or Infectious Material Treatment or Storage Facility\n(4) Kennel, Commercial\n(5) Junkyard\n(6) Landfill\n(7) Lumber Mill and Lumber Storage Yard\n(8) Non-governmental Off-site Land Clearing and Inert Debris Landfill\n(9) Petroleum Storage Facility\n(10) Power Generation Plant\n(11) Quarry\n(12) Raceway and Drag Strip\n(13) Salvage Yard\n(14) Sanitary Landfill\n(15) Slaughter House or Meat Packing Plant\n(16) Solid Waste Incineration\n(17) Storage of salvage or used vehicles, equipment, manufactured homes\nConditional Zoning Districts\nThe process for conditional zoning is outlined in Section 2. Conditional zoning allows for an approved\ndevelopment plan to become the zoning regulations for the subject property. It allows variation from\nregulations found in other zoning districts in exchange for the expectation of higher quality development under\na site-specific comprehensive plan. The intent is to create better form and design through flexibility, not to\navoid meeting minimum standards of general use districts. Conditional Zoning is intended only for firm\ndevelopment proposals and should not be used for tentative projects without definitive plans.\nConditional Zoning Districts will be designated by case number on the official Zoning Map. The period of\nvalidity for a conditional zoning development plan is two years. After such time, staff, the Board, or any\nother person with standing may initiate a rezoning of the property.\nDevelopers applying for conditional zoning for property shall include a development plan with the\napplication. The development plan shall include:\n1) A narrative statement of intent describing the uses, form, and character of the planned development\n2) Specific or conceptual site plan\n3) Infrastructure plan if applicable\n4) Street cross-section diagrams if applicable\n5) Common themed elements, such as lighting and/or street furniture\n6) Architecture (scale, form, style, materials, etc. of any structures or elements)\n7) Amenities\n8) Location of uses\n9) Density calculations\n10) Phasing schedule\n11) Conversions- (Possible land use substitutions in the future.)\n12) Edge treatments and use/form/greenspace transitions to blend or relate to surrounding development.\n13) Transportation impacts if required\n14) Copy of proposed Property Owner's Association agreements\n"}, {"page": "20", "text": "15) Parking / travel / connectivity\nPLANNED DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES FOR CONDITIONAL ZONING\nPlanned Developments can vary to include mixed-use, housing, shopping, entertainment, civic, recreation,\nconservation, industrial, institutional, office, common interest, business, recreational, theme, or any\ncombination. Some planned developments are identified within the tables of \"permitted development and\napproval type required\" within each zoning district as only being permitted by conditional zoning due to\nthe potential impact to surrounding residential neighborhoods. This is not to say that other conditional\nzonings will not be considered, but to set out a method and guidance on expectations for certain identified\ndevelopments. Descriptions below are designed to provide guidance to developers to gain support for\napproval in close proximity to residential neighborhoods.\nConditional Zoning Planned Development - Suburban Neighborhood\nDefined: Any development of 10 or more residential units which is located either in close proximity to\nand/or currently zoned Suburban Neighborhood District, and which may or may not include construction\nof a public or private street.\nGuidelines: Development proposal should be limited to one-family homes and/or townhomes, and\namenities. The setting is natural in form with larger lots, larger setbacks, common areas, and greenspace.\nSubstantial landscaping throughout is strongly encouraged. Lots may front on public streets, or on\ncourtyards or greens where pedestrian access and rear alleys are provided for drive and service access.\nResidential structures are strongly encouraged to have usable front porches with visual prominence, with\ngarages having a subdued or secondary visibility. Architectural materials are encouraged to be of high\nquality, with brick, natural stone, and/or fiber cement siding providing the primary exterior finishes.\nWindows should be incorporated into the structure in such a way that any side of the house visible from the\nstreet contains a number of windows, avoiding large solid walls with a minimal number of openings.\nDriveways and garages should be substantial enough to easily accommodate three to four cars on site. Street\ncross sections should include sidewalks, planter strips, and pavement of at least 27 feet in width. A traffic\nimpact study is expected for any development that creates more than 30 units. A traffic impact analysis will\nbe expected for any development that creates more than 100 units. Any development that proposes more\nthan 30 units should provide more than one connection to two or more collector streets or to a thoroughfare,\nconfigured SO that vehicles are not all required to utilize the same exit from the development or any existing\nneighborhood. Applicants will be expected to initiate contact and/or hold information meetings with nearby\nproperty owners and residents in order to share plans and hear concerns.\nConditional Zoning Planned Development - Traditional Neighborhood\nDefined: Any development of 30 or more residential units which is located either in close proximity to\nand/or currently zoned Traditional Neighborhood District, and which may or may not include construction\nof a public or private street.\nGuidelines: Development proposal may include any combination of one-family homes, two-family homes,\ntownhomes, and/or multifamily homes. Amenities should be provided in the form or gathering space,\ngreens, play areas, recreational facilities, walking trails, or other similar common areas. Substantial\nlandscaping throughout is strongly encouraged. The setting is higher density form with an emphasis on\nlandscaping, walkability, and connectivity. Lots may front on public streets, or on courtyards or greens with\npedestrian access and where rear alleys are provided for drive and service access. One-family, two-family,\nand townhomes are strongly encouraged to have usable front porches with visual prominence, with garages\nhaving a subdued or secondary visibility. Multifamily buildings are strongly encouraged to have upper story\nbalconies and first floor porches or stoops. Architectural materials are strongly encouraged to be high\nquality, with brick, natural stone, and/or fiber cement siding providing the primary exterior finishes. High\nquality vinyl siding may be utilized, but should be limited. The front of a dwelling should never face the\n"}, {"page": "21", "text": "rear of another dwelling. Windows should be incorporated into the structure in such a way that any side of\nthe house visible from the street contains a number of windows, avoiding large solid walls with a minimal\nnumber of openings. Driveways and garages should be substantial enough to easily accommodate two cars\non site. Street cross sections should include sidewalks, planter strips, and pavement of at least 27 feet in\nwidth. Parking areas for multifamily buildings should be situated SO as to provide easy access without\ndiminishing front porch interactions. Rear parking for multifamily building with rear or cut-through access\nis strongly encouraged. Fronting on community greenspace is preferred. A traffic impact study is expected\nfor any development that creates more than 30 units. A traffic impact analysis will be expected for any\ndevelopment that creates more than 100 units. Any development that proposes more than 30 units should\nprovide more than one connection to two or more collector streets or to a thoroughfare, configured SO that\nvehicles are not all required to utilize the same exit from the development or any existing neighborhood.\nApplicants will be expected to initiate contact and/or hold information meetings with nearby property\nowners and residents in order to share plans and hear concerns.\nSUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD DISTRICT\nINTENT.

The expression of the buildings shall respect the historic\nsignificance, but appropriate contemporary elements may be utilized to reflect the new uses.\n3) Except for structurally unsound buildings, existing buildings should generally remain and be\nrepurposed to the extent commercially reasonable and monetarily feasible. No building or structure\nmay be demolished without express written approval by the City. With approved demolitions, materials,\nremnants, and portions are encouraged to be repurposed and creatively incorporated into the Project.\n4)\nNew buildings, if any, and changes to existing buildings shall demonstrate quality architecture and\ncompatibility with surrounding buildings in terms of material, style, massing, and form relative to the\nsurrounding area and public realm. Adding monolithic or box-like facades shall be avoided. Quality\narchitecture includes architectural accents and features conducive to pedestrian scale and usage; vertical\nand horizontal articulation; rooflines that highlight entrances; transparent storefront windows (if\napplicable for future development) and activated uses on the ground floor.\n5)\nProperly scaled fenestration, signage and lighting shall be designed to create visual interest and depth.\nReopening former windows and doors, and repurposing former dock doors and larger openings in order\nto reengage interaction with the streetside is encouraged. Additional fenestration will be encouraged\nwhere appropriate.\n6) The building use, program, and architecture shall be planned in concert to activate the pedestrian\nenvironment of the street frontage. Facades shall create an active and engaging public realm, while uses\nwith no public interaction such as storage will be placed at secondary locations.\n7) Along the streets, existing building sides will be transformed into facades to create streetwalls with\nrelatively continuous facades, or public open space built to the front lot line to provide a sense of\ndefinition or enclosure and improve pedestrian comfort. As an urban space, the perimeter of the project\nshould promote active uses that provide pedestrian traffic for the space such as an outdoor deck,\norchard, herb gardens and other greenspace. Upper story right-of-way encroachments for balconies,\nwalkovers, canopies, art, etc. may be utilized upon approval by the City.\n8) Redevelopment projects will incorporate, to the degree practical, taking the \"indoors\" outdoors by use\nof decks, courtyards, outdoor seating, etc. Outdoor spaces may be integrated into the building by\nopening interior spaces with bay doors and/or incorporating outdoor decks and shade areas.\n9)\nAny new development, streetscape, and building improvements shall promote higher intensity,\npedestrian-oriented use and lessen the need for movement within the Depot District by automobile,\nwhile also providing convenient parking to the Subject Property.\n10) Parking lots shall not dominate the frontage of pedestrian-oriented streets, interrupt pedestrian routes,\nor negatively impact surrounding developments. Parking lots shall occupy secondary space and be\nlocated behind or in the interior of a block whenever possible. Parking lots shall be screened in\naccordance with design regulations contained in Section 4.\nAIRPORT DISTRICT\n(Formerly referenced as Planned Development District containing the Davidson County Airport.)\nThe Airport District contains the boundaries of the Davidson County Airport campus including the primary\nairport office, hangers, as well as complimentary public and/or private aviation-related services or\nbusinesses.

elements contributes to the form and character of historic buildings. Shape,\nfeatures, materials, orientation, relief, details, and finishes, work in concert to define style. Features such\nas projecting bays, chimneys, towers, and pediments add variety to the shapes of exterior walls.\nArchitectural details including quoins, cornerboards, cornices, brackets, entablatures, and skirtboards\nenhance the connections between exterior walls to other building elements. Light cast against varying\ndegrees of relief adds depth to the structure. Variations in exterior wall materials contribute to the pattern,\ntexture, scale, color, and finish of a structure.

Use of brick increased after World\nWar II with the increasing popularity of Colonial Revival and Ranch style houses. Masonry, including\nbrick, stucco, and stone, is used throughout the district and contributes to its character. Stucco is a textured\nexterior finish composed of Portland cement, lime and sand mixed with water. In addition to other local,\nstate, or federal regulations, codes, or requirements, the following standards will be used in considering\nCertificates of Appropriateness.\nMaintain and Repair using appropriate methods\n1) Inspect surfaces and features regularly for signs of moisture damage, vegetation, structural cracks or\nsettlement, deteriorated mortar, and loose or missing masonry units.\n2) Provide adequate drainage to prevent water from standing on flat, horizontal surfaces, or from\ncollecting on decorative elements or along foundations and piers, as this can cause water to soak\nupwards (\"rising damp\").\n3) Caulk joints between bricks and window frames in order to prevent water penetration.\n4) Clean masonry only when necessary to remove heavy soiling or prevent deterioration, and use the\ngentlest means possible.

The use\nof abrasive methods such as sandblasting, water blasting, and power washing is destructive to historic\nmasonry surfaces and not permitted.\n5) Open or deteriorated mortar joints will allow moisture to penetrate and damage masonry walls. This\ncan be prevented by proper maintenance, which may require repointing the joints with new mortar.\nRepoint masonry mortar joints if the mortar is cracked, crumbling, or missing, or if damp walls or\ndamaged plaster indicate moisture penetration. Before repointing, carefully remove deteriorated mortar\nusing hand tools, rather than with electric saws and hammers. Replace the mortar with new mortar that\nduplicates the original in strength, color, texture, and composition. Match the original mortar joints in\nwidth and profile.

Cast Iron, wrought iron, lead, brass, copper, tin and bronze\nare some of the traditional metals found. The shapes, textures, and detailing of these metals reflect the\nnature of their manufacture, whether wrought, cast, pressed, rolled or extruded. Corrosion or oxidation of\nmetal surfaces is a chemical reaction usually resulting from exposure to air and the moisture it contains, but\ncorrosion can also result from galvanic action between two dissimilar metals.

Painted, stained, or baked-enamel finishes in a color that is compatible\nwith the color of the existing door are required. Avoid aluminum coated storm doors or windows.\n3) Do not use prefabricated snap-in muntins to create a false divided-light appearance.\n4) Do not replace transparent glazing with tinted or opaque glazing.\n5) If historically appropriate install fabric awnings over porch, door or window openings SO that\narchitectural features are not concealed. Aluminum or plastic awnings are not appropriate.\n6) If exterior storm windows are desired, select ones that are coated with a finish appropriate to the color\nof the building. Install them SO that the existing door or frame is not obscured or damaged. Operable\nstorm window dividers should align with the existing window's meeting rail.\n7) Do not introduce shutters on a historic building if no evidence of earlier shutters exists.\nROOFS\nAlthough roofs are often seen as merely functional features on a structure, the variety of shapes and\nmaterials make a significant contribution to the overall historic character of the district. Often roofs\nincorporate details unique to Lexington's older structures. The design and shape of a roof are essential to\nthe form and character of a building. Roofing materials vary from metal, slate and clay tile to the most\ncommon material seen in the district, asphalt shingles. Shingles come in a variety of colors, but dark colors\nare the most appropriate because they resemble historic materials like metal or slate that were also generally\ndark in color. In addition to other local, state, or federal regulations, codes, or requirements, the following\nstandards will be used in considering Certificates of Appropriateness.\nMaintain and repair using permitted methods\n1) Ensure the roof is weather tight by repairing leaks and deteriorated metal flashing.\n2) Routinely clean gutters and downspouts. Concealed or built-in gutters require routine monitoring and\nmaintenance to avoid damage from unseen leaks. Such gutters must be cleaned out more often and kept\nin good repair to make sure they remain functional.\n3) Roofs should be properly ventilated to prevent moisture retention and condensation as well as insect\ninfestation.\n"}, {"page": "55", "text": "4) Roofing material should be adequately anchored to protect against wind and weather damage.\n5) Refasten loose or replace damaged shingles, slates, or tiles.\n6) Older metal roofs, other than those made of copper, require a protective coat of paint or sealant to avoid\ncorrosion due to moisture.\n7) Introducing incompatible metal fasteners or flashing on a metal roof can result in galvanic corrosion,\nand patching metal roofs with roofing tar accelerates deterioration of the metal.\nRetain and Preserve Historic Features\n1) Retain and preserve roofs and roof forms that contribute to the overall historic character of a building,\nincluding functional and decorative features such as roofing materials, cresting, dormers, chimneys,\ncupolas, and cornices.\n2) Do not remove a roof feature that is important in defining the overall historic character of a building,\nrather than repairing or replacing it.\n3) Retain distinctive built-in gutters that are concealed from view within a boxed cornice.\n4) Painting roofing materials that historically were not painted is not permitted.\nReplace if necessary using like materials and design\n1)\nIf replacing a partially deteriorated roof, replace only the deteriorated portion in kind to match the\noriginal feature in design, dimension, detail, color, and material.

Any substitute materials used should match\nthe dimensions, profile, finish and style of the original as closely as possible. Any proposed new\nmaterials will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Planning Board and/or its appointed review\ncommittee(s).\n2) If a roof must be replaced, metal is considered an acceptable material, if the color of the metal is dark\ngray, black, brown, or a color to match galvanized metal. Brightly colored roofs such as blue, green,\nor red are not permitted.\n3) If new gutters or downspouts are necessary, install them SO that no architectural features are damaged\nor lost.\n4) Replace gutters and downspouts with painted or a baked-enamel finished in a color appropriate to the\ncolor of the house.\n5) Colored metal cannot mimic the original color and texture of a tile roof. Therefore, if a tile roof must\nbe replaced and metal is chosen as the replacement material, the color of the metal shall be a traditional\nroof color such as black or brown.\nAvoid compromising authenticity\n1) Do not use white or light colors of asphalt shingles.\n2)\nIf new gutters and downspouts are needed, install them SO that no architectural features are lost or\ndamaged.

A foundation's height,\nmaterial, and any unique features or details are important to retain. Brick is the most common foundation\nmaterial in Lexington's historic districts. Many brick foundations are unpainted, some have colored mortar,\nand others have been painted over at some point. Wooden lattice panels are sometimes seen as infill between\n"}, {"page": "56", "text": "exposed brick pier foundations and on porches and entrances. In addition to other local, state, or federal\nregulations, codes, or requirements, the following standards will be used in considering Certificates of\nAppropriateness.\nMaintain and repair using permitted methods\n1) Moisture due to improper drainage or inadequate ventilation is the most common cause of deterioration\nin foundations. Improper drainage results from insufficient sloping or grading around the foundation,\nwhich allows water to collect and eventually erode the mortar joints in the foundation. Brick\nfoundations also can have loose or cracked brick and deterioration of mortar joints due to the settling\nof the structure over the years. Ensure proper grades are maintained to remove water from the\nfoundation. Install drains near the foundation if necessary. Remove vegetation growing close to the\nfoundation if resulting in moisture retention and foundation damage.\n2) Clean, repair, and repoint foundation according to masonry standards.\n3) Open vents during summer months to ensure adequate ventilation of the crawl space.\n4) Remove vegetation that may cause structural damage to the building's foundation.\nRetain and preserve historic features\n1) Return the original design, texture, color, and materials of historic foundations.

Non-\nstructural underpinning may consist of a single course of bricks, lattice brick walls, or even treated\nwooden lattice. If openings between brick piers are filled in, similar materials or lattice should be used.\nThe infill area should be recessed and clearly differentiated from the original piers.\nAvoid compromising authenticity\nInconspicuously locate new utility and mechanical connections through foundations using side or rear walls\nwhere they will not be visible from the street.\nPORCHES, ENTRYWAYS & BALCONIES\nPorches, entrances and balconies are often the focal point of a historic building and contribute significantly\nto overall architectural character. Porches were historically the center of activity in a residential\nneighborhood. Because the use of front porches in the neighborhood plays an equally significant role in the\noverall character of the community, new front porches will be permitted for houses lacking this important\nsocial space. Entrances demonstrate the architectural design as well as the period of the residential\nstructure. Balconies, sleeping porches, side and back porches also exist in the Lexington historic district.\nMany side and rear porches are screened or enclosed with lattice panels. Most porches are constructed in\nwood although some decorative ironwork can be present as well. Because the enclosure of a porch or\nbalcony alters the character of a historic structure significantly it is not permitted in a historic district, unless\nthe porch is on the rear fa\u00e7ade.

Reconstructed porches shall\nbe based on documentary evidence. If adequate documentation is not available, a new design is\nappropriate if it is compatible with the style and period of the building.\n2) Houses lacking usable front porches will be permitted to add new porches in a design consistent with\nother architectural features on the structure as well as overall compatibility with the surrounding homes.\n3) Repairs to porches using materials incompatible with the original materials are not allowed. For\nexample, metal supports shall not be used as substitutes for wood columns, plywood shall not be\nsubstituted for beaded board ceilings, and concrete shall not be used as a substitute for tongue-and-\ngroove wood flooring.\nAvoid compromising authenticity\n1) Handicapped access can be accommodated in an appropriate manner. The installation of temporary\nfeatures to aid the handicapped and disabled is recommended if designed SO that it can be installed or\nremoved without damage to the historic structure.\n2) Introducing new entrances on a primary elevation is prohibited.\n3) Creating a false historical appearance through the addition of elements and details is prohibited.\nReconstruction of a missing balcony or entrance requires evidence of the original configuration and\ndetail.\nFENCES AND WALLS\nMany different types of fencing and walls can be found in the City's historic areas. There are brick and\nconcrete retaining walls bordering the sidewalk and a stone wall that runs along the Salem and West Third\nStreet sides of the Lexington City Cemetery. Masonry walls are often used to define yards and to accent\ngarden landscapes. Some yards along West Fourth and North State Street are lined by wrought-iron fences.\nFences are prominent landscape features and help to visually define the scale of residential lots and public\nspaces.

Therefore, a property owner\nwithin the historic district does not need to obtain a Certificate of Appropriateness prior to painting his or\nher building. The standards for paint presented in this document are included only as a guide to the proper\nmethods to apply and maintain paint on a historic structure and will be used only in reviewing larger\nrenovation projects. Paint color and its application are non-permanent changes to a structure that often\nreflect personal taste. It also provides a level of visual detail on a structure much to the same degree as an\narchitectural component like a cornice or porch. References to paint colors are meant as suggestions. Paint\nserves two primary purposes on a historic structure: it provides character and detail to the building, and it\npreserves and protects wood and some metal surfaces. Masonry surfaces were historically left unpainted\n"}, {"page": "59", "text": "while some metal surfaces such as copper or bronze were also left uncoated as well. In addition to other\nlocal, state, or federal regulations, codes, or requirements, the following standards will be used in\nconsidering Certificates of Appropriateness.\nMaintain and repair using permitted methods\n1) Using high-quality paint, apply a sound paint film to surfaces that were historically painted.\n2) Follow preparation and application standards in previous sections on wood, masonry, and metal\nmaterials.\nRetain and preserve historic features\n1) Painting architectural features such as trim, brackets, corner boards and moldings a different color than\nthe body of the structure can accentuate these architectural details.\n2) When applying paint to a historic building, be careful not to conceal any architectural details or texture\nof the underlying material.\n3) Paint previously painted masonry material in colors that reflect the underlying material.\nReplace if necessary using like materials and design\n1) Select paint schemes that are most appropriate to the architectural style and period of the historic\nstructure. Historic color palettes and color suggestions may be obtained at local paint stores.\nAvoid compromising authenticity\n1) Masonry surfaces were historically unpainted. Paint previously unpainted surfaces is prohibitted.\nHowever, once painted, it is appropriate to repaint using color repair rather than blasting the surface to\nremove paint.\nLIGHTING\nLighting provides a subtle, but defining feature within historic areas. Lighting fixtures on historic homes,\nlamp posts along walkways, and even overhead street lights work in concert to paint the evening picture of\nhistoric districts, as well as improve safety for outdoor activity. Historic light fixtures, though small in\ncomparison to the size of structures, are important details to preserve. In addition to other local, state, or\nfederal regulations, codes, or requirements, the following standards will be used in considering Certificates\nof Appropriateness.\nMaintain and repair using permitted methods\n1) Original fixtures should be kept in good working order. Electrical wiring components should be\nchecked on a regular basis. Globes and glass coverings should be replaced or repaired if broken to keep\nwater from reaching electrical components.\n2) Metal should be maintained in accordance with methods prescribed in Section 2.3.\nRetain and preserve historic features\n1)\nRetain original lighting fixtures, lamp posts, and other outdoor lighting elements.\n2) If a light fixture is damaged, replace only the damaged portion in order to retain the historical detail.\n3) Methods to install new fixtures and repair original fixtures shall not damage the structure or any other\narchitectural feature.\nReplace if necessary using like materials and design\n"}, {"page": "60", "text": "1) Replacement fixtures shall be to the building and district in terms of type, style, size, color, brightness,\nand materials.\nAvoid compromising authenticity\n1) New fixtures shall be appropriate to the building and district in terms of type, style, size, color,\nbrightness, and materials.\n2) Use understated techniques and light sources to highlight a building's architecture.\n3) Lighting shall not adversely affect or spill over into neighboring properties, nor should it overly\nilluminate the district.\n4) Electric service lines to lamp posts should be buried whenever possible.\n5) Overhead street lights should be replaced with period overhead lamp post lighting and line should be\nburied whenever possible.\n6) Installing tall security pole lights in locations that are visible to the public is prohibited.\nAWNINGS\nAwnings were found on historic commercial structures as well as on some residential buildings. While their\nfunction is to provide shade and reduce heat gain, their design and application contribute significantly to\nthe architectural character of a historic structure. In addition to other local, state, or federal regulations,\ncodes, or requirements, the following standards will be used in considering Certificates of Appropriateness.\nRepair and maintain using permitted methods\n1) On masonry structures, attachments for awnings should be made in the mortar joints and not in the\nbrick itself.\n2) Awnings shall be maintained and cleaned in accordance with the manufacturer's suggested methods.\nOften a mild soap and water will remove any darkening of the fabric due to environment.\n3) Small tears in canvas that are patched or repaired early-on may prevent addition damage from wind. In\naddition, regular maintenance of the fabric may prevent water damage to the frame.\n4) Inspect regularly for damage to brackets, supports, or fasteners.\nRetain and preserve historic features\n1) Awnings shall fit in the openings above windows and doors.\n2) Awnings shall be affixed SO that no architectural features are concealed or damaged.\n3) Awnings shall be placed only on structures for which they are historically accurate or on which there\nis physical evidence of a similar previous treatment.\nReplace if necessary using like materials and design\n1) If replacement is necessary, new awnings shall match the original awnings in terms of placement, scale,\nand design. Color may vary to match current paint color schemes.\n2)\nContinuous awnings or awnings that cover architectural features such as piers or columns are not\nappropriate.\nAvoid compromising authenticity\n1) Signage, including logos, graphics, and other copy, is not permitted on lawnings. Only the address\nnumber may be screen printed or painted directly on the awning and the numbers shall be no greater\nthan six inches in height.\nOutbuildings & Accessory Structures\nThis section pertains to existing outbuildings and accessory structures. See Section, New Construction, for\nnew outbuildings and accessory structures. Original outbuildings such as barns, sheds, and garages, often\ngain historic significance in their own right due to construction method, architectural style, and period.\n"}, {"page": "61", "text": "Many of these structures survive in the district and are still being used as originally intended. Many of these\nhistoric outbuildings have architectural characteristics and style similar to the primary structure with which\nthey are associated. They are more utilitarian in nature, and are usually situated in rear yards adjacent to\nalleyways. The same criteria used for primary contributing buildings applies to contributing outbuildings\nand accessory structures. In addition, the following standards will be used in considering Certificates of\nAppropriateness.\nMaintain and repair using permitted methods\n1) Maintain and repair contributing outbuildings in the same manner as prescribed for primary\ncontributing structures.\nRetain and preserve historic features\n1) Retain and preserve original outbuildings which have gained historic significance on their own.\n2) Architectural elements of historic outbuildings such as roofs, siding, material, windows and doors,\nfoundations, and character-defining detailing should be retained and preserved.\nReplace if necessary using like materials and design\n1) If replacement of an element on a historic outbuilding is necessary, replace only the deteriorated portion\nto match the original in material, size, proportion, texture and detailing.\n2) The same criteria related to the use of materials applies to outbuildings and accessory structures.\nAvoid compromising authenticity\n1) Do not introduce new elements to outbuildings and accessory structures that diminish the historic\nintegrity of the structure.\nRESIDENTIAL PARKING, DRIVEWAYS & SIDEWALKS\nThe historic district was originally planned and developed with little consideration for the use and storage\nof vehicles, and certainly not to accommodate the 2- and 3-car families of today. Pedestrian features were\nprominent and buildings were closely spaced to reduce walking distances. Over the years, provisions for\nincreased vehicular use have been incorporated, and are now fundamental elements of the district. These\nfeatures can be maintained and designed in ways that do not detract from the original architecture, while\nproviding convenience and function for today's automobile-dependent society.\nResidential driveways are narrow and parking areas are small. Off-street parking is often in rear yards\naccessed from alleys. Due to the small size of residential lots as well as the early, pre-automobile\ndevelopment of the district, many lots do not have designated parking areas and must utilize on-street\nparking.\nIn addition to other local, state, or federal regulations, codes, or requirements, the following standards will\nbe used in considering Certificates of Appropriateness.\nRepair and maintain using permitted methods\n1) Maintain and repair paving surfaces for driveways and off-street parking.\nRetain and preserve historic features\n1) Landscape and site design should continue to enhance the district and complement its historic\narchitecture.\n2) Historic walkways and sidewalks and their original materials shall be retained and preserved whenever\npossible.\n"}, {"page": "62", "text": "3) Planter strips shall be retained as planter strips and may not be filled with concrete or other impervious\nsurface material.\nReplace if necessary using like materials and design\n1)\nOn-site parking within commercial areas shall be to the side or rear of the structure.

The planter strip shall contain a minimum of one canopy (large) tree\nplanted sixty feet on center.\n11) New walkways and steps shall be compatible to the architectural style and character of the structure\nlocated on the property.\n12) New front walks in residential areas shall lead directly from the public sidewalk to the front door of\nthe structure.\n13) New walkways shall be flush with the grade of the front yard and with the public sidewalk.\nTREES\nBecause the Lexington Historic District is primarily residential in scale and character, buildings generally\ncover half of the average lot; therefore, it is important to preserve both the proportion of green area to\nbuilding mass and the formal or informal character of the landscaping. Significant elements of the\nlandscape, such as mature trees, grassy lawns, hedges, foundation plantings, fences, walls, trellises, ground\ncover, fountains, terraces and gardens, all contribute to the character of the specific site and the historic\ndistrict as a whole, though only mature (18\" diameter) large trees will be regulated herein. (Large tree\nspecies are defined and listed within Section 9.)\nLarge trees within the district are often as historically significant as the structures themselves, particularly\nin the residential areas. Some of the trees in the district are as old if not older than the historic buildings.\nWhile a building can be renovated or restored, vegetation cannot. Therefore, it is critical that mature and\nhistoric trees contributing to the character of the district be preserved and maintained. In addition to other\nlocal, state, or federal regulations, codes, or requirements, the following standards will be used in\nconsidering Certificates of Appropriateness.\nMaintain and Repair using permitted methods\n"}, {"page": "63", "text": "Unnatural pruning techniques such as topping, stubbing, dehorning, or lopping are not appropriate.

Removal of significant trees should only be done in the case of disease or storm\ndamage, if the tree poses a safety hazard, or is a hazard to historic structures. The Historic Preservation\nCommission will pay the cost of obtaining the professional opinion of an acceptable licensed arborist to\nassist in determining the condition of large trees. Please contact the Director of Business and Community\nDevelopment in such cases SO that arrangements may be made for an arborist.\nAvoid compromising authenticity\nSee Section, Landscape Methods and Standards, for additional information on permitted species and\ninstallation methods.\nENERGY RETROFIT\nMany features of historic buildings are inherently energy efficient. For example, operable transoms,\nwindows, awnings, and shutters provide opportunities for conserving energy. Enclosed vestibules,\nextending porches and even certain plantings help buffer historic interiors from the elements. Capitalizing\non energy-efficient historic features and sensitively retrofitting historic buildings can maximize their\nenergy-conserving potential. In addition to other local, state, or federal regulations, codes, or requirements,\nthe following standards will be used in considering Certificates of Appropriateness.\nMaintain and repair using permitted methods\n1) Energy efficiency of older windows is compromised if the weather-stripping around the sash is not\nmaintained and the glazing compound that seals the glass panes within the wooden sash deteriorates.\nWeather-stripping around doors must be maintained to prevent air infiltration.\n2) Once existing windows and doors have been repaired as needed, storm windows and doors can be\ninstalled to provide a second barrier for greater efficiency when installing storm windows. Care must\nbe taken not to damage or obscure the windows and the doors in the process. Interior storm windows\nare required as an alternative to exterior storm windows. However, exterior storm windows with a\npainted or baked-enamel finish in a color appropriate to the color of the building are acceptable. Stained\nor painted wooden storm doors with large glass panels are also acceptable.\n3) When introducing insulation, care should be taken not to damage historic details or materials. Rapid-\nexpanding insulating foam may damage historic window and siding details. Introducing blown-in\ninsulation by drilling holes through an exterior wall of a building is prohibited.\nRetain and preserve historic features\n1) Retain and preserve the inherent energy-conservation features of a historic building, such as porches,\noperable windows, transoms, and louvered shutters.\n2) Improve thermal efficiency by installing weather-stripping, storm windows, caulk, and, if they are\nhistorically appropriate, fabric awnings and shutters.\nReplace if necessary using like materials and design\n"}, {"page": "64", "text": "Replace multiple-paned doors or window sashes with thermal sashes using snap-in, false muntins is\nprohibited.\nAvoid compromising authenticity\n1) Select wooden doors or screen doors that are stained in a natural wood color or painted to match the\nbuilding or the trim. Install storm or screen doors SO that the existing door and frame are not damaged\nor obscured. Metal storm or screen doors are not appropriate.\n2) If wooden shutters are historically appropriate, install them in porch, door, or window openings SO that\narchitectural features are not concealed or historic materials damaged. Select colors appropriate to the\ncolor of the building.\n3) Install low-profile ridge vents if desired, provided that they do not diminish the original design of the\nroof or destroy architectural details.\n4) Locate roof ventilators, antennas, and solar collectors on non-character-defining roofs or\ninconspicuously on rear slopes, where they will not be visible on the street. They are prohibited on front\nor street elevations.\nSTOREFRONTS OF COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES\nAlthough most of the standards are applicable to commercial properties as well, this section is applicable\nto commercial storefronts. The storefront is the most important character-defining element of a commercial\nfa\u00e7ade. Upper fa\u00e7ades on a historic commercial building are quite different in their function and design.\nCommercial buildings were originally designed to have a commercial function on the first level, and an\noffice or residential function on the upper floors. While not often used in that way today, a growing trend\nin downtown revitalization is to bring a residential function back into a city's historic core. Many\nstorefronts in Lexington had large display windows above wooden or masonry bulkheads with transom\nwindows above. Some also had recessed entryways in the center of the fa\u00e7ade flanked by display windows.\nIn addition to other local, state, or federal regulations, codes, or requirements, the following standards will\nbe used in considering Certificates of Appropriateness.\nMaintain and Repair using permitted methods\nFollow the standards specific to individual materials in order to protect and maintain historic storefronts\nclad in wood, masonry, and architectural metals.\nRetain and preserve historic features\n1) Retain and preserve historic fa\u00e7ades and their architectural features such as brick corbelling, brick and\nstone string courses, quoins, stone and tile coping, cornices, and other fa\u00e7ade elements.\n2) Retain and preserve historic materials including wood, stone, architectural metal, and cast iron.\n3) Retain and preserve commercial storefronts and storefront details that contribute to the historic\ncharacter of the building including display windows, recessed entryways, doors, transoms, corner posts,\ncolumns, and other decorative features.\n4)\nRetain and preserve historic materials whenever possible including wood, stone, architectural metal,\nand cast iron.\n5) Bricking-in original window and door openings is prohibited.\n6) Whenever possible, remove metal cladding or other non-historic coverings from historic fa\u00e7ades.\nReplace if necessary using like materials and design\n1)\nIf replacement of a deteriorated storefront or storefront feature is necessary, replace only the\ndeteriorated element to match the original in size, scale, proportion, material, texture and detail.\n2)\nIf reconstructing a historic storefront, base the design on historic research, physical evidence, and\nphotographic documentation, if available.

The design and function of storefront\nentrances shall also be retained.\n3) Changing a storefront SO that it appears as an office or residential use other than commercial is not\npermitted. Reconstructing storefronts for new uses is not allowed.\n4) It is prohibited to cover architectural details or entire fa\u00e7ades with non-historic materials or treatments.\n5) Established contemporary materials may be used as a suitable replacement or for repair when necessary.\n6) Proposals to restore exterior walls, details, materials, or any other character-defining elements to a more\nauthentic or historically-accurate condition shall be required. Proposals will be evaluated on a case-by-\ncase basis by the Planning Board and/or its appointed review committee(s).\nREAR AND NON-CHARACTER-DEFINING ELEVATIONS ON COMMERCIAL\nBUILDINGS\nRear elevations on historic commercial buildings are usually of simple design reflecting their utilitarian\nfunction. These elevations, with rear entrances to shops, offices, and residential spaces, still foster a great\ndeal of activity.\nMaintain and repair using permitted methods\nFollow the standards specific to individual materials in order to protect and maintain historic storefronts\nclad in wood, masonry, and architectural metals.\nRetain and preserve historic features\n1)\nHistoric structures which are adjacent to rear parking areas or public rights-of-way are required to\nutilize existing rear entrances allowing public and private access.\n2) Retain and preserve historic side and rear elevations and their architectural features.\n3) Whenever a rear elevation faces a public right of way or parking facility, unnecessary utility lines and\nequipment shall be removed, whenever possible. New utility and mechanical equipment shall be placed\nin an inconspicuous location such as the roof and screened from public view.\nReplace if necessary using like materials and design\n1) When portions of rear and non-character-defining elevations are deteriorated, replace only the\ndeteriorated portions with materials that match the originals.\n2)\nOriginal windows on upper floors that are located on rear or non-character-defining elevations may be\nrepaired, or replaced with wood, aluminum-clad, or vinyl-clad windows that match the originals in\ndesign, size, proportions and detail.\nAvoid compromising authenticity\nResidential features such as window boxes, window air conditioning units, etc, should be located on rear\nor side elevations and should be appropriate to the style of the historic structure. Small satellite dishes or\ntelevision antennas should be as inconspicuous as possible, preferably being located on rooftops.\nCOMMERCIAL PARKING, DRIVEWAYS & SIDEWALKS\n"}, {"page": "66", "text": "1) Commercial areas are designed with wide streets and sidewalks, and designated on-street parking\nspaces in order to accommodate heavy vehicular and pedestrian traffic.

Some signage is historic in its own right. While signs serve\nimportant functions, sensitive design that complements and does not detract from historic architecture can\nenhance the historic district. Size, type, and location of signs are important design considerations for\ncommercial structures and help define the pedestrian qualities of the downtown.

According to a report by the North Carolina's State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), asbestos-\ncement siding installed on historically significant structures during original construction is worthy of\npreservation. However, there are several historically-significant structures that were constructed during the\nperiod of significance (1854 to 1957), that appear to have asbestos-cement siding added at a later date,\nthereby compromising the historic character of these structures. As part of the review process, staff will\ndetermine a structure's historic status as either contributing or noncontributing by referring to both the\nSHPO report and the Park Place Local Historic District Local Designation Report, prepared by an\naccredited Historic Preservation Consultant. The intent is to restore structures that are found to be\nhistorically-compromised and therefore, non-contributing, back to their contributing status in the District.\nIn addition to other local, state, or federal regulations, codes, or requirements, the following standards will\nbe used in considering Certificates of Appropriateness.\nMaintain and Repair using permitted methods\n1)\nAsbestos-cement siding can be cleaned if it is soiled or moldy, or has an algae coating. Trisodium\nPhosphate (TSP) added to warm water in the proportions recommended by the manufacturer can be\nused to remove dirt or light stains. Bleach may be added to the mixture to remove moss or other fungi.\nWear rubber gloves, eye protection, long sleeve shirts, and long pants when mixing or using trisodium\nphosphate or bleach solutions, and be sure to the follow safety precautions printed on cleaner and bleach\nlabels. The use of a power washer or mechanical methods for cleaning asbestos-cement can damage\nthe surface, possibly allowing asbestos fibers to become airborne, and should not be used. Property\nowners are encouraged to contact the City for technical assistance and contact information for the North\nCarolina Historic Preservation Office.\n2) Provide adequate drainage to prevent water from standing on flat, horizontal surfaces and collecting on\ndecorative elements. Prolonged dampness of asbestos-cement siding can promote growth of moss, algae\nand fungi. Shade trees in close proximity to the structure or exterior wall planes facing northerly\ndirections are susceptible to moisture retention. It is recommended to remove objects blocking sunlight\nand trim vegetation and landscaping to mitigate moisture problems.\n3)\nIf stains cannot be removed, another option is painting the asbestos-cement products. Painting is an\nespecially good solution if the material was originally painted, but adds a maintenance factor. Oil based\npaints and varnishes are not chemically compatible with cementitious materials. High quality alkali-\nresistant and weather resistant exterior paint (i.e., 100% acrylic coating) should be used on exterior\nasbestos-cement materials, or use pigmented shingle stain. Before being painted, asbestos-cement\nsurfaces should be cleaned, then primed with an alkali-resistant primer.\n4) Asbestos-cement products can be brittle and susceptible to cracking and chipping. Potential damage\nshould be minimized or prevented. For example, shrubs or flower beds can planted around the\nfoundation to prevent the siding from being damaged by lawn equipment, automobiles, etc., or a drip\ncap can be added below the bottom row of siding to serve as a bumper. Hairline cracks can be repaired\nwith clear epoxy, and larger gaps can be patched with a thin grout made of Portland cement and water.\nFor cracks larger than 1/8 inch, grout with a thicker consistency should be used, or sand should be\nadded to the grout. After patching, keep the grout damp for about a week to keep it from drying SO\nquickly that it cracks.\nRetain and Preserve Historic Features\n1) Retain and preserve Asbestos-cement siding that was installed during original construction of\ncontributing structures. Broken or damaged shingles shall be replaced with fiber cement planks that\nduplicate the dimensions and texture of the existing panels. Applications of any vinyl siding, materials,\ncomponents or substitutes are not appropriate.\n2) Do not resurface, cover or encase existing asbestos-cement siding on any structure, building, wall, or\nfeature with synthetic materials including however, not limited to: vinyl, aluminum, EIFS/Stucco\n(Exterior Insulation Finishing System) or asphalt. Covering asbestos-cement siding or features conceals\n"}, {"page": "70", "text": "the historic fabric of a building.

In addition, it allows\nmoisture and related problems to go undetected. Resurfacing with these materials often covers, but does\nnot address, underlying problems that may get much worse.\nReplace if necessary using like materials and design\n1) If replacement of a portion of damaged asbestos-cement panels on contributing structures is necessary,\nreplace only the damaged panels with fiber-cement panels, only. Use of fiber-cement panels that match\nthe original, asbestos-cement panels in design, dimensions and texture are appropriate. Regarding the\nhandling of asbestos, the following finding has been determined by the North Carolina Department of\nHealth and Human Services: If this material is in good condition and can be removed substantially\nintact, with no small fragments or dust generated, then it is not considered a regulated asbestos-\ncontaining material and does not require the use of accredited personnel or an asbestos removal permit.\nMinor breakage that may occur during careful removal of the siding does not result in the material\nbecoming regulated; however, if the siding is not removed substantially intact, it becomes regulated.\nProperty owners are encouraged to contact the City for technical assistance, resources and guidance on\nhandling asbestos materials.\n2)\nIf asbestos-cement siding is present on historically-compromised structures, and/or is in substantial\ndisrepair, any proposals to restore exterior walls, details, materials or any other character-defining\nelements to a more authentic or historically-accurate condition shall be required. Proposals to remove\nand abate existing asbestos-cement materials with the intent of restoring the structure's original, historic\ncharacter will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Planning Board and/or its appointed review\ncommittee(s).\n3) If asbestos-cement siding or features are found to be unoriginal to the construction of any structure, and\nthere is documented evidence that wooden siding was the original material, then restoration and/or\nreplacement of the wooden siding or features with natural wooden material or fiber cement is\nappropriate. Replacement with wooden material must match the original material in design, dimension,\ndetail, and texture. Replacement with fiber cement material must mimic natural wood material in both\ntexture and dimensions.\n4) If asbestos-cement siding or features are found to be original to the structure, and is in a state of\nsubstantial disrepair as determined by the Planning Board and/or its designated review committee(s),\nthen wooden or fiber cement shall be used as an appropriate replacement.\nAvoid compromising authenticity\n1) Do not add new features such as window or door openings, bays, vents, balconies, or chimneys to\ncharacter-defining exterior walls.\n2)\nDo not resurface, cover or encase existing asbestos-cement siding on any structure, building, wall, or\nfeature with synthetic materials including however, not limited to: vinyl, aluminum, EIFS/Stucco\n(Exterior Insulation Finishing System) or asphalt.

In addition, it allows\nmoisture and related problems to go undetected. Resurfacing with these materials often covers, but does\nnot address, underlying problems that may get much worse.\n3) The introduction of features or details on exterior walls in an attempt to create a false historical\nappearance is not permitted. Proposals to restore exterior walls, details, materials, or any other\ncharacter-defining elements to a more authentic or historically-accurate condition shall be required.\nProposals will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\nVINYL, ALUMINUM AND OTHER SYNTHETIC SIDING MATERIALS\n"}, {"page": "71", "text": "Vinyl, aluminum, EIFS (Exterior Insulation Finishing System)/Stucco and other synthetic siding materials\nare present on both contributing and noncontributing structures in the Park Place Historic District. However,\nvinyl siding and other synthetic materials are not recognized as historically-relevant building materials.\nAccording to a statement by the United States Secretary of the Interior; \"Vinyl siding creates a very different\nplay of light and shadow on the wall surface, thus resulting in a different character, thereby compromising\nthe historic character of the structure. Changes to character-defining features of a building such as this\nalways have an impact on more than just that building; they also alter the historic visual relationship\nbetween the buildings in the neighborhood.\" As part of the review process, staff will determine a structure's\nhistoric status as either contributing or noncontributing by referring to the Park Place Local Historic\nDistrict Local Designation Report, prepared by an accredited Historic Preservation Consultant. In addition\nto other local, state, or federal regulations, codes, or requirements, the following standards will be used in\nconsidering Certificates of Appropriateness.\nMaintain and Repair using permitted methods\n1) Vinyl, aluminum, EIFS (Exterior Insulation Finishing System)/Stucco and other synthetic siding\nmaterials are susceptible to the same effects as natural products of being exposed to the elements.\nAdditionally, vinyl siding can shatter when struck by hard objects, and aluminum and stucco will dent\nor show scratches. Painting synthetic surfaces as a maintenance solution is not appropriate, and the\nresults are often unsuccessful because of the nature and chemical compositions of these various\nmaterials. Periodic cleaning with mild soap and water is recommended. Any brick, stone or other\nmasonry surfaces should be covered and protected from any potential runoff that may occur from\ncleaning agents. A soft bristle brush may be used as an agitator.\n2) Provide adequate drainage to prevent water from standing on flat, horizontal surfaces and collecting on\ndecorative elements. Although many synthetic materials contain chemicals that resist the growth of\nmoss, algae and fungi, prolonged dampness of any siding material can promote growth of biological\nmicroorganisms. Shade trees in close proximity to structures or exterior wall planes facing northerly\ndirections are susceptible to moisture retention. It is recommended to remove objects blocking sunlight\nand trim vegetation and landscaping to mitigate moisture problems.\nRetain and Preserve Historic Features\n1) Vinyl or aluminum siding, EIFS (Exterior Insulation Finishing System)/Stucco and other synthetic\nmaterials are not recognized as historically-relevant building materials. These materials were\nmanufactured and installed on buildings well after the period of significance (1854-1957) and are not\noriginal to the buildings, thereby compromising the historic character of structures. As a matter of\nregular maintenance, broken or damaged synthetic siding shall be replaced with duplicate materials that\nmatch the dimensions and texture of the existing panels, to the practical extent possible. Replace only\nthe damaged sections, in-kind. Substantial installation, new or otherwise, of any replacement vinyl\nsiding, materials, components or substitutes are prohibited.\n2)\nKeep joints properly sealed and maintained according to the specifications recommended by the\nparticular manufacturer or industry-specific standards and methods to prevent moisture infiltration.\n3) Do not resurface, cover or encase existing vinyl, aluminum, EIFS (Exterior Insulation Finishing\nSystem)/Stucco, or other synthetic siding on any structure, building, wall, or feature with new or\nreplacement synthetic materials. Covering siding or features may further conceal the historic fabric of\na building and could allow moisture and related problems to go undetected. Resurfacing with these\nmaterials often covers, but does not address, underlying problems that may get much worse.\nReplace if necessary using like materials and design\n1) If replacement of a portion of damaged synthetic siding or materials is necessary as a matter of regular\nmaintenance, replace the damaged pieces, parts or areas, only. Use of replacement materials that match\nthe original materials in design, dimensions and texture are appropriate. Substantial installation, new\nor otherwise, of any replacement vinyl siding, materials, components or substitutes are prohibited.\n"}, {"page": "72", "text": "2) If damage or deterioration of existing vinyl, aluminum, EIFS (Exterior Insulation Finishing\nSystem)/Stucco and/or other synthetic siding material is found to be substantial by the Planning Board\nand/or its appointed review committee(s), then siding must be replaced and restored back to its original\nmaterial at the time of construction based on documented evidence to the extent possible.

An approved Major Works Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) is required prior to the\nissuance of any building permit(s) to begin placement and/or new construction (refer to Appendix G\nfor permitted materials). Additionally, any proposals must meet setback and placement provisions as\ndefined and illustrated in Section 3: Zoning District Regulations, in the Land Use Ordinance for\noutbuildings and accessory structures.\n2) Designs for new outbuildings and accessory structures, such as detached carports, detached garages,\nlighting, and signage, shall complement the architectural style and period of the primary structures as\nwell as similar structures within the district.\n3) New outbuildings and accessory structures shall be located SO as not to be visible from the fronting\npublic street. The Lexington Land Use Ordinance regulates the specific location and setbacks for new\noutbuildings and accessory structures. In addition, the side setback should be no less than the side\nsetback for the primary structure SO that the building is less likely to be visible from the street.\n4) The scale of new outbuildings relative to the house should be comparable to other ratios within the\ndistrict. As stated in the Lexington Land Use Ordinance, and also required herein, the aggregate floor\narea of all accessory buildings, excluding open patios and decks, may not exceed half of the total first\nfloor area of the house.

Install them in such a manner that there is no damage to the\nexisting window sill or sashes, or to the wall surface below, as water can hug the sill and return to\nstain and damage the wall.\n3) Installation, rehabilitation, or replacement of mechanical systems should minimize changes to the\nexterior appearance of a structure.\n4) Some historic mechanical systems such as plumbing, early lighting fixtures, and vents are important\narchitectural features and should be retained and preserved whenever possible.\n5)\nCompliance with local building codes and utility company standards and practices is required for\nthe installation, upgrading, or replacement of building systems.\n6) New mechanical systems shall be installed in areas and spaces that will require the least possible\nalteration to the site plan, materials, and appearance of a building. Mechanical equipment which\ncan be seen from the street must be screened with shrubbery or appropriate fencing.\n7) If feasible, mechanical supply lines and ductwork shall be located inside buildings. Exterior\nmechanical supply lines and ductwork shall be disguised by architectural elements compatible with\nthe character of the building and shall be located as inconspicuously as possible.\n8) Plumbing vents and solar collectors shall not be visible from the street.\n9) Locate television antennas and satellite dishes on rear elevations where they are not easily seen\nfrom a public right-of-way.\n10) Communication systems such as television antennae, satellite dishes, and cellular phone towers can\ndramatically affect the character of the historic environment. Care must be taken SO the installations\nof these systems minimize their visual and physical impact to the historic district.\n11) Attaching exterior electrical, telephone or television cables to the principal elevations of the\nbuildings is not permitted.\nDEMOLITION\nCertificate of Appropriateness for Demolition\nA Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) is required for demolition of any structure within the historic\ndistrict. Demolition should be carefully deliberated. Property owners should work with the Planning Board\nand City staff to seek alternatives and guidance on demolition. The Planning Board will evaluate the\nfollowing points when considering issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness for a proposed demolition:\n1) Does the structure represent an imminent threat to health or safety as is?\n2) Is the cost of stabilization or rehabilitation reasonable compared to the cost of new construction?\n"}, {"page": "77", "text": "3) If the demolition is proposed in order to facilitate new development on site, are other suitable sites\navailable?\n4) Is adaptive reuse a viable option?\n5) Can the property be sold to someone willing to use the existing building?\n6) Can the existing building be moved to another site?\n7) Will the proposed demolition adversely affect other historic buildings in the district or the overall\ncharacter of the district?\n8) If the COA were denied, would the property owner be denied any reasonable return from, or make any\nreasonable use of, his property?\n9) Is the need to demolish the result of the applicant's own actions?\nA COA may delay demolition for up to 365 days in order to allow the Planning Board adequate time to\nexplore alternatives.\nDemolition of Structures of Statewide Significance\nIn addition, an application for a COA authorizing the demolition of a building, site or a structure determined\nby the NC State Historic Preservation Office to have statewide significance as defined in the criteria of the\nNational Register of Historic Places, may be denied except when:\n1) City Council has adopted a demolition ordinance pursuant to the Minimum Housing Code and North\nCarolina General Statute (NCGS) 160A-443.\n2) The structure is certified by a building inspector to be Unsafe and Condemned under the NCGS 160A-\n426(a).\n3) The Planning Board finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of\nall beneficial use of or return from the property by virtue of the denial.\nConditions for COA for Demolition\nThe following shall be imposed conditions upon any COA issued for demolition:\n1) Any proposed new infill development on lots where the original structure has been demolished and/or\nremoved will follow the standards set forth in section 17.3.1.1\n2) Any proposed new primary structure will match, as much as possible, the setbacks, massing, placement,\nscale, orientation and spacing of the original demolished structure, as determined by the Planning Board\nand/or its appointed review committee(s).\n3) Before demolition, the property owner shall record significant structures through photographs and/or\nmeasured drawings as specified by the Planning Board.\n4) Before demolition, the property owner shall submit a site plan to the Planning Board illustrating\nproposed site development or plantings to follow demolition.\n5)\nDuring demolition, the property owner shall ensure the safety of any adjacent properties and historic\nresources. Also, during and after demolition, the property owner shall protect trees on the site from\ndamage due to compaction of the soil by equipment or materials.\n6) After demolition, the property owner shall be responsible for clearing the site promptly and thoroughly.\n7) After demolition, the property owner shall seed in grass, landscape and/or develop the site promptly as\napproved in the proposed site plan.\nRELOCATION\nA Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) is required for the relocation of any contributing structure from\nwithin the district, or to another site within the same historic district or another historic district. The\nrelocation of structures from outside of the district to within the district shall be considered as new\nconstruction. Moving a historic structure is a substantial process requiring a special skill set and is usually\nonly undertaken to prevent demolition.

In addition, multi-tenant direction signs may be necessary to give specific directions\nconcerning the locations of businesses without doors fronting the sidewalk. Each of these types of signs\nhas an appropriate size and scale to guide the customer at any point along the trip. A sign that is out of\nscale will detract from the business and not assist the potential customer with finding the location.\nIncreasing the level of simplicity relative to size improves readability of larger (building) signs, thus\ngreatly improves effectiveness. Small scale window signs can become more complex without obscuring\nthe openness of the business, as the customer is more at leisure to absorb additional information while\nstanding outside of the business.\nMost Uptown buildings were built with a space, commonly a recessed or obvious sign \"frame\" located\nbetween the first and second level, specifically for the placement of a building sign. The eye naturally\nfalls to this central area of a building and simple lettering in this designated space is visible and much\neasier to quickly read from a passing vehicle. Often this designated space remains blank, while ill-fitting,\ncomplicated signage is applied elsewhere on the building. Back-lit plastic illustrated color panels are in\nconflict with the historic environment and detract from the shopping experience sought in Uptown.\nHighlighting the architecture of the building through appropriate placement of signage gains positive\nattraction for the business and unites the Uptown area as a shopping and dining destination. Occasionally,\na creative yet simple projection sign will serve the same purpose, but only if it is not in competition with\ntoo many other existing projection signs, trees, or architectural features.\n1) Building signs on buildings with two or more stories shall be located between the first and second\nlevel, centered over the storefront or business opening.

VESTED RIGHTS AND PERMIT\nCHOICE.\nFindings. Development approval typically follows significant investment in site evaluation, planning,\ndevelopment costs, consultant fees, and related expenses. It is necessary and desirable to provide for the\nestablishment of certain vested rights in order to ensure reasonable certainty, stability, and fairness in the\ndevelopment regulation process, to secure the reasonable expectations of landowners, and to foster\ncooperation between the public and private sectors in land-use planning and development regulation. The\nprovisions of this section strike an appropriate balance between private expectations and the public interest.\nPermit Choice. If an application is submitted for a development approval in accordance with requirements\nof this ordinance and a development regulation changes between the time the application was submitted\nand a decision is made, the applicant may choose which version of the development regulation will apply\nto the application. (For the purpose of this ordinance, an application is not considered submitted if it it\nincomplete.) If the applicant chooses the version of the rule or ordinance applicable at the time of the permit\napplication, the development permit applicant shall not be required to await the outcome of the amendment\nto the rule, map, or ordinance prior to acting on the development permit. This section applies to all\ndevelopment approvals issued by the State and the City.\nWhere multiple local development permits are required to complete a development project, the\ndevelopment permit applicant may choose the version of each of the local land development regulations\napplicable to the project upon submittal of the application for the initial development permit. This provision\nis applicable only for those subsequent development permit applications filed within 18 months of the date\nfollowing the approval of an initial permit. For purposes of the vesting protections of this subsection, an\nerosion and sedimentation control permit or a sign permit is not an initial development permit.\nIf a permit application is placed on hold at the request of the applicant for a period of six consecutive months\nor more, or the applicant fails to respond to comments or provide additional information reasonably\nrequested by the local or State government for a period of six consecutive months or more, the application\nreview shall be discontinued and the development regulations in effect at the time permit processing is\nresumed shall be applied to the application.\nProcess to Claim Vested Right. A person claiming a statutory or common law vested right may submit\ninformation to substantiate that claim to the Administrator or Administrative Staff, who shall make an initial\ndetermination as to the existence of the vested right. The decision of the Administrator or Administrative\nStaff may be appealed under G.S. 160D-405. On appeal, the existence of a vested right shall be reviewed\nde novo. In lieu of seeking such a determination, a person claiming a vested right may bring an original\ncivil action as provided by G.S. 160D-405(c).\nTypes and Duration of Statutory Vested Rights. Except as provided by this section and subject to\nsubsection 13.2 of this section, amendments in development regulations shall not be applicable or\nenforceable with regard to development that has been permitted or approved SO long as the development\napproval remains valid and unexpired. Each type of vested right listed in this subsection is defined by and\nis subject to the limitations provided in this section. Vested rights established under this section are not\nmutually exclusive. The establishment of a vested right under this section does not preclude the\nestablishment of one or more other vested rights or vesting by common law principles. Vested rights\nestablished by City approvals are as follows:\n1) Six months - Building permits. A building permit expires six months after issuance unless work\nunder the permit has commenced. Building permits also expire if work is discontinued for a period\nof 12 months after work has commenced.\n"}, {"page": "180", "text": "2) Two years - All other local development approvals expire two years after issuance unless work has\nsubstantially commenced. Expiration of a development approval shall not affect the duration of a\nvested right established under this section or vested rights established under common law.\n3) Three to five years - Site-specific vesting plans.\na) Duration. A vested right for a site-specific vesting plan shall remain vested for a period of\nthree years. This vesting shall not be extended by any amendments or modifications to a\nsite-specific vesting plan unless expressly provided by the City. At development approval,\nthe City may provide that rights regarding a site-specific vesting plan shall be vested for a\nperiod exceeding three years, but not exceeding five years, if warranted by the size and\nphasing of development, the level of investment, the need for the development, economic\ncycles, and market conditions, or other considerations. This determination shall be in the\ndiscretion of the approving authority and shall be made following the regular review\nprocess for that permit type.\nb) Relation to building permits. A right vested as provided in this subsection shall terminate\nat the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to buildings and uses for which no\nvalid building permit applications have been filed. Upon issuance of a building permit, the\nprovisions of G.S. 160D-1109 and G.S. 160D-1113 shall apply, except that the permit shall\nnot expire or be revoked because of the running of time while a vested right under this\nsubsection exists.\nc) Requirements for site-specific vesting plans. For the purposes of this section, a \"site-\nspecific vesting plan\" means a plan submitted to the City pursuant to this section describing\nwith reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of\nproperty. The plan may be in the form of, but not be limited to, any of the following plans\nor approvals: a planned unit development plan, a subdivision plat, a site plan a conditional\nzoning, or any other development approval as may be issued and determined by the City.\nUnless otherwise expressly provided by the City, the plan shall include the approximate\nboundaries of the site; significant topographical and other natural features affecting\ndevelopment of the site; the approximate location on the site of the proposed buildings,\nstructures, and other improvements; the approximate dimensions, including height, of the\nproposed buildings and other structures; and the approximate location of all existing and\nproposed infrastructure on the site, including water, sewer, roads, and pedestrian\nwalkways. A variance shall not constitute a site-specific vesting plan and approval of a\nsite-specific vesting plan with the condition that a variance be obtained shall not confer a\nvested right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained. If a sketch plan or other\ndocument fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a\nspecified parcel or parcels of property, it may not constitute a site-specific vesting plan.\nd) Process for approval and amendment of site-specific vesting plans. If a site-specific\nvesting plan is based on an approval required by the City, the City shall provide whatever\nnotice and hearing is required for that underlying approval. The site-specific vesting plan\ncan be approved as part of the underlying approval and be for up to five years. The two-\nyear duration of the underlying approval shall not affect the duration of the site-specific\nvesting plan established under this subdivision. The City may approve a site-specific\nvesting plan upon such terms and conditions as may reasonably be necessary to protect the\npublic health, safety, and welfare. Such conditional approval shall result in a vested right,\nalthough failure to abide by its terms and conditions will result in a forfeiture of vested\nrights. City Council shall not require a landowner to waive vested rights as a condition of\ndevelopmental approval. A site-specific vesting plan shall be deemed approved upon the\neffective date of the decision approving the plan or such other date as determined by City\n"}, {"page": "181", "text": "Council upon approval. An approved site-specific vesting plan and its conditions may be\namended with the approval of the owner and City Council as follows: any substantial\nmodification must be reviewed and approved in the same manner as the original approval;\nminor modifications may be approved by staff, if such are defined and authorized in section\n4) Seven years - Multiphase developments. A multiphase development shall be vested for the entire\ndevelopment with the regulations in place at the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial\nphase of the multiphase development. This right shall remain vested for a period of seven years\nfrom the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multiphase development.\nFor purposes of this subsection, \"multiphase development\" means a development containing 25\nacres or more that (i) is submitted for site plan approval for construction to occur in more than one\nphase and (ii) is subject to a master development plan with committed elements, including a\nrequirement to offer land for public use as a condition of its master development plan approval.\n5) Indefinite - Development agreements. Development agreements shall be of a reasonable term\nspecified in the agreement.\nContinuing Review. Following approval or conditional approval of a statutory vested right, the City may\nmake subsequent reviews and require subsequent approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and\nconditions of the original approval, provided that such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the\noriginal approval. The City may revoke the original approval for failure to comply with applicable terms\nand conditions of the original approval or the applicable local development regulations.\nExceptions. The provisions of this section are subject to the following:\n1) A vested right, once established as provided for by subdivision (3) or (4) of subsection (13.4) of\nthis section, precludes any zoning action by the City that would change, alter, impair, prevent,\ndiminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the property as set forth in an approved\nvested right, except when any of the following conditions are present:\na) The written consent of the affected landowner.\nb) Findings made, after notice and an evidentiary hearing, that natural or man-made hazards\non or in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat\nto the public health, safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as contemplated in\nthe approved vested right.\nc) The extent to which the affected landowner receives compensation for all costs, expenses,\nand other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but not limited to, all fees paid in\nconsideration of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and other\nconsulting fees incurred after approval by the City Council, together with interest as\nis\nprovided in G.S. 160D-106. Compensation shall not include any diminution in the value\nof the property that is caused by such action.\nd) Findings made, after notice and an evidentiary hearing, that the landowner or the\nlandowner's representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material\nmisrepresentations that made a difference in the approval by the City of the vested right.\ne) The enactment or promulgation of a State or federal law or regulation that precludes\ndevelopment as contemplated in the approved vested right, in which case the City may\nmodify the affected provisions, upon a finding that the change in State or federal law has a\nfundamental effect on the plan, after notice and an evidentiary hearing.\n2) The establishment of a vested right under subdivision (3) or (4) of subsection (13.4) of this section\nshall not preclude the application of overlay zoning or other development regulation that imposes\nadditional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or\n"}, {"page": "182", "text": "regulations that are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to development\nregulation by the City, including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and\nmechanical codes.

A vested right obtained under this section is not a personal right but shall attach\nto and run with the applicable property. After approval of a vested right under this section, all successors\nto the original landowner shall be entitled to exercise such rights. Nothing in this section shall preclude\njudicial determination, based on common law principles or other statutory provisions, that a vested right\nexists in a particular case or that a compensable taking has occurred.
