The Board of Commissioners finds that adult uses in certain locations contribute to\nneighborhood deterioration and blight through an increase in crime and diminution of property values,\namong other adverse consequences, and finds that such effects are contrary to the general welfare of the\nCounty. The Board of Commissioners recognizes that important and substantial government interests\nprovide a constitutional basis for reasonable regulation of the time, place and manner under which adult\nuses operate; and that, therefore, the Board of Commissioners determined that persons seeking to operate\nadult uses shall be required to observe specific location requirements before they commence business, as\nprovided for in this Section. The Board of Commissioners finds that the licensing of adult uses is\nnecessary to ensure compliance with the location and zoning requirements of such businesses. The Board\nof Commissioners also recognizes that adult uses in other communities have been used for unlawful sexual\nactivities, including prostitution, and sexual encounters of a casual nature. The concern over sexually\ntransmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of the County.

The conditional zoning district included herein allows for the consideration of certain uses that,\nbecause of their nature or scale, have particular impacts on both the immediate area and the community as a\nwhole and are created or established for selected criteria as indicated in the applicability section below. The\ndevelopment of these uses cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district regulations. In addition,\ncircumstances arise when a general zoning district designation would not be appropriate for certain property,\nbut specific uses permitted under the district would be consistent with the objectives of this section. To\naccommodate those situations, this section establishes the conditional zoning district process. A conditional\nzoning district is not intended for securing speculative zoning for a proposal but rather is based on a firm\ndevelopment proposal.\n(B)\nApplicability. Conditional zoning districts may be appropriate when a planned development districts\n(PD) are proposed.\n(C)\nApplication. Except as provided herein, petitions to establish a conditional zoning district must be\nsubmitted and will be processed in accordance with the provisions in this Chapter. Petitioning for a conditional\nzoning district is a voluntary procedure and can be initiated only by the owner(s) of the property(ies) in question\nor by his/her authorized agent. Applications shall be submitted on a form provided by the County.\n(D)\nApplication Contents. All applications must include a master plan and supporting text that, as approved,\nwill become part of the ordinance amendment. The plan must include any supporting information and text that\nspecifies the actual use(s) intended for the property and any rules, regulations and conditions that in addition to\nall predetermined ordinance requirements, will govern the development and use of the property. At a minimum,\nthe applicant shall follow the guidelines as set forth in Section $154.158.\n(E)\nAdditional Information. When dealing with the conditional zoning district process, it may be desirable to\nrequest additional information in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding area.\nTherefore, the Planning Director, Planning and Zoning Commission and/or Board of Commissioners may\nrequest additional information in addition to that required above, as they deem necessary.\n(F)\nReview. In evaluating an application for the establishment of a conditional zoning district, it is\nappropriate for the Planning and Zoning Commission and Board of Commissioners to consider the following:\n(1)\nAdherence to the general policies and objectives of the adopted land use plan, particularly in\n109\n"}, {"page": "110", "text": "relation to the proposed site and surrounding area;\n(2)\nThe potential impacts on the surrounding area, including but not limited to the absolute certainty\nof the specific use(s), traffic, stormwater, land values and the compatibility of land use activities.\nHigher standards and conditions may be proposed for the development and other community\nbenefits, mutually agreed upon by the developer and County.

Any such conditions shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the\ndevelopment plan and use of the site to county ordinances and an officially adopted comprehensive plan or\nother plan and those that address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of\nthe site. For example, conditions that relate to the relationship of the proposed uses to the surrounding property,\nproposed support facilities, screening and landscaping, phasing of development, street and right-of-way\nimprovements, water and sewer improvements, provisions of open space and other matters that the boards may\nfind appropriate or the petitioner may propose. The petitioner shall have a reasonable opportunity to consider\nand respond to any such conditions prior to final action by the Board of Commissioners. Only those conditions\nmutually agreed upon by the Board of Commissioners and the applicant, with input from the public, may be\nincorporated into the conditional zoning district.\n(H)\nEffect of Approval.
