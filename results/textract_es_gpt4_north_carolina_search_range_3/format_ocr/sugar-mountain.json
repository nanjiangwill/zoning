IX \u00a7 909)\n\u00a7 154.110 ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN STANDARDS.\nThese standards shall apply to all new construction, expansions and/or additions of 50% of the gross floor area of existing\nbuildings, or changes to exterior building facades for multi-family and nonresidential development. Any regulation relating to\nbuilding design elements adopted under this section may not be applied to any structures subject to regulation under the\nNorth Carolina Residential Code for One-and Two-Family Dwellings (see G.S. \u00a7 160D-702(b)).\n(A) Site aspects.\n(1) Relationship of a building to its site.\n(a) Building design shall be fitted to the natural contours of the site. Natural features of the site, such as rock\noutcroppings or natural drainage ways shall be preserved.\n(b) On wooded sites, buildings shall be carefully situated to take advantage of the shade and energy conservation\nprovided by the trees.\n(c) The impression of buildings tucked into, rather than superimposed on, the natural landscape shall be created.\n(d) The view of the building from the street and surrounding areas shall be as important as the view available to the\nbuildings occupants.\n(e) Buildings shall be located according to the natural characteristics of the site. In hilly terrain, clustering of buildings\nis encouraged as a strategy to avoid destroying sensitive natural areas.\n(f) Buildings shall be designed to harmonize with the existing topography, thereby minimizing land disruption.\n(g) Grading shall be held to a minimum and should complement natural landforms (such as, smooth gradations or\nterracing).\n(h) Use of retaining walls that retain more than five in height of earth within a linear 50-foot distance is required to be\ndesigned by a state registered engineer.\n(2) Relationships of the project to adjoining area.\n(a) Building projects shall not be designed as isolated units, but instead shall reflect the context of the adjoining\nproperties.\n(b) Grading shall blend gently with contours of adjacent properties.\n(c) Buildings at the ends of streets, or at street corners, shall serve as visual terminals serving to both unify and\nconclude the architectural statement made on the street.\n(d) Proposed recreation areas or uses shall complement nearby existing uses. The extension of existing parks or\nrecreation areas into a proposed development is a highly desirable design feature.\n(e) Buildings or projects located near or adjacent to a greenway shall provide safe and efficient pedestrian connection\nto that greenway, and also to adjacent properties that might include pedestrian systems in the future.\n(f) Buffer zones shall separate and protect the greenway, while at the same time connect it to the building site.\n(g) Natural drainage patterns shall be preserved where possible. Changing the natural drainage areas will affect the\ndrainage onto adjoining areas.\n(h) Innovative building and site design can capitalize on natural drainage ways and transform steep slopes into major\nsite amenities.\n(i) Design shall insure that drainage occurs only in areas designed to serve a drainage function. Storm water should\nnot flow over sidewalks, paths or streets.\n(3) Streetscape.\n(a) Scale is a major factor in creating a sense of community and a sense of place.\n"}, {"page": "34", "text": "(b) The ratio between the width of the street corridor (as measured between opposing building facades) and the\nheight of the walls of that corridor (the foundation-to-eaves dimension) plays an important role in creating a human scale in\nthe streetscape. If the width exceeds the height more than four times, the sense of the enclosure is diminished.\n(c) The village shall be focused on people rather than on vehicles. Streets shall be connections not separations.\n(d) Reference Illustration A for explanation of zones and transition areas that shall be addressed in the design of new\nstreets.\n(4) Streets.\n(a) Difficult topography shall be avoided when locating and designing roads. For instance, roads are best placed\nalong the contours of a site if the site is hilly or steep. This minimizes fuel consumption and noise in automobiles and\nprovides a more comfortable access for pedestrians and bicycle riders. Consideration shall also be given to fire protection\nand emergency vehicles in order to facilitate access to any structure in case of any emergency.\n(b) Roadways shall focus attention on interesting views and should not interfere with natural drainage patterns.\n(c) The site plan should incorporate a hierarchy of roadways and walkways that provide for safe, smooth and pleasant\nmovement of people and vehicles. Special attention shall be paid to points and which pedestrian, bicycle, and automobile\nmovements are in conflict. Clearly marked crosswalks or routing of pedestrian paths away from main automobile traffic\nareas can reduce hazards in these areas.\n(d) Whenever there is a design choice between access from the development to a street of a higher classification and\naccess to a street or a lower classification, access should be to the street of lower classification.\n(e) On large streets, landscaped median islands are encouraged and crosswalks shall be included.\n(f) Trees, shrubs and other plants shall be planted along the streets in accordance to the setbacks established.\n(5) Sidewalks.\n(a) Building sites shall accommodate pedestrians and shall be centered around pedestrian traffic rather than vehicular\ntraffic.\n(b) Access must be safe and convenient within a site. Sidewalks must be clearly separated from driving areas and\nmust connect buildings to each other, to parking areas and to adjacent pedestrian paths.\n(c) Handicapped accessibility along walkways at street/driveway intersections shall be provided whenever possible,\nper North Carolina Building Code specifications.\n(d) Sidewalk construction standards (including curb and gutter) shall follow the North Carolina Department of\nTransportation subdivision roads minimum construction standards.\n(e) Walkways or sidewalks shall be provided along all public streets for commercial developments. Where\nintersections occur, pedestrian walkways shall be clearly marked with paint or contrasting surface material.\n(f) The separation of sidewalks from the roadway for pedestrians' safety will be achieved by:\n1. Curbside planting strips;\n2. Depressing or raising the walkway in relation to street level; and\n3. Providing parking adjacent to the walkway (on-street parking) as an additional barrier.\n(g) Especially around areas with interesting natural contours.\n(h) Major commercial developments shall include a system for internal pedestrian movement. These internal\nwalkways shall also be linked with the village walkways, particularly to greenways and park.\n(6) Bicycles.\n(a) Bike lanes or sufficient room on the streets for bicyclists are very desirable. However, bike lanes do not have to\nparallel the street. Like sidewalks or walkways, they should follow natural patterns.\n(b) Businesses and organizations should recognize the needs of cyclists who may bicycle to work. These cyclists\nneed convenient use of a bicycle rack.\n(B) Building design. The following elements of building design shall be incorporated in new construction and renovations\nas noted in this section.\n(1) Scale. Scale and proportion should reflect local traditions of mountain buildings. They should be oriented to the\ncharacteristic, simple residential buildings of the village. Texture of roof and wall finishes shall provide a scale or reference\npoint for the pedestrian in proximity to the structure. In the R-3, C-B, M-U, and R-C Districts, where structures already exist\non a subject property, the maximum wall height of any new structure connected to existing structures shall not exceed the\nhighest wall of the existing structure.\n(a) Allowed:\n"}, {"page": "35", "text": "1. Thirty-five feet height maximum from average natural slope to roof; existing contours shall be provided on the plat\nor site plans as part of the zoning permit application.

T1-11 siding (plywood);\n10. Split face block; and\n11. Non-ASTM approved cement board.\n(3) Roofs. Roofs are a major visible element and shall be compatible with both buildings and neighboring buildings\narchitectural style. Similarities in roof type create a visual continuity in the streetscape and neighborhood. Roof shape, color\nand texture should be coordinated with the treatment of the buildings perimeter walls. Roofs with more than one place, and\ncontaining dormers, add variety to a building and break-up its size.\n(a) Allowed:\n1. Any pitched room must be 6/12 to 12/12 slope;\n2. Large overhangs (minimum one foot);\n3. Fascia eight inches minimum and/or exposed rater tails;\n4. Gable or hip roofs;\n5.

Very steep slopes (over 12/12);\n5. Overhangs less than one foot;\n6. Brightly colored and unnatural looking roof material;\n7. Roll felt roofing; and\n8. Corrugated plastic sheet material.\n(4) Windows. Windows are the most important architectural element to unify a facade. They reflect the character of a\nbuilding. However, windows not only add to the aesthetics of a building but also have to provide light and ventilation.\n(a) Allowed:\n1. Traditional shapes (forms of square, arches or rectangle);\n2. Forms of residential scale;\n3. Multi-pane windows (use of muntins to divide glass into unified sections);\n"}, {"page": "37", "text": "4. Vertical windows;\n5.

The regulations of this section are intended to reduce tree canopy loss and implement urban forest\nimprovements through requirements for tree protection, tree preservation, and planting or replanting of trees, and the\nmaintenance of existing trees within the village. The tree preservation requirements are intended to enhance the quality of\nlife through sustainable urban forest practices and increase benefits that trees provide, including, but not limited to the\nfollowing:\n(1) Preservation, protection and enhancement of the natural environment;\n(2) Provision of habitat for wildlife;\n(3) Maintenance and improvement of the village appearance and aesthetics;\n(4) Improvement of storm water runoff;\n(5) Screening of noise, dust and glare;\n(6) Provision of shade for cooling;\n(7) Reduction of soil erosion and the increase of rainwater infiltration; and\n(8) Absorption of carbon dioxide and returning oxygen.\n(B) Administration. To carry out the provisions of the section, the Zoning Administrator shall have the responsibility and\ncontrol over all trees and shrubbery planted or growing in or upon village property.\n(C) Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates\nor requires a different meaning.\nDIAMETER AT BREAST-HEIGHT (DBH). A tree trunk diameter measured in inches at a height of four and one-half feet\nabove the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below four and one- half feet, then each trunk is measured as a\nseparate tree. A tree that splits into multiple trunks above four and one-half feet is measured as a single tree at four and one-\nhalf feet. Diameter can be determined by dividing the circumference of the tree trunk at four and one half feet above the\nground by 3.14.\nHISTORIC TREE. A tree with a diameter at breast height (DBH) of 24 inches or greater. Every effort should be made to\nretain healthy historic trees.\nPROTECTED TREE. A live tree measuring in excess of six inches in diameter at four and one-half feet above ground.\nREMOVAL OF TREES. Any intentional or negligent act that shall cause a tree to decline and die, including but not\nlimited to:\n(1) Pruning;\n(2) Cutting; and\n(3) Damage inflicted upon the root system of a tree by application of a toxic substance, operation of machinery, change\nof natural grade by excavation or filling about the root system or around the trunk of a tree, or injury by fire that result in or\npermit pest infestation.\nSIGNIFICANT TREE. A tree with a DBH of six inches or greater.\nTREE REMOVAL/PRUNING PERMIT. A permit for tree removal and/or pruning issued under the provision of this\nsection.\n(D) Tree protection requirements.\n(1) Jurisdiction. The regulations set forth in this section shall apply to all real property within the village limits and extra\nterritorial jurisdiction, subject to the following exceptions: utility companies, electric suppliers, and governmental agencies in\nthe course of construction or maintaining easements for water, sewer, electricity, gas, drainage, telephone or television\ntransmissions, or rights-of-way.\n(2) Tree removal prohibited. No person firm, organization, society, association, corporation, or any agent or\nrepresentative thereof shall directly or indirectly destroy or remove any trees in excess of six inches DBH within any zoning\ndistrict without permission under the provisions of this section.\n"}, {"page": "40", "text": "(3) Application and scope. The process for applying the tree protection of this section shall be as follows:\n(a) All personas desiring to prune, crop, scale or shape a protected tree(s) shall apply for a tree removal/pruning\npermit through the Zoning Administrator. Tree limbs of three inches or less in diameter may be pruned without a permit.\n(b) The Zoning Administrator or his or her designee may issue and approve a tree removal/pruning permit.\n(c) Lots that contain a majority of trees less than six inches DBH shall not be clear-cut. No more than 50% of the\nnatural vegetation, equally balanced on the lot, can be cut regardless of the size of the vegetation. The Zoning Administrator\nshall base approval on the criteria listed in this subchapter.\n(d) Trees shall not be topped. However, limbs may be removed for improving views as long as the health of the tree\nis not damaged. Detrimental trimming is prohibited. Property owners are encouraged to use an ISA certified arborist to\nprune and remove trees and utilize the drop/crotch pruning technique.\n(e) Public property trees: In determining whether a permit shall be issued for the cutting of trees on public property,\nthe Zoning Administrator shall consider the following:\n1. The condition of the tree with respect to disease, danger of falling, proximity to existing or proposed structures\nand interference with utility services.\n2. The necessity to remove trees in order to construct proposed improvements to allow economic development of\nproperty adjacent to public property.\n3. The topography of land and the effect of tree removal on erosion, soil retention, and the diversion or increased\nflow of surface waters, and coordination with the village's drainage patterns.\n4. The effects of tree removal regarding property values in the area.\n(E) General standards for removal and retention. It is the desire of the village to preserve all existing trees to the greatest\nextent possible. Permits for removal of protected trees may be approved and issued where one or more of the following\nconditions are found to exist:\n(1) Said trees are within ten feet of an area designated for the construction of an approved primary or accessory\nstructure on a lot, including designated walkways, driveways and parking area;\n(2) Said trees are within five feet of an approved septic tank or septic drain field;\n(3) Said trees pose a hazard to the property owner, adjacent property, utility lines or public health and safety;\n(4) Selective cutting of said trees, observing property trunk spacing in accordance with best managements practices,\npromotes the growth and development of other trees on the lot;\n(5) Said trees are diseased or damaged; or\n(6) Removal of said tree(s) is the only reasonable means by which building, zoning, subdivisions, healthy, public safety\nor other village requirements can be met.\n(F) General considerations.\n(1) Emergency conditions. In the event that any tree shall be determined to be an imminent hazard or danger to the\npublic health, safety, or general welfare by the Zoning Administrator or his/her designee, that tree can be removed\nregardless of the size of the tree.\n(2) Violations.\n(a) Defined.\n1. Lacking a valid tree removal/pruning permit, any intentional or negligent act resulting in the death of a protected\ntree, including but not limited to those defined in this section.\n2. Lacking a valid tree removal/pruning permit, the pruning of any protected tree, except as allowed under the\nprovisions of this section.\n3. All waste from tree removal and/or tree pruning activities that accumulate on public property shall be removed at\nthe end of each day of tree removal or pruning. All waste from tree removal and/or tree pruning activities that accumulate on\nprivate property shall be removed within three working days after the day of completion if the work has been contracted out.\nIf the homeowner does the removal/pruning, they must remove the debris or put the debris in a place accessible by the\nvillage and the village will remove no more than one truckload. Additional truck loads will be removed at a cost of $75 per\nload. The homeowner must notify the town within three days. Failure to comply with these stipulations shall constitute a\nviolation.\n(b) Actions. If violations are noted during the course of a project or at final inspection, the Zoning Administrator may\ntake appropriate actions including, but not limited to:\n1. Requiring replacement of illegally removed trees with trees no smaller than six feet high and of the same type\n(evergreen or deciduous) as the trees removed.\n"}, {"page": "41", "text": "2. Replacement of protected trees that are damaged, dying or dead with trees no smaller than six feet high and of\nthe same type (evergreen or deciduous) as the trees damaged.\n3. Remedial actions to protect trees during construction.\n(G) Penalties defined. Pursuant to G.S. \u00a7 160A-175(b), a violation of any provision of this section shall subject the\noffender to a civil penalty in the amount of $500 per tree to be recovered by the village. Violators shall be issued a written\ncitation, which must be paid within ten days after receipt of the written citation. If the violator does not pay the penalty within\nten days after receipt of the written citation, the village may recover such penalty in a civil action in the nature of a debt. In\naddition, trees removed without approval are subject to a requirement that they shall be replaced with two six-foot tall, two-\ninch in caliper trees for each tree illegally cut. Such replacement trees shall include but not be limited to the following list:\n(H) Enforcement. In the case of a tree removal/pruning permit issued for a new construction site, the Zoning\nAdministrator, prior to the issuing of a certificate of zoning compliance, shall ensure the inspection of the site to determine if\nall not-to-be removed, protected trees are still standing and healthy. If such is not the case, the certificate of zoning\ncompliance will not be issued until appropriate enforcement of this section has taken place.\n(I) Upon the issuance of a notice of violation or citation, the Village Manager may suspend any other permits or\napprovals issued to the violator, including the issuance of a stop-work order, until such time as the violation is cured and any\ncivil penalty paid. An active appeal of the violation to the appropriate village authority shall operate as a stay of the\nsuspension of the permits and approvals, unless the Village Manager determines that allowing the work to continue would\nconstitute a danger to health, life, safety, or property.\n(J) In the event there is an outstanding penalty amount or unresolved violation of this chapter, the village may require the\nviolation to be remedied as a condition for the issuance of any subsequent permit or approval.\n(Ord. 2018-2, passed 12-18-2018; Res.

Further, such a licensing procedure will place a\nheretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent\nwith the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the village. It is appropriate to\nrequire reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession\nand control of the premises and activities occurring therein.\n(n) Prohibition of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a\nsubstantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres.\n(o) Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain\npast employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of\npotential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments.\n(p) The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and\nmaintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant\ngovernmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.\n(q) It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information\nregarding employees who may engage in the conduct which this section is designed to prevent or who are likely to be\nwitnesses to such activity.\n(r) The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the\nrational concern that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this section.\n(s) The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to\nand prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.\n(t) The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the village will be promoted by the enactment of\nthis section.\n(B) Definitions.\nADULT ARCADE.
