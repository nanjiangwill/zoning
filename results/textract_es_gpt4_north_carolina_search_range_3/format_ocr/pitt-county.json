NCGS 160D-701 requires that \"zoning regulations shall be made\nin accordance with a comprehensive plan and shall be designed to promote health, safety, and general\nwelfare, and \"may address, among other things, the following public purposes: to provide adequate light\nand air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to lessen\ncongestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers; to facilitate the adequate\nprovision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public requirements; and to\npromote the health, safety, morals, or the general welfare of the community\". The regulations shall be\nmade with reasonable consideration as to, among other things, the character of the district and its\npeculiar suitability for particular uses, and with a view to conserving the value of buildings and\nencouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the planning and development regulation\njurisdiction of the County.\nAuthority\nNCGS 160D-702 establishes the basic authority for local government zoning. NCGS 160D-903 states\nthat property used for bona fide farm purposes is specifically exempted from zoning regulations. Bona\nfide farm purposes include the production and activities relating or incidental to the production of crops,\nfruits, vegetables, ornamental and flowering plants, dairy, livestock, poultry, and all other forms of\nagricultural products having a domestic or foreign market. This Statute also makes clear that the use of\nfarm property for nonfarm purposes is not exempt from zoning regulations.\nTerritorial Applicability\nThe Pitt County Zoning Ordinance is applicable to all properties within Pitt County not located in a\nmunicipal zoning jurisdiction.\nRelationship to the Land Use Plan\nWhen adopting or rejecting any zoning text or map amendment, NCGS 160D-605 requires the Board of\nCommissioners to consider existing county planning policies and the recommendations of existing plans.\nThe Board shall adopt brief statements describing whether its action is consistent or inconsistent with an\nadopted plan, and explain the reasonableness of the proposed rezoning. If an amendment is adopted\nand the action was deemed to be inconsistent with the adopted plan, the zoning amendment shall have\nthe effect of also amending any future land use map in the approved plan and shall not require any\nadditional request or application for a plan amendment.\nADMINISTRATION\nBoard of County Commissioners\nThe NCGS authorize the Board of Commissioners to adopt and amend a Zoning Ordinance.\nPlanning Board Advisory Committees\nWhile the appointment of advisory committees to assist the Planning Board is not the current practice,\nthis language provides the option for the establishment of such committees in the future.\nComposition of Board of Adjustment\nNCGS 160D-302 requires that a Board of Adjustment consist of at least five members, each to be\nappointed for three years (except for initial terms). All Board members must reside within Pitt County, with\nthree members residing south of the Tar River and two from the north. The alternate members may\nreside anywhere within Pitt County. NCGS 160D-302 also provides that the County may designate the\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 2 of 250\n"}, {"page": "3", "text": "Planning Board or Board of Commissioners to perform any or all of the duties of a Board of Adjustment in\naddition to its other duties. This Ordinance establishes a separate Board of Adjustment, however, the\nmembers of the Board of Adjustment may be appointed from the membership of the Planning Board.\nTerms of Board of Adjustment Members\nNCGS 160D-302 provides that the Board of Commissioners may appoint alternate members to the Board\nof Adjustment to serve in the absence of regular members. Alternate members shall be appointed for the\nsame term, and in the same manner as regular members. While serving on behalf of any regular\nmember, alternates have all the same powers and duties of a regular member.\nBoard of Adjustment Voting\nNCGS 160D-401(i) requires that a four-fifths vote of the Board of Adjustment membership is necessary to\ngrant a variance. A majority of the members will be required to decide any other quasi-judicial matter or to\ndetermine an appeal made in the nature of certiorari. Vacant positions on the Board and members who\nare disqualified from voting shall not be considered members of the Board for calculation of the requisite\nmajority if there are no qualified alternates available to take their place.\nPERMITS AND HEARING PROCEDURES\nPermit Required\nNCGS 160D-705(c) provides that the Board of Commissioners or the Board of Adjustment may issue\nspecial use permits in accordance with principles, conditions, safeguards, and procedures specified in the\nOrdinance and may impose reasonable and appropriate conditions and safeguards upon such permits.\nThe Board of Adjustment shall consider special use permits for those uses that require meeting specified\nconditions for approval. The overwhelming majority of uses are allowed by zoning permit, which are\nreviewed and approved by the Planning Department staff. As proposed, the Board of Commissioners\nhas\nresponsibility for the review and approval of 17 uses requiring a Conditional Zoning District, the Board of\nAdjustment reviews and approves 11 uses requiring a special use permit, and the Planning Department\nstaff reviews and approves 370 uses requiring a zoning permit and specific development standards. The\nissuance of zoning permits is coordinated and consolidated with the County's building permit issuance\nprocess.\nPlot Plan and Site Plan Procedures\nPlot plans are required for all single-family dwellings, including manufactured homes, and duplex\ndwellings. Site plans are required for all other uses. The specific data needed for plot plans and site\nplans is delineated in Appendix B. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to waive the requirement for a\nsite plan or a plot plan if it is determined that a site plan or plot plan is unnecessary to complete the\nreview of a permit application.\nEvidentiary Hearing Requirements and Procedures\nNCGS 160D-406 states that notice of evidentiary hearings conducted pursuant to this section shall be\nmailed to the person or entity whose appeal, application, or request is the subject of the hearing; to the\nowner of the property that is the subject of the hearing if the owner did not initiate the hearing; and to any\nother persons entitled to receive notice as provided by this Ordinance. In the absence of evidence to the\ncontrary, the county may rely on the county tax listing to determine owners of property entitled to mailed\nnotice. Hearing notices are also subject to the requirements of Section 13 (H).\nThe hearing for reviewing requests for special use permits, variances, and appeals is an evidentiary\nhearing and is conducted in a different manner than a legislative hearing (such as to adopt or amend a\nzoning ordinance or zoning map). Evidentiary hearings are conducted using quasi-judicial procedures.\nThe purpose of an evidentiary hearing is to gather relevant facts and evidence prior to consideration by\nthe Board of Adjustment or Board of Commissioners. Consequently, restrictions on what can be heard\nand how it can be heard are applied to these hearings. Procedural rules for conducting hearings are\ndelineated in NCGS 160D-705.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 3 of 250\n"}, {"page": "4", "text": "Action on Special Use Permits\nNCGS 160D-302 requires that any board assigned decision-making authority to approve or deny special\nuse permits shall follow the procedures for Boards of Adjustment except that only a majority vote is\nneeded to approve the permit. Every decision of the Board of Adjustment regarding special use permits is\nsubject to appeal to the Superior Court.\nZoning Vested Rights\nNCGS 160D-108 mandates the provisions of vested rights. This Subsection is consistent with this\nStatute. A property owner may formally petition for a vested right and, after approval of a site-specific\nvesting plan by the Board of Commissioners, a vested right is granted for a specific period of time based\nupon the type of development.\nZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP\nConventional Zoning Districts\nEleven conventional zoning districts are provided. These districts include 5 residential districts, 3 commer-\ncial districts, 1 office and institutional district, and 2 industrial districts. The format of the Zoning Ordinance\nis conducive to adding other zoning districts if needed. NCGS 160D-703 mandates that regulations and\nrequirements must be uniform for each class or kind of building throughout each conventional zoning\ndistrict but the regulations in one zoning district may differ from those in other districts. The majority of\nproperty within the County is zoned as RA, Rural Agricultural. The RA District is primarily intended to\naccommodate very low-density residential uses as well as associated public and institutional uses, low\nintensity commercial uses, and agricultural-related industrial uses which are interspersed throughout\nareas that are principally characterized as rural in nature. This district reflects the diverse nature of land\nuses within predominantly rural areas and, therefore, permits a wide array of land uses. The remaining\nproposed conventional zoning districts include:\nSome of the zoning districts that are established in the Zoning Ordinance may not be utilized (i.e., shown\non the official zoning map) until some future date when the need for that particular district classification\narises.\nConditional Zoning Districts\nNCGS 160D-703 authorizes the County to establish conditional zoning districts. Within this type of district,\nuses are permitted only upon the establishment of a conditional zoning district for a particular use. Prop-\nerty may be rezoned to a conditional zoning district upon the request of the property owner. Several\nspecific uses that involve large expenditures of County funds (i.e., utilities, public buildings) or land uses\nthat may have significant impacts on surrounding properties and residents, such as solar farms, mining\noperations, prisons, etc. may be permitted only within a conditional zoning district. These specific uses\nare designated as such in Table 5-1, Table of Permitted Uses. Conditions and site-specific standards\nthat are imposed in a conditional zoning district are limited to those that address conformance with this\nOrdinance or officially adopted plans, or to address the impacts normally expected to be generated by the\ndevelopment or use of the site. Section 14(G) provides detail as to the procedures for authorizing\nconditional zoning districts.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 4 of 250\nCELL (1, 1): \nRR\nCELL (1, 2): \nRural Residential\nCELL (2, 1): \nR40\nCELL (2, 2): \nLow Density Residential\nCELL (3, 1): \nSR\nCELL (3, 2): \nSuburban Residential\nCELL (4, 1): \nMFR\nCELL (4, 2): \nMultifamily Residential\nCELL (5, 1): \nRC\nCELL (5, 2): \nRural Commercial\nCELL (6, 1): \nOI\nCELL (6, 2): \nOffice and Institutional\nCELL (7, 1): \nGC\nCELL (7, 2): \nGeneral Commercial\nCELL (8, 1): \nHC\nCELL (8, 2): \nHeavy Commercial\nCELL (9, 1): \nGI\nCELL (9, 2): \nGeneral Industrial\nCELL (10, 1): \nLI\nCELL (10, 2): \nLight Industrial\n"}, {"page": "5", "text": "Overlay Zoning Districts\nNCGS 160D-703 authorizes the County to establish overlay districts. In overlay districts, different\nrequirements are imposed on certain types of properties within one or more underlying conventional or\nconditional zoning districts. Overlay districts established by this Ordinance include the following; AH,\nAirport Height Overlay District; WCA and WPA, Water Supply Watershed Overlay Districts; HC, Highway\nCorridor Overlay District; SWB, Southwest Bypass Highway Corridor; and FH, Flood Hazard Overlay\nDistrict. Specific regulations for the overlay districts are delineated in Section 7. The water supply\nwatershed regulations contained in the Zoning Ordinance replaced a previous, freestanding County\nOrdinance dealing with watershed protection (Water Supply Watershed Protection Ordinance, Planning &\nDevelopment Services Ordinance No. 13). The Flood Hazard Regulations contained in the Zoning\nOrdinance are a supplement to those regulations found in the Pitt County Flood Damage Prevention\nOrdinance (Planning & Development Services Ordinance No. 4).\nPERMITTED USES\nFor the most part, the County can determine, at its own discretion, what land uses are most appropriate\nfor the different zoning districts that it establishes. However, several caveats apply. Bona fide farm uses\nare specifically exempt from County Zoning by NCGS 160D-903 (see also the commentary under\n\"Authority\" herein.) Other statutory and constitutional limitations on zoning dictate how the County can\nregulate certain land uses, such as cell towers, signage, sexually-oriented businesses, etc.\nTable 5-1 Table of Permitted Uses\nA detailed Table of Permitted Uses identifies the land uses that are permitted within the various zoning\ndistricts. The Table uses the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) coding system, where applicable, to\nidentify specific uses. The Table is organized by major land use categories: Agricultural-Related Uses;\nMining Uses; Residential Uses; Accessory Uses and Structures; Recreational Uses; Educational and\nInstitutional Uses; Business, Professional and Personal Services; Retail Trade; Wholesale Trade;\nTransportation, Warehousing and Utilities; Manufacturing and Industrial Uses; and Other Uses. A letter\ncode in the table ('Z', 'D', 'S', 'CD', or 'E') identifies if the use is (1) allowed with a Zoning Permit ('Z')\nissued by the Zoning Administrator, (2) allowed with a Zoning Permit issued by the Zoning Administrator\nprovided that specified development standards ('D', see Section 8) are complied with, (3) allowed with a\nSpecial Use Permit ('S') issued by the Board of Adjustment, (4) allowed only in a Conditional Zoning\nDistrict ('CD') that requires a legislative hearing by the Board of Commissioners, or (5) an exempt ('E')\nuse. A blank space in the Table indicates that the use is not permitted. Guidelines for utilizing the Table\nof Permitted Uses are provided in Section 5(A)(2). Permissible uses that do not require a permit (such as\nroads, electric power lines, water and sewer lines, etc.) are specifically identified in Section 3(C). Uses\nspecifically prohibited in watershed overlay and flood hazard overlay districts are delineated in Section\n5(G).\nDENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REQUIREMENTS\nTable 6-1 Table of Density and Dimensional Requirements\nThis table outlines the basic minimum lot area, lot width, and building setback requirements for all zoning\ndistricts. Maximum density and built-upon area requirements for properties located with public water\nsupply watersheds are delineated in Section 7(A).\nCluster Development\nProvisions allowing for smaller lot sizes and the reservation of open space are provided. With cluster\ndevelopment, flexibility in sizing lots and setbacks is allowed but there is no overall increase in density for\nthe development.\nZero Side Setback\nProvides, under specified conditions, for the flexibility of developing lots with a zero side setback.\nAccessory Uses, Buildings and Structures\nIncludes provisions for setback requirements based upon the size of the accessory building; limits home\noccupations to 25 percent of the floor area of the residential dwelling.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 5 of 250\n"}, {"page": "6", "text": "Encroachments into Required Setbacks\nProvides detail as to the types of permissible encroachments into setback areas.\nGeneral Lot Requirements\nRequires that every building constructed be located on a buildable lot and that, in general, there be no\nmore than one principal residential structure and its accessory buildings on a lot. Exceptions to this\nrequirement are outlined in Section 6(D)(1). Section 6(D)(2) provides detail on the various types of road\naccess allowed for nontraditional developments.\nSpecial Purpose Lots\nAllows special, nontraditional building lots (example: a lot for a sewer lift station or a lot for a church\ncemetery) that are not required to meet the standard lot area, width, setback, etc. requirements.\nPlanned Development\nPlanned developments allow the mixture of residential and commercial uses in a single, planned\ndevelopment. This section also provides for the reduction of individual lot sizes but the overall residential\ndensity does not exceed that permitted for the underlying zoning district. Section 8(CCC) also provides\nadditional standards for planned developments.\nOVERLAY DISTRICTS PROVISIONS AND SPECIAL PURPOSE REGULATIONS\nOverlay regulations have been specifically developed for flood hazard areas, public water supply\nwatersheds, airport hazard areas, and designated highway corridors. The regulations in this Section are\nin addition to the requirements for the underlying conventional zoning district.\nWatershed Protection Overlay District Regulations\nThe standards in this Section parallel the regulations in the previous Water Supply Watershed Protection\nOrdinance, Planning & Development Services Ordinance No. 13 which was repealed upon adoption of\nthe zoning ordinance. Watershed protection regulations are mandated by state law.\nFlood Hazard District Overlay Requirements\nThe provisions in this Section are required to maintain the County's eligibility in the federal flood insur-\nance program and are based upon the latest FEMA model ordinance. The regulations in this Section are\na supplement to those regulations found in the Pitt County Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance. NCGS\n160D-105 states that development regulations such as this Ordinance may reference or incorporate by\nreference flood insurance rate maps, watershed boundary maps, or other maps officially adopted\nor\npromulgated by state and federal agencies. For these maps, a regulation text or zoning map may\nreference a specifically adopted map or may incorporate by reference the most recently adopted version\nof such maps.\nAirport Height Overlay Requirements\nThe standards in this Section have been coordinated with Chapter 3, Airport Zoning, of the Greenville City\nCode. The standards primarily address height obstructions that could pose a hazard to normal airport\noperations and are based upon the FAA model airport zoning ordinance.\nHighway Corridor Overlay Requirements\nThis Section provides specific developmental standards that would be applicable only to a designated\nhighway corridor overlay. The purpose of these requirements is to provide specific appearance and\nvehicular access control measures to any anticipated high-profile development area within the Pitt County\nzoning jurisdiction. NC Highway 11 North and US Highway 264 have been designated as highways that\nare subject to the Highway Corridor Overlay requirements. Any overlay district that is identified in the\nfuture would be delineated on the official zoning map.\nSouthwest Bypass Highway Corridor Overlay Requirements\nThis Section provides specific developmental standards that are applicable only to the Southwest Bypass\nHighway Corridor. The purpose of these requirements is to provide enhanced landscaping, viewshed\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 6 of 250\n"}, {"page": "7", "text": "protection, specific development standards and vehicular access control measures for development\nwithin the Southwest Bypass Highway Corridor as delineated on the official zoning map.\nProtection of Riparian Buffers\nThis Section cross references the riparian buffer requirements for the Tar-Pamlico and Neuse River\nBasins as set out in 15A NCAC 2B.0259.\nDEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR INDIVIDUAL USES\nSection 8 delineates specific standards and requirements for those uses listed in Table 5-1, Table of\nPermitted Uses, that are designated with a 'D', 'S' (Special Use Permit), or 'CD' (Conditional Zoning\nDistrict). The standards listed in this Section are applicable only if the use is so designated in Table 5-1.\nFor example, a bed and breakfast inn proposed to be located in a RA, RR, R40, SR, or MFR zoning\ndistrict would be required to adhere to the standards of Section 8(K). However, if the bed and breakfast\ninn is proposed to be located within a GC zoning district, the standards in Section 8(K) would not have to\nbe met. The main purpose of this Section is to ensure that certain uses, proposed to be located in\nspecified zoning districts, are as compatible as possible with surrounding land uses and the general type\nof development that is anticipated in the general area of the proposed use. Development standards\ndelineated in Section 8 often address such requirements as minimum and maximum lot area, property\nseparation, vehicular access, off-site environmental (noise, dust, odors, etc.) impacts, security fencing,\noutdoor storage, hours of operation, screening, and signage.\nSIGNS\nDefinitions and standards pertaining to signs are provided in Section 9. Exempt signs and signs, which\nare prohibited, are specifically noted. Any sign that is 4 square feet or less in area is exempt from permit\nand fee requirements.\nBillboards are required to comply with the regulations of the existing Outdoor Advertising Signs\nOrdinance, Planning & Development Services Ordinance No. 7, of the Pitt County Code. Billboards\nlocated within 660 feet of interstate or federally-assisted primary highways are also subject to the\nstandards and permitting requirements of the Outdoor Advertising Control Act which is administered by\nthe North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT). The Outdoor Advertising Control Act\nessentially allows billboards in areas that are zoned for commercial or industrial use or in unzoned areas\nthat meet certain criteria specified in the Act. Local governments are required to notify, in writing, the\nNCDOT of all zoning changes regarding the establishment or revision of commercial and industrial zoning\ndistricts in areas regulated by the Outdoor Advertising Control Act. A recent Federal Highway\nAdministration (FHWA) ruling regarding a North Carolina town's zoning action resulted in the withholding\nof federal-aid highway funds. In that decision, the FHWA determined that a rezoning that was undertaken\nfor the express purpose of allowing the construction of outdoor advertising signs was not consistent with\nfederal regulations. The FHWA ruled that the NCDOT could not use Federal-aid highway funds in any\nproject located within the town's zoning jurisdiction.\nThere are limitations imposed on zoning restrictions by the United States Constitution that affect sign\nregulations. Sign regulations must be particularly careful not to unreasonably infringe on a person's\nfreedom of speech. The courts have, however, allowed more substantial restrictions on 'commercial\nspeech' such as advertisements and signs as opposed to political or other types of speech.\nThe sign standards delineated in Section 9 are very minimal requirements.\nOFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING\nStandards for parking, stacking, and loading are provided in Section 10. Table 10-1 lists the minimum\nnumber of parking and stacking spaces required by major use categories. Administrative guidelines for\ndetermining parking requirements for change in use, shared parking, and deviations are outlined in this\nsection. Property line landscaping is required for nonresidential land uses that abut residentially-zoned\nproperty.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 7 of 250\n"}, {"page": "8", "text": "ENFORCEMENT\nSection 11 provides administrative detail and guidelines concerning violations, enforcement, and\nremedies of violations. The General Statutes provide a wide range of authority for the County to enforce\nthe zoning ordinance. Civil actions can be brought by the County. Normally, the threat of civil action\nis\nsufficient to dispose of the majority of enforcement cases. Legal enforcement tools available to the\nCounty include stop work orders, civil penalties, injunctions, and court orders. Enforcement decisions\nmade by the Zoning Administrator may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with the\nprocedures outlined in Section 13.\nNONCONFORMING SITUATIONS\nVarious types of nonconforming situations can occur with the adoption of zoning regulations. This article\nprovides very specific and comprehensive provisions for dealing with nonconforming land, nonconforming\nuse of land, dimensional nonconformities, nonconforming projects, nonconforming structures, and mis-\ncellaneous nonconforming situations such as repair, renovation, and abandonment of nonconformities.\nThe provisions contained in this article provide a more realistic approach to dealing with nonconformities.\nRather than attempting to eliminate all nonconforming situations, the zoning ordinance recognizes that\nnonconformities seldom go away and, therefore, attempts to deal with them in the most equitable manner.\nThis article allows, under prescribed conditions, for some nonconforming situations to be expanded or\neven rebuilt (see Section 12(C)(3)) in an effort to improve nonconforming situations rather than attempt to\nlegislate them out of existence. Single-family residences are exempt from the nonconforming provisions\nand may be enlarged or replaced so long as new nonconformities are not created.\nAPPEALS, VARIANCES, INTERPRETATIONS\nAppeals\nDecisions made by the Zoning Administrator may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment. The appeals\nprocedures outlined in this ordinance apply only to administrative zoning decisions and cannot be used to\nappeal the decisions made by the Planning Board or Board of Commissioners. Only formal decisions or\ninterpretations made by the Zoning Administrator may be appealed. The Board of Adjustment is not\nauthorized to issue advisory decisions.\nVariances\nNCGS 160D-705 authorizes the Board of Adjustment to vary or modify any regulation or provision of the\nzoning ordinance when 'unnecessary hardships' would result from carrying out the strict letter of the\nzoning ordinance. The applicant for a variance is responsible for demonstrating that the hardship claimed\nwarrants a variance.\nVariances from Flood Hazard Overlay District Requirements\nSpecial conditions apply to granting variances from the flood damage prevention regulations. This\nsection is necessary to maintain the County's eligibility in the Flood Insurance Program.\nAMENDMENTS\nPlanning Board Review and Recommendation\nNCGS 160D-604 requires that all proposed amendments shall be submitted to the Planning Board for\nreview and comment prior to consideration by the Board of Commissioners. The Planning Board must\nprovide a written recommendation to the Board of Commissioners within 30 days. If no recommendation\nis received, the Board of Commissioners may proceed to act on the request without the Planning Board's\nrecommendation. The Board of Commissioners is not, however, bound by the recommendation, if any, of\nthe Planning Board.\nNCGS 160D-604 requires the Planning Board to advise and comment on whether a proposed amend-\nment is consistent with an adopted comprehensive plan and any other officially adopted plan that is appli-\ncable. The Planning Board is required to provide a written recommendation to the Board of County\nCommissioners that addresses plan consistency and other matters deemed appropriate by the Planning\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 8 of 250\n"}, {"page": "9", "text": "Board, however a comment by the Planning Board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with an\nadopted plan does not preclude consideration or approval by the Board of Commissioners.\nBoard of Commissioners Review and Adoption\nNCGS 160D-605 requires that prior to adopting or rejecting any zoning amendment, the governing board\nmust adopt a brief statement describing whether its action is consistent with an adopted comprehensive\nplan. The Board must also adopt a brief statement explaining the reasonableness of the proposed\nrezoning. The consistency statement and statement of reasonableness may be approved as a single\nstatement.\nLegislative Hearing Requirements\nNCGS 160D-602 mandates that first-class mail notice of a legislative hearing concerning a rezoning be\nmade to the owner(s) of the property proposed to be rezoned and the owners of all parcels abutting the\nproperty to be rezoned. The person mailing the notices must certify to the Board of Commissioners that\nfact. NCGS 160D-602 also requires that when a zoning map amendment is proposed, the legislative\nhearing notice must be prominently posted on the site proposed for rezoning or on an adjacent public\nstreet or highway right-of-way.\nUltimate Issue Before Board of Commissioners on Amendments\nSections 1 and 2 provide rezoning and text amendment guidelines for the Board of Commissioners. It is\nimportant that the impact of an amendment be viewed from the perspective of the County as a whole and\nnot just from the perspective of the individual(s) requesting the amendment.\nConditional Zoning Districts\nConditional zoning is authorized by NCGS 160D-703. This type of zoning, as opposed to a conventional\nrezoning, allows the County to review a rezoning request for a specific use. The rezoning, if approved, is\nvalid only for the use specified in the rezoning request. This type of rezoning works well only in those\nsituations in which the applicant has a definitive use in mind for the property.\nWhen the zoning ordinance was initially adopted, it incorporated a conditional use district rezoning\nprocess. With this type of rezoning, uses are permitted only upon the issuance of a conditional use\npermit following a legislative hearing by the Board of Commissioners using quasi-judicial procedures.\nPursuant to Chapter 160D of the North Carolina General Statutes, local governments may no longer\nutilize conditional use districts. Any previously approved conditional use district that is valid and in effect\nas of January 1, 2021, is deemed a conditional zoning district and any conditional use permits issued\nconcurrently with the establishment of those districts remain valid and are deemed to be special use\npermits. Conditional zoning is an entirely legislative process and follows the same procedures as a\nconventional rezoning. The two processes achieve the same result in that a specific project is approved\nsubject to an approved site plan and a set of specific conditions. With conditional zoning, however, no\nconditional use permit is issued and the legislative process is less complex than the quasi-judicial process\nrequired by conditional use district rezonings. Property can be rezoned to a conditional zoning district\nonly upon the request of the property owner. Adjacent property owners find this type of rezoning more\nreassuring because they know exactly what use will be developed beside them. There are no surprise\nuses going in beside them after the rezoning is approved as is possible with a conventional district\nrezoning. The conditional zoning process is conducive to reaching consensus among the different parties\ninvolved in a rezoning--- owner/developer of the property proposed to be rezoned, the abutting\nproperty owners, and the Board of Commissioners.\nDEFINITIONS\nSection 15 includes information to assist in interpreting the zoning ordinance as well as definitions of\nwords and terms used throughout the document. This section also provides guidelines for making\ndecisions in cases where uncertainty exists as to zoning district boundaries. Definitions are very\nimportant in assisting with the day-to-day administration of the zoning ordinance.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 9 of 250\n"}, {"page": "10", "text": "APPENDIX A\nAppendix A contains flowcharts regarding the review and approval processes for zoning permits, special\nuse permits, appeals and variances, and rezonings/text amendments.

If the Board\nconcludes that the application fails to meet one or more of the requirements of this\nOrdinance, the application shall be denied.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 21 of 250\n"}, {"page": "22", "text": "C.\nIf the Board concludes that all such requirements are met, it shall issue the permit unless\nit adopts a motion to deny the application for one or more of the reasons set forth in\nSection 3(N)(3) Such a motion shall propose specific findings based upon the evidence\nsubmitted which justifies such a conclusion, and may be carried by a simple majority\nvote.\n3. Even if the Board finds that the application complies with all other provisions of this\nOrdinance, it may still deny the permit if it concludes, based upon the information submitted\nat the hearing, that if completed as proposed, the development, more probably than not:\na. Will materially endanger the public health or safety; or\nb. Will substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property; or\nC. Will not be in harmony with the area in which it is to be located; or\nd. Will not be in general conformity with the land use plan or other plans officially adopted\nby the Board of Commissioners.\n4. The Board may attach reasonable and appropriate conditions to the permit to ensure\ncompliance with the provisions of this Ordinance. The Board may not attach additional\nconditions that modify or alter the specific requirements set forth in this Ordinance, or\nrequirements for which the County does not have authority under the North Carolina General\nStatutes to enforce. Without limiting the foregoing, the Board may attach to a permit a\ncondition limiting the permit to a specified duration.\n5.\nAll additional conditions or requirements shall be consented to in writing by the applicant and\nshall be entered on the permit.\n6.\nDecisions by the Board of Adjustment on special use permit requests shall be filed in the\noffices of the Planning Department.\nO. Authorizing Use or Occupancy Before Completion of Development\n1. In cases when, because of weather conditions or other factors beyond the control of the\nzoning or special use permit recipient (exclusive of financial hardship) it would be\nunreasonable to require the permit recipient to comply with all of the requirements of this\nOrdinance before commencing the intended use of the property or occupying any buildings,\nthe permit-issuing authority may authorize the commencement of the intended use or the\noccupancy of buildings (insofar as the requirements of this Ordinance are concerned) if the\npermit recipient provides an adequately secured performance bond or other security\nsatisfactory to the permit-issuing authority to ensure that all of these requirements will be\nfulfilled within a reasonable period (not to exceed twelve months). The proposed performance\nbond and security shall be reviewed and approved by the Pitt County Attorney prior to\nauthorization of the intended use or occupancy.\n2. When the Board of Adjustment imposes additional requirements upon a special use permit\nrecipient in accordance with Section 3(N)(4) or when a developer proposes in the plans\nsubmitted to install amenities beyond those required by this Ordinance, the permit-issuing\nauthority may authorize the permittee to commence the intended use of the property or to\noccupy any building before the additional requirements are fulfilled or the amenities installed\nif it specifies a date by which or a schedule according to which such requirements must be\nmet or each amenity installed, and if it concludes that compliance will be ensured as the\nresult of any one or more of the following:\na. A performance bond and security satisfactory to the County Attorney is furnished;\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 22 of 250\n"}, {"page": "23", "text": "b. A condition is imposed establishing an automatic expiration date on the permit, thereby\nensuring that the permit recipient's compliance will be reviewed when application for\nrenewal is made;\nC.\nThe nature of the requirements or amenities is such that sufficient assurance of\ncompliance is given by Section 1(D), Penalties and Remedies for Violations, and\nSection 11(F), Permit Revocation.\nP. Completing Development in Phases\n1. If a development is constructed in phases or stages in accordance with this Section, then,\nsubject to Section 3(P)(3), the provisions of Section 3(G) and Section 3(O) shall apply to\neach phase as if it were the entire development.\n2.\nAs a prerequisite to taking advantage of the provisions of Section 3(P)(1), the developer shall\nsubmit plans that clearly show the various phases or stages of the proposed development\nand the requirements of this Ordinance that will be satisfied with respect to each phase or\nstage.\n3.\nIf a development that is to be built in phases or stages includes improvements that are\ndesigned to relate to, benefit, or be used by the entire development (such as a swimming\npool or tennis courts in a residential development) then, as part of the application for devel-\nopment approval, the developer shall submit a proposed schedule for completion of such\nimprovements. The schedule shall relate completion of such improvements to completion of\none or more phases or stages of the entire development. Once a schedule has been\napproved and made part of the permit by the permit-issuing authority, no land may be used,\nno buildings may be occupied except in accordance with the schedule approved as part of\nthe permit, provided that:\na. If the improvement is one required by this Ordinance then the developer may utilize the\nprovisions of Section 3(O)(1); or\nb. If the improvement is an amenity not required by this Ordinance or is provided in\nresponse to a condition imposed by the permit-issuing authority, then the developer may\nutilize the provisions of Section 3(O)(2).\nQ. Expiration of Permits\n1. Except as provided in Section 3(Q)(6), zoning and special use permits (including approved\nsite or plot plans) shall expire automatically if, within one year after the issuance of such\npermits:\na. The use authorized by such permits has not commenced, in circumstances where no\nsubstantial construction, erection, alteration, excavation, demolition, or similar work is\nnecessary before commencement of such use; or\nb.\nLess than ten percent of the total cost of all construction, erection, alteration, excavation,\ndemolition, or similar work on any development authorized by such permits has been\ncompleted on the site. With respect to phased development (see Section 3(P)), this\nrequirement shall apply only to the first phase.\n2. If, after some physical alteration to land or structures begins to take place, such work is\ndiscontinued for a period of one year, then the zoning or special use permit authorizing such\nwork shall immediately expire. However, expiration of the permit shall not affect the\nprovisions of Section 3(R).\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 23 of 250\n"}, {"page": "24", "text": "3. The permit-issuing authority may extend for a period up to six months the date when a zoning\nor special use permit would otherwise expire pursuant to Sections 3(Q)(1) or 3(Q)(2) if it\nconcludes that (i) the permit has not yet expired, (ii) the permit recipient has proceeded with\ndue diligence and in good faith, and (iii) conditions have not changed so substantially as to\nwarrant a new application. Successive extensions may be granted for periods up to six\nmonths upon the same findings. All such extensions may be granted without resort to the\nformal processes and fees required for a new permit.\n4. For purposes of this Section, a special use permit within the jurisdiction of the Board of\nAdjustment is issued when the Board votes to approve the application and issue the permit. A\nzoning permit within the jurisdiction of the Zoning Administrator is issued when the earlier of\nthe following takes place:\na. A copy of the fully executed permit is delivered to the permit recipient, and delivery is\naccomplished when the permit is delivered to the permit applicant; or\nb. The Zoning Administrator notifies the permit applicant that the application has been\napproved and that all that remains before a fully executed permit can be delivered is for\nthe applicant to take certain specified actions, such as having the permit executed by the\nproperty owner so it can be recorded, if required under Section 3(R)(2)\n5. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of Section 12, Nonconforming Situations, this Section\nshall be applicable to permits issued prior to the date this Ordinance becomes effective.\n6. Special use permits with a vested right established in accordance with Section 3(V) shall\nexpire at the end of the applicable vesting period.\nR. Effect of Permit on Successors and Assigns\n1. Zoning, special use, and sign permits authorize the permittee to make use of land and\nstructures in a particular way. Such permits attach to and run with the land and are\ntransferable. However, so long as the land or structures or any portion thereof covered under\na permit continues to be used for the purposes for which the permit was granted, then:\na. No person (including successors or assigns of the person who obtained the permit) may\nmake use of the land or structures covered under such permit for the purposes\nauthorized in the permit except in accordance with all the terms and requirements of that\npermit; and\nb. The terms and requirements of the permit apply to and restrict the use of land or\nstructures covered under the permit, not only with respect to all persons having any\ninterest in the property at the time the permit was obtained, but also with respect to\npersons who subsequently obtain any interest in all or part of the covered property and\nwish to use it for or in connection with purposes other than those for which the permit was\noriginally issued.\n2. Whenever the recording of a special use permit is required by the Board of Adjustment as a\ncondition of approval, nothing authorized by the permit may be done until the record owner of\nthe property provides documentation that indicates that the permit has been recorded in the\nPitt County Registry and indexed under the record owner's name as grantor.\nS. Modification of Permits\n1. Minor modifications to issued permits (including approved special use permits, conditional\nzoning districts, and site plans) may be reviewed and approved by the Zoning Administrator.\nFor purposes of this Section, minor modifications are those that do not involve a change in\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 24 of 250\n"}, {"page": "25", "text": "permitted use or density. Such permission may be obtained without a formal application,\nhearing, or payment of any additional fee.\n2. All other requests for modifications or changes to an approved special use permit (including\napproved site plans) shall follow the same process as approval of a new special use permit\nand shall be acted upon by the Board of Adjustment. For such requests, conditions may be\nimposed only on the specific site or area requested to be modified in accordance with Section\n3(N)(4), but the applicant retains the right to reject such additional conditions by withdrawing\nhis request for an amendment and may then proceed in accordance with the previously\nissued permit.\n3. If multiple parcels of land are subject to a special use permit, the owners of individual parcels\nmay apply for a permit modification so long as the modification would not result in other\nproperties failing to meet the terms of the special use permit. Any modifications approved\nshall only be applicable to those properties whose owners apply for the modification.\n4. Any request for modification to the approved conditions in a conditional zoning district shall\nfollow the same process for approval as a zoning map amendment in accordance with the\nprovisions of Section 14. If multiple parcels of land are subject to a conditional zoning district,\nthe owners of individual parcels may apply for modification of the conditions so long as the\nmodification would not result in other properties failing to meet the terms of the conditions.\nAny modifications approved apply only to those properties whose owners petition for the\nmodification.\n5. The Zoning Administrator shall determine if proposed permit modifications fall within the\ncategories set forth above in Sections 3(S)(1) through 3(S)(4).\n6. A developer requesting a permit modification shall submit a written request for such approval\nto the Zoning Administrator identifying the requested changes. Approval of all changes must\nbe given in writing.\n7. A vested right established in accordance with Section 3(V) shall not be extended by any\nmodifications to an approved site-specific vesting plan unless expressly provided for by the\nBoard of Commissioners.\nT. Reconsideration of Action on Special Use Permits\n1. Whenever the Board of Adjustment disapproves a special use permit application on any basis\nother than the failure of the applicant to submit a complete application, such action may not\nbe reconsidered by the Board at a later time unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that:\na. Circumstances affecting the property that is the subject of the application have\nsubstantially changed; or\nb. New information is available that could not with reasonable diligence have been\npresented at a previous hearing. A request to be heard on this basis must be filed with\nthe Zoning Administrator within the time period for an appeal to superior court (see\nSection 11(G)). However, such a request does not extend the 30-day period within which\nan appeal must be taken.\n2. The Board of Adjustment may, however, at any time consider a new application affecting the\nsame property as an application previously denied. A new application is one that differs in\nsome substantial way from the one previously considered.\nU. Maintenance of Common Areas, Improvements, and Facilities. The recipient of any zoning or\nspecial use permit, or his successor, shall be responsible for maintaining all common areas,\nimprovements or facilities required by this Ordinance or any permit issued in accordance with its\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 25 of 250\n"}, {"page": "26", "text": "provisions, except those areas, improvements or facilities with respect to which an offer of\ndedication to the public has been accepted by the appropriate public authority.

Zoning Vested Rights and Permit Choice\n1. Unless otherwise specifically provided, or unless clearly required by the context, the words\nand phrases defined in this Section shall have the meaning indicated when used in this Sec-\ntion.\na. Development. Without altering the scope of any regulatory authority granted by statute or\nlocal act, any of the following:\ni.\nThe construction, erection, alteration, enlargement, renovation, substantial repair,\nmovement to another site, or demolition of any structure;\nii.\nExcavation, grading, filling, clearing, or alteration of land;\niii.

Landowner. The holder of the title in fee simple. Absent evidence to the contrary, the\nCounty may rely on the county tax records to determine who is a landowner. The\nlandowner may authorize a person holding a valid option, lease, or contract to purchase\nto act as his or her agent or representative for the purpose of making applications for\ndevelopment approvals.\ne.\nMulti-phased development. A development containing 25 acres or more that is submitted\nfor approval in more than one phase, and is subject to a master development plan with\ncommitted elements showing the type and intensity of each phase.\nf.\nProperty.

Vested right. The right to undertake and complete the development and use of property\nunder the terms and conditions of an approved site-specific vesting plan or under\ncommon law.\n2. Process to Claim Vested Right\na. A person claiming a statutory or common law vested right may submit information to\nsubstantiate that claim to the Zoning Administrator, who shall make an initial\ndetermination as to the existence of the vested right. The decision by the Zoning\nAdministrator may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with Section\n13(A) of this Ordinance.\nb. In lieu of seeking such a determination or pursuing an appeal to the Board of Adjustment,\na person claiming a vested right may bring an original civil action as provided by NCGS\n160D-1403.1.\n3. Site-Specific Vesting Plans\na. Following the receipt of a petition from a landowner or applicant, a vested right is\nestablished with respect to any property upon the valid approval or conditional approval\nof a site-specific vesting plan as provided in this subsection. Such a vested right confers\nupon the landowner or applicant the right to undertake and complete the development\nand use of the property under the terms and conditions of a site-specific vesting plan,\nincluding any amendments thereto.\nb. A petition for approval of a site-specific vesting plan shall be submitted by filing a copy of\nthe petition and the site-specific vesting plan with the Zoning Administrator in the\nPlanning Department 20 working days prior to the meeting at which the request will be\nreviewed. The site-specific vesting plan shall be in the form of a site plan prepared in\naccordance with the requirements of Appendix B of this Ordinance and shall describe\nwith reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels.\nC.\nExcept as provided in Subsection (d), the Board of Commissioners shall review all\nrequests to approve a site-specific vesting plan. Prior to consideration of a site-specific\nvesting plan, the Board shall conduct a legislative hearing, and notice of the hearing shall\nbe provided in accordance with the provisions of NCGS 160D-602.\nd. If the use proposed by a site-specific vesting plan is based on issuance of a special use\npermit, the vesting shall be considered for approval by the Board of Commissioners\nrather than the Board of Adjustment. Such requests shall not be approved until an\nevidentiary hearing has been held by the Board of Commissioners using quasi-judicial\nprocedures as required by NCGS 160D-406 and Section 3(M) of this Ordinance.\ne. A site-specific vesting plan may be approved upon such terms and conditions, as may be\ndetermined necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Conditional\napproval results in a vested right, although failure to abide by the approved terms and\nconditions will result in a forfeiture of vested rights. Modifications or amendments to an\napproved site-specific vesting plan shall be made in accordance with the provisions of\nSection 3(S).\nf.\nA vested right for a site-specific vesting plan runs with the land and is valid for a minimum\nof two years from the effective date of approval of the plan. This vesting period shall not\nbe extended unless expressly authorized by the Board of Commissioners. The Board\nmay approve a vesting period exceeding two years, but not to exceed five years, if\nwarranted by the size and phasing of development, the level of investment, the need for\nthe development, economic cycles, and market conditions or other considerations.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 27 of 250\n"}, {"page": "28", "text": "g, Following the approval of a site-specific vesting plan, the Zoning Administrator shall issue\na vested right certificate to the landowner which indicates the duration of the vesting\nperiod, the conditions, if any, imposed on the approval of the site-specific vesting plan,\nand any other information determined by the Zoning Administrator to be necessary to\nadminister the vested right.\nh. A vested right as provided in this Section terminates at the end of the applicable vesting\nperiod with respect to buildings and uses for which no valid building permit applications\nhave been filed. Upon issuance of a building permit, the provisions of NCGS 160D-1111\nand NCGS 160D-1115 shall apply, except that a permit does not expire and shall not be\nrevoked because of the running of time while a vested right under this Section is\noutstanding.\ni.\nA variance does not constitute a site-specific vesting plan, and approval of a site-specific\nvesting plan with the condition that a variance be obtained does not confer a vested right\nunless and until the necessary variance is obtained.\n4. Multi-phased development\nApproval of a master development plan for a multi-phased development shall follow the same\nprocedures for approval of a site-specific vesting plan as outlined in Section 3(V)(2). A\nvested right for a multi-phased development is established at the time a site plan, prepared in\naccordance with Appendix B, is approved for the initial phase of the development by the\nappropriate permit-issuing authority as outlined in Section 3(F)(2). The vested right shall\nremain valid for a period of seven years from the date of approval for the initial phase of the\ndevelopment.\n5. Permit Choice\na. If an application for a zoning, sign, or special use permit is submitted for approval in\naccordance with the provisions of this Ordinance, and an applicable rule, map, or\nprovision of this Ordinance is amended between the time the application was submitted\nand the permit is acted upon, the applicant may choose which version of the rule, map, or\nOrdinance will apply to the application.\nb. If the permit applicant chooses the version of the rule, map, or Ordinance applicable at\nthe time of the permit application, the applicant shall not be required to await the outcome\nof the amendment to the rule, map, or Ordinance prior to acting on the permit.\nC. Where multiple local development permits are required to complete a development\nproject, the permit applicant may choose the version of each of the local development\nregulations applicable to the project upon submittal of the application for the initial\ndevelopment permit. This provision is applicable only for those subsequent development\npermit applications filed within 18 months of the date following the approval of an initial\npermit. For purposes of the vesting protections of this subsection, an erosion and\nsedimentation control permit or a sign permit is not an initial development permit.\nC. If this Ordinance is amended after a permit application is wrongfully denied or after an\nillegal condition is imposed, as determined in a proceeding challenging the permit denial\nor the condition imposed, the permit applicant may choose which adopted version of the\nrule or Ordinance will apply to the permit and use of the building, structure, or land\nindicated on the permit application. Provided, however, any provision of the development\npermit applicant's chosen version of the rule or Ordinance that is determined to be illegal\nfor any reason shall not be enforced upon the applicant without the written consent of the\napplicant.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 28 of 250\n"}, {"page": "29", "text": "d.

Subsequent Changes Prohibited; Exceptions\na. A vested right, once established or provided for in this Section, precludes any zoning\naction by Pitt County which would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise\ndelay the development or use of the property as set forth in an approved site-specific\nvesting plan, except under one or more of the following conditions:\ni.\nWith the written consent of the affected landowner;\nii.\nUpon findings, after notice and an evidentiary hearing, that natural or man-made\nhazards in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious\nthreat to the public health, safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as\ncontemplated in the approved vested right;\niii. To the extent that the affected landowner receives compensation for all costs,\nexpenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but not limited to,\nall fees paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing,\nlegal, and other consultant's fees incurred after approval by the County, together with\ninterest as is provided in NCGS 160D-106. Compensation shall not include any\ndiminution in the value of the property, that is caused by such action;\niv. Upon findings, after notice and an evidentiary hearing, that the landowner or his\nrepresentative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material\nmisrepresentations that made a difference in the approval by the County of the site-\nspecific vesting plan or the phased development plan; or\nV.\nUpon the enactment or promulgation of a State or federal law or regulation that\nprecludes development as contemplated in the site-specific vesting plan or the\nphased development plan, in which case the County may modify the affected\nprovisions, upon a finding that the change in State or federal law has a fundamental\neffect on the plan, by ordinance after notice and an evidentiary hearing.\nb. The establishment of a vested right does not preclude the application of overlay zoning or\nother development regulations which impose additional requirements but do not affect the\nallowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations which are general in\nnature and are applicable to all property subject to development regulation by the County,\nincluding, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes.\nOtherwise applicable new regulations shall become effective with respect to property that\nis subject to a site-specific vesting plan upon the expiration or termination of the vested\nrights period provided for in this Section.\nC. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Section, the establishment of a vested right does\nnot preclude, change, or impair the authority of the County to adopt and enforce\nprovisions of this Ordinance governing nonconforming situations or uses.\n6. Miscellaneous Provisions\na. A vested right obtained under this Section is not a personal right, but attached to and\nruns with the applicable property. After approval of a site-specific vesting plan, all\nsuccessors to the original landowner are entitled to exercise these rights.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 29 of 250\n"}, {"page": "30", "text": "b. Nothing in this Section precludes judicial determination, based on common law principles\nor other statutory provisions, that a vested right exists in a particular case or that a\ncompensable taking has occurred.

The County shall not require a landowner to waive his vested rights as a condition of\ndevelopmental approval.\nW. High Density Development Permit Application\n1. A High Density Development Permit shall be required for new developments exceeding the\nrequirements of the low density option included in the water supply watershed overlay district.\n2. Application for a High Density Development shall be addressed and submitted to the\nTechnical Review Committee through the Watershed Administrator. Application for a High\nDensity Development Permit shall be made on the proper form and shall include the following\ninformation:\na.\nA completed High Density Development Permit Application signed by the owner of the\nproperty.

However, failure of the agencies to submit their\ncomments and recommendations shall not delay the Technical Review Committee's action\nwithin prescribed time limit.\n4. The Technical Review Committee shall either approve or disapprove each application for a\nHigh Density Development Permit based on the applicable criteria contained in this\nOrdinance. All applications shall be submitted in accordance with the Technical Review\nCommittee deadline schedule which is generally 20 working days prior to the next Technical\nReview Committee meeting.

Zoning Districts and Zoning Map\nIn order to achieve the purposes of this Ordinance as set forth, all property within the County's zoning\njurisdiction is divided into districts with the designations and purposes listed in Sections 4(A) through\n4(C). The minimum lot sizes and dimensional requirements for each zoning district are provided in\nSection 6.\nA. Conventional Zoning Districts\n1. RA, Rural Agricultural District. The RA, Rural Agricultural District is primarily intended to\naccommodate very low-density residential uses as well as associated public and institutional\nuses, low intensity commercial uses, and agricultural-related industrial uses which are\ninterspersed throughout areas that are principally characterized as rural in nature. This\ndistrict reflects the diverse nature of land uses within predominantly rural areas and,\ntherefore, permits a wide array of land uses. The district is specifically established for the\nfollowing purposes:\na. To preserve and encourage the continued use of land for agricultural, forestry, and open\nspace purposes;\nb. To encourage small-scale and low intensity commercial uses that primarily provide goods\nand services to residents of the surrounding rural areas;\nC. To encourage only those industries which are agricultural-related;\nd. To encourage the concentration of more intensive urban land uses in and around identi-\nfied growth areas that have the capacity to accommodate the utility and traffic demands\nof such development, thereby avoiding premature conversion of farmland to urban uses;\nand\ne. To discourage any use which, because of its character, would create premature or\nextraordinary public infrastructure and service demands.\n2. RR, Rural Residential. The RR, Rural Residential District is primarily intended to\naccommodate low density, single-family residential uses and their associated, supporting\npublic and institutional uses in areas that generally do not have access to public or\ncommunity water and sewer systems.\n3. R40, Low Density Residential District. The R40, Low Density Residential District is primarily\nintended to accommodate low density, single-family residential uses and their associated,\nsupporting public and institutional uses in areas that generally do not have access to public or\ncommunity water and sewer systems.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 31 of 250\n"}, {"page": "32", "text": "4.\nSR, Suburban Residential District. The SR, Suburban Residential District is intended to\naccommodate low density, single-family residential uses and their associated, supporting\npublic and institutional uses in areas that have access to public or community water and\nsewer services or in areas that can readily be served by such systems. This district is\nintended to accommodate land uses that are served by public sewer service and is not\nintended to accommodate development that is served by septic tanks.\n5. MFR, Multifamily Residential District. The MFR, Multifamily Residential District is intended to\naccommodate low to moderate density single-family residential uses, multifamily residential\nuses, and associated, supporting public and institutional uses in areas that have the\nnecessary utilities and road systems to support such development.\n6.\nRC, Rural Commercial District. The RC, Rural Commercial District is intended to\naccommodate very limited retail, service, office, and low density multifamily residential uses\nthat have little or no adverse impact upon surrounding properties.

Change in Use\n1. A substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character or nature of the\nactivity conducted on a lot changes. This occurs whenever:\na. The change involves a change from one principal use category to another.\nb. If the original use is a combination use, the relative proportion of space devoted to the\nindividual principal uses that comprise the combination use changes to such an extent that the\nparking requirements for the overall use are altered.\nC.\nIf the original use is a combination use, the mixture of types of individual principal uses that\ncomprise the combination use changes.\nd. If there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot (regardless of whether that\nbusiness or enterprise consists of one individual principal use or a combination use), that\nbusiness or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in (even though the\nnew business or enterprise may be classified under the same principal use or combination use\ncategory as the previous type of business). For example, if there is only one building on a lot\nand a florist shop that is the sole tenant of that building moves out and is replaced by\na\nclothing store, that constitutes a change in use. However, if the florist shop were replaced by\nanother florist shop, that would not constitute a change in use since the type of business or\nenterprise would not have changed. Moreover, if the florist shop moved out of a rented space\nin a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store, that would not constitute a change\nin use since there is more than one business on the lot and the essential character of the\nactivity conducted on that lot (shopping center-combination use) has not changed.\n2. A mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice-versa does not\nconstitute a change in use. Whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the\ntwo active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during which the property\nmay have been unoccupied, unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than 180\nconsecutive days or has been abandoned.\n3. A mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in the name shall not be\nregarded as a change in use.\nD. Combination Uses\nWhen a combination use comprises two or more principal uses that require different types of permits\n(zoning or special use), then the permit authorizing the combination use shall be:\n1. A special use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a special use permit.\n2. A zoning permit in all other cases.\nE. Mixed Uses\nTwo or more permitted uses may occupy the same principal building.\nF. Accessory Uses\n1. Whenever an activity is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former use (i)\nconstitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot,\nor\n(ii) is customarily associated with the principal use and integrally related to it, then the former use\nmay be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath the\numbrella of the permit issued for the principal use.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 54 of 250\n"}, {"page": "55", "text": "2. For purposes of interpreting Section 5(F)(1):\na.\nA use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial in and of\nitself or in relation to the principal use;\nb.

Without limiting the generality of Sections 5(F)(1) and 5(F)(2), the following activities are\nspecifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses so long as they satisfy the general\ncriteria set forth above:\na.

Cluster Option: The cluster development option may be used in any RR, RA, R40, SR or MFR\nzoning district if the tract to be developed is ten acres or larger in area for those properties\nzoned SR & MFR and a minimum of twenty-five acres for properties zoned RR, RA & R40.\nb. Purpose: The regulations of this section are intended to encourage design that minimizes land\ndisturbance promoting the grouping of building lots for greater protection of natural resources\nthan in conventional development design. These development types are intended to\nencourage the preservation of Open Space, reduce stormwater run-off and help preserve the\narea's rural or agricultural character.\nC.\nDevelopment Standards: The cluster development standards of this section require that a\nspecified portion of each development be set aside and permanently preserved as Open\nSpace. The required Open Space area within cluster developments can be used to provide\nrecreational opportunities for the development's residents, to conserve and protect significant\nnatural resources, or to conserve productive farming and forestry uses.\nIn a cluster subdivision development lots smaller than the minimum lot size permitted in the\nzoning district are allowed provided such lots are developed in accordance with the following:\ni.\nOpen Space Area Standards\n(1) The total amount of land set aside as Open Space areas shall be comprised of a\nminimum of 15% of the total land area in the development.\n(2) Open Space areas should prioritize sensitive environmental features and/or significant\ncultural resource areas (e.g., wetlands, riparian areas, hydric soils, mature trees and\nforests, cropland, pastures, meadows) for preservation.\n(3) Open Space shall be placed in undivided preserves which adjoin housing areas and\nproperty lines that have been designed more compactly to create larger conservation\nareas. Such undivided Open Space shall be accessible to the largest number of lots\nwithin the development. To achieve this, the majority of lots should abut undivided\nOpen Space to provide residents with direct views and access. Safe and convenient\npedestrian access to the Open Space from all adjoining lots shall be provided, except\nin the case of farmland or other resource areas vulnerable to human disturbance.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 56 of 250\n"}, {"page": "57", "text": "Table 6-1 Table of Density and Dimensional Requirements\nN/A\nNot applicable.\nNotes:\na\nOr as determined by the Pitt County Environmental Health Division for on-site septic\n1.

Flood Hazard District Overlay Requirements\nThe Flood Hazard Overlay District (FH), as established in Section 4(C)(4) is designed for the\npurpose of protecting people and property from the hazards of flooding in accordance with the\nauthority provided in NCGS 153A-121. The provisions of this Section are a supplement to those\nregulations found in the Pitt County Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance.\n1. Findings of Fact\na. The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of Pitt County are subject to periodic\ninundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of\ncommerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood\nprotection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the\npublic health, safety, and general welfare.\nb.\nThese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains\ncausing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood prone\nareas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately\nelevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.\n2. Basis for Establishing the Special Flood Hazard Areas\nThe Special Flood Hazard Areas are those identified by the Federal Emergency Management\nAgency (FEMA) or produced under the Cooperating Technical State (CTS) agreement\nbetween the State of North Carolina and FEMA in its Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or\nFlood Insurance Study (FIS) and its accompanying flood maps such as the Flood Insurance\nRate Map(s) (FIRM) and/or the Flood Boundary Floodway Map(s) (FBFM), for Pitt County\ndated January 2, 2004 which with accompanying supporting data, and any revision thereto,\nincluding Letters of Map Amendment or Revision, are adopted by reference and declared to\nbe a part of this Ordinance. The Special Flood Hazard Areas also include those defined\nthrough standard engineering analysis for private developments or by governmental\nagencies, but which have not yet been incorporated in the FIRM. This includes, but is not\nlimited to, detailed flood data:\na.

Preliminary FIRMs where more stringent than the effective FIRM; or\nC. Post-disaster Flood Recovery Maps.\n3. Regulations Do Not Guarantee Flood Protection\nThe degree of flood protection required by this Section is considered reasonable for\nregulating purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods\ncan and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or\nnatural causes. This Section does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood\nhazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This\nSection shall not create liability on the part of Pitt County or by any officer or employee\nthereof any flood damages that result from reliance on this Section or any administrative\ndecision lawfully made hereunder.\n4. Effect Upon Outstanding Building Permits\nNothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans, construction, size or\ndesignated use of any development or any part thereof for which a floodplain development\npermit has been granted by the Floodplain Administrator or his authorized agents before the\ntime of passage of this Section; provided, however, that when construction is not begun\nunder such outstanding permit within a period of six (6) months subsequent to passage of\nthis section or any revision thereto, construction or use shall be in conformity with\nthe\nprovisions of this Section.\nC. Airport Height Overlay Requirements\n1. The Airport Overlay (AH) District, as established in Section 4(C)(1) is not intended to be\nutilized as a district classification, but as a designation which identifies areas subject to\nregulations which are supplementary to the regulations of the district to which such\ndesignation is attached, appended or overlaid. Regulations which apply to areas designated\non the zoning map as being within such appended or overlaid designation must be\ndetermined by joint reference to the regulations of both the basic district classification and the\noverlay classification.\n2. It is the intent of this Section to restrain influences which are adverse to the airport property\nand safe conduct of aircraft in the vicinity of the Pitt-Greenville Airport, to prevent creation of\nconditions hazardous to aircraft operation, to prevent conflict with land development which\nmay result in loss of life and property, and to encourage development which is compatible\nwith airport use characteristics within the intent and purpose of zoning. To this end, the AH\ndesignation, when overlaid to a basic district classification, is intended to coordinate the\npurpose and intent of this Section with other regulations duly established by the County of Pitt\nwhose primary intent is to further the purposes set out above.\n3.

Therefore, the permit-issuing authority may permit deviations from the\nrequirements of Table 10-1 and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever it\nfinds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the general standard delineated in Section\n10(C)(4).

Such screening may consist of evergreen vegeta-\ntion, fences, walls, or berms and shall be installed, located, or constructed so as to create an\neffective screen.\n4. Alternative Screening Methods\na. Under certain circumstances the application of the standards delineated in Sections\n10(H)(1) through 10(H)(3). is either inappropriate or ineffective in achieving the purposes\nof this Ordinance. When screening is required by this Section or by other provisions of\nthis Ordinance and the site design, topography, unique relationships to other properties,\nlot configuration, spatial separation, natural vegetation, or other special considerations\nexist relative to the proposed development, the developer may submit a specific plan for\nscreening to the Zoning Administrator. This plan must demonstrate how the purposes\nand standards of this Section will be met by measures other than those listed in Sections\n10(H)(1) through 10(H)(3). If approved by the Zoning Administrator, the alternative\nscreening plan may be utilized to meet the requirements of this Section.\nb.\nA combination of natural vegetation, fences, walls and berms may be utilized to achieve\nthe screening requirements of Sections 10(H)(1) through 10(H)(3), provided that the\nfollowing standards are met:\ni.\nWalls (a minimum of 5 feet in height and constructed of masonry, stone or pressure\ntreated lumber) or an opaque fence (a minimum of 5 feet in height) may be used to\nreduce the width of the buffer yard required in Section 10(H)(1)(a) to a minimum of 5\nfeet.

Wall planters shall be constructed of masonry, stone or pressure treated lumber and\nshall have a minimum height of 30 inches. The minimum height of shrubs in wall\nplanters shall be 6 inches. The effective planting area of the wall planter shall be 4\nfeet in width (7 feet if the wall planter contains trees).\niv.\nAny berm utilized for screening purposes shall have a minimum height of 5 feet, a\nminimum crown width of 3 feet, and a side slope no greater than 3:1, and shall be\nplanted with a permanent ground cover of natural vegetative growth or other material\nwhich renders the soil surface stable against accelerated erosion.\n5. Maintenance\nIn order for any screening to fulfill the purpose for which it was established, it must be\nproperly maintained. Vegetation should be installed according to established planting\ntechniques, including establishing a well-prepared planting area prior to planting any trees or\nshrubs. Reference materials that illustrate proper planting techniques for trees and shrubs\nare available from the Pitt County Planning Department and the Pitt County Cooperative\nExtension. It is highly recommended that soil testing be conducted to ensure that soil\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 170 of 250\n"}, {"page": "171", "text": "conditions are appropriate for proposed plantings. The owner of the property and any tenant\non the property where screening is required will be jointly and severally responsible for the\nmaintenance of all required screening materials. Maintenance includes actions necessary to\nkeep screening materials healthy, neat and orderly in appearance and free of litter and\ndebris. Any live screening materials such as shrubs and trees which may die must be\nreplaced in compliance with the minimum standards of this Section. All screening and\nlandscaping areas must be protected from damage by motor vehicles or pedestrians which\ncould reduce the effectiveness of the screening.\n6. Use of Existing Screening\nWhen a lot is to be developed so that screening is required and that lot abuts an existing\nhedge, fence or other screening material on the adjoining lot, then that existing screen may\nbe used to satisfy the requirements of this Section. The existing screen must meet the mini-\nmum standards for screening established by this Section and it must be protected from\ndamage by pedestrians or motor vehicles. However, the burden to provide the necessary\nscreening remains with the use to be screened and is a continuing obligation that runs with\nthe land so long as the original use continues in operation. Consequently, should the\nscreening on the adjoining lot be removed, the use required to be screened shall, at that time,\nprovide screening in accordance with the requirements of this Section.\n7. Obstructions Prohibited\nLandscaping and screening materials shall not obstruct the view of motorists using any road,\ndriveway, or parking aisle.\n8. Guarantee in Lieu of Immediate Installation of Landscaping and Screening Materials\nIt is recognized that land development occurs continuously and that vegetation used in\nlandscaping or screening should be planted at certain times of the year to ensure the best\nchance of survival. In order to ensure compliance with this Section and reduce the potential\nexpense of replacing landscaping or screening materials which were installed in an untimely\nor improper fashion, the developer may provide, in accordance with the provisions of Section\n3(O), an adequately secured performance bond or other security to ensure that all of the\nrequirements of Section 10(H) will be fulfilled.\nI.\nExcessive Illumination in Parking Lots and Loading Areas\nLighting within any parking and loading area that unnecessarily illuminates any other lot and\nsubstantially interferes with the use or enjoyment of such other lot is prohibited.\nSection 11.

Among other possibilities, a non-\nconforming situation may arise because a lot does not meet minimum acreage requirements,\nbecause structures exceed maximum height limitations, because the relationship between\nexisting buildings and the land (in such matter as density and setback requirement) is not in\nconformity with this Ordinance, because signs do not meet the requirements of this Ordinance, or\nbecause land or buildings are used for purposes made unlawful by this Ordinance.\nUnless otherwise specifically provided for in this Ordinance and subject to the restrictions and\nqualifications set forth in the remaining sections of this Ordinance, nonconforming situations that\nwere otherwise lawful on the effective date of this Ordinance may be continued. Whenever this\nOrdinance refers to the effective date of this Ordinance, the reference shall be deemed to include\nthe effective date of any amendments to this Ordinance if the amendment, rather than this\nOrdinance as originally adopted, creates a nonconforming situation.\nB. Nonconforming Lots\n1. Single Lot of Record with Lot Area and/or Lot Width Nonconformity\na. When an undeveloped lot has an area or width which does not conform to the\ndimensional requirements of the district where located, but such lot was approved and of\nrecord at the time of adoption of this Ordinance or any subsequent amendment which\nrenders such lot nonconforming, then such lot may be used for a use permitted in the\ndistrict where located, provided that the setback dimensions and other requirements,\nexcept area or width, are complied with.\nb. In residential zones, only a single-family dwelling shall be permitted on the\nnonconforming lot.\nC. Nothing contained herein exempts a lot from meeting the applicable provisions of the Pitt\nCounty Board of Health regulations.\n2. Lots with Contiguous Frontage in One Ownership\na.\nWhen two or more adjoining and vacant lots of record with contiguous frontage are in one\nownership at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance or subsequent to adoption and\nsaid lots individually have a lot area or lot width which does not conform to the\ndimensional requirements of the district where located, such lots shall be combined to\ncreate one or more lots that meet the standards of the district where located.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 176 of 250\n"}, {"page": "177", "text": "b. Nothing contained herein exempts the contiguous lots considered as a single buildable\nlot or lots from meeting the applicable provisions of the Pitt County Board of Health\nregulations.\n3. Reduction of a Lot of Record\nA lot of record reduced to less than the required area, width, or setback dimensions as the\nresult of a condemnation or purchase by a local or state government agency shall become a\nnonconforming lot of record.\n4. Lot of Record with Setback Nonconformity\nWhen the use proposed for an undeveloped nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all\nother respects except that the applicable setback requirements cannot reasonably be\ncomplied with, then the entity authorized by this Ordinance to issue a permit for the proposed\nuse (the Zoning Administrator, Board of Adjustment, or Board of Commissioners) may allow\ndeviations from the applicable setback requirements if it finds that:\na. The property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such\ndeviations;\nb. The deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot; and\nC. The property can be developed as proposed without any significantly adverse impact on\nsurrounding properties or the public health or safety.\nC. Nonconforming Use of Land\n1. Continuance of Nonconforming Use of Land\nAny nonconforming use legally existing at the time of adoption or amendment of this\nOrdinance may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to conditions\nprovided in this Section.\n2.\nConditions for Continuance\nSuch nonconforming use of land shall be subject to the following conditions:\na.\nNo nonconforming use shall be changed to another nonconforming use unless such use\nis determined to be of equal or less intensity. In determining whether a nonconforming\nuse is of equal or less intensity, the Board of Adjustment shall consider:\ni.\nProbable traffic of each use;\nii. Parking requirements of each use;\niii. Probable number of persons on the premises of each use at a time of peak demand;\niv. Off-site impacts of each use, such as noise, glare, dust, vibration or smoke and other\nimpacts on surrounding properties or the public health or safety.\nb. The number of dwelling units in a nonconforming residential use shall not be increased.\nC. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or\nparcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or\namendment of this Ordinance.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 177 of 250\n"}, {"page": "178", "text": "d.\nIf any nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a continuous period of more\nthan 180 days, any subsequent use of such land shall be a permitted use in the district\nin\nwhich such land is located.\ne.\nThe resumption of a nonconforming use of land shall not be permitted if such\nnonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use for any period of time.\nf.\nNo additional structure(s) not conforming to the requirements of this Ordinance shall be\nerected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.\n3.\nExtension, Enlargement or Replacement of a Nonconforming Use\na. Except as provided for in Subsections (b) through (f), no nonconforming use shall be\nextended, enlarged, or replaced.\nb.\nAny single-family residential nonconforming use (which may be a manufactured home)\nmay be enlarged or replaced with a similar single-family residential structure of the same\nsize or of a larger size, so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new\nnonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to setback\nrequirements.\nC.\nA nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building\nthat, when the use was made nonconforming by this Ordinance, was manifestly designed\nor arranged to accommodate such use. However, a nonconforming use may not be\nextended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building unless specifically\nauthorized in accordance with Subsection (f).\nd. A nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was\noccupied by that use when it became nonconforming, except that a use that involves the\nremoval of natural materials from the lot (e.g., a sand pit) may be expanded to the limits\nof the site plan upon which the mining permit was granted if ten percent or more of the\nnatural materials had already been removed on the effective date of this Ordinance.\ne. The volume, intensity, or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming use exists\nmay be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a\nnonconforming use exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to\nchanges in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind or use and no violations of\nother Sections of this Ordinance occur.\nf. Any other nonconforming use may be extended, enlarged, or replaced only upon the\nissuance of a special exception if the Board of Adjustment finds that, in completing the\nextension, enlargement, or replacement work:\ni.\nThere is no increase in the total amount of lot area devoted to the nonconforming\nuse;\nii.\nThere is no greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as\nsetback requirements, height limitations, or density requirements or other\nrequirements such as parking, loading and landscaping requirements; and\niii. There is no significant adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health\nor safety.\nIn issuing a special exception, the Board of Adjustment may affix other reasonable\nand appropriate conditions such as, but not limited to, landscaping and buffering to\nseparate dissimilar uses or to screen parking and loading areas.

Nonconforming Structures\n1. Continuance of Nonconforming Structure\nAny nonconforming structure legally existing at the time of adoption or amendment of this\nOrdinance may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful.\n2.\nConditions for Continuance\nSuch nonconforming structures shall be subject to the following conditions:\na.\nNo nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in any way which increases its\ndimensional deficiencies; however, any nonconforming structure or portion thereof may\nbe altered to decrease its dimensional deficiencies. Any enlargement of the structure\nshall conform to the current dimensional requirements.\nb. In the event of damage by fire or other causes to the extent exceeding sixty percent of its\ntax value prior to such damage as established by the Building Inspector, reconstruction of\na nonconforming structure shall be permitted only in compliance with the dimensional\nprovisions of this Ordinance.\nC.\nIn the event of damage by fire or other causes to the extent causing less than sixty\npercent of its tax value prior to such damage as established by the Building Inspector,\nreconstruction of a nonconforming structure shall be permitted provided it is constructed:\ni.\nIn the same manner in which it originally existed subject to compliance with the\nrequirements of the NC State Building Code; or\nii. In compliance with the dimensional requirements.\nd. No nonconforming structure shall be moved or relocated unless it is made to comply with\nthe dimensional and use requirements of the district in which it is relocated and with the\nrequirements of the NC State Building Code.\n3. Preservation of Safe or Lawful Conditions\nNothing in this Ordinance shall prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe or lawful\ncondition any part of any building declared unsafe or unlawful by the County Building\nInspector or other duly authorized official.\nE. Miscellaneous Nonconforming Situations\n1. Nonconforming Situation Resulting from Governmental Acquisition\nAny lot reduced in size by municipal, county or state condemnation or purchase of land shall\nobtain nonconforming lot or building status to the extent that said condemnation or purchase\ncauses noncompliance with any provisions of this Ordinance.\n2. Nonconforming Parking Created by Change of Use\nWhenever a change of use that does not involve the enlargement of an existing structure is\nproposed for a lot on which the parking requirements of this Ordinance for the proposed new\nuse cannot be met due to insufficient lot area, the proposed change of use shall not be\nregarded as an impermissible extension or enlargement of a nonconforming situation.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 179 of 250\n"}, {"page": "180", "text": "However, the permit-issuing authority shall require that the parking requirements be satisfied\nto the extent possible utilizing the lot area that is available and may require that satellite\nparking space be obtained.\nF. Nonconforming Projects\nAll nonconforming projects on which construction was begun at least 180 days before the\neffective date of his Ordinance as well as all nonconforming projects that are at least ten percent\ncompleted in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date of this Ordinance\nmay be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits, so long as these permits were\nvalidly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired. If a development is designed to be\ncompleted in stages, this Section shall apply only to the particular phase under construction. In\naddition, as provided in NCGS 160D-108(c), neither this Ordinance nor any amendment to it\nshall, without the written consent of the property owner, affect any lot with respect to which a\ndevelopment permit application has been submitted and subsequently issued pursuant to NCGS\n143-755 prior to the enactment of the Ordinance making the change so long as the development\npermit remains valid, unexpired, and unrevoked.\nG. Nonconforming Signs\n1. Continuance of Nonconforming Signs\na. Signs in existence on the effective date of this Ordinance which do not conform to the\nprovisions of this Ordinance, but which were constructed, erected, affixed or maintained\nin compliance with all previous regulations, shall be regarded as nonconforming signs.\nAlthough it is not the intent of this Ordinance to encourage the continued use of\nnonconforming signs, nonconforming signs shall be allowed to continue and a decision\nas to the continued existence and use or removal of such signs shall be controlled as\nfollows:\ni.\nNo nonconforming sign shall be changed to another nonconforming sign.\nii.\nNo nonconforming sign shall have any changes made in the words or symbols used\nor the message displayed on the sign unless the sign is specifically designed for\nperiodic change of message.\niii. No nonconforming sign shall be structurally altered so as to change the shape, size,\ntype or design of the sign other than to make the sign a conforming sign.\niv. No nonconforming sign shall be re-established after the activity, business or use to\nwhich it relates has been discontinued and such sign shall be removed.\nV.\nNo nonconforming sign shall be re-established and all remains of the sign must be\nremoved after damage or destruction, if the estimated expense of repairs exceeds\nfifty percent of the estimated total value of the sign at the time of destruction, as\ndetermined by the Building Inspector. If damaged by less than fifty percent, but\nrepairs are not made within three months of the time such damage occurred, the\nnonconforming sign shall not be allowed to continue and must be removed.\nvi. No nonconforming sign shall be relocated unless it is brought into conformance with\nthe requirements of this Ordinance.\nvii. Normal maintenance and repair of a nonconforming sign is permitted providing the\nshape, size, type or design of the sign is not altered.\nb. Any nonconforming sign that is structurally altered, relocated or replaced shall\nimmediately be brought into compliance with all the provisions of this Ordinance.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 180 of 250\n"}, {"page": "181", "text": "C.

Violations of Nonconforming Sign Provisions\nThe Zoning Administrator shall order the removal of any sign maintained in violation of the\nprovisions of this Section for which removal procedures are herein prescribed, accordingly:\nthe Zoning Administrator shall give ninety days written notice to the owner or lessee to\nremove the sign or to bring it into compliance with this Ordinance. If the owner or lessee fails\nto remove the sign within ninety days after the ninety-day written notice has been given, the\nZoning Administrator or his duly authorized representative may institute removal proceedings\naccording to the procedures specified in NCGS 153A-123.\nSection 13. Appeals, Variances, Interpretations\nA. Appeals\n1. Any person who has standing under NCGS 160D-1402(d), including the County, may appeal\nan administrative decision to the Board of Adjustment. Pursuant to NCGS 160D-405, a stop\nwork order issued by the Zoning Administrator may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment.\nAn appeal is taken by filing with the Zoning Administrator and the Board of Adjustment a\nwritten notice of appeal specifying the grounds for appeal. A notice of appeal shall be\nconsidered filed with the Zoning Administrator and the Board of Adjustment when delivered to\nthe Planning Department, the required filing fee paid, and the date and time of filing entered\non the notice by Planning Department staff.\n2. The official who made the decision shall give written notice to the owner of the property that\nis the subject of the decision and to the party who sought the decision, if different from the\nowner. The written notice shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first-\nclass mail. The owner or other party has 30 days from receipt of the written notice within\nwhich to file an appeal. Any other person with standing to appeal has 30 days from receipt\nfrom any source of actual or constructive notice of the decision within which to file an appeal.\nIn the absence of evidence to the contrary, notice given pursuant to NCGS 160D-403(b) by\nfirst-class mail shall be deemed received on the third business day following deposit of the\nnotice for mailing with the United States Postal Service.\n3. It is conclusively presumed that all persons with standing to appeal have constructive notice\nof the decision from the date a sign containing the words \"Zoning Decision\" or \"Subdivision\nDecision\" in letters at least six inches high and identifying the means to contact an official for\ninformation about the decision is prominently posted on the property for at least 10 days.\nPosting of the signs is not the only form of constructive notice. Any such posting is the\nresponsibility of the landowner or applicant. Verification of the posting shall be provided to\nthe official who made the decision. Posting of signs is not required.\n4. Whenever an appeal is filed, the Zoning Administrator shall transmit to the Board of\nAdjustment all documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the decision\nappealed from is taken. The Zoning Administrator shall also provide a copy of the record to\nthe appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal if the appellant\nis not the owner.\n5. An appeal stays enforcement of the action appealed from and accrual of any fines assessed\nduring the pendency of the appeal to the Board of Adjustment and any subsequent appeal in\naccordance with NCGS 160D-1402 or during the pendency of any civil proceeding authorized\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 181 of 250\n"}, {"page": "182", "text": "by law or appeals therefrom, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board of\nAdjustment that because of facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril to\nlife or property, or because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere\nwith enforcement of this Ordinance. In that case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by\na restraining order which may be granted by a court.\n6. Upon appeal of a stop work order issued by the Zoning Administrator, no further work or\nactivity shall take place in violation of the stop work order pending a ruling on the appeal.\nViolation of a stop work order shall constitute a Class 1 misdemeanor.\n7. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request\nfor an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board of Adjustment shall meet to hear the\nappeal within 15 days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding any other provision of\nthis Section, appeals of decisions granting a development approval or otherwise affirming\nthat a proposed use of property is consistent with the ordinance does not stay the further\nreview of an application for development approvals to use the property. In these situations,\nthe appellant or County may request and the board may grant a stay of a final decision of\ndevelopment approval applications including building permits affected by the issue being\nappealed.\n8. The official who made the decision (or the person currently occupying that position if the\ndecision-maker is no longer employed by the County) shall be present at the evidentiary\nhearing as a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated in\nthe notice of appeal. If any party or the County would be unduly prejudiced by the\npresentation of matters not presented in the notice of appeal, the board shall continue the\nhearing to another date.\n9. The Board shall determine contested facts and make its decision within a reasonable time.\nWhen hearing an appeal, the Board may reverse or affirm (wholly or partly) or may modify the\norder, requirement or decision or determination appealed from and shall make any order,\nrequirement, decision or determination that in its opinion ought to be made in the case before\nit. To this end, the Board of Adjustment shall have all the powers of the officer from whom\nthe appeal is taken.\n10. The parties to an appeal that has been made under this subsection may agree to mediation\nor other forms of alternative dispute resolution. The ordinance may set standards and\nprocedures to facilitate and manage such voluntary alternative dispute resolution.\nB. Variances\n1. General\na. An application for a variance along with the required filing fee shall be submitted to the\nBoard of Adjustment by filing a copy of the application with the Zoning Administrator.\nb. When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of a zoning\nregulation, the board of adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of the regulation upon\na showing of all of the following:\ni.\nUnnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the regulation. It is\nnot necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable\nuse can be made of the property.\nii.\nThe hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as\nlocation, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as\nwell as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or\nthe general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance. A variance may be\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 182 of 250\n"}, {"page": "183", "text": "granted when necessary and appropriate to make a reasonable accommodation\nunder the Federal Fair Housing Act for a person with a disability.\niii. The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner.\nThe act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may\njustify the granting of a variance is not a self-created hardship.\niv. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the\nregulation, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.\nV. The variance will neither result in the extension of a nonconforming situation in\nviolation of Section 13.0 nor authorize the initiation of a nonconforming use of land.\nC.\nIn granting variances, the Board of Adjustment may impose such reasonable conditions\nas will ensure that the use of the property to which the variance applies will be as\ncompatible as practicable with the surrounding properties, provided such conditions are\nreasonably related to the condition or circumstance that gives rise to the need for a\nvariance. No change in permitted uses may be authorized by a variance.\nd. A variance may be issued for an indefinite duration or for a specified duration only.\nUnless otherwise specified, any order or decision of the Board of Adjustment granting a\nvariance shall expire if the applicant does not obtain a building permit or certificate of\noccupancy for such use within 60 days from the date of the decision or if construction of\nthe use has not commenced within 180 days from the date of the issuance of a building\npermit.\ne.\nThe nature of the variance and any conditions attached to it shall be entered on the face\nof the zoning permit, or the zoning permit may simply note the issuance of the variance\nand refer to the written record of the variance for further information. All such conditions\nare enforceable in the same manner as any other applicable requirement of this Ordi-\nnance.\n2. Variances from Watershed District Overlay Requirements\na.\nMinor Variances. Minor variances, as defined in Section 15, to the provisions of (Section\n7(A)) may be approved by the Board of Adjustment pursuant to the procedures outlined\nin this Ordinance. The Zoning Administrator shall keep a record of all such minor\nvariances and shall submit, for each calendar year, the record to the Water Quality\nDivision of the NC Department of Environment and Natural Resources on or before\nJanuary 1st of the following year. The record shall include a description of each project\nreceiving a variance and the reasons for granting the variance.\nb. Major Variances. Major variances, as defined in Section 15 shall be reviewed by the\nBoard of Adjustment pursuant to the procedures outlined in this Ordinance and a\nrecommendation prepared for submission to the NC Environmental Management\nCommission (EMC). The record of a major variance review shall include the following\nitems:\ni.\nThe variance application;\nii.\nThe hearing notices;\niii. The evidence presented;\niv.

If the EMC approves\nthe variance as proposed, the Board of Adjustment shall prepare a final decision\ngranting the proposed variance. If the EMC approves the variance with conditions\nand stipulations, the Board of Adjustment shall prepare a final decision, including\nsuch conditions and stipulations, granting the proposed variance. If the EMC denies\nthe variance request, the Board of Adjustment shall prepare a final decision denying\nthe variance.\n3. Variances from Airport Overlay Requirements\na. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth\nof any tree, or use property not in compliance with the regulations prescribed in Section\n7(C) may apply to the Board of Adjustment for a variance in accordance with the\nprovisions of Section 13(B). The application for variance shall be accompanied by a\ndetermination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on\nthe operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace.\nSuch variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or\nenforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief, if granted,\nwill not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do\nsubstantial justice and will be in accordance with the spirit of this Section. Additionally, no\napplication for a variance to the requirements of Section 7(C) may be considered by the\nBoard of Adjustment unless a copy of this application has been furnished to the manager\nof the Pitt-Greenville Airport for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the\nAirport Manager does not respond to the application within thirty days after receipt, the\nBoard of Adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny said application.\nb. Any variance granted, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of\nSection 7(C) and be reasonable in the circumstances, may be so conditioned as to\nrequire the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate or maintain, at the\nowner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by\nthe Board of Adjustment, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit\nthe Pitt-Greenville Airport Authority, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain\nthe necessary markings and lights.\nC. Interpretations\nInterpretations of the location of floodway and floodplain boundary lines may be made by the\nFloodplain Manager as provided in Section 7(B).\nD. Requests to be Heard Within a Reasonable Time\nThe Board of Adjustment shall determine contested facts and make its decision within a\nreasonable time, consistent with the need to follow regularly established agenda procedures,\nprovide notice in accordance with Section 13(H), and obtain the necessary information to make\nsound decisions.\nE. Burden of Proof in Appeals and Variances\n1.\nWhen an appeal is taken to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with Section 13(A), the\nZoning Administrator shall have the initial burden of presenting to the Board of Adjustment\nsufficient evidence and argument to justify the order or decision appealed from. The burden\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 184 of 250\n"}, {"page": "185", "text": "of presenting evidence and argument to the contrary then shifts to the appellant, who shall\nalso have the burden of persuasion.\n2. The burden of presenting evidence sufficient to allow the Board of Adjustment to reach the\nconclusions set forth in Section 13(B)(1)(b), as well as the burden of persuasion on those\nissues, remains with the applicant seeking the variance.\nF. Board Action on Appeals and Variances\n1. With respect to appeals, a motion to reverse, affirm, or modify the order, requirement,\ndecision, or determination appealed from shall include, insofar as practicable, a statement of\nthe specific reasons or findings of facts that support the motion. If a motion to reverse or\nmodify is not made or fails to receive the simple majority vote necessary for adoption, then\nthe motion is not approved.\n2. Before granting a variance, the Board of Adjustment must take a vote and vote affirmatively\n(by a 4/5 majority) on the required findings stated in Subsection 13(B)(1)(b). Insofar as\npracticable, a motion to make an affirmative finding on each of the requirements set forth in\nsubsection 13(B)(1)(b) shall include a statement of the specific reasons or findings of fact\nsupporting such motion.\n3. A motion to deny a variance may be made on the basis that any one or more of the five\ncriteria set forth in subsection 13(B)(1)(b) are not satisfied or that the application is\nincomplete. Insofar as practicable, such a motion shall include a statement of the specific\nreasons or findings of fact that support it. This motion is adopted as the Board of\nAdjustment's decision if supported by more than one fifth of the Board's membership\n(excluding vacant seats).\nG. Hearing Procedures Required on Appeals and Variances\n1. Before making a decision on an appeal or an application for a variance, the Board of Adjust-\nment shall hold an evidentiary hearing on the appeal or application using quasi-judicial\nprocedures.\n2. The applicant, the County, and any person who would have standing to appeal the decision\nunder NCGS 160D-1402(c) shall have the right to participate as a party at the evidentiary\nhearing. Other witnesses may present competent, material, and substantial evidence that is\nnot repetitive as allowed by the board.\n3. The Board of Adjustment may place reasonable and equitable limitations on the presentation\nof evidence and arguments and the cross-examination of witnesses so that the matter at\nissue may be heard and decided without undue delay.\n4. The Zoning Administrator shall transmit to the Board all applications, reports, and written\nmaterials relevant to the matter being considered. The administrative materials may be\ndistributed to the members of the Board prior to the hearing if at the same time they are\ndistributed to the Board a copy is also provided to the appellant or applicant and to the\nlandowner if that person is not the appellant or applicant. The administrative materials shall\nbecome a part of the hearing record. The administrative materials may be provided in written\nor electronic form. Objections to inclusion or exclusion of administrative materials may be\nmade before or during the hearing. Rulings on unresolved objections shall be made by the\nboard at the hearing.\n5. Objections regarding jurisdictional and evidentiary issues, including, but not limited to, the\ntimeliness of an appeal or the standing of a party, may be made to the Board. The Board\nChair shall rule on any objections, and the Chair's rulings may be appealed to the full Board.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 185 of 250\n"}, {"page": "186", "text": "These rulings are also subject to judicial review pursuant to NCGS 160D-1402.

Appeals shall be filed within the\ntimes specified in NCGS 160D-1405(d).\nH. Notice of Hearing\nThe Zoning Administrator shall give notice of any evidentiary hearing required by Section 13(G)\nas follows:\n1. Notice of the evidentiary hearing shall be mailed to the person or entity whose appeal,\napplication, or request is the subject of the hearing; to the owner of the property that is the\nsubject of the hearing if the owner did not initiate the hearing; to the owners of all parcels of\nland abutting the parcel of land that is the subject of the hearing; and to any other persons\nentitled to receive notice as provided by this Ordinance. In the absence of evidence to the\ncontrary, the person mailing the notices may rely on the county tax listing to determine\nowners of property entitled to mailed notice.\n2. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least 10 days, but not more than 25 days, prior to\nthe date of the hearing. Within that same time period, notice of the hearing shall also be\nprominently posted on the site that is the subject of the hearing or on an adjacent street or\nhighway right-of-way.\n3. The mailed notice required by this Section shall state the date, time and place of the hearing,\nreasonably identify the property that is the subject of the application or appeal, and give a\nbrief description of the action requested or proposed.\n4.

Evidence\n1. The provisions of this Section apply to all hearings for which a notice is required by Section\n13(G).\n2. All persons who intend to present evidence to the Board of Adjustment, rather than argu-\nments only, shall be sworn. The Chair of the Board or any member acting as Chair and the\nClerk to the Board are authorized to administer oaths to witnesses in any matter coming\nbefore the Board. Any person who, while under oath during a proceeding before the Board\ndetermining a quasi-judicial matter, willfully swears falsely is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\n3. All findings and conclusions necessary to the issuance or denial of the requested appeal or\nvariance (crucial findings) shall be based upon competent, material, and substantial evidence\nin the record.\n4.

As provided in NCGS 160D-108(c), amendments to this Ordinance shall not be applicable or\nenforceable without consent of the owner with regard to any of the following:\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 187 of 250\n"}, {"page": "188", "text": "a. Buildings or uses of buildings or land for which a development permit application has\nbeen submitted and subsequently issued in accordance with G.S. 143-755;\nb. Subdivisions of land for which a development permit application authorizing the\nsubdivision has been submitted and subsequently issued in accordance with G.S. 143-\n755;\nC. A site-specific vesting plan pursuant to G.S. 160D-108.1 and the provisions of Section\n3(V)(3) of this Ordinance;\nd. A multi-phased development pursuant to Section 3(V)(4) of this Ordinance; or\ne. A vested right established by the terms of a development agreement authorized by Article\n10, Chapter 160D of the North Carolina General Statutes.\nB. Initiation of Amendments\n1. Any person or organization may petition the Board of Commissioners to amend this Ordi-\nnance. The petition shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator and shall include, among the\ninformation deemed relevant by the Zoning Administrator:\na. The name, address, and phone number of the applicant. If the applicant is not the\nproperty owner, then a notarized signature of the property owner is required on the\napplication unless amendment is initiated by Pitt County;\nb. A metes and bounds description and a scaled map of the land affected by the\namendment if a change in zoning district classification is proposed; and\nC.

No amendment to zoning regulations or a zoning map that down-zones property shall be\ninitiated nor is it enforceable without the written consent of all property owners whose\nproperty is the subject of the down-zoning amendment, unless the down-zoning amendment\nis initiated by Pitt County. Pursuant to NCGS 160D-601, \"down-zoning\" means a zoning\nordinance that affects an area of land in one of the following ways:\na. By decreasing the development density of the land to be less dense than was allowed\nunder its previous usage.\nb. By reducing the permitted uses of the land that are specified in a zoning ordinance or\nland development regulation to fewer uses than were allowed under its previous usage.\nC. Planning Board Review and Recommendation\n1. Upon receipt of a petition for an amendment, the Zoning Administrator shall forward the\nrequest to the Planning Board for its consideration.\n2.\nThe Planning Board shall review the proposed amendment, along with planning staff\nrecommendations and any comments received from applicable reviewing departments and\nagencies, and shall advise and comment on whether the proposed action is consistent with\nthe adopted Comprehensive Land Use Plan and any other officially adopted plan that is\napplicable.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 188 of 250\n"}, {"page": "189", "text": "3. The Planning Board shall provide a written recommendation to the Board of Commissioners\nthat addresses plan consistency and other matters as deemed appropriate by the Planning\nBoard. A statement by the Planning Board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with\nthe Comprehensive Land Use Plan shall not preclude consideration or approval of the\nproposed amendment by the Board of Commissioners. If a zoning map amendment\nproposes to change the zoning designation of more than 50 properties, owned by at least 50\ndifferent property owners, the Planning Board statement describing plan consistency may\naddress the overall rezoning and describe how the analysis and policies in the relevant\nadopted plans were considered in the recommendation made.\n4. The Planning Board shall have 30 days from the date of the Planning Board meeting at which\nthe petition is reviewed to submit its written recommendation. Failure of the Planning Board to\nsubmit its recommendation within this time period shall constitute a favorable\nrecommendation.\nD. Board of Commissioners Review and Adoption\n1. Upon receipt of a recommendation from the Planning Board, the Zoning Administrator shall\nconsult with the Clerk to the Board to establish and schedule a legislative hearing before the\nBoard of Commissioners on the petition. The public notice required for the hearing shall be in\naccordance with Section 14(E).\n2.\nAt the conclusion of a legislative hearing on the proposed amendment, the Board of\nCommissioners may proceed to vote on the proposed amendment, refer it to a committee for\nfurther study, or take any other action consistent with its usual rules of procedure.\n3. When adopting or rejecting any zoning text or map amendment, the Board of Commissioners\nshall adopt a brief statement describing whether its action is consistent or inconsistent with\nthe Comprehensive Land Use Plan. The requirement for a plan consistency statement may\nalso be met by a clear indication in the minutes of the Board of Commissioners that at the\ntime of action on the amendment the Board was aware of and considered the Planning\nBoard's recommendations and any relevant portions of the Comprehensive Land Use Plan.\nIf a zoning map amendment is adopted and the action was deemed inconsistent with the\nadopted plan, the zoning amendment shall have the effect of also amending any future land-\nuse map in the approved plan, and no additional request or application for a plan amendment\nshall be required. A plan amendment and a zoning amendment may be considered\nconcurrently. The plan consistency statement is not subject to judicial review.\n4. When adopting or rejecting any petition for a zoning map amendment, a statement analyzing\nthe reasonableness of the proposed rezoning shall be approved by the Board of\nCommissioners. This statement of reasonableness may consider, among other factors, (i)\nthe size, physical conditions, and other attributes of the area proposed to be rezoned, (ii) the\nbenefits and detriments to the landowners, the neighbors, and the surrounding community,\n(iii) the relationship between the current actual and permissible development on the tract and\nadjoining areas and the development that would be permissible under the proposed\namendment; (iv) why the action taken is in the public interest; and (v) any changed conditions\nwarranting the amendment. If a zoning map amendment proposes to change the zoning\ndesignation of more than 50 properties, owned by at least 50 different property owners, under\nNCGS 160D-602(b), the statement by the Board of Commissioners on reasonableness may\naddress the overall rezoning.\n5. If the Planning Board has not provided a recommendation within the timeframe specified in\nSection 14(C), the Board of Commissioners need not await the recommendation of the Plan-\nning Board before taking action on a proposed amendment nor is the Board of Commission-\ners bound by any recommendations of the Planning Board that are before it at the time it\ntakes action on a proposed amendment.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 189 of 250\n"}, {"page": "190", "text": "6. The Board of Commissioners is not required to take final action on a proposed amendment\nwithin any specific period of time, but it should proceed as expeditiously as practicable on\npetitions for amendments since inordinate delays can result in the petitioner incurring unnec-\nessary costs.\n7. Voting on amendments to this Ordinance shall proceed in the same manner as other ordi-\nnances.\n8. Decisions by the Board of Commissioners on amendment requests shall be filed in the offices\nof the Planning Department.\nE. Legislative Hearing Requirements\n1.\nNo ordinance that amends any of the provisions of this Ordinance may be adopted until a\nlegislative hearing has been held on such ordinance.\n2. Notice of the hearing shall be given once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper\nhaving general circulation in the County. The notice shall be published for the first time not\nless than ten days nor more than twenty-five days before the date scheduled for the hearing.\nIn computing this period, the date of publication is not to be included but the date of the\nhearing shall be included.\n3. The owners of affected parcels of land and the owners of all parcels of land abutting and\nwithin 500 feet of that parcel of land shall be mailed a notice of the hearing on a proposed\nzoning map amendment by first-class mail at the last addresses listed for such owners on the\ncounty tax abstracts. For the purpose of this section, properties are \"abutting\" even if\nseparated by a street, railroad, or other transportation corridor. This notice must be\ndeposited in the mail at least 10 but not more than 25 days prior to the date of the hearing.\nThe Zoning Administrator shall prominently post a sign on the site proposed for the\namendment or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way. The notice shall be\nposted within the same time period specified for mailed notices of the hearing. When multiple\nparcels are included within a proposed zoning map amendment, posting of signs on each\nindividual parcel is not required, but the Zoning Administrator shall post a sufficient number of\nsigns to reasonably inform interested persons of the proposed amendment. The Zoning\nAdministrator may take any other action deemed to be useful or appropriate to give notice of\nthe hearing.\n4. The notice required in Section 14(E)(3) shall not be required if the zoning map amendment\ndirectly affects more than 50 properties, owned by a total of at least 50 different property\nowners. In this instance, the County may elect to make the mailed notice provided for in\nSection 14(E)(3) or, as an alternative, elect to publish notice of the hearing as provided by\nSection 14(E)(2), provided that the advertisement shall not be less than one-half of a\nnewspaper page in size. The advertisement shall only be effective for property owners who\nreside in the area of general circulation of the newspaper that publishes the notice. Property\nowners who reside outside the County's jurisdiction or outside of the newspaper circulation\narea, according to the address listed on the most recent property tax listing for the affected\nproperty, shall be notified by mail pursuant to Section 14(E)(3). The person or persons mail-\ning the notices shall certify to the Board of Commissioners that fact, and the certificates shall\nbe deemed conclusive in the absence of fraud. In addition to the published notice, the County\nshall post one or more prominent signs immediately adjacent to the subject area reasonably\ncalculated to give public notice of the proposed rezoning.\n5. The mailed and published notice required by this Section shall:\na. State the date, time, and place of the legislative hearing;\nb. Summarize the nature and character of the proposed change;\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 190 of 250\n"}, {"page": "191", "text": "C. If the proposed amendment involves a change in zoning district classification, reasonably\nidentify the property whose classification would be affected by the amendment;\ne.

The person or persons mailing notices pursuant to Sections 14(E)(3) and 14(E)(4) shall\ncertify to the Board of Commissioners that fact.\nF. Ultimate Issue Before Board of Commissioners on Amendments\nIn deciding whether to adopt a proposed amendment to this Ordinance, the central issue before\nthe Board of Commissioners is whether the proposed amendment advances the public health,\nsafety or welfare. When considering proposed map amendments:\n1. Except for rezoning requests submitted in accordance with Section 14(G), the Board of\nCommissioners shall not consider any representations made by the petitioner that, if the\nchange is granted, the rezoned property will be used for only one of the possible range of\nuses permitted in the requested classification. Rather, the Board of Commissioners shall\nconsider whether the entire range of permitted uses in the requested classification is more\nappropriate than the range of uses in the existing classification.\n2. The Board of Commissioners shall not regard as controlling any advantages or\ndisadvantages to the individual requesting the change, but shall consider the impact of the\nproposed change on the public at large.\nG. Conditional Zoning Districts\n1. There are circumstances in which a conventional zoning district designation allowing a use by\nright would not be appropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could, if\nproperly planned, be appropriate for the property and consistent with the objectives of this\nOrdinance, county planning policies, and adopted land use plans. The review process\nestablished in this Section provides for the accommodation of such uses by a reclassification\nof property into a conditional zoning district, subject to specific conditions that ensure\ncompatibility of the use with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties.\n2. Property may be placed in a conditional district only in response to a petition by all owners of\nthe property to be included. With the exception of specific uses listed in Table 5-1 that\nrequire a conditional zoning district for approval, the conditional zoning district procedure is\nvoluntary and is intended for firm development proposals. It is not intended or suited for\nsecuring early zoning for tentative proposals that may not be undertaken for some time.\n3. Decisions on the establishment of conditional zoning districts are a legislative process subject\nto the same procedures and standard of review as apply to conventional zoning district\ndecisions. No conditional zoning district shall be established until after the person proposing\nthe district has submitted a petition for the reclassification of property and the Board of\nCommissioners has approved such petition in accordance with the procedures delineated in\nSections 14(B) through 14(D).\n4.\nAny use permitted under this process must also conform to the development regulations for\nthe corresponding conventional zoning district unless more restrictive regulations or\nconditions are specifically proposed by the applicant as part of the conditional zoning or\nplanned development approval process. Uses that may be proposed and considered for a\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 191 of 250\n"}, {"page": "192", "text": "conditional zoning district shall be restricted to those uses permitted in the underlying\nconventional zoning district either by right or by special use permit. If the proposed use is one\nallowed by special use permit, it shall be reviewed and approved by the Board of Com-\nmissioners rather than the Board of Adjustment.\n5. Every petition for the reclassification of property to a conditional zoning district shall be\naccompanied by a sketch plan or site plan containing the requisite information specified in\nSection 15. In the course of evaluating the proposed request, the Board of Commissioners\nmay request additional information deemed appropriate to provide a complete analysis of the\nproposal.\n6. The Board of Commissioners may approve the reclassification of property to a conditional\nzoning district only upon determining that the proposed use will meet all standards and\nrequirements in these regulations that are applicable to the proposed use. In approving a\npetition for the reclassification of property to a conditional zoning district, the Planning Board\nmay recommend and the Board of Commissioners may attach reasonable and appropriate\nconditions to approval of the petition.\nConditions and site-specific standards imposed in a conditional zoning district shall be limited\nto those that address the conformance of the development and use of the site to County\nordinances, plans adopted pursuant to NCGS 160D-501, or the impacts reasonably expected\nto be generated by the development or use of the site. Only those conditions mutually\napproved by the Board of Commissioners and consented to by the petitioner in writing may\nbe incorporated into the zoning regulations.\n7.\nIf a petition is approved under this Section, the district that is established, the approved\npetition and sketch plan, and all conditions which may have been attached to the approval\nare binding on the property as an amendment to this Ordinance and to the zoning map. All\nsubsequent development and use of the property shall be in accordance with the standards\nand attached conditions for the approved conditional zoning district, the approved petition,\nand approved sketch plan. All uses that are permitted in the approved conditional zoning\ndistrict shall comply with the applicable permit and site plan approval procedures as required\nin Section 3 of this Ordinance. Only those uses and structures indicated in the approved peti-\ntion and sketch plan shall be allowed on the subject property. Any uses and structures on the\nsubject property shall also comply with all standards and requirements for development in the\nunderlying conventional zoning district unless more restrictive regulations or conditions are\nspecifically proposed by the applicant as part of the conditional zoning process.\n8. Following the approval of the petition for a conditional zoning district, the subject property\nshall be identified on the zoning map by the appropriate district designation. A conditional\nzoning district shall be identified by the same designation as the underlying conventional\nzoning district followed by the letters 'CD' (for example, R40-CD).\n9. Except as provided in Section 14(G)(10), changes to the approved petition or to the\nconditions attached to the approval shall be treated the same as amendments to this\nOrdinance or to the zoning map and shall be processed in accordance with the procedures in\nthis Ordinance.\n10. Minor modifications to conditional zoning district standards (including approved special use\npermits and site plans) may be reviewed and approved by the Zoning Administrator. For\npurposes of this Section, minor modifications are those that do not involve a change in uses\npermitted or the density of overall development permitted.\nIf multiple parcels of land are subject to a conditional zoning district, the owners of individual\nparcels may apply for modification of the conditions so long as the modification would not\nresult in other properties failing to meet the terms of the conditions. Any modifications\napproved apply only to those properties whose owners petition for the modification.\nZoning Ordinance\nPage 192 of 250\n"}, {"page": "193", "text": "11. No sooner than one year after the date of approval of the petition, the Zoning Administrator\nshall inspect the use and maintenance of the subject property to ensure the use has been\nestablished and is in continued compliance with this Ordinance, the approved petition and\nsite plan, and any conditions attached by the Board of Commissioners to approval of the\npetition. If the Zoning Administrator determines that the development is not in accordance\nwith the approved petition, site plan, and conditions, the Zoning Administrator shall either\ninitiate a reclassification of the property in accordance with the procedures established in this\nOrdinance or shall forward a report to the Board of Commissioners recommending that the\nproperty be reclassified to the original zoning district or to another district.\nH. Amendments to Watershed Protection Provisions\nThe Zoning Administrator shall keep a record of all text amendments to this Ordinance that\ninvolve regulations, standards, or procedures regarding public water supply watersheds as\noutlined in Section 7(A). Copies of all such amendments shall, upon adoption, be provided to the\nSupervisor of the Classification and Standards Group, Water Quality Division of the Department\nof Environment and Natural Resources. Under no circumstances shall an amendment be adopted\nwhich would cause this Ordinance to violate the public water supply watershed rules as adopted\nby the NC Environmental Management Commission.\nI.\nWithdrawal of Amendment Petition\nThe petitioner shall have the right to withdraw, in writing, an amendment petition at any time prior\nto a final decision by the Board of Commissioners. However, petitions that have been withdrawn\nshall be reconsidered only as a new petition and shall adhere to the submission and review\nrequirements of Sections 14(A) through 14(F).\nJ. Petition Resubmittal\nIf an amendment petition is denied by the Board of County Commissioners, the Zoning\nAdministrator shall not accept a rezoning petition similar to that denied for the same property or a\nportion of the property within one year of the Board's action, except that the Zoning Administrator\nmay accept a new rezoning petition within the one-year period if the Zoning Administrator\ndetermines that:\n1. There has been a significant change in the zoning district classification of an adjacent\nproperty;\n2. A new or updated land use plan that changes public policy regarding the property is adopted\nby the County;\n3. Public facilities such as roads, water lines, sewer lines, or other infrastructure are constructed\nor expanded to serve the property and enable the proposed development to be\naccommodated; or\n4. There has been some other significant change, other than a change in ownership of the\nproperty, which might justify waiving the one-year restriction on submitting a new petition.\nK. Notification of Decision\nWithin five working days of any action by the Board of County Commissioners on an amendment\npetition, notice of such action shall be sent by first-class mail to the petitioner and any other\npersons who have indicated to the Zoning Administrator, in writing, that they would like the\ndecision mailed to them.
