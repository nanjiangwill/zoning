GENERAL\nThe Conditional Zoning districts set forth herein are authorized by N.C. Gen Stat. $160D-703 and\nare intended to modify the uses to which the parallel zoning district is restricted. Generally, an\napplicant, by seeking to rezone property to a Conditional Zoning district, will propose to restrict\nor eliminate Permitted or Special Uses. Request for Conditional Zoning district rezoning shall be\nprocessed administratively in the same manner as for amendments to this ordinance as\nestablished in Article XIV.\nConditional Zoning districts are floating districts that parallel general zoning districts. Conditional\nZoning districts are identical to their corresponding general zoning districts in all respects except\nthat a permit is required as a prerequisite to any use (Permitted or Special) or development\nwithin them.\nParallel Conditional Zoning districts are provided as a voluntary alternative method of petitioning\nthe Board of Commissioners for a zoning map or classification change. The owner may submit\nconditions that restrict the uses that would otherwise be allowed in the zoning district and only\nthose uses specifically requested in the application shall be considered.\nSECTION 5-502. RESTRICTIONS ON FILING OF APPLICATIONS.\nA request for a Conditional Zoning district rezoning shall be initiated only by an application\n[petition] signed by all current record owners of the property.\nSECTION 5-503.

Sign Requirements: The application shall indicate the location of signs in accordance with\nArticle XII, Sign Regulations. If the applicant proposes to vary the sign provisions for the district\nrequested, it shall be demonstrated that the public purposes to be accomplished by any such\nprovision are met to an equal or greater degree.\nD. Off-Street Parking Requirements: The application shall indicate the location of all off-\nstreet parking and internal drive areas in accordance with Article XI, Off-Street Parking and\nLoading provisions. If the applicant proposes to vary the off-street parking provisions of this\nordinance for the use requested, it shall be demonstrated that the public purposes to be\naccomplished by any such provisions are met to an equal or greater degree.\nE. Miscellaneous Provisions: The application may also set forth other conditions and\nperformance criteria, such as days an hour of operation, numbers of employees, exterior lighting,\nand noise, odor and smoke emission controls or other environmental conditions, which might be\nproposed to make the use of the property compatible with surrounding areas and uses allowed\ntherein.\nF.

If the proposed uses involve development subject to the Linden\nSubdivision Ordinance, the site plan required may be general in nature, showing a generalized\nstreet pattern, if applicable, and the location or proposed uses. If the proposed uses include\ndevelopment not subject to the Linden Subdivision Ordinance, the site plan shall be of sufficient\ndetail to allow the Planning and Inspections Staff, the Planning Board, and the Board of\nCommissioners to analyze the proposed uses and arrangement of uses on site. It shall also include\nthe footprints of all buildings to be place on the site, the proposed number of stories, and the\nlocation and number of off-street parking and loading spaces. The site plan shall show proposed\npoints of access to existing streets and internal circulation patterns. In addition, the location of\nall proposed buffers and fences shall be included on the site plan.\nSECTION 5-504. ACTION BY THE PLANNING BOARD.\nThe Planning Board may hold a public meeting during which the applicant may voluntarily make\nmodifications to the request. The Planning Board shall review the request for a Conditional\nZoning district rezoning and make a recommendation to the Board of Commissioners. When\nmaking this recommendation, the Planning Board shall issue a statement addressing the\nreasonableness of the proposed rezoning, in addition to addressing the request's consistency\nwith any comprehensive plan that has been adopted and any other officially adopted plan that is\napplicable.\n36\n"}, {"page": "38", "text": "SECTION 5-505.

Since the intent of this type of\ndistrict is to provide for workable alternative uses of property, it is intended that land will be\nzoned in accordance with firm plans to develop.

In that case, enforcement proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining\norder, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant\nmay file with the official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board of\nAdjustment shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a development approval or\notherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the ordinance shall not\nstay the further review of an application for development approvals to use such property; in\nthese situations, the appellant or local government may request and the board may grant a stay\nof a final decision of development approval applications, including building permits affected by\nthe issue being appealed.\nE.

VARIANCES.\nWhen unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of a zoning\nregulation, the Board of Adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of the zoning regulation upon\na showing of all of the following:\nA. Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the regulation. It shall\nnot be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be\nmade of the property.\nB. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location,\nsize or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships\nresulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not\nbe the basis for granting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate\nto make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a person with a\ndisability.\n100\n"}, {"page": "102", "text": "C. The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner.\nThe act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the\ngranting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.\nD. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the regulation,\nsuch that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.\nAppropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the conditions are\nreasonably related to the variance. Any variance granted becomes null and void if not exercised\nwithin the time specified in such approvals, or if no date is specified, within one calendar year\nfrom the date of such approval. No change in permitted uses may be authorized by a variance.\nThe Board of Adjustment is also not authorized to grant variances to any use approved in a\nConditional Zoning district or to the specific conditions or other performance criteria imposed\nupon such use.

Reasonable and appropriate\nconditions may be imposed upon these permits.\nA. Permitting special uses adds flexibility to this ordinance. Subject to high standards of\nplanning and design, certain property uses are allowed in the several districts where these uses\nwould not otherwise be acceptable. By means of controls exercised through the Special Use\nPermit procedures, property uses that would otherwise be undesirable in certain districts can be\ndeveloped to minimize any negative effects they might have on surrounding properties.\nB. Special Use Permits shall be granted by the Board of Adjustment as permitted for only\nthose uses enumerated in Section 4-403, Use Matrix, as Special Uses. Uses specified as a Special\nUse in Section 4-403 shall be permitted only upon the issuance of a Special Use Permit by the\nBoard of Adjustment.\nThe owner or owners of all property included in the petition for a Special Use Permit shall submit\na complete application and a detailed site plan (drawn in accordance with the specifications listed\nin Section 13-1302) to the Planning and Inspections staff.
