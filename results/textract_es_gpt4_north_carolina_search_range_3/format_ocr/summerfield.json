If such a street or alley right-of-way, railroad right-of-way, or\nutility easement forming the boundary between two separate zoning districts is abandoned or removed\nfrom dedication, the district boundaries shall be construed as following the centerline of the abandoned\nor vacated roadbed or utility easement.\n(b)\nEdge Line\nWhere a boundary line follows the edge of a street or alley right-of-way, a railroad right-of-way, or utility\neasement, the boundary shall be construed to be the edge of such street or alley right-of-way, railroad\nright-of-way, or utility easement. If such a street or alley right-of-way, railroad right-of-way, or utility\neasement forming the boundary between two separate zoning districts is abandoned or removed from\ndedication, the district boundaries shall be construed as following the edge of the abandoned or vacated\nroadbed or utility easement.\n(c)\nProperty Lines\nBoundaries shown as approximately following a property line shall be interpreted as following the property\nline as it existed when the boundary was established. If a subsequent minor adjustment (such as from\nsettlement of a boundary dispute or overlap) results in the property line moving 10' or less, the zoning\nboundary shall be interpreted as moving with the property line. In the event that a district boundary line\ndivides a lot or tract, each part so divided shall be used in conformity with the regulations established by\nthis Ordinance for the district in which said part is located.\n(d)\nWatercourses\nBoundaries shown as approximately following a river, stream, canal, lake, or other watercourse shall be\ninterpreted as following the centerline of the watercourse as it actually exists, and as moving with that\ncenterline to the extent the watercourse moves as a result of natural processes (flooding, erosion,\nsedimentation, etc.).\n(e) Watersheds\nOuter boundaries of General Watershed Area districts indicated as approximately following ridge lines or\nstreets shall be construed to follow ridge lines (the actual drainage basin boundaries).

Pursuant to GS 160D-403(c), unless otherwise specified\nby statute or local ordinance, all other development approvals expire one year after issuance unless work\nhas substantially commenced. Expiration of a development approval shall not affect the duration of a vested\nright established under this section or vested rights established under common law\n(c) Two years - Site-Specific Vesting Development Plans. A site-specific development plan shall be\nvested for two years after it is approved. Amendments shall not extend the vesting period unless\nspecified at the time of approval.\n(d) Seven years - Multi-Phase Developments. A multi-phase development approved containing 25 acres\nor more and subject to a master development plan with committed elements including a requirement to\noffer land for public use as a condition of its master development plan approval.\n(e) Exceptions.

This person may also be referred to, as appropriate, as an\n\"authorized agent.\"\n(b)\nIf there are multiple owners or other persons authorized to submit the submittal, all such persons shall\nsign the submittal or a letter or document consenting to the submittal.\n(c)\nThe burden of proof as to proper authority to file a submittal shall rest with the applicant(s). An approved\nsubmittal for development that is later found to have been submitted without proper and complete\nauthority the application and any subsequent application were void at the outset (void ab initio).\n2.\nSUBMITTAL CONTENTS\nThe Administrator is authorized to and shall establish the requirements for submittal contents and forms. The\nAdministrator may amend and update these requirements as the Administrator determines necessary.\n3.\nFEES\nTown Council shall establish and publish submittal fees and may amend and update them as the Town Council\ndetermines necessary.\n4.\nSUBMISSION AND REVIEW SCHEDULE\nThe Administrator is authorized and shall establish the submission and review requirements for development\nsubmittals. The Administrator may amend and update these requirements as determined necessary.\n5.\nSTANDARDIZED MAP PLANS\nSeveral standardized map plans are referenced in this Ordinance in association with specific types of\ndevelopment submittals. Specifications and required components of these map plans are set forth in Appendix\n1: Map Standards. This list is intended to represent types of map plans generally and does not include all\nrequired plan types, nor does it include plan types required by other agencies. The general purpose of each\nstandardized map plan is as follows:\n(a)\nSketch Plan\nThis is submitted early in the development review process to allow for comment and changes before\nsignificant time and money is invested in detailed planning. The Sketch Plan provides basic information\nabout the applicant and the proposed development. It is not formally approved or denied and is not\nbinding on either the applicant or the Town. The details required of a Sketch Plan for various development\ntypes are included in sections B through E of this Article, and in Appendix 1: Map Standards.\nTown of Summerfield, NC\nUnified Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "26", "text": "Article 3: Permits and Procedures\nPage 3-4\n(b)\nPreliminary Plat\nThis and all required attachments are submitted as the first step in the subdivision approval process.\nPreliminary plat approval authorizes the applicant to prepare and submit construction plans for all\nrequired improvements. Preliminary plat approval does not authorize the transfer of lots, does not\nauthorize the commencement of improvements, and does not authorize the commencement of any\nconstruction on the lots created.\n(c)\nFinal Plat\nApproval of installed improvements, evidence of approval of completed improvements, or submission of\ncompletion bonds is required prior to the commencement of the final plat procedure. A final plat shall\nthen be prepared to the standards of this Ordinance and submitted for approval. After review, execution\nof certifications, and approval of the final plat, it shall then be recorded with the Guilford County Register\nof Deeds and the transfer of lots may begin.\n(d)\nSite Plan\nA detailed site plan is prepared for formal review and approval. It includes specific details about the\nphysical characteristics of the parcel(s) of land. It will show the proposed size and location of buildings,\nparking areas, utility locations, driveways, water and sewer provisions, site grading and drainage, and\nlandscape buffer areas. Additional required attachments may include details for building elevations,\nsignage, tree preservation, stormwater management facilities, and other major improvements. An\napproved site plan authorizes the applicant to proceed with grading and building permits.\n(e)\nMaster Development Plan\nThis will show delineated areas where particular types of development or groups of buildings will be\nlocated, along with access and internal circulation through the development. Specific site plan or\nsubdivision submittal and approval is required prior to the commencement of any type of construction.\n(f)\nPlot Plan\nThis must be prepared and submitted by the lot owner in order to apply for a Development Clearance\nCertificate (DCC) and subsequent building permit for a principal or accessory residential structure. A plot\nplan must be drawn to scale showing the placement of a proposed home or other proposed accessory\nstructure(s).\n6.\nPRE-SUBMITTAL CONFERENCE\nPrior to the preparation, review, and approval of a subdivision, site plan, or rezoning, a pre-submittal conference\nis required. Its purpose is to obtain comments from the technical review authorities regarding the development\nof a proposed development or case. Such discussions save time, money, and effort in preparing and submitting\nnecessary plans and plats. Various departments and agencies have information, requirements, and insight\nnecessary for a successful project. It is advisable for the applicant to prepare a draft sketch plan in accordance\nwith Appendix 1: Map Standards, for the pre-submittal conference. As required for specific development types,\nthe Town will forward preliminary materials to technical review authorities which will review and make comment.\nA synopsis of information and comments will be prepared, and a copy will be forwarded to the applicant.\n7.\nINFORMATIONAL MEETING\n(a) Purpose\nInformational meetings are opportunities for informal communication between applicants, owners and\noccupants of nearby lands, and other residents who might be affected by development proposals. The\npurpose of the meeting is to educate neighbors about the proposed development and submittal, to\nreceive feedback, to address concerns, and to resolve conflicts and outstanding issues, if possible. Such\nmeetings, when required, must be held prior to a Planning Board meeting.

Posted Notice\nThe property shall be prominently posted with a notice that includes the meeting date, time,\nand place.\n(4)\nConduct of Meeting\nThe applicant shall host the meeting and he or his representative(s) will present the development\nproposal, answer questions, respond to concerns, and consider ways to resolve conflicts. Any\nbinding agreements between the applicant and neighbors shall be the responsibility of the\napplicant. No agreement shall be contingent upon the Town waiving any portion of the laws,\nprocedures, or regulations of this Ordinance.\n8.\nPRELIMINARY SUBMISSION\n(a)\nPurpose\nA preliminary submission is to assist the developer in complying with Ordinance requirements and other\napplicable State and local laws. It also provides reasonable assurance that detailed construction plans,\nand record plats have a better likelihood of approval before undertaking plan preparations. If a\ndevelopment is to be created in stages, it is required for the purpose of coordinating the entire tract, that\nthe preliminary plat or site plan be submitted for all of the land which is or likely to be included in\nsubsequent stages. All fees are due and payable upon completed submittal.\n(b)\nContent\nThe submittal shall include all required materials specified in the appendix of this Ordinance for the\npurposes of commencing review. Any submittal that is incomplete, as determined by the Administrator,\nTown of Summerfield, NC\nUnified Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "28", "text": "Article 3: Permits and Procedures\nPage 3-6\nshall not be processed.

All proposed development plans shall be prepared by a\nregistered civil engineer, professional land surveyor, or other qualified design professional as permitted\nby North Carolina General Statutes.\n9.\nDETERMINATION OF COMPLETENESS\nThe Administrator shall determine if a submittal is complete. A complete submittal is one that:\n(a)\ncontains all information and materials established by the Administrator as required for submittal of the\nparticular type of submittal;\n(b)\nis in the form established by the Administrator as required for submittal of the particular type of submittal;\n(c)\nincludes information in sufficient detail for evaluation as to whether it complies with the appropriate\nsubstantive standards of this Ordinance; and,\n(d)\nis accompanied by the fee established for the particular type of submission.\n10.\nREVIEW OF SUBMITTAL\n(a)\nWhen a submission is determined to be complete, the Administrator shall refer it to the appropriate staff,\nreview agencies, and review bodies for evaluation in accordance with the procedures and standards of\nthis Ordinance. The timeframe and review cycle shall be based on the date the submittal is determined\nto be complete. Scheduling of any public hearing(s) or approvals shall be done after reviewing agencies\nhave been given adequate time for review and comment.\n(b)\nIf a submittal is subject to coordinated technical review by other agencies, the Administrator shall prepare\na memorandum of understanding summarizing all reviewer comments including conditions, deficiencies,\ncorrections, and revisions necessary for approval of the proposed development and forward a copy to\nthe applicant. Other agencies that could be included in a coordinated technical review are the Guilford\nCounty Fire Marshal, Guilford County Department of Environmental Health, NCDOT, the Town Engineer\nand the Town Fire Marshall.\n11.\nPREPARATION OF STAFF REPORT\n(a)\nStaff Report Required\nIf a submittal is subject to staff review and a subsequent public hearing or consideration by a review body,\nthe Administrator shall review the submittal, relevant support material, and any comments from other\nstaff and review agencies, and then prepare a written staff report.\n(b)\nContent\nThe staff report shall be addressed to the review body or decision-making body, as appropriate, and shall\nstate whether the submittal complies with all appropriate Ordinance standards and other adopted Town\nplans. The staff report may identify ways in which areas of noncompliance might be eliminated and\nadverse effects might be mitigated. The staff report shall be transmitted to the applicant and made\navailable to the review body or decision-making body and to the public a reasonable period of time before\nthe first scheduled review body meeting or public hearing on the submittal according to the published\nsubmittal schedule.\n12.\nPUBLIC HEARINGS AND PUBLIC MEETINGS\n(a)\nDistinction Between Public Hearings and Public Notice Meetings\nUnder State law, some types of development submittals are subject to review in a public hearing while\nothers require a public notice meeting. These two types are distinguished.\nTown of Summerfield, NC\nUnified Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "29", "text": "Article 3: Permits and Procedures\nPage 3-7\n(1)\nPublic Notice Meeting\nA public notice meeting occurs whenever a board of the Town meets and deals in any way with\nthe business of that board. Public meetings, whether regular or special meetings, are governed by\nNCGS and the procedural rules established by the particular Town board holding the meeting.\nAlthough the board holding the meeting may allow the public to speak during a public comment\nperiod, public input on a particular application under consideration by the particular Town board is\nnot the meeting intent and is not required by State law. Two basic legal requirements of a public\nmeeting are that the public be notified and be allowed to attend. As set forth in this Ordinance,\nmajor site plans and major subdivisions are reviewed and approved in a public meeting by the\nTown Planning Board.\n(2)\nPublic Hearing\nA public hearing is also a public meeting, but the main purpose of most public hearings is to obtain\npublic testimony or comment. A public hearing may occur as part of a regular or special meeting,\nor it may be the sole purpose of a special meeting, with no other matters addressed. There are\ntwo types of public hearings, legislative and quasi-judicial.\na.\nLegislative public hearings are required by State law to obtain public input on proposed\nchanges in Town laws, such as the Ordinance text or Map. These hearings are generally\nless formal than quasi-judicial public hearings.\nb.\nQuasi-judicial public hearings involve the legal rights of specific parties, and the decisions\nmade as a result of such hearings must be based upon and supported by the record or facts\npresented during the hearing. These hearings are subject to stricter procedural\nrequirements than legislative hearings and involve sworn testimony. Under this Ordinance,\nall quasi-judicial hearings are held by the Board of Adjustment, and are required for special\nuse permits, variances, changes in non-conforming use, and appeals.\n(b)\nScheduling a Public Hearing or Publicly Noticed Meeting\nWhen a submittal is subject to either, the Administrator shall ensure that it is scheduled for a regular\nscheduled meeting of the body reviewing the submittal.\n(1)\nTiming\nThe public hearing or meeting on the submittal shall be held to comply with the schedule set forth\nin accordance with NCGS.\n(2)\nRequired Public Hearings and Publicly Noticed Meetings\nTable 3.A.12 Required Public Hearings and Publicly Noticed Meetings identifies the review and\ndecision-making bodies responsible for conducting public hearings on development submissions,\nwhere public hearings are required, and the type of hearing (standard public hearing or quasi-\njudicial public hearing). The table also shows publicly noticed meetings held by advisory review\nbodies on development submittals.

It is not\nnecessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can\nbe made of the property.\nii.\nThe hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location,\nsize, or topography.

The Open Space Mixed Use-Village District (OSM-V) is a district based on and regulated\nby detailed, place-based plans, standards, and Form-Based Code adopted in the rezoning process\nas part of the Development Regulations rather than the concepts and rules of conventional zoning\nfound in other sections of the UDO. This type of zoning creates a land development regulation that\nfosters predictable built results and a high-quality public realm by using physical form as the\norganizing principle for the code and using illustrations to explain design elements rather than using\nnumeric standards and text. The district is structured to allow greater control than is allowed by the\nUDO over such elements as the landscape, the scale of buildings, the form and function of\nneighborhoods, and the placement of building types. The district is established for the following\npurposes:\na.\nTo accommodate the development of large tracts or combinations of tracts that require\nmore comprehensive planning to follow accepted Traditional Neighborhood design\nprincipals incorporating open space practices and preservation;\nb.\nTo regulate the orderly mixed-use development of large areas to be under unified\nownership or control with a comprehensive and cohesive design\nC.\nTo avoid a saturation of large tracts used for disconnected, large-lot, cul-de-sac\nsubdivisions;\nd.\nTo ensure a specific development outcome as described in a detailed plan typical of a\nForm-Based Code project, if applicable;\ne.\nTo establish cohesive living spaces within a plan designed around the unique\ncharacteristics of a particular land area;\nf.\nTo integrate roadways, buildings, and open spaces into the natural landscape of\nwoodlands, pastures, streams, slopes, and other features offered by the location;\ng.\nTo establish neighborhoods or village areas with a unique sense of place; and\nh.\nTo provide a development tool that supports the Town's policies for, and complies with,\nfederal fair housing regulations.\n(2)\nMinimum Size. Only a tract or a combination of tracts totaling a minimum of 450 acres may be\nconsidered for an OSM-V district.\n(3)\nUses, Density, Design, and Building Types. The uses, density, building types, and design of\ndevelopment shall be included in and governed by Development Regulations with zoning maps that\nare created for the OSM-V district and approved at the time of rezoning, provided, however, that\nthe maximum density for apartments in the OSM-V district shall be 0.70 apartments units per acre\nand the maximum overall density of dwelling units in the OSM-V is 3.70 dwelling units per acre. The\nDevelopment Regulations shall be adopted as a component of a Development Agreement\nnegotiated as part of the approval of a rezoning request.\n(4)\nAcknowledgement of the structure of the zoning regulation. Different development results may\noccur using Development Regulations that focus on the scale and design of buildings, the\nfunctional integration of several uses in a community setting, the use of open space, intentional\ninterconnectivity, and the preservation and sustainability of a community's character based upon\nelements of building and landscape design. This type of place-based zoning is contrasted with mid-\n20th century conventional zoning that creates land development regulations based primarily on the\nseparation of uses with much less focus on the appearance and function of the built form. The\nOSM-V district also acknowledges that the design of neighborhoods and villages requires flexibility\nnot allowed by the conventional zoning standards in other sections of the UDO.\n(5)\nUnified ownership and control.

Building types allowed in the FHA are the same as those\nallowed in the underlying base zoning districts, subject to the requirements of Article 9.H Definitions\nRelated to Environmental Regulations.\n(b)\nWatershed Area Overlays\nWatershed protection is accomplished by establishing low density development, limiting the amount of\nimpervious surface, and limiting or prohibiting land uses that pose a threat to surface and groundwater\nsupplies, which is especially critical for Summerfield. These regulations are in accordance with the\nrequirements of the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission, the North Carolina General\nStatutes, and Best Management Practices. Summerfield has two watershed overlays that are specified in\nArticle 9.\n(1)\nGeneral Watershed Area Overlay (GWA)\nThe General Watershed Area Overlay District (GWA) is intended to set forth regulations for the\nprotection of public drinking water supplies and is applicable to all lands which drain toward such\nsupplies and are outside of the Watershed Critical Area.\n(2)\nWatershed Critical Area Overlay (WCA)\nThe Watershed Critical Area Overlay District (WCA) is intended to set forth regulations for the\nprotection of public drinking water supplies and is applicable to all lands adjacent to and which\ndrain toward existing or proposed supply intakes or reservoirs. Building Types allowed in the\nGWA and WCA are the same as those allowed in the underlying base zoning districts, subject to\nthe requirements of Article 9.H Definitions Related to Environmental Regulations.\n(c)\nScenic Corridor Area Overlay Districts (SCA)\nThe Scenic Corridor Area Overlay (SCA) are established to protect the natural features and trees that\nprovide a sense of arrival for residents and visitors traveling the major entrance roads and gateways to\nthe Town. Properties along these entrance roads and gateways contribute significantly to the\nComprehensive Plan's policies for Community Character Preservation and Attractive Community\nAppearance. The goal of these overlay areas is to protect the scenic value of the view corridors\nthrough development standards for building architecture, building materials, lighting, signage, and\nsite design. These standards shall preserve the character and improve the appearance of the Town\nby maintaining the sense of a rural corridor in a developed environment; provide an aesthetically\nappealing experience for those traveling the corridor; increase safety along the corridors by reducing\nvisual clutter and inappropriate site design, and provide safe multi-modal transportation options\nfor\nmotorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Regulations governing density, use, building type and\ndevelopment standards are set forth herein. The following Scenic Corridor Area Overlay Districts are\nhereby established:\n(1)\nI-73 Scenic Corridor: This corridor extends for a distance of 1,500 linear feet on either side of the\nright-of-way of Interstate 73 within the boundaries of the Town limits.\n(2)\nUS 220 Scenic Corridor: This corridor extends for a distance of 1,500 linear feet on either side of\nTown of Summerfield, NC\nUnified Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "106", "text": "Article 4: Zoning Districts\nPage 4-21\nthe right-of-way of US Highway 220 from the northern Town limits to the southern Town limits.\n(3)\nNC 150 Scenic Corridor: This corridor extends for a distance of 1,500 linear feet on either side\nof\nthe right-of-way of NC Highway 150 from the western Town limits to the eastern Town limits.\n(d)\nGeneral Requirements for Scenic Corridor Area Overlay Districts\nIn addition to the development standards of Article 5, the following development standards apply to all\nScenic Corridor Area Overlay Districts established after the effective date of this ordinance.\n(1)\nPermitted Uses\nAll uses permitted in the underlying base district are permitted, except manufactured housing,\noutdoor storage, outside processing or assembly operations, outdoor advertising and commercial\nor fleet truck, trailer, or container parking areas.\n(2)\nBuilding Materials and Design\na.\nMaterials such as brick, stone, wood, or other like and similar materials are required on all\nnew construction and additions that are visible from the subject scenic corridors' public right-\nof-way.\nb.

This section also provides support in categorizing a new or unanticipated land use not identified\nin the use table.\n(b)\nStructure of this Section\n(1)\nGeneral\nThis section identifies each of the five use classifications in the Table 4.D.1 Permitted Uses and\nincludes a section under each use classification identifying each use category. \"Characteristics\" and\n\"examples\" are given for each use category (individual uses are defined in Article 11: Definitions).\n(2)\nPrincipal Use Characteristics and Accessory Uses\nThe \"characteristics\" subsection describes common characteristics of each use category. Principal\nuses are assigned to the use category that most closely describes the nature of the principal use. Also\nlisted are examples of common accessory uses that, unless otherwise stated in this Ordinance, are\nallowed in conjunction with a principal use.\n(3) Examples\nThe \"examples\" subsection lists common examples of use types included in the respective use\ncategory. The names of these sample uses are generic. They are based on common meanings and\nnot on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use that calls itself \"wholesale sales,\" but\nsells mostly to consumers, is included in the Retail Sales and Service Use Category rather than\nthe\nWholesale Sales Use Category.\n(c)\nDevelopments with Multiple Principal Uses\nWhen all permitted uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is assigned\nto that use category. A development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore, and bakery, for example, would\nbe classified in the Retail Sales and Service Use Category. When the permitted uses of a development fall\nwithin different use categories, each permitted use is classified in the applicable use category and each use\nis subject to applicable regulations for that use category. Developments with multiple permitted uses, such\nas shopping centers, shall incorporate only those use types allowed in the applicable zoning district.\n(d)\nInterpretation of Unlisted Uses\n(1)\nProcedure for Interpreting Unlisted Uses as Permitted\nThe Zoning Administrator may interpret a particular land use not expressly listed in the use table in\naccordance with the procedure in Article Interpretation of Uses, and based on the standards\nin Section 4.C.1(d)(2) Standards for Approving Unlisted Uses.\n(2)\nStandards for Interpreting Unlisted Uses as Permitted\nThe Town Manager shall interpret an unlisted land use as permitted in a particular zoning district only\nafter determining that the nature, function, and duration of the use and its impact are similar to those\nof a use type or use category allowable in the zoning district. In making such determination, the Town\nManager shall consider the purpose and intent statements in this Ordinance concerning the zoning\ndistrict, the character of use types allowable in the district, and all relevant characteristics of the\nunlisted use, including but not limited to the following:\na. the volume and type of sales, retail, wholesale, etc.;\nb. the size and type of items sold and nature of inventory on the premises;\nC. any processing done on the premises, including assembly, manufacturing, warehousing,\nshipping, distribution;\nTown of Summerfield, NC\nUnified Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "115", "text": "Article 4: Zoning Districts\nPage 4-30\nd. any dangerous, hazardous, toxic, or explosive materials used in the processing;\ne.\nthe nature of storage and outdoor display of merchandise, whether enclosed, open, inside or\noutside the principal building; predominant types of items stored (such as business vehicles,\nwork-in-process, inventory, and merchandise, construction materials, scrap and junk, and raw\nmaterials including liquids and powders);\nf.\nthe type, size, and nature of buildings and structures;\ng. the number and density of employees and customers per unit area of site in relation to business\nhours and employment shifts;\nh. transportation requirements, including the modal split for people and freight, by volume type and\ncharacteristic of traffic generation to and from the site;\ni.\ntrip purposes and whether trip purposes can be shared by other use types on the site;\nj.\nparking requirements, turnover and generation, ratio of the number of spaces required per unit\narea or activity;\nk.\nthe amount and nature of any nuisances generated on the premises, including but not limited to\nnoise, smoke, odor, glare, vibration, radiation, and fumes;\nI.\nany special public utility requirements for serving the proposed use type, including but not limited\nto water supply, wastewater output, pre-treatment of wastes and emissions required or\nrecommended, and any significant power structures and communications towers or facilities; and\nm. the impact on adjacent lands created by the proposed use type, which should not be greater than\nthat of other use types allowed in the zoning district.\n(3)\nEffect of Approval of Unlisted Use\na.\nAfter interpreting an unlisted land use as permitted in a particular zoning district, the Administrator\nshall determine whether the unlisted use is likely to be common or to recur frequently, or whether\nits omission from the use table is likely to lead to public uncertainty and confusion. On determining\nthat the unlisted use is likely to be common or would lead to confusion if unlisted, the Town\nManager shall initiate an application for a text amendment to this Ordinance to list the use in the\nuse table.

The names of the building types are not intended to limit uses within a building. Not all building types are\npermitted in all zoning districts. All building types are subject to additional design and development standards in Article\n6 as applicable.\nThe maximum height for any building type within the Town of Summerfield is 50 feet, which may include a maximum of\n3 partial stories above grade or 2 full stories above grade.\nThere are hereby established the following building types:\n1.\nFARM BUILDING\nFarm Buildings are any of the structures used in farming operations, which may include buildings to house families\nand workers, as well as livestock, machinery, and crops.\n2.\nDETACHED HOUSE (SINGLE FAMILY)\nDetached Single Family houses are the most predominant residential building type in Summerfield and are\nappropriate on a wide variety of lot sizes depending on the zoning district. Detached houses include modular\nhomes, accessory carriage houses but do not include manufactured homes, mobile homes, or recreational or\nmotor vehicles.\n3.\nTOWNHOUSE\nTownhouses are residential buildings with three or more dwelling units that share a common wall. Each unit has\nits own entrance. Units are typically aligned close to the public sidewalk, although sometimes there are small\nvariations in setback to provide landscaping or diversity in the streetscape.\n4.\nATTACHED HOUSE (DUPLEX)\nA Duplex Attached House has two separate dwelling units with external accesses to each unit.\n5.\nATTACHED HOUSE (TRIPLEX, QUADPLEX)\nAttached houses have the outward appearance of detached houses but accommodate three or four separate\ndwelling units within one building.\n6.\nMANUFACTURED HOME\nManufactured Homes provide alternatives to modular homes or buildings that are stick built on site and typically\noffer lower cost alternatives for the home buyer. These building types are often used as accessory dwellings.\n7.\nLIVE/WORK\nLive/work buildings are designed to combine commercial and residential uses within a single building of two or\nmore stories. They are similar to a townhouse, with a storefront on the ground floor and a residential unit above.\nStorefront space may be a home-based business or may be leased independently; however, different NC State\nBuilding Code regulations apply in each case.\n8.\nCOMMERCIAL CENTER\nCommercial Centers are designed to combine a grouping of commercial uses, designed as attached businesses\n(such as in a strip center) or detached businesses clustered around shared parking.\n9.\nINSTITUTIONAL\nInstitutional buildings are used for public or semi-public purposes. These buildings must be designed\nappropriately to fit within neighborhoods as integral parts of the community. Their uses may include churches,\nlibraries, post offices, and schools.\nTown of Summerfield, NC\nUnified Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "146", "text": "Article 4: Zoning Districts\nPage 4-61\nInstitutional buildings serve as landmarks and places of assembly.

STOREFRONT\nA storefront building is designed to accommodate either single or multiple uses or tenants in a single building. A\ngroup of storefront buildings can be combined to form a mixed-use center. For example, individual storefront\nbuildings can provide commercial uses with residential or office uses on the upper floors.

Important to this physical appearance is the design of the site, the natural\ntopography and plant life, and miscellaneous other objects that are observed by the public. These standards are\nnot intended to restrict imagination, innovation, or variety, but rather to assist in focusing on design principles\nwhich can produce creative solutions that will develop a satisfactory visual appearance within the Town,\npreserve taxable values, preserve natural resources, and promote public health, safety, and welfare. Specific\nstandards for subdivision and site design are found in Articles 5.A through 5.L.\nThe landscape shall be preserved in its natural state insofar as practicable, by minimizing tree and soil removal.\nThe preservation of natural vegetation reduces the risks of erosion and sedimentation. Any grade changes shall\nbe in keeping with the general appearance of neighboring developed areas. The orientation of individual building\nsites shall be such as to maintain maximum natural topography and cover. Topography, tree cover, and natural\ndrainage ways to the greatest extent possible shall be treated as fixed determinants of road and lot rather than\nas malleable elements that can be changed to follow a preferred development scheme.\nActive farmland shall be considered a valuable resource when incorporated into site designs.\nRoads shall be designed and located in such a manner as to maintain and preserve natural topography, cover,\nsignificant landmarks, and natural vegetation; to minimize cut and fill; and to preserve and enhance views and\nvistas on or off the subject parcel.\nProposed development shall be related harmoniously to the terrain.\nThe removal or disruption of historic, traditional, or significant uses, structures, or architectural elements shall\nbe minimized insofar as practical, whether these exist on the site or on adjacent properties.\n2.\nIMPROVEMENTS, DEDICATIONS, EASEMENTS AND MINIMUM STANDARDS REQUIRED\nEach subdivision and developed site shall contain the improvements specified in this article, which shall be\ninstalled in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance and paid for by the developer, unless other\nmeans of financing is specifically stated in this Ordinance and except the cost for the installation of a well and/or\nseptic tank system may be assigned to the new owner.

(See Figure 5.F.4.1)\n3.\nPLANTING YARD DETERMINATION\nThe following steps explain how to determine the planting yards required by this Ordinance.\n(a)\nIdentify the classification of the proposed or expanded land use and of any existing or proposed adjacent\nland use(s) by using Table 4.D.2(b) Permitted Use Table. A land use becomes existing on an adjacent\nproperty when a building permit is issued. If a zone lot contains uses with different land use classifications,\nselect the higher numbered classification.\n(b)\nUse the Planting Yard Chart, Table 5.F.3.1, to determine the appropriate letter designation for each\nplanting yard.\n(c)\nMatch the letter designation obtained from the Planting Yard Chart with the Planting Rate Chart, Table\n5.F.3.2, to determine the types and numbers of shrubs and trees required.\nTABLE 5.F.3.2 PLANTING YARD RATE CHART\nPlanting Yard Rates\nNote: On lots of record less than fifty-five thousand (55,000) square feet in area, no development shall be required to place required landscaping on greater than\nfifteen (15%) percent of the site.\nFootnotes:\na\nMinimum Width and Minimum Average Width Explained: The minimum width is not intended nor permitted to be applied along the entire length of a required\nplanting yard. Rather, it is the smallest width allowed at any point along the yard as installed. The minimum average width is determined by averaging the\nwidth of the planting yard along its entire length. Thus, if a planting yard is 25 feet wide for half its length and 15 feet wide for the other half of its length, the\nminimum average width for that yard as installed would be calculated as 20 feet (i.e. 25' + 15' = 40'/ = 20') This example would satisfy the dimensional\nrequirements for a Type C planting yard.\nb Walls, a minimum of five (5) feet in height, constructed or masonry, stone, or pressure treated lumber or an opaque fence, a minimum of five (5) feet in height, may\nbe used to reduce the widths of the planting yards by ten (10) feet.\nTown of Summerfield, NC\nUnified
