The requirements in Sec. 4-2, 4-3, and 4-7 are\nlocation-dependent and most relevant for properties adjacent to or in close proximity to\nwaterbodies. Property near waterbodies may be subject to water supply source watershed\nprotection, waterbody protection, and floodplain life and property protection requirements.\nThe first two sections after the Purpose focus on the protection of water quality. Sec. 4-2\nregulates land uses and densities in the proximity of drinking water reservoirs to protect\nthem from pollution. Sec. 4-3 establishes undisturbed buffers and vegetative setbacks to\nprotect surface waters from soil erosion and pollutants.\nThe next two sections focus on minimizing negative impacts from stormwater. Sec. 4-4\nmandates engineered stormwater controls to minimize the qualitative and quantitative\nimpacts of runoff and ensure compliance with federal point source discharge requirements.\nThese requirements are based on the permit conditions in NPDES Permit No. NCS000423 (the\nCity's Phase // stormwater permit). The phase II provisions became effective upon the\nadoption of an ordinance amendment on January 12, 2006. Sec. 4-5 mandates the control of\nsedimentation and erosion; however, the sedimentation and erosion control regulatory\nprogram is administered by the State of North Carolina.\nThe next two sections focus on the protection of life and property. Sec. 4-6 regulates grading\nto protect existing vegetation and utilities. Sec. 4-7 regulates land uses to minimize loss of\nlife and property due to flood conditions. Previously, these requirements were located in\nCDO Section 4.14 (Floodplain Protection Overlay District).\nAreas regulated by Section 4-2, 4-3, and 4-7 are located in overlay districts.

Others require\ndetailed plans showing most of the features of the new development, such as buildings, parking lots,\nlandscaping, stormwater ponds, and other features. These are called \"site plans.\" Subdivisions and\nsite plans are the two most common and complex types of plans for new development. As such, they\ndeserve their own article. All site plans and subdivisions must be designed with the environmental\nrequirements of Article 4 in mind. Before designing a subdivision or site plan, please consult Article 4.\nSubdivisions are approved in a two-step process. First, preliminary plats are approved (Section 5.2).\nPreliminary plats must conform to the standards for the creation of new lots found in Section 5.5 and\nArticles 7 and 9. After approval of a subdivision or site plan-controlled development, technical plans\nfor the installation of roads, sewers, water lines and stormwater control devices must also be approved.\nThese requirements are found in Section 5.6, (Construction Plans). After the installation of the\nimprovements shown in the construction plans, comes the final approval of the subdivision in Section\n5.3, (Final Plats). Site plans (Section 5.4, Site Plan-Controlled Development) are required for\ndevelopments that require hearing by the Planning and Zoning Commission for conditional district\nzonings or special use permits. If new lots are created, a subdivision and site plan will be required for\nthe same development. Typically, lots are subdivided before commercial construction drawings are\ngenerated. The details on the inspection of new utility infrastructure and acceptance of utilities by the\nCity Council are found at Section 5.7 (Construction).

Metal and split-faced concrete\nblock may be used as accent material provided that cumulatively they\ndo not exceed 20 percent of the area of any individual exterior wall\nvisible from an existing or proposed public street or adjacent parcel\nlocated outside the industrial development in which the building is\nlocated.\nMetal may be utilized exclusively on 1) walls not visible from an\nexisting or proposed public street or adjacent parcel located outside\nthe industrial development in which the building is located, or 2) on\nmanufacturing facilities of more than two stories in height.\nWhen two (2) or more materials are used on an exterior wall, the\nheavier material (e.g., brick) shall be placed below the lighter\nmaterial (e.g., stucco).\nThe Administrator or his designee may allow modifications to the\nrequired materials on a case=by-case basis. The applicant shall\ndocument through photo or photo simulations that areas using\nalternative materials are not visible from public streets or adjacent\ndevelopments. The burden of proof in justifying alternative materials\nshall rest with the applicant.\nF. Parapet Walls\nAverage parapet height shall not exceed 15 percent of the supporting\nwall height. Maximum parapet height shall not exceed 33 percent of\nthe supporting wall height. (See Figures 7.11-2.)\nG. Facade/Wall Treatment\nFacades shall have a recognizable \"base\" consisting of (but not limited\n55\n"}, {"page": "206", "text": "ARTICLE 7: BASE ZONING DISTRICTS\nto): walls, ledges, sills, integrally textured materials (such as stone or\nother masonry), integrally colored and patterned materials, or\nplanters. Facades shall also have a recognizable \"top\" consisting of\n(but not limited to): cornice treatments with integrally textured\nmaterials (other than colored \"stripes\" or \"bands\"), sloping roofs (with\noverhangs and brackets), or stepped parapets.\nH. Design Elements\nFor building facades that are visible from streets external to a\ndevelopment or from internal collector or arterials streets, at least\nfour (4) of the following elements must comprise 15 percent of front\nfa\u00e7ade length:\n1. Parapets\n2. Cornices\n3. Roofline offsets\n4. Windows or doors\n5. Window hoods\n6. Transoms\n7. Bulkheads\n8. Awnings or canopies\n9. Ribs or columns\n10. Changes in texture or masonry\nI. Height Transitions\nOn parcels that abut residential\n1' height increase\nzoning districts, portions of the\nfor each 2' extra\nbuilding exceeding thirty-five\nsetback\n(35) feet shall be setback an\nadditional two (2) feet from the\nrequired building setback for\neach foot of height in excess of\n10'\nthirty-five (35) feet. For\nheight\npurposes of this provision, the\nheight transition shall be\n35'\nmeasured from average grade\nheight\nalong the nearest building line\nfacing any property line of a\nresidentially zoned lot to the\nhighest point of the non-\nresidential structure.\n56\n"}, {"page": "207", "text": "ARTICLE 8\nUSE REGULATIONS\nSummary: This Article establishes uniform criteria for particular uses which are permitted within one\nor more of the zoning districts as established in Article 7.

"text": "8.2 USE CATEGORIES\nCOMMENTARY: The following use categories are not zoning districts. These\ncategories group uses for regulatory purposes. The names of some use categories\n(for example, \"Commercial\") may be similar to names for zoning districts (such\nas \"Commercial, General\"). A use listed in the examples below is only permitted\nin accordance with the use table.\n8.2.1. IN GENERAL\nA. Approach to Categorizing Uses\nThe use categories found in the use table in 8.1.8 are set forth in this\nSection. Specific uses may be further defined in Article 14, Definitions.\nThe Zoning Administrator may determine that uses not listed in Table\n8.1.8. are similar to those uses listed in the Table. Where such similar\npermitted use is subject to special use standards or supplemental\nstandards the proposed use shall also be subject to such standards or\napproval.\nB. Basis for Classifications\nUse categories classify land uses and activities based on common\nfunctional, product, or physical characteristics. Characteristics\ninclude the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or\nresidents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, likely impact on\nsurrounding properties, and site conditions. The Use Categories\nprovide a systematic basis for assigning land uses to appropriate zoning\ndistricts. The Administrator may consult the North American Industry\nClassification System (NAICS) for further clarification on a particular\nuse.\nC. Principal Uses Not Specifically Listed\nDetermination of the appropriate category for a proposed principal use\nshall be made by the Zoning Administrator. The criteria below shall be\nused to determine both the appropriate category for a use not\nspecifically listed in the Use Table or the examples in the Use Category\ndescriptions, and whether a use is considered principal or accessory.\nA.

SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES\n1. PURPOSE & FINDINGS\nA. The City Council of the City of Concord finds that this Ordinance\nis necessary in order to protect the City from the potential\nsecondary effects of sexually oriented businesses including\ncrime, the protection of the City's retail trade, the prevention\nof the blighting of neighborhoods and the maintenance of\nproperty values, protecting and preserving the quality of the\nCity's neighborhoods and the City's commercial districts, the\nprotection of the City's quality of life, the increased threat of\nthe spread of sexually transmitted diseases, and the protection\nof the peace, welfare and privacy of persons who patronize\nsexually oriented businesses. Experience in this City as well as\nin cities and counties within and outside of North Carolina\nincluding the County of Los Angeles, the City of Garden Grove\nand the cities of Renton, Washington; Seattle, Washington;\nDetroit, Michigan; Austin, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; and\nConcord Development Ordinance\n8-48\nConcord, North Carolina\n"}, {"page": "255", "text": "Phoenix Arizona; have demonstrated that such uses have\nobjectionable secondary effects upon immediately adjacent\nresidential and commercial areas. The City recognizes and\nrelies upon the experience of these other cities and counties in\nadopting sexually oriented business regulations including the\nCounty of Los Angeles (as discussed in Smith V. County of Los\nAngeles 211 Cal. App. 3d 188 (1989)); City of Renton,\nWashington (as discussed in City of Renton V. Playtime Theatres,\nInc.475 U.S. 41 (1976)); the City of Seattle Washington (as\ndiscussed in Northend Cinema V. City of Seattle 90 Wash. 2d\n709, 585 P.2d 1153 (1978)); and the County of Palm Beach,\nFlorida (as discussed in Movie & Video Work V. Board of County\nCommissioners 723 F. Supp. 695 (S.D. Fla. 1989)) in support of\nthis Ordinance. The City also recognizes and relies upon the\nstudies done by: (1) the 1979 Adult Use Study by the Phoenix\nPlanning Department; (2) Tucson, Arizona (1990); (3) the 1991\nreport to the City of Garden Grove by Drs. McCleary and Meeker\non the relationship between crime and adult business\noperations; (4) the City of Los Angeles in 1977); (5) the 1984\n\"Analysis of Adult Entertainment Businesses in Indianapolis\" by\nthe Department of metropolitan Development; (6) Minneapolis,\nMinnesota (1980); (7) Cleveland, Ohio (1977); (8) Oklahoma\nCity, Oklahoma (1986); (9) Austin, Texas' study on effects of\nadult businesses; (10) Amarillo, Texas (1977); (11) Beaumont,\nTexas (1982); (12) Houston, Texas (1983); and (13) Seattle,\nWashington (1989).\nB. The City Council believes the following statements are true, in\npart based upon its understanding of the experiences of the\nvarious jurisdictions identified.\n1. Crime rates tend to be higher in residential areas\nsurrounding sexually oriented businesses than in industrial\nareas surrounding sexually oriented businesses;\n2. Areas within close walking distance of single and multiple\nfamily dwellings should be free of sexually oriented\nbusinesses;\n3. Sexually oriented businesses should be located in specific\nareas of the City which are a specified distance from\nsensitive uses such as residences, parks, religious institutions\nand schools, irrespective of whether physical barriers are\npresent. This is necessary to (1) ensure that the impact on\nsuch sensitive uses by adverse secondary effects caused by\nsexually oriented businesses are mitigated to the maximum\nextent possible; (2) to prevent ad hoc decisions with respect\nto a potential sexually oriented business site which does not\nmeet the criteria set forth herein; and (3) to provide\nConcord Development Ordinance\n8-49\nConcord, North Carolina\n"}, {"page": "256", "text": "certainty to the residents of the City and sexually oriented\nbusiness operators with respect to potential adult use sites.\n4. The image of the City as an attractive place to reside will be\nadversely affected by the presence of sexually oriented\nbusinesses in close proximity to residential uses, schools,\nreligious institutions and parks;\n5. The existence of sexually oriented businesses in close\nproximity to residential areas has been shown in some cities\nto reduce the property values in those residential areas;\n6. A reasonable regulation of the location of sexually oriented\nbusinesses protects the image of the community and its\nproperty values and protects its residents from the adverse\nsecondary effects of sexually oriented businesses while\nproviding those who desire to patronize sexually oriented\nbusinesses an opportunity to do so in appropriate areas in\nthe City; and\n7. There is substantial evidence that an increase in crime tends\nto accompany, concentrate around, and be aggravated by\nsexually oriented businesses, including but not limited to an\nincrease in the crimes of narcotics distribution and use,\nprostitution, pandering, and violence against persons and\nproperty. The studies from other cities establish convincing\nevidence that sexually oriented businesses which are not\nregulated as to permissible locations often have a\ndeleterious effect on nearby businesses in residential areas,\ncausing, among other adverse secondary effects, an increase\nin crime and a decrease in property values. Regulations for\nsexually oriented businesses should be developed to prevent\ndeterioration and/or degradation of the vitality of the\ncommunity before the problem exists, rather that waiting\nfor problems to be created.\nC. The City Council recognizes and relies on the findings set forth\nin the 1986 N.C. Attorney General's Report on Pornography in\nsupport of this Ordinance including, but not limited to its\nrecommendations that local governments ban certain features\nof video booths that facilitate carnal sexual encounters.\nD. The City Council finds the following, in part based upon its\nunderstanding of the documents and judicial decisions in the\npublic record:\n1. Evidence indicates that some dancers, models and other\npersons who publicly perform specified sexual activities or\npublicly display specified anatomical parts in sexually\noriented businesses (collectively referred to as\n\"performers\") have been found to engage in sexual activities\nwith patrons of sexually oriented businesses on the site of\nConcord Development Ordinance\n8-50\nConcord, North Carolina\n"}, {"page": "257", "text": "the sexually oriented business;\n2. Evidence has demonstrated that performers employed by\nsexually oriented businesses have been found to offer and\nprovide private shows to patrons who, for a price, are\npermitted to observe and participate with the performers in\nlive sex shows;\n3. Evidence indicates that performers at sexually oriented\nbusinesses have been found to engage in acts of prostitution\nwith patrons of the establishment;\n4. As a result of the above, and the increase in incidents of AIDS\nand Hepatitis B, which are both sexually transmitted\ndiseases, the City has a substantial interest in adopting\nregulations which will reduce, to the greatest extent\npossible, the possibility for the occurrence of prostitution\nand casual sex acts at sexually oriented businesses.\nE. The City Council has determined that the establishment of a\nsexually oriented business development permit process is a\nlegitimate and reasonable means of ensuring that:\n1. Operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with the\nreasonable regulations of this Ordinance;\n2. The recognized secondary impacts of a proposed sexually\noriented business in a specific location are mitigated; and\n3. Operators of sexually oriented businesses have specific\nguidelines with respect to where they can establish or\noperate a sexually oriented business.\nF. It is not the intent of the City Council in adopting this Ordinance\nto suppress any activities protected by the First Amendment,\nbut rather to enact a content neutral ordinance which addresses\nthe secondary effects that sexually oriented businesses have on\nthe City.\nG. The City Council desires to protect the rights conferred by the\nUnited States Constitution to sexually oriented businesses in a\nmanner that ensures the continued and orderly development of\nproperty within the City and diminishes those undesirable\nnegative secondary effects the previously mentioned studies\nhave shown to be associated with the development and\noperation of sexually oriented businesses.\nH. The City Council and Planning and Zoning Commission have held\nduly noticed public hearings, to receive input and testimony\nfrom the public concerning the adoption of this proposed\nOrdinance.\nI.

The character of a development should be reflected in its lighting. The light fixtures along\nstreets should contribute to a coordinated, attractive streetscape that works well with\nstreet trees, curb cuts, signage, street furniture and other features to create continuity\nin the streetscape.\n2. A mixed use development should be designed to create compatibility between commercial\nand residential uses. The types of issues that would be addressed are glare, safety,\nillumination levels, clear designation of pedestrian ways, and aesthetic appeal.\n3. Pedestrian circulation is encouraged and therefore pedestrian oriented lighting is\nencouraged. Pedestrian area lighting should emphasize the location of pedestrian ways\nand be in character with the architectural and landscape design of the center.\n4. The use of a greater number of low fixtures is preferred over fewer taller fixtures.\n5. Parking area lighting should complement the lighting of adjacent streets and properties,\nwith consistent fixtures, source colors and illumination levels. When adjacent to\npedestrian circulation and gathering areas, parking area lighting should not overpower the\nquality of pedestrian area light\nS. STREET NETWORKS\nMixed use centers are intended to incorporate all modes of transportation (motorized\nvehicles, bicycles, transit and pedestrians) both safely and efficiently by meeting the design\nstandards for streets in Mixed Use Developments outlined in City of Concord Technical\nStandards Manual.\nSince mixed use developments tend to create higher traffic impacts than single use\ndevelopment, mixed use centers will be limited to locations along arterial and collector\nstreets, with the cross-street for an arterial being no less than a collector. This minimizes the\nimpact on adjacent residential neighborhoods. A mixed use center has the potential to\nreduce traffic impacts by providing alternatives to automobile trips within the neighborhood\nand convenient connections to the regional transit and bicycle systems. Additionally, an\nmixed use development will produce more internal automobile trips than a convention\ndevelopment. Except as expressly waived, the Traffic Engineering Department will adhere to\nstandards set forth in the City of Concord Technical Standards Manual.\nStandards\n1.\nBasic Design: All streets shall be designed to meet City of Concord street found in\nthe City of Concord Technical Standards Manual.\n2.

Its provisions adapt the urban\nconventions which were normal in the United States from colonial times until\nthe 1940's. The TND ordinance prescribes the following physical conventions:\n1.\nThe neighborhood is spatially consistent and limited in size.\n2.\nResidences, shops, workplaces, civic buildings and parks are\ninterwoven within the neighborhood, all in close proximity and\nconnected by a system of sidewalks.\n3.\nThe hierarchy, design and detailing of streets, serves equitably the\nneeds of pedestrians, bicycles and automobiles.\n4.\nCarefully placed civic buildings and squares reinforce the identity of\nthe neighborhood.\n5.\nSpatially defined squares and parks are distributed and designed as\nspecialized places for social activity and recreation.\n6.\nCivic buildings provide places of assembly for social, cultural and\nreligious activities, becoming symbols of community identity through\ntheir architectural clarity.\n7.\nPrivate buildings form a disciplined edge, spatially delineating the\npublic street space and the private block interior.\n8.\nArchitecture and landscape respond to the unique character of the\nregion and traditional design principles with attention toward a classic\nsense of timelessness. Designs shall preserve the charm and unity of\nthe neighborhood as a whole.\n9.\nBy providing a full range of housing types and workplaces, residents of\nall ages are blended together, forming the bonds of an authentic\ncommunity.\n10.

LID is encouraged by allowing innovative\nsite design and flexibility in combination with traditional means of controlling stormwater\nrunoff.\n9.11.1 Purpose\nThe goal of the LID Zoning Overlay is to develop site design techniques, strategies,\nBest\nManagement Practices (BMPs), and other criteria to store, infiltrate, evaporate, transpire,\nretain, and detain storm water runoff on the site to replicate pre-development runoff\ncharacteristics and mimic the natural and unique hydrology of the site. Because multiple\naspects of site development impact the hydrologic response of the site, LID runoff control\ntechniques also can address many aspects of site development. There is a wide array of\nimpact reduction and site design techniques that allow the site designer to create storm\nwater control mechanisms that function in a similar manner to natural control mechanisms.\nThe net result is to resemble as closely as possible, the site's pre-development hydrology\nby preserving and/or recreating the watershed's natural hydrologic functions or water\nbalance between runoff, infiltration, storage, ground water recharge, and\nevapotranspiration. With the LID approach receiving waters experience little change in\nthe\nvolume, frequency, or quality of runoff or in the base flows fed by ground water and\nprecipitation. Specifically, LID is designed to:\nA. Promote storm water management practices that maintain pre-development\nhydrology through site design, site development, building design and landscape\ndesign techniques that infiltrate, filter, store, evaporate and detain storm water\nclose to its source;\nB. Protect natural resources, particularly streams, lakes, wetlands, floodplains and\nother natural aquatic systems on the development site and elsewhere from\ndegradation that could be caused by construction activities and post-construction\nconditions;\nC. Protect other properties from damage that could be caused by storm water and\nsediment during construction activities and post-construction conditions on the\ndevelopment site, while insuring that detention measures do not negatively effect\nthe overall hydrology of the site;\nD. Reduce and disperse, throughout the site, the storm water from impervious\nsurfaces such as streets, parking lots, rooftops and other paved surfaces, and\nminimize the storm water's impact on the environment;\nE. Protect public safety by minimizing flooding and stream bank erosion, reduce\npublic expenditures in removing sediment from stormwater drainage systems and\nnatural resource areas, and to prevent damage to municipal infrastructure\ncaused by inadequate stormwater controls; and\nF.

Buildings serve to spatially\ndefine streets. Proper spatial definition is achieved with buildings or other\narchitectural elements (including certain tree plantings) that make up the street\nedges aligned in a disciplined manner with an appropriate ratio of height to width.\nThe condition of alignment occurs when the facades of buildings cooperate to\ndelineate the public space, as walls form a room. Building articulation must take\nplace primarily in the vertical plane or facade. Appendages such as porches,\nbalconies, and bay windows are encouraged to promote the visual transition. The\ncondition of enclosure generated by the height-width ratio of the space is related\nto the physiology of the human eye. If the width of a public space is such that the\ncone of vision encompasses less street walls than the opening to the sky, then the\ndegree of spatial enclosure is slight. Ratios not exceeding 1:4 are considered\noptimal, while a 1:6 height-to-width ratio is the absolute minimum required for\nappropriate urban spatial definition. See P. Craighead, ed., The Hidden Design in\nLand Use Ordinances (University of Southern Maine, 1991), at 45; R. Arendt, Rural\nby Design (American Planning Association, 1994), at 10-11. An appropriate average\nratio is 1:3. As a general rule, the tighter the ratio, the stronger the sense of place.\nSpatial enclosure is particularly important for shopping streets, which must compete\nwith malls which provide very effective spatial definition. In the absence of spatial\ndefinition by facades, disciplined tree planting is an alternative. Trees aligned for\nspatial enclosure are necessary along thoroughfares with substantial front yards. If\nStreetscape Landscaping is provided in accordance with the Landscaping Standards\nof this Ordinance, the Enclosure Ratio shall be measured from the height of the\ntrees at maturity rather than the height of the buildings. For the internal streets or\ncirculation systems of subdivision plats or site plans, the Enclosure Ratio shall be\ncomputed by dividing the height of the shortest facing structure by the spaces\nbetween the buildings. For development on individual tracts adjoining a public\nright-of-way and not under Common Ownership with tracts or parcels facing across\nthe right-of-way, the Enclosure Ratio shall apply only to the tract or parcel subject\nto the Application for Development Approval. Example: A building (Building A) is 15\nfeet in height and faces a building (Building B) 24 feet in height across a street with\na 40-foot right-of-way. Building A is located 15 feet and Building B is located 20\nfeet from the edge of the right-of-way, producing a building-to-building space of 75\n"}, {"page": "602", "text": "CITY OF CONCORD DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nArticle 14\nfeet.
