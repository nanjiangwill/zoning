The North Carolina Bar\nAssociation Zoning, Planning, and Land Use Section introduced changes to the statutes\nthat they thought needed to be included, and other organizations got involved. The North\nCarolina House of Representatives passed the bill in 2015 but the North Carolina Senate\n-did not take up the bill. In 2017, the Senate passed the bill, but the House of\nRepresentatives did not consider the bill. Finally, in 2019 both houses of the North\nCarolina General Assembly took up the bill, passed then reconciled the bill with it\nultimately being signed by the Governor on July 11, 2019. Other revisions to the North\nCarolina General Statutes continue even today as this Ordinance is adopted.\nThe changes contained in NCGS \u00a7 160D are numerous and complex. The Staff of the\nRandolph County Department of Planning and Zoning have worked for over a year\nimplementing the changes as required by the new statutes. Part of the process of the\noverhaul was to make The Randolph County Unified Development Ordinance more user-\nfriendly and to comply with certain statutory provisions contained in NCGS \u00a7 160. What\nfollows is the revised and updated Randolph County Unified Development Ordinance.\nReaders and users shall make note of the following information.\n1.\nSession Law 2019-111, the law that created NCGS \u00a7 160D, had a different\nnumbering sequence. The Reconciliation Commission changed the\nnumbering sequence and the information contained in this Randolph\nCounty Unified Development Ordinance matches that sequence for most of\nthis Ordinance.\n2.\nThe existing Randolph County Unified Development Ordinance has been\nreformatted. Information that was previously contained in Article II (Zoning)\nof the previous Ordinance can be found in Article 600.\nRandolphCounty\nServing with Heart from the\nHeart of North Carolina\nRANDOLPH

The plan may be in the form of, but not be\nlimited to, any of the following plans or approvals: a planned unit\ndevelopment plan, a subdivision plat, a preliminary or general development\nplan, a special use permit, a conditional district zoning plan, or any other\nland-use approval designation as may be utilized by Randolph County.\nUnless otherwise expressly provided by Randolph County, the plan shall\ninclude the approximate boundaries of the site; significant topographical\nand other natural features affecting the development of the site; the\napproximate location on the site of the proposed buildings, structures, and\nother improvements; the approximate dimensions, including height, of the\nproposed buildings and other structures; and the approximate location of all\nexisting and proposed infrastructure on the site, including water, sewer,\nroads, and pedestrian walkways. What constitutes a site-specific vesting\nplan under this section that would trigger a vested right shall be finally\ndetermined by Randolph County under a development regulation, and the\ndocument that triggers the vesting shall be so identified at the time of its\napproval. A variance does not constitute a site-specific vesting plan, and\napproval of a site-specific vesting plan with the condition that a variance is\nobtained does not confer a vested right unless and until the necessary\nvariance is obtained. If a sketch plan or other document fails to describe\nwith reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specified parcel\nor parcels of property, it may not constitute a site-specific vesting plan.\nB.\nESTABLISHMENT OF VESTED RIGHT\nRANDOLPH COUNTY UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nPAGE 110\n"}, {"page": "119", "text": "NORTH\nARTICLE 400: ADMINISTRATION, ENFORCEMENT AND APPEALS\n1779\nA vested right is established for any property upon the valid approval, or\nconditional approval, of a site-specific vesting plan as provided in this\nsection.
