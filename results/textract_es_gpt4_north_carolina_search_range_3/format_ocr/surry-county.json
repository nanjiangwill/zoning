Failure to abide by the terms and conditions placed upon such approval will\nresult in the forfeiture of the vested right previously accorded.\n(2) A vested right, once established as herein provided, shall preclude any zoning action by the county\nwhich would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the\nproperty as set forth in the approved site-specific development except under the following conditions:\n(a) The affected landowner provides written consent to the county of his or her desire to terminate\nthe vested right; or\n(b) The county determines, after having advertised and held a public hearing, that natural or man-\nmade hazards exist on or in the immediate vicinity of the property which pose a serious threat to the public\nhealth, safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as indicated in the sitespecific vesting plan; or\n(c) Compensation is made by the county to the landowner for all costs, expenses, and other losses\nincurred including, but not limited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural,\nplanning, marketing, legal, and any other consultant's fees incurred after approval together with interest\nthereon at the legal rate until paid; or\n(d) The county determines, after having advertised and held a public hearing, that the landowner or\nhis representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations which\nmade a difference in the approval by the county of the site-specific vesting plan; or\n(e) Upon the enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law or regulations which precludes\ndevelopment as contemplated in the site specific vesting plan. In such case the county may (after having\nadvertised and conducted a public hearing) modify the affected provisions upon a finding that the change in\nstate or federal law has a fundamental effect on the plan.\n(3) Once a vested right is granted to a particular site-specific vesting plan, nothing in this chapter shall\npreclude the county from conducting subsequent reviews and approvals to ensure compliance with the\nterms and conditions of the original approval, provided such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent\nwith the original approval.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\n65/236\n"}, {"page": "66", "text": "6/17/24, 7:57 PM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\n(D) Extension. The Board of Commissioners may extend the vested rights period from two to five years\nif it determines the extension is warranted considering all relevant circumstances including but, not limited\nto the size and phasing of the development, the level of investment, the need for development, economic\ncycles, and market conditions. If the landowner requests, the county may conduct a public hearing to\nextend a vesting period not to exceed five years from the date of approval. The vesting of any site plan\nbeyond a two year period shall only be authorized by the county.\n(E) Required public notice of hearing.\n(1) Notice shall be mailed to the person or entity whose application, or request is the subject of the\nhearing; to the owner of the property that is the subject of the hearing if the owner did not initiate the\nhearing; and to the owners of all parcels of land abutting the parcel of land that is the subject of the\nhearing. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the local government may rely on the county tax listing\nto determine owners of property entitled to mailed notice. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least\nten days, but not more than 25 days, prior to the date of the hearing.\n(2) Within that same period, the local government shall also prominently post a notice of the hearing\non the site that is the subject of the hearing or on an adjacent street or highway right-of-way.\n(F) Expiration, limitations, and revocation.\n(1) The vested right resulting from the approval of a site-specific vesting plan may be revoked by the\ncounty. In addition, a revocation may occur if the county determines that the landowner has failed to comply\nwith the terms and conditions of the approval or with any other applicable portion of this chapter. The\nvested right shall otherwise expire at the end of the approval period established by the county.\n(2) A valid development approval shall not expire if work on the project has substantially commenced\nwithin the initial validity period.

If an application for development approval has been made and after the date of that\napplication, a development regulation changes or is proposed, the development permit applicant may\nchoose the version of the regulation existing at the time of the application.

A NON-CONFORMITY is any use, building, structure or lot which fails to\ncomply with one or more of the applicable regulations or standards established herein. A LEGAL NON-\nCONFORMITY is a non-conformity which lawfully existed prior to the adoption of this subchapter. A legal\nnon-conformity is also any use, building, structure or lot which was lawfully created, constructed, and the\nlike, under this subchapter. but which was subsequently rendered non-conforming due to circumstances\nthat were not self-created.\n(B) Continuation, maintenance and repair allowed without permit. Except as provided in division (H)\nbelow, the continuation of any legal non-conformity and the normal maintenance and repair thereof is\nallowed without a general or special use approval. Normal maintenance and repair means that which is\nnecessary to maintain and to correct any damage or deterioration to the structural soundness or to the\nexterior or interior appearance of a building or structure. The continuation of a legal non-conformity other\nthan normal maintenance and repair shall be classified as an alteration, expansion, change, rebuilding, or\nresumption as defined in division (F) below.\n(C) Bringing non-conformity into compliance.\n(1) The owner of a non-conformity may bring it into compliance by securing any permit or approval\nwhich would have been required in the first instance for the intended or resulting use, building, structure or\nlot under this subchapter, or any other applicable local law. For example, if the owner of a building wants to\nchange its use from one which is not allowed under this subchapter, to one which is allowed pursuant to a\ngeneral use permit, he or she may secure a general use permit and thus eliminate the non-conformity.\nLikewise, approval may be secured under this jurisdiction's subdivision regulations to recombine two lots\nwhich do not comply with the minimum area regulations for building lots into one which does.\n(2) The provisions in this section are primarily intended to deal with those situations where a non-\nconformity may easily be brought into compliance. In contrast, the procedures and standards in division (F)\nbelow are primarily intended to deal with those situations where it may be difficult or expensive to bring a\nnon-conformity into compliance, but the owner nevertheless wants permission to alter, expand, change,\nrebuild or resume it.\n(D) Failure to bring illegal non-conformity into compliance. Failure to bring an illegal nonconformity into\ncompliance will subject the property owner to enforcement under the provisions of G.S. \u00a7 160D-404 and\n\u00a7\n154.005-11. If an illegal non-conformity has not been brought into compliance within 90 days after\nenforcement remedies are exhausted, the county is authorized to petition the courts for an injunction and/or\norder of abatement as described below.\n(E) Reservation of authority of deal with non-conformities under other powers.\n(1) Notwithstanding the policies and provisions of this subchapter, with respect to non-conformities,\nthe\ngoverning body expressly reserves its authority to initiate court-ordered action against unlawful uses,\nbuildings, structures and lots, including those which unlawfully existed prior to the adoption of this\nsubchapter, and to control or abate noxious uses, to require the repair or demolition of unsafe buildings or\nstructures, or to control or eliminate unsafe or hazardous conditions through the exercise of any powers\nother than the ones exercised under this subchapter.\n(2) Where for any reason a non-conforming use is determined to be subject to enforcement action due\nto termination of its grandfathered status, such action shall be brought within ten years after the\ntermination.\n(F) Special use permit required for any proposed alteration, expansion, change, rebuilding, or\nresumption of a non-conformity. The altering, expanding, changing, rebuilding or resuming of a non-\nconformity is only allowed pursuant to a special use permit under \u00a7\u00a7 154.010 Special use permits for\nthese types of non-conformities are issued by the Planning Board for proposals located in the VR District,\nand the Board of Adjustment for proposals located in all other districts. A petition for a special use permit\nshall be filed with the Surry County Zoning Administrator. The Planning Board or Board of Adjustment shall\nfix a time and place for the hearing, give notice thereof to the interested parties and the public, and render\nand give notice of its decision.\n(1) The terms altering, expanding and changing shall be strictly construed.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\n71/236\n"}, {"page": "72", "text": "6/17/24, 7:57 PM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\n(2) Rebuilding means the rebuilding, reconstruction or restoration of any nonconforming building or\nstructure which was damaged or partially destroyed by an exercise of the power of eminent domain or by\nfire, flood, wind, explosion or other calamity or act of God, if the cost of the rebuilding, reconstruction or\nrestoration will be 50% or more of the replacement cost of such building or structure at the time such\ndamage or destruction occurred. If the cost will be less than 50% of the replacement cost, a special use\npermit must, nevertheless, be obtained from the Board of Adjustment under the procedures of \u00a7\u00a7 154.010,\nbut the Board of Adjustment is only required to find that the nature and degree of the non-conformity will not\nbe changed or increased from that which existed prior to the damage or destruction.\n(3) Resuming means the reusing or reoccupying of a non-conforming building or structure which was\nunused or unoccupied for a continuous period of 365 days or more, or the resuming of a non-conforming\nuse which was ceased for a continuous period of 120 days or more. If a non-conforming building or\nstructure is reused or reoccupied or a previously ceased use is resumed within a lesser period of time, no\npermit is required under this subchapter as long as the nature and degree of the non-conformity will not be\nchanged or increased from that which existed before the non-conformity became unused, unoccupied or\nceased.\n(4) Ceased means that a use or occupation has ended and activity has been discontinued. For\npurposes of this subchapter, the ending, cessation, or abandonment of a use or occupation shall not be\ninterpreted to require the intent to do so permanently or for any given period of time.\n(5) The Zoning Administrator shall be permitted to approve minor alterations and additions, for loading,\noffice or storage area expansions only, to a non-conformity so long as the addition or alteration does not\nexceed 25% of the existing square footage, not to exceed 3,000 square feet, of the structure. This\nexception shall only be permitted once every three years per non-conformity.\n(6) In acting upon a petition for a special use permit, the Board of Adjustment cannot order the\ndiscontinuance or termination of a non-conformity, refuse to allow the development of a vacant lot, or\nrefuse to allow the alteration, expansion, change, rebuilding or resumption of a non-conformity which\ncannot comply with the yard and height regulations. If a petition is denied, the continuation of a non-\nconformity and the normal maintenance and repair thereof will still be allowed under this chapter without a\ngeneral or special use permit. This policy is adopted to encourage owners of non-conformities to apply for\npermits to improve and bring them into conformance to the extent possible without imposing any\nunreasonable sanctions if total conformance is not possible under the regulations of this chapter.\n(G) Grandfathered non-conforming automobile salvage yards and junkyards.\n(1)\nYards eligible for grandfathered status. In order to be eligible to be grandfathered as a non-\nconformity under this chapter, an automobile salvage yard or junkyard must meet the following criteria:\n(a) The yard was permitted and registered prior to September 17, 2001 under the Automobile\nSalvage Yard and Junkyard Ordinance adopted on August 1, 1992; and\n(b) The yard was permitted and registered under the Grandfathered Salvage Yards and Junkyards\nAmendment passed by the Surry County Board of County Commissioners on September 18, 2006\n(hereinafter the \"2006 GF Amendment\");\n(c) The yard must be on the list of active yards as of January 1, 2007 maintained by the Planning\nand Development Office; and\n(d) The grandfathered status of the yard must not have been lost by abandonment, cessation, or\ndiscontinuation, by administrative action of Surry County, or otherwise.\n(2) Level of yard usage grandfathered. Unless a special use permit is obtained, the level of usage of a\ngrandfathered yard may not exceed the highest level of use which occurred on the property during the\nseven years prior to the enactment of this chapter.\n(3) Reregistration and application for interim operating permit. All grandfathered yards remaining in\noperation after the date this chapter is enacted are required to reregister with Development Services and\napply for an interim permit to operate a grandfathered yard within six months of the date this chapter is\nenacted.

Each district was formulated\nusing goals and recommendations from the Surry County Land Use Plan.\n(A) RA, Rural Agricultural District. The purpose of this district is to maintain a rural development pattern\nwhere single-family housing is intermingled with agricultural and appropriate non-residential uses, as\ndescribed in the Table of Uses in \u00a7 154.007-01, and may not have access to public water and sewer\nsystems. This district is also designed to protect rural areas from the intrusion of non-agricultural land uses\nthat could create a nuisance, detract from the quality of life and/or present a danger to the natural\nenvironment.\n(B) RE, Residential Exclusive District. The purpose of this district is to stabilize established and planned\nresidential neighborhoods by providing a place for medium density on-site stick-built homes, provided that\nadequate water and sewer systems are available.\n(C) RR, Restricted Residential District. The purpose of this district is to stabilize established and\nplanned residential neighborhoods by providing a place for medium density on-site stick-built and modular\nhomes, provided that adequate water and sewer systems are available.\n(D) RL, Residential Limited District. The purpose of this district is to stabilize established and planned\nresidential neighborhoods by providing a place for medium density on-site stick-built, modular and Class A\nmanufactured homes, provided that adequate water and sewer systems are available.\n(E) RG, Residential General District. The purpose of this district is to provide a place for medium density\nresidential uses of all types, on-site stick-built, modular and Class A and B manufactured homes, provided\nthat adequate water and sewer systems are available.\n(F) PR-CD, Planned Residential Conditional District. The purpose of the Planned Residential\nConditional District (PR-CD) is to encourage the development of environments which provide certain\ndevelopment privileges in exchange for preplanning and design considerations. The PR-CD provides an\nalternative to conventional subdivision design by promoting the conservation and creation of viable,\nconnected open space and more flexible lot design options while minimizing development costs. The\nPlanned Residential Conditional District (PR-CD) provides flexibility in utilizing new development concepts,\nincluding the incorporation of a limited number of non-residential uses. In return for development flexibility,\nadditional site plan information and development conditions may be required of the developer to assist in\nevaluating the suitability of a proposed PR-CD. While maximum open space preservation and high-quality\nresidential development is the primary goal of PR-CDs, open space within PR-CDs must balance the need\nfor open space preservation with an increased need for integration with surrounding developments through\nstreet connectivity and compatibility with adjacent and internal land uses. Minimum acreage, lot\ndimensions, setbacks and building height requirements are described in \u00a7 154.006-19.\n(G) RPD, Rural Preservation Conditional District.\n(1) The purpose of this district is to preserve the rural community character sometimes lost in\nconventional development approaches by allowing greater flexibility and creativity in the design of the\ndevelopment with clustering lots and preserving open space. Specific objectives of the RPD district are as\nfollows: the intent is to maintain density similar to surrounding districts but provide flexibility to maintain\nopen spaces with lot sizes not less than 10,000 sq ft.\n(a) To preserve areas of the county with productive soils for continued agricultural uses. Therefore if\na parcel abuts RA the overall density shall not exceed one lot/acre;\n(b) To minimize site disturbance and erosion through retention of existing vegetation and avoiding\ndevelopment on steep slopes;\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download\n78/236\n"}, {"page": "79", "text": "6/17/24, 7:57 PM\nkport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\n(c) To preserve open land, including those areas containing unique and sensitive features such as\nnatural areas and wildlife habitats, steep slopes, streams, wetlands, and floodplains;\n(d) To preserve scenic views and elements of the county's rural character, and to minimize perceived\ndensity by minimizing views of new development from existing roads and existing development;\n(e) To provide for the active and passive recreational needs of the residents;\n(f) To provide greater efficiency in the siting of services and infrastructure by reducing road length,\nutility extensions and the amount of impervious surface for development; and\n(g) To create compact neighborhoods accessible to open space amenities and with a strong identity.\n(2) Minimum acreage, lot dimensions, setbacks and building height requirements are described in \u00a7\n154.006-20.\n(H) MR, Multi-Family Residential District. The purpose of this district is to provide a place for high-\ndensity residential development where the principal use will be multi-family development, provided that\nadequate water and sewer systems are available.\n(I) MHP, Manufactured Home Park District. The purpose of this district is to provide a place for high-\ndensity development of manufactured homes in a park like setting that is subject to the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7\n154.019 and requires conditional zoning to be requested and approved for new manufactured home parks\nproposed after the date of adoption of this chapter.\n(J) RB, Rural Business District. The purpose of this district is to accommodate existing business and\ncommercial establishments that may be isolated from similar land uses. The rural business district is\nintended for such establishments located in rural areas where residential and/or agricultural operations are\npredominant land uses.\n(K) CB, Community Business District. The purpose of this district is to accommodate retail, service and\nrelated businesses that are usually clustered together and cater to the immediate community. Community\nBusiness Districts should typically be located at the intersection of collector and arterial roads. These sites\nshall have direct access to collector and arterial roads, provided that adequate water and sewer systems\nare available.\n(L) HB, Highway Business District. The purpose of this district is to accommodate the development of\nretail, service and related businesses which are located along, and have direct access to, major roadways\nthroughout the county which cater to the traveling public; and these sites should have access to public\nwater and sewer systems.\n(M) MI, Manufacturing Industrial District. The purpose of this district is to provide locations for intensive\nindustrial and/or manufacturing, processing and assembly uses and to protect adjacent rural/residential\nareas from such land uses; and these sites should have access to public water and sewer systems.\n(N) VR, Village of Rockford District. The purpose of this district is to allow a mixture of appropriate\nresidential and non-residential uses in the Rockford National Register Historic District. This district allows\nthis village area to continue development patterns initiated in the 1790s. This district is a zoning district with\nboth conventional and form-based and design features, as authorized by G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 160D-703(a) and 160D-\n702(b)(2).\n(O) CP, Conservation Protected District. The purpose of this district is to preserve and limit development\nwithin certain land and/or water areas which serve as wildlife refuges, possess natural beauty, are utilized\nfor outdoor recreational purposes, provide needed open space and are environmentally sensitive.\n(P) TO, Thoroughfare Overlay District. The purpose of this overlay district is to guide the development of\noff-premises signs to preserve the county's natural features for the traveling public, as governed by this\nsubchapter.\n(Q) SBO, Scenic Byway Overlay. The purpose of this overlay district is to guide the physical appearance\nof new and expanded land use for the traveling public, as governed by this subchapter.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download\n79/236\n"}, {"page": "80", "text": "6/17/24, 7:57 PM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\n(R) WO, Watershed Overlay District. The purpose of this overlay district is to identify the areas of the\ncounty which can regulate lot sizes, built upon areas and non-residential development, as governed by \u00a7\u00a7\n154.017.\n(S) AO-1, Elkin Municipal Airport Overlay District.

walls or fences. Minimum dimensional requirements for private\nswimming pools/tennis courts shall be equal to those for accessory structures.\n(2) Minimum lot sizes are contingent upon approval of the Environmental Health Department in areas\nwhich do not have access to both municipal water and sewer systems. Larger lot sizes may be required\nbased on site evaluations.\n(3) Any lot abutting a state-maintained road shall have at least 75 feet of road frontage; lots abutting a\nstate-maintained road in a cul-de-sac shall have at least 45 feet of road frontage. Exception given to flag\nlots as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 154.013.\n(4) Lot width shall be measured at the actual front setback line. Maximum building height shall be\nmeasured at the roof deck or the highest point of a pitched roof.\n(5) Minimum dimensional requirements are subject to more stringent requirements to any property\nwithin an overlay zoning district. In those cases, the most restrictive requirements shall apply.\n(6) Zero lot line developments are permitted as described in this subchapter.\n(7) Lot sizes and dimensions for the PR-CD and RPD districts are listed in \u00a7 154.006-19 and \u00a7\n154.006-20 respectively.\n(Ord. passed 4-17-2023)\n\u00a7 154.006-16 CONDITIONAL ZONING.\n(A) Purpose.\n(1) Pursuant to G.S. \u00a7 160D-703(b), conditional zoning districts are zoning districts in which the\ndevelopment and the use of the property is subject to specific conditions proposed by the petitioner or\nthe\ncounty, but only those conditions mutually approved by both the petitioner and the Board of Commissioners\nmay be incorporated into the zoning regulations. Conditions and site-specific standards imposed in a\nconditional zoning district shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the development and\nuse of the site to county ordinances, adopted plans, or the impacts reasonably expected to be generated\nby the development or use of the site. Conditional zoning is considered as a legislative decision creating\nthe district and applying it to the parcel or parcels.\n(2) Each conditional zoning district corresponds to each of the general districts authorized in this\nchapter and listed in \u00a7 154.006-11. It is recognized that certain types of zoning districts would be\ninappropriate at locations in the absence of special conditions. Conditional zoning districts are a means by\nwhich special conditions can be imposed in the furtherance of the purpose of this chapter. Conditional\nzoning districts are intended to support firm plans for development. As a result, the conditional zoning\ndistrict classification will be considered for rezoning only upon request of a property owner with the\npresentation of one or more of the following: limitations on allowed uses from those normally permitted in\nthe requested zoning district; written conditions limiting how the property or buildings proposed are\ndeveloped; and a major site plan.\n(3) Within a conditional zoning district, only those uses authorized as permitted or special uses in the\nzoning district with which the district corresponds shall be permitted, and all other requirements of the\ncorresponding district shall be met as minimum standards unless the County Commissioners explicitly\napprove conditions reducing minimum standards. Additional limitations on use and other requirements may\nbe added as conditions as agreed to mutually by the petitioner and by the County Commissioners.\n(B) Standards and conditions. A conditional zoning district allows uses to be established only in\naccordance with specific standards and conditions pertaining to each individual development project. Some\nland uses are of such a nature and scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediate area and\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\n82/236\n"}, {"page": "83", "text": "6/17/24, 7:57 PM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download\non the entire community, which cannot be predetermined and controlled by the standards of a general use\ndistrict. In addition, this process will ensure compatibility with the land use plan and other adopted district\nplans, corridor plans and area plans. The review process established in \u00a7\u00a7 154.009 provides for a specific\nreview process subject to specific conditions which mitigate concerns with the proposed development and\nensure compatibility of the use with the surrounding community.\n(C) Compliance with general use district provisions. Any petition to amend district boundaries to create a\nconditional zoning shall comply with procedures and provisions for general use district amendments set out\nin this chapter especially \u00a7\u00a7 154.009.\n(D) Conditions on development activities.\n(1) A landowner petitioning to rezone land to a conditional zoning district may propose conditions to be\nplaced on the property should a rezoning to a conditional zoning district be approved by the Board of\nCommissioners. The petition shall specify any proposed conditions on the petition and the development\nplan, if included. These conditions shall be in addition to the limitation on uses as provided in this\nsubchapter.\n(2) Any proposed conditions shall impose requirements that are more restrictive than those generally\napplicable in the corresponding general use district. For example, conditions might propose to limit the\nnumber of permitted uses to one or more specified uses. They might also propose to limit the number, size,\nlocation, and design of structures, exterior building materials, the location and extent of supporting facilities,\nthe location and extent of special purpose areas, the location and extent of parking areas and\ningress/egress points, location and extent of buffer areas, the hours of business operation or the timing of\ndevelopment.\n(3) The Board of Commissioners may request conditions, in addition to those self-imposed by the\npetitioner, if the conditions directly relate to the protection of the health, safety and general welfare of the\nsurrounding community and the public. Only those conditions approved by the Board of Commissioners\nand consented to by the petitioner in writing may be incorporated into the zoning regulations.\n(4) No condition, however, may restrict the race, religion, ownership status or character of district\noccupants, or contain any other exclusionary restrictions. Nor may any condition purport to abridge or affect\nany other applicable federal, state or local law.\n(5) A landowner must submit a development plan according to the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 154.009 and \u00a7\u00a7\n154.012, as a condition to regulate future development of the land.\n(Ord. passed 4-17-2023)\n\u00a7 154.006-17 CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICTS SUPPLEMENT FOR ZONING PERMITS.\nIn the event a petition to conditional zoning is approved, no zoning permit shall be issued until the Zoning\nAdministrator has stamped a development plan and the approved rezoning petition with conditions.\n(Ord. passed 4-17-2023)\n\u00a7 154.006-18 EFFECT OF APPROVAL.\n(A) If a petition for conditional zoning is approved, the development and use of the parcel or parcels\nshall be governed by the predetermined ordinance requirements applicable to the district's category, the\napproved site plan for the district, and any additional approved rules, regulations and conditions, all of\nwhich shall constitute the zoning regulations for the approved district and are binding on the property as an\namendment to these regulations and to the zoning maps.\n(B) The approval of any use or uses in any conditional zoning district which would otherwise require a\nspecial use permit in the corresponding general use zoning district shall preclude any requirements for\nobtaining a special use permit.\n(C) If a petition is approved, the petitioner shall comply with all requirements established in \u00a7\u00a7 154.004\nfor obtaining a building permit and certificate of occupancy. Only those uses and structures indicated in the\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\n83/236\n"}, {"page": "84", "text": "6/17/24, 7:57 PM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\napproved petition and site plan shall be allowed on the subject parcel or parcels.\n(D) Following the approval of the petition for a conditional zoning district, the subject property shall be\nidentified on the zoning maps by the appropriate district designation. A corresponding conditional zoning\ndistrict shall be identified by the same designation as the underlying general use district followed by the\nletter \"C\" (ex. RA-C). If the county uses a color scheme identifying zoning districts on the zoning map, then\nthe conditional zoning district shall use the same color as the corresponding general use district.\n(Ord. passed 4-17-2023)\n\u00a7 154.006-19 PLANNED RESIDENTIAL CONDITIONAL DISTRICT (PR-CD).\n(A) Minimum size. A PR-CD shall be located on a site containing at least five contiguous acres.\n(B) PR-CDs do not have any inherent permitted or special uses and development activities are only\nallowed through specific conditions approved by the Board of Commissioners; however, PR-CDs are\nprimarily intended for single-family developments. A maximum of 10% of the total land of the development\nmay be utilized for multi-family or non-residential uses, with the exception that 15% of the land may be\nutilized for a combination of lodging and other non-residential uses. The compatibility, location, and\nappropriateness of any multi-family or non-residential uses proposed shall be carefully considered. Those\nuses permitted and conditions approved by the Board of Commissioners shall be reflected on the\nconditional zoning district supplement issued by the Zoning Administrator.\n(C) Relationship to other applicable regulations. A PR-CD shall be subject to all applicable standards,\nprocedures and regulations of this chapter unless otherwise set forth in this section.\n(D) Maximum density. Proposed maximum residential density shall be indicated in the PR-CD\napplication and the required site plan which is to be submitted. The proposed density shall compliment the\nadopted land use plan and predominant density of the zoning districts abutting the subject property. All land\nproposed for non-residential development shall be excluded from density calculations. If all the PR-CD or a\nportion of the PR-CD is unable to be served by public water and sewer, minimum lot sizes and maximum\ndensity shall be determined in consultation with the Surry County Health Department.\n(E) Development standards. A PR-CD shall meet the following standards:\n(1) Outside perimeter lot setback requirements. Any lot which adjoins the outside boundary of the PR-\nCD shall be considered an outside perimeter lot. Internal streets are those contained within the boundary of\nthe PR-CD. Adjoining streets are those not located within the PR-CD but are adjacent to the outside\nboundary of the PR-CD. The following setbacks shall be required for outside perimeter lots.\n(a) Lots with access on an internal street. The rear yard setback requirement of the existing zoning\ndistrict in which the PR-CD is proposed shall be required.\n(b) Lots with access on an adjoining street. The front yard setback requirements of the existing\nzoning district in which the PR-CD is proposed shall be required.\n(c) Corner lots with access either on an internal or adjoining street. The front yard setback\nrequirements of the existing zoning district in which the PR-CD is proposed shall be required on the\nadjoining street and the front yard setback requirements allowed in the PR-CD shall be permitted on the\ninternal street.\n(d) Access drives. No loading space, parking space or access drive to a parking space shall be\npermitted within any required buffer yard.\n(2) Required parking.\n(a) Off-street parking.\n1. Off-street parking shall be provided in compliance with \u00a7\u00a7 154.014; except that, the parking\nrequirements may be met through group parking located on commonly owned land.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\n84/236\n"}, {"page": "85", "text": "6/17/24, 7:57 PM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\n2.\nAdditionally, any required parking spaces located between the fronts of residential buildings and\npublic rights-of-way or private access easements shall be at least 20 feet in depth and shown on the PR-\nCD site plan. In no instances shall off-street parking spaces extend into public rights-of-way or private\naccess easements. All off-street parking shall be on an improved surface constructed of concrete or\nasphalt.\n(b) Special accommodations. Special accommodations for recreational vehicles, including boats,\nmay be provided in group parking areas. Such special parking areas shall be designated and screened\nfrom adjacent residential uses.\n(3) Private streets. Private streets are permitted in PR-CDs at the discretion of the Board of\nCommissioners. Where permitted, private streets shall be built in accordance with the requirements of the\nNorth Carolina Department of Transportation, Division of Highways, Minimum Construction Standards for\nSubdivision Roads or Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) Guidelines, August 2000, as\namended, shall serve as minimum guidelines for design. However, public streets may be required to ensure\nadequate street connectivity.\n(4) Pedestrian access. Pedestrian and other modes of non-vehicular movement shall be provided in\naccordance with \u00a7\u00a7 154.013.\n(5) Lot dimensional requirements and spacing of structures. Lot and setback dimensional\nrequirements for individual lots within a PR-CD are flexible, except for a minimum ten-foot building setback\nfrom public rights-of-way and private access easements. Minimum distances between single-family, duplex\nand twin home structures shall be as follows:\n(a) Front or rear facing front. The minimum distance between the front wall of one structure and the\nrear wall of another structure, or the front walls of structures oriented to face each other, shall be not less\nthan 30 feet from one another.\n(b) Rear facing rear. Dwellings oriented back-to-back shall be subject to the following provisions:\n1. The minimum distance between rear walls of the dwellings shall be no less than 30 feet.\n2. Accessory structures shall only be permitted in the intervening space between principal\ndwellings oriented back-to-back or to the rear yard of the principal dwelling.\n3. Front facing side. The minimum distance between the front wall of the structure and the side\nwall of another structure shall not be less than 16 feet to allow for fire lanes.\n4. Side or rear facing side. The minimum distance between the rear of a structure and side of\nanother structure, or the minimum distance between the side walls of structures, shall not be less than 16\nfeet to allow for fire lanes.\n5. Front loaded garages. All front-loaded garages shall be set back no less than 20 feet from\npublic rights-of-way or private access easements.\n6. Perimeter buffer. Where perimeter lots in PR-CDs do not meet the minimum lot area and\ndimensional requirements of the surrounding zoning district(s), a minimum 30-foot buffer is required\nbetween these lots and the adjacent single family zoning district. The buffer shall contain a minimum of four\ncanopy trees, ten understory trees and 33 shrubs per 100 linear feet. The planting material comprising the\nbuffer shall be spread across the width of buffer and not just planted in rows. The intent of this section is to\nsoften the appearance of the development and not necessarily screen it from view. Shrubs shall be\nexpected to reach a minimum height of 36 inches, and a minimum spread of 30 inches within three years of\nplanting. Understory trees shall be a minimum of four feet high with a minimum caliper of one inch,\nmeasured six inches above grade when planted. Canopy trees shall be a minimum of eight feet in height\nand two inches in caliper, measured six inches above grade, when planted. When mature, a canopy tree\nshould be at least 40 feet high and have a crown width of 30 feet or greater. A minimum of 25% of the\nunderstory trees and 75% of the shrubs shall be evergreens. The preservation of existing stands of trees\nand shrubs is strongly encouraged and can be credited toward meeting this requirement if sufficiently\ndemonstrated on the site plan and accompanied by pictures. This buffer shall be located on commonly\nowned land and shall be considered open space as described in division (E)(6) below. Where any\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download\n85/236\n"}, {"page": "86", "text": "6/17/24, 7:57 PM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\nindividual lot in the PR-CD does not meet the dimensional and area requirements of an abutting single-\nfamily zoning district, the buffer shall be required along the entire length of the PR-CD that abuts the\nexisting development.\n(6) Common open space.\n(a) Area. Common open space shall not be less than 25% of the total development area. Open\nspace shall be held in common ownership by a homeowner's association or accepted by the county as\npublic open space.\n(b) Limitations on flood hazard land as open space. Land within a floodway or floodway fringe, as\ndefined by FEMA, may be used to provide not more than 50% of the required open space.\n(c) Qualification. To qualify as open space, land shall be usable for recreation purposes or shall\nprovide visual, aesthetic or environmental amenities and may not be occupied by streets, drives, parking\nareas, or structures other than recreational structures. At least 30% of the gross area (unless otherwise\nallowed by the Board of Commissioners) dedicated (for open space) must be suitable for and designed to\nbe used as active recreation space (for example, walking trails, ball fields, playgrounds and the like).\n(d) Letter of credit for maintenance of open space required. Following inspection and approval of the\nconstruction and/or installation of all required recreational areas in each phase of the development, the\ndeveloper shall submit a letter of credit issued in the county's favor, for 100% of the annual maintenance\ncost of these facilities as agreed upon and approved by the Zoning Administrator. Such letter of credit shall\nbe renewed every 12 months until such time as the developer ceases to have the controlling vote in the\nhomeowner's association, as recorded in the articles of incorporation of the homeowner's association, and\nthe county has received written notice thereof along with a copy of the names, addresses and phone\nnumbers of all duly elected members of the homeowner's association board of directors.\n(e) Access to open space. All property owners within the development shall have access to open\nspace by means of a public street or improved walkway located in an easement at least 15 feet in width.\n(f) Open space connectivity requirements. Where practicable, areas of open space within a PR-CD\nshall be connected. Separate areas of active open space on site shall be connected by a sidewalk or\npedestrian path consisting of an all-weather surface. Open space in PR-CDs shall adjoin open space in\nneighboring parcels where practicable. If public parks or greenways are present on adjacent sites, a\npedestrian connection to these resources shall be made from the PR-CD.\n(g) Maintenance of open space. Maintenance of the open space, as shown on the approved plan,\nshall be required in perpetuity and shall be the responsibility of the homeowner's association.\n(7) Alternative compliance. Alternative compliance measures may be proposed which vary from the\nstrict application of the above requirements in order to accommodate the unique character of the site or\nto\nutilize innovative design. Alternative compliance may be granted by the Board of Commissioners upon a\nfinding that the proposed alternative fulfills the intent of this chapter as well as, or better than would strict\ncompliance with the requirements of this subchapter.\n(8) Front yard canopy trees required. The front yard of each lot shall contain at least two trees,\nsuitable for healthy growth in our climate. Each tree shall have a minimum caliper of one and one-half\ninches measured at a height of six inches above grade.\n(9) Architectural standards for residential dwellings. In order to improve and maintain the quality of\nresidential neighborhoods, protect the investments of residents and promote the interests of the community\nas outlined in the county's adopted land use plan, the developer may submit a list of minimum architectural\nstandards to be incorporated throughout the PR-CD to Development Services staff during the pre-\napplication conference. Standards submitted are encouraged to address the following issues: roof pitch,\nbuilding materials, foundation type and facing materials, fences (front and rear), pools, accessory buildings,\nporches, decks, articulation, garages and number and frequency of dwelling design.\n(10) Platting requirements. All PR-CDs shall meet the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 154.013. In addition, prior to\na permit being issued for the construction of any building, there shall have been recorded in the office of\nthe Surry County Register of Deeds, a plat of the property or section thereof, showing easement and right-\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\n86/236\n"}, {"page": "87", "text": "6/17/24, 7:57 PM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\nof-way widths, street widths, the actual or approximate location of single-family lots, commonly owned\ntracts, and lots and buildings to be occupied by other uses.\n(Ord. passed 4-17-2023)\n\u00a7 154.006-20 RURAL PRESERVATION DISTRICT (RPD).\n(A) This district shall be allowed as a conditional zoning district.\n(B) Minimum size. An RPD shall be located on a site containing at least five contiguous acres.\n(C) Septic system and repair areas and water systems may be in common areas, provided that\nappropriate measures are taken to ensure maintenance through a homeowner's association. System\ndesigns must be obtained and approved from the Surry County Environmental Health Department.\n(D) Design, lot, and density requirements.\n(1) Notwithstanding the development standards set out in this subchapter, RDP districts shall be\nexempt from the minimum lot size requirements and side property line setbacks of this subchapter except\nfor those within a watershed area and outstanding resource watershed area, provided the developmental\nstandards and other requirements herein are met.

Any parcel or lot that falls within a\nWatershed Overlay District shall be required to adhere to the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 154.017 and this code of\nordinances, as amended. The following watersheds (which include their critical and protected areas, as\nwell as the balance of the watershed areas) in Surry County are included in the Watershed Overlay District:\nThe watershed areas are established and described in \u00a7\u00a7 154.017.\n(1) Fisher River: WS-II.\n(2) Elkin Creek: WS-II.\n(3) Tom's Creek: WS-II.\n(4) Stewart's Creek: WS-IV.\n(5) Lovill's Creek: WS-IV.\n(6) Ararat River: WS-IV; and\n(7) Yadkin River-King: WS-IV.\n(D) Elkin Municipal Airport Overlay District (AO-1). The Elkin Municipal Airport Overlay District (AO-1) is\nhereby established to identify on the zoning map areas in the vicinity of the Elkin Municipal Airport that are\ncritical to air navigation. This section is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by G.S. Ch. 63, Art. 4. It\nis hereby found that an obstruction has the potential for endangering the lives and property of users of the\nElkin Municipal Airport, and property or occupants of land in its vicinity; that an obstruction may affect\nexisting and future instrument approach minimums of the Elkin Municipal Airport; and that an obstruction\nmay in effect reduce the size of areas available for the landing, takeoff and maneuvering of aircraft, thus\ntending to destroy or impair the utility of the Elkin Municipal Airport and the public investment therein, and is\ntherefore not in the interest of the public safety or general welfare chapter, there are hereby created and\nestablished certain zones which include all the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional\nsurfaces, horizontal surfaces and conical surfaces as they apply to the Elkin Municipal Airport. Such zones\nare shown on the Elkin Municipal Airport height restriction zones map consisting of one sheet representing\nthe current version on file in the Surry County Development Services Department and made a part hereof.\nAn area located in more than one of the following zones is only in the zone with the more restrictive height\nlimitation.\n(1) The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:\n(a) Runways larger than utility with a visibility minimum greater than three-fourths mile non-precision\ninstrument approach zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary\nsurface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a\nhorizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the\ncenterline of the runway.\n(b) Transitional zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces.\n(c) Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the\ncenter of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing\nlines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.\n(d) Conical zone. The conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of\nthe horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. The conical zone\ndoes not include the transitional zone.\n(2) Airport zone height limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure shall be\nerected, altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this chapter to\na height in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for such zone. Such applicable height\nlimitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows:\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download\n89/236\n"}, {"page": "90", "text": "6/17/24, 7:57 PM\nxport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\n(a) Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum greater than a mile non-precision instrument\napproach zone: slopes 34 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same\nelevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended\nrunway centerline.\n(b) Transitional zones: slope seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and\nat the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach surface and extending to a height of 100\nfeet above the airport elevation, or at an elevation of 1,168 feet above mean sea level.\n(c) Horizontal zone: established at 100 feet above the airport elevation, or at an elevation of 1,168\nfeet above mean sea level.\n(d) Conical zone: slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the periphery of the\nhorizontal zone and at 100 feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of 300 feet above the\nairport elevation.\n(e) Excepted height limitations.

No\npermit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter shall be granted unless a variance has been\napproved in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 154.010.\n(a) In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be\nrequired for any tree or structure less than 70 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when,\nbecause of terrain, land contour or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the\nheight limits prescribed for such zones.\n(b) In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than\n4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 70\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\n90/236\n"}, {"page": "91", "text": "6/17/24, 7:57 PM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\nfeet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height\nlimit prescribed for such approach zones.\n(c) In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal\nzone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 70 feet of vertical height above the\nground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, would\nextend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones.\n(d) Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or\nintending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of\nthe height limits established by this subchapter, except as set forth in divisions (C)(2), (C)(3) and (C)(4)\nabove. In the event a tree is allowed to grow in excess of the height limits established by this subchapter,\nexcept as set forth in divisions (C)(2), (C)(3) and (C)(4) above, said tree shall be removed, topped, trimmed\nor otherwise modified to bring into compliance with this subchapter. If the Zoning Administrator or his or her\ndesignee determines that the tree adversely affects the safe use of the airport, the Town of Elkin will pay for\nthe direct cost to remove, top, trim or otherwise modify said tree to bring into compliance with this\nsubchapter.\n(6) Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an\nairport obstruction that is a hazard to air navigation or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to\nbecome a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this chapter or any\namendments thereto or that it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all\napplications for such a permit shall be granted.\n(7) Non-conforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the Surry County Zoning Administrator\ndetermines that a non-conforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80% torn down,\nphysically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to\nexceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.\n(8) Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the\ngrowth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this section, may\napply to the Board of Adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be\naccompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on\nthe operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances\nshall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result\nin unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a\nhazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this section.\nAdditionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this section may be considered by the Board\nof\nAdjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the Zoning Administrator or his or her\ndesignee for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance.

This subchapter provides for several uses to be located by right in each\ngeneral zoning district, subject to meeting certain area, height, yard, and off-street parking and loading\nrequirements. Uses shown with references in the far-right column in the Table of Uses of \u00a7 154.007-01\nshall also be subject to the requirements and review process in this section. Some of those uses are also\nsubject to the issuance of a special use permit by the Board of Adjustment or Planning Board (for uses in\nthe VR District) to ensure compatibility with surrounding development and in keeping with the purposes of\nthe general zoning district in which they are located. Those uses that require a special use permit are\nshown with an \"S\" in the Table of Uses. These development standards are supplementary to the general\nrequirements of this chapter. They are designed to allow development of uses that may need extra\nbuffering or attention to layout to make them compatible with surrounding uses.\n(B) Conditions imposed. For uses that require a special use permit, the Board of Adjustment or, for the\nVR District, the Planning Board, may impose reasonable conditions in addition to those given in this section\nand elsewhere in this chapter. To do this, the approval body must determine that additional conditions are\nnecessary to protect the welfare and safety of the public and of property, or to meet the tests given\nelsewhere in this chapter.\n(C) Requirements. Below are specific requirements for specific uses by name. They are as follows:\n(1) Accessory dwelling units on same lot as principal dwelling.\n(a) Accessory dwellings in non-residential districts: in zoning districts not otherwise permitting\nresidential buildings. A watchman or caretaker may occupy a residential dwelling on the same premises\nwhere he or she is employed. The residential dwelling must clearly be incidental to the non-residential\noperation on the zoning lot.\n(b) Exemptions for mobile homes. In a zoning district where manufactured homes are permitted, an\nindividual may petition the Planning Board to place a manufactured home as a temporary second dwelling\non a single parcel that does not meet minimum lot size requirements. However, prior to issuance of a\nconditional use for hardship, the Environmental Health Department must approve the additional septic\nsystem on the parcel in question. Conditional uses for hardship must be renewed annually by the Planning\nBoard. If, for any reason, the conditions of the hardship cease to exist, the conditional use shall become\nnull and void. Conditional uses for hardship are for temporary situations only.\n(2) Adult entertainment. See Permitted Use Table NAICS Classification Number 71.\n(a) It is and shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation, as hereafter defined, to operate or\nallow to be operated adult live entertainment or an adult live entertainment business within the boundaries\nof Surry County outside the corporate limits of any city or town within the boundary of Surry County, except\nas otherwise permitted by this chapter.\n(b) Adult live entertainment which permits less than completely or opaquely covered human genitals\nor pubic region of either males or females is expressly prohibited.\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\n123/236\n"}, {"page": "124", "text": "6/17/24, 7:57 PM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\n(c) For definitions of adult entertainment and establishments see \u00a7 154.003-02.\n(d) Locations.\n1. Adult live entertainment involving the display of less than completely or opaquely covered\nfemale breasts has been recognized by the State of North Carolina as a protected display of free speech\nwhich is subject to reasonable local regulation as to geographic location to serve a substantial\ngovernmental interest if such regulation allows for reasonable alternative areas for the regulated activity.\nAccordingly, adult live entertainment which includes the display of less than completely or opaquely\ncovered female breasts, uncovered below a point immediately at the top of the areola, is permitted only in\nan enclosed building, premises or structure where the activity is not visible from outside of the enclosed\nbuilding or structure. Such enclosed building or structure must be located at least 2,000 feet from an area\nof interest.

This chapter provides for several uses to be located by right in each\ngeneral zoning district subject to the use meeting certain area, height, yard, and off-street parking and\nloading requirements. In addition to these uses, this chapter allows some uses in districts subject to the\nissuance of a special use permit by the Board of Adjustment. In the VR District, all special use permits are\nassigned to the Planning Board to consider and decide upon. The purpose of having such uses being\n\"special\" is to ensure that they would be compatible with surrounding development and in keeping with the\npurposes of the general zoning district in which they are located. Those uses shown as special in the\nPermitted Uses Table in \u00a7 154.007-01 shall be subject the requirements and review process of in this\nsection.\n(B) Approval process. Special use permits considered by either the Board of Adjustment or the Planning\nBoard shall follow the Board of Adjustment process as described in both \u00a7 154.004-02 and in this\nsubchapter, conducting an evidentiary hearing in accordance with all relevant provisions of G.S. \u00a7 160D-\n406. An application shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator and shall be accompanied by a plan\nmeeting the requirements of a major site plan in \u00a7\u00a7 154.011. The Zoning Administrator shall submit the site\nplan to the Technical Review Committee for review. The Technical Review Committee may, in its review,\nsuggest reasonable conditions to the location, nature, and extent of the proposed use and its relationship\nto\nsurrounding properties, parking areas, driveways, pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems, screening\nand landscaping, timing of development, and any other appropriate conditions. Such conditions may\ninclude dedication of any rights-of-way or easements for streets, water, sewer, or other public utilities\nnecessary to serve the proposed development. Conditions and safeguards imposed under this division\nshall not include requirements for which the county does not have authority under statute to regulate; nor\nrequirements for which the courts have held to be unenforceable if imposed directly by the county,\nincluding, without limitation, taxes, impact fees, building design elements within the scope of G.S. \u00a7 160D-\n702(b), driveway-related improvements in excess of those allowed in G.S. \u00a7 136-18(29) and G.S. \u00a7 160A-\n307, or other unauthorized limitations on the development or use of land. Following Technical Review\nCommittee review and recommendation, the Board of Adjustment shall hold an evidentiary hearing and\nconsider the application in accordance with the findings-of-fact in division (D) below.\n(C) Notice of hearing. Notice of evidentiary hearings conducted pursuant to this section shall be mailed\nto the person or entity whose application is the subject of the hearing; to the owner of the property that is\nthe subject of the hearing if the owner did not initiate the hearing; and to the owners of all parcels of land\nabutting the parcel of land that is the subject of the hearing. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the\ncounty may rely on the county tax listing to determine owners of property entitled to mailed notice. The\nnotice must be deposited in the mail at least ten days, but not more than 25 days, prior to the date of the\nhearing. Within that same time, the county shall also prominently post a notice of the hearing on the site\nthat is the subject of the hearing or on an adjacent street or highway right-of-way. Such notice shall be\nreadable to passersby and able to withstand rain and light wind. The Board of Adjustment may continue an\nevidentiary hearing that has been convened without further advertisement. If an evidentiary hearing is set\nfor a given date and a quorum of the Board is not then present, the hearing shall be continued until the next\nregular Board meeting without further advertisement.\n(D) Conditions, evidence, and findings-of-fact.\n(1) In approving an application for a special use permit, the Board of Adjustment may attach fair and\nreasonable conditions to the approval. The petitioner will have a reasonable opportunity to consider and\nrespond to any additional requirements prior to approval or denial by the Board of Adjustment. In no\ninstance shall any of these conditions be less restrictive than any requirements which would pertain to that\ndevelopment found elsewhere in a similar zoning district. The applicant shall provide consent in writing to\nthe conditions before the special use permit will be issued. The applicant has the burden of producing\ncompetent, material, and substantial evidence to establish the facts and conditions.\n(2) The Board of Adjustment shall issue a special use permit if it has evaluated an application and\ndetermined that:\n(a) The use will not materially endanger the public health or safety if located where proposed and\ndeveloped according to plan; and\n(b) The use meets all required conditions and specifications; and\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/downloa\n159/236\n"}, {"page": "160", "text": "6/17/24, 7:57 PM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/downl\n(c) The use will not substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property unless the use is a\npublic necessity; and\n(d) The location and character of the use, if developed according to the plan as submitted and\napproved, will be in harmony with the area in which it is to be located and will be in general conformity with\nthe adopted land use plans and other plans for physical development of Surry County as adopted by the\nBoard of Commissioners.\n(E) Effect of approval and expiration of approval. If an application for a special use permit is approved\nby the Board of Adjustment, the owner of the property shall have the ability to develop the use in\naccordance with the stipulations contained in the special use permit or develop any other use listed as a\n\"permitted use\" for the general zoning district in which it is located. Any special use permit so authorized\nshall be perpetually binding to the property included in such permit unless subsequently changed or\namended by the Board of Adjustment. Unless the Board of Adjustment issues a special use permit which\neither is specifically exempt from any time constraints or has some other specified time period for\nimplementation, the applicant must secure a valid building permit within a two years period from date of\nissuance of the special use permit. In addition, if the project for which a special use permit was issued is\nnot complete and a valid building permit is not in place at the end of said two year period, the Zoning\nAdministrator shall notify the applicant of either such finding, and within 60 days of said notification, shall\nmake a recommendation concerning the rescission of the special use permit. The Board of Adjustment,\nafter having conducted a public hearing to consider the rescission, may then rescind the special use permit,\nor extend the life of the special use permit for a specified period.\n(F) Alterations to site and amendments to special use permit. Amendments to special use permits shall\nfollow the process used to consider the special use permit.\n(G) Reapplication following denial. If a request for special use permit is denied by the Board of\nAdjustment, a similar application for the same property or any portion thereof shall be barred by res\njudicata unless there has been a material change in the facts or circumstances. When used herein, the\nphrase MATERIAL CHANGE shall mean a change of sufficient materiality that a decision on the new\npetition would not be barred by application of North Carolina law on res judicata. See, for example, Mount\nUlla Historical Pres. Soc., Inc. V. Rowan Cnty., 232 N.C. App. 436, 444 (2014).\n(H) Denial and appeal of special use permits.\n(1) Denial. If the Planning Board or Board of Adjustment denies the special use permit, it shall enter\nthe reason for its action in the minutes of the meeting at which the action is taken.\n(2) Appeal. No appeal may be taken from the action of the Planning Board or Board of Adjustment in\ngranting or denying a special use permit, except through the Surry County Superior Court within 30 days of\nthe decision or forever be barred.\n(Ord. passed 4-17-2023)\n\u00a7 154.010-02 STANDARDS FOR GRANTING A SPECIAL USE PERMIT FOR ANY PROPOSED\nALTERATION, EXPANSION, CHANGE, REBUILDING OR RESUMPTION OF A NON-CONFORMITY.\nProcedures for the granting of a special use permit for the alteration, expansion, change, rebuilding or\nresumption of a non-conformity are the same as for other special use permits above.\n(A) Decision authority. The Board of Adjustment shall be the decision authority for all such petitions\nregarding property in Surry County with the exception that the Planning Board shall hear and decide such\npetitions for property located within the VR District.\n(B) Evidence and testimony.\n(1) After taking evidence and testimony, the Planning Board or Board of Adjustment shall find whether\nthe proposed alteration, expansion, change, rebuilding or resumption of the non-conformity will have a\nsubstantial adverse impact upon adjacent properties, the neighborhood, or the public. The Planning Board\nor Board of Adjustment may consider any relevant factor, but no petition shall be granted unless it complies\nwith the criteria of divisions (B)(2)(a) through (B)(2)(g) below.

If the Planning Board or Board of Adjustment finds that a petition will\nhave a substantial adverse impact, it shall consider:\n(1) The possible detriment or benefit to the owner of the non-conformity from refusing to issue the\npermit; from issuing it but requiring, either wholly or partially, that the non-conformity be brought into\ncompliance; or from issuing it as requested.\n(2) The possible detriment or benefit to the owners of adjacent or neighboring properties from refusing\nto issue the permit; from issuing it, but requiring, either wholly or partially, that the non-conformity be\nbrought into compliance; or from issuing it as requested; and\n(3) The possible detriment or benefit to the public:\n(a) From refusing to issue the permit; from issuing it but requiring; either wholly or partially, that the\nnon-conformity be brought into compliance; or from issuing it as requested; and\n(b) From allowing and/or refusing to allow other non-conformities of the same type or within the\nsame neighborhood to continue as is, to be altered, expanded, changed, rebuilt, or resumed, or to be\nbrought into compliance.\n(D) Standard of reasonableness. The Planning Board or Board of Adjustment shall not approve a\npetition which fails to comply with the criteria in divisions (B)(2)(a) through (B)(2)(g) above or any other\nrelevant factor unless it finds that the detriment to the owner from denying the permit will be so great as to\nprohibit any reasonable opportunity to recoup his or her investment in the non-conformity while the benefit\nto adjacent and neighboring owners and the public from denying the permit will be minimal. The Planning\nBoard or Board of Adjustment may deny the petition or approve it in whole or in part. If the Planning Board\nor Board of Adjustment grants a special use permit, it may impose reasonable conditions and safeguards\nto\nmitigate any potential hazards or problems or to bring the non-conformity into compliance to the extent\nnecessary to protect the rights and interests of adjacent and neighboring owners and the public.\n(Ord. passed 4-17-2023)\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download\n161/236\n"}, {"page": "162", "text": "6/17/24, 7:57 PM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download/\n\u00a7 154.010-03 ZONING VARIANCES.\n(A) The Board of Adjustment may authorize a variance from the zoning regulations of this chapter, such\nas setbacks and lot dimensions, when, in its opinion, undue hardship may result upon a showing of all of\nthe following:\n(1) Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the regulation. It is not necessary\nto demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property;\n(2) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or\ntopography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from\nconditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a\nvariance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate to make a reasonable\naccommodation under the federal Fair Housing Act for a person with a disability;\n(3) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of\npurchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance is\nnot a self-created hardship; and\n(4) The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the regulation, such that\npublic safety is secured and substantial justice is achieved.\n(5) No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance. Appropriate conditions may be\nimposed on any variance, provided that the conditions are reasonably related to the variance. Any other\ndevelopment regulation that regulates land use or development may provide for variances from the\nprovisions of those ordinances consistent with the provisions of this division.\n(B) In considering and granting any request for a variance, the Board of Adjustment shall make findings\n(A)(1) through (4) stated above as required by G.S. \u00a7 160D-705(d), and shall likewise follow all quasi-\njudicial procedures required in G.S. \u00a7 160D-406 concerning notice, materials, presentation of evidence, the\nconduct of hearings, and voting.\n(C) Additional variance requirements. Additional requirements and stipulations for variances may be\nfound in other subchapters of this chapter. It will be the responsibility of the Zoning Administrator to ensure\nthat all variance requirements found in this chapter are strictly followed. Examples include:\n(1) Variances to subdivision standards, \u00a7\u00a7 154.013;\n(2) Variances to floodplain regulations and watershed protection regulations, \u00a7\u00a7 154.017; and\n(3) Variances for property located within the VR District.\n(Ord. passed 4-17-2023)\n\u00a7 154.010-04 APPEALS.\nAll appeals shall be filed with the county by notice specifying the grounds for appeal. Appeals shall be\neffective upon receipt.\n(A) Schedule. Appeals shall be filed within 30 days from the date of the action being appealed.\n(B) Process of appeal.\n(1) An administrative appeal is taken by filing a written notice of appeal with the Development Services\nDirector or the Board of Adjustment which specifies the grounds for the appeal. A notice of appeal shall be\nconsidered filed when delivered to the Zoning Administrator or Development Services Director. The Zoning\nAdministrator or Development Services Director shall transmit to the Board of Adjustment all applications,\nreports, and written materials relevant to the matter being considered. The administrative materials may be\ndistributed to the members of the Board prior to the hearing, if at the same time they are distributed to the\nBoard, a copy is also provided to the applicant and to the landowner if that person is not the applicant. The\nadministrative materials shall become a part of the hearing record. The administrative materials may be\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/download\n162/236\n"}, {"page": "163", "text": "6/17/24, 7:57 PM\nexport.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/cc9192d5-6b32-4361-9dad-9e873deaae99/downl\nprovided in written or electronic form. Objections to inclusion or exclusion of administrative materials may\nbe made before or during the hearing. Rulings on unresolved objections shall be made by the Board at the\nhearing. The Board shall follow quasi-judicial procedures pursuant to G.S. \u00a7 160D-406 in determining\nappeals of administrative decisions. The Board of Adjustment may, after a public hearing, so long as such\naction is in conformity with the terms of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify any\norder, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made and, to that end, shall have the powers\nof the administrative official from whom the appeal is taken.\n(2) The official who made the decision or the person currently occupying that position, if the decision\nmaker is no longer employed by the local government, shall be present at the evidentiary hearing as a\nwitness.\n(3) An appeal stays all actions by the Zoning Administrator or Development Services Director\nenforcing the requirements of this chapter unless the Zoning Administrator or Development Services\nDirector certifies to the Board reason of facts that a stay would in their opinion cause imminent peril to life\nor property, or because the violation charged is transitory in nature and a stay would interfere with\nenforcement of the chapter. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order\nwhich may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Zoning\nAdministrator or Development Services Director and on due cause shown.\n(C) Further appeals from the Board of Adjustment, quasi-judicial decisions of the Planning Board, or\nfrom any action of the Board of County Commissioners shall be taken directly to the courts as provided by\nlaw.\n(D) Fees. Each applicant for an appeal shall pay a fee, according to the fee schedule available in the\nDevelopment Services Department, to Surry County to cover the costs of advertising and administration. A\nreceipt for this fee shall be issued by the county. However, this fee shall not apply to requests originating\nwith any Surry County department, board or agency.\n(E) County appeals. In all cases, the Board of County Commissioners reserves the right to appeal any\ndecision of the Zoning Administrator to the Board of Adjustment and any decision of the Board of\nAdjustment to the courts.\n(Ord. passed 4-17-2023)\n\u00a7 154.011 DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS.\n\u00a7 154.011-01 DEVELOPMENT REVIEW RESPONSIBILITIES.\nThis chart identifies the advisory or decision-making responsibilities of the various bodies that have\nspecific review and approval roles under this chapter.
