The requirements of this subsection shall not apply to uses in\nbuildings undergoing reconstruction in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 2.7.4.\nFor purposes of determining whether a right to continue a non-conforming situation is lots\npursuant to this subsection, all of the buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are\ngenerally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a non-\nconforming apartment building or one space in a non-conforming mobile home park for 365 days\nshall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the\napartment building or mobile home park as a whole is continuously maintained.

Purpose\nTown of Goldston Unified Development Ordinance\n48\n"}, {"page": "58", "text": "The purpose of the Mixed Use Conditional District is to permit flexibility in the Ordinance by\nproviding for a mix of residential, commercial, and light industrial uses to be developed on\nlarge tracts in accordance with a unified development plan. These developments should be\nunified by distinguishable design features and provide pedestrian connections between all\nuses. Mixed use developments should provide a more efficient use of land while providing\nmore on-site amenities and preserving open space. The mix of uses shall be designed to be\nmutually supporting so that traffic congestion is minimized and pedestrian circulation is\nenhanced.\nB. Minimum Size\nIn order to qualify for a Mixed Use District the gross acreage for the development shall be a\nminimum of 50 acres.\nC. Maximum Net Density and Built Upon Area Allowed\nWithin a Mixed Use District, the net density and built upon area for any portion of the\ndevelopment shall not exceed the requirements of the underlying watershed district as\nidentified in Chapter 8 of this Ordinance.\n(1) For areas within the Local Watershed Area, which do not have density and built-upon\narea requirements defined in Chapter 8, the maximum allowable density shall be based\non the most restrictive requirement of the zoning districts listed in 2.8.9 (E) (1) below\nthat will be used to select permitted uses for the development. If a proposed use is\npermitted in more than one of the listed districts, then the district with more restrictive\ndensity standards shall apply.\nD. Net Land Area Computation\nNet land area is obtained by taking the gross land area of the development and subtracting\nthe following areas:\n(1) Land to be dedicated or set aside for public or private street right-of-way. As an option\nto measuring projected street right-of-way, the developer may subtract 20% gross area\nas a street right-of-way allowance regardless of the amount of land actually required for\nstreets.\n(2) Any area classified as wetlands or woody swamp by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n(3) Other areas determined by the Planning Department, Planning Board or Town Board to\nbe unbuildable due to either physical features or regulatory authority. However, typical\nzoning setback areas and riparian buffer areas shall be considered to be buildable areas\nfor purposes of this net land area determination.\nE. Permitted Uses\n(1) The uses allowed within the Mixed Use District may be selected from the permitted uses\nor Special Uses from the following districts:\nR-15 Residential District\nR-MF Residential District\nO&I Office and Institutional District\nC-1 General Commercial District\nIL Light Industrial District\nTown of Goldston Unified Development Ordinance\n49\n"}, {"page": "59", "text": "(2) The site plan must show, and the final development must include, uses from at least two\n(2) of the zoning districts listed above. Uses may be mixed within a building or within\nthe development and the site plan must identify the location of the proposed uses.\n(3) At a minimum, twenty percent (20%) of the total land area of the development must be\noccupied by or used for non-residential uses, provided that at no time shall the\ncumulative amount of land developed for non-residential purposes exceed the\ncumulative amount of land developed for residential purposes.\nF. Dimensional and Off-street Parking Requirements\n(1) Standard dimensional and off-street parking requirements shall not apply. Proposed lot\nsizes, setbacks, building heights, and off-street parking must be specified on the site\nplan or accompanying text for a conditional rezoning application and must be approved\nby the Town Board. In no circumstances shall a building have a height greater than 60\nfeet.\n(2) A setback of 100 feet shall apply to all residential and non-residential buildings and\nstructures along the exterior boundary of the mixed use development, including any\nexisting street right-of-way.\nG. Signage\nAny proposed signage shall not exceed the standards set forth in this Ordinance for the\nrespective zoning district from which a use is taken. All signs shall use a coordinated color,\nstyle, and lettering scheme.\n2.8.10 - Table 1: Zoning Table of Permitted Uses\nNote: Many commercial activities that are otherwise prohibited in this table

There are many possible approaches to achieving the\ndegree of screening necessary for the various conditional districts. A clearly stated rationale should\naccompany the landscaping plan that explains how the plan both serves the needs of the project\nand fits in with the community setting. For example, some factors that may be addressed are as\nfollows:\nSite conditions, such as the amount of sun or shade, slope, and wet or dry areas\nRepresentative native species of both canopy and understory trees to provide continuity\nwith wooded areas nearby\nPlants that provide screening in cold seasons\nCost and maintenance considerations\nGrowth rates\nFlowering species that can benefit both passers-by and beneficial insects\nLandscaping plants shall be selected that are, for the most part, a naturally occurring species and\narrangement for the area. The use of non-naturally occurring and rare plantings is not discouraged\nfor \"specimen\" or \"contrast\" plantings.\nA. A landscaping plan must be submitted to the Town with every non-residential application.\nLandscaping refers to topography, trees, shrubs, grass, and vegetation. The landscaping\nplan shall indicate where existing trees and vegetation are preserved.\nB.\nA buffer is a strip of land with the screening required thereon. Screening may include\nlandscaping, walls, fences, hedges, berms, and existing vegetation.\nC.\nStreet trees shall be required along streets at intervals of 40 feet. Each tree shall be of at\nleast 2.5-inch caliper when installed and be a height of 30 feet at maturity.\nD.\nChain link fences are to be discouraged unless screened by vegetation.\nE.\nPlantings adjacent to building walls should be included along sides of buildings where\ndevoid of architectural interest.\nF.

Xeriscaping is recommended where possible to conserve water.\n2.10.3 - Landscape Buffering Requirements and Screen Types\nThere are three general types of landscaped buffer screens:\nScreen A: This screen creates a year-round visual barrier such that there are no direct views from\nthe street or from adjacent properties to the development at any time of year. Plants are typically\nevergreen and can be used in combination with walls and berms. Minimum spacing shall generally\nbe no wider than 20 feet between tree trunks (but may be wider depending on tree type), with\nevergreen shrubs spaced five feet on center.\nScreen B: This screen breaks up the view such that some elements of the property can be seen from\nsome views and/or during some seasons. 25-35% deciduous plants may be allowed. Minimum\nspacing shall generally be no wider than 30 feet between tree trunks (but may be wider depending\non tree type), with evergreen shrubs spacing ranging from five to eight feet on center.\nScreen C: This buffer area simply preserves existing vegetation. It is intended less as a visual\nbarrier and more for a specific purpose. Examples could include, but are not limited to, erosion\ncontrol, providing continuity with nearby wooded areas, providing wildlife habitat, protecting\nexisting vegetation, providing shade, and/or for aesthetic purposes. Minimum spacing shall\ngenerally be no wider than 40 feet between canopy tree trunks and no wider than 20 feet between\nornamental tree trunks.\nHeight and width of all screen types to be determined case-by-case depending on height of\nstructure to be screened, in combination with topography of site and of adjacent sites.

Vested Rights\nAmendments in land development regulations are not applicable or enforceable without the\nwritten consent of the owner with regard to any of the following:\n(1) Buildings or uses of buildings or land for which a development permit application has\nbeen submitted and subsequently issued in accordance with G.S. 143-755.\n(2) Subdivisions of land for which a development permit application authorizing the\nsubdivision has been submitted and subsequently issued in accordance with G.S. 143-755.\n(3) A site-specific vesting plan pursuant to G.S. 160D-108.1.\n(4) A multi-phased development pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.\n(5) A vested right established by the terms of a development agreement pursuant to 160D-\n403.\nThe establishment of a vested right under any subdivision of this subsection does not preclude\nvesting under one or more other subdivisions of this subsection or vesting by application of\ncommon law principles. A vested right, once established as provided for in this section or by\ncommon law, precludes any action by the town that would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish,\nor otherwise delay the development or use of the property allowed by the applicable land\ndevelopment regulation or regulations, except where a change in State or federal law mandating\nlocal government enforcement occurs after the development application is submitted that has a\nfundamental and retroactive effect on the development or use.\nC. Duration of Vesting.\nUpon issuance of a development permit, the statutory vesting granted by subsection (B) of this\nsection for a development project is effective upon filing of the application in accordance with G.S.\n143-755, for so long as the permit remains valid pursuant to law. Unless otherwise specified by this\nsection or other statute, local development permits expire one year after issuance unless work\nauthorized by the permit has substantially commenced. A local land development regulation may\nprovide for a longer permit expiration period. For the purposes of this section, a permit is issued\neither in the ordinary course of business of the applicable governmental agency or by the applicable\ngovernmental agency as a court directive. Except where a longer vesting period is provided by\nstatute or land development regulation, the statutory vesting granted by this section, once\nestablished, expires for an uncompleted development project if development work is intentionally\nand voluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than 24 consecutive months, and the statutory\nvesting period granted by this section for a nonconforming use of property expires if the use is\nintentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than 24 consecutive months.

The 24-month discontinuance period is also tolled during the\npendency of any litigation involving the development project or property that is the subject of the\nvesting.\nD. Multiple Permits for Development Project\nSubject to subsection (C) of this section, where multiple local development permits are required to\ncomplete a development project, the development permit applicant may choose the version of each\nof the local land development regulations applicable to the project upon submittal of the\napplication for the initial development permit.

A right which has been vested as provided for in this subsection remains\nvested for a period of seven years from the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase\nof the multi-phased development.\nF. Continuing Review\nFollowing issuance of a development permit, the town may make subsequent inspections and\nreviews to ensure compliance with applicable land development regulations in effect at the time of\nthe original application.\nG. Process to Claim Vested Right\nA person claiming a statutory or common law vested right may submit information to substantiate\nthat claim to the zoning administrator or other officer designated by a land development regulation,\nwho shall make an initial determination as to the existence of the vested right. The decision of the\nzoning administrator or officer may be appealed under G.S. 160D-405. On appeal, the existence of a\nvested right shall be reviewed de novo. In lieu of seeking such a determination or pursuing an\nappeal under G.S. 160D-405, a person claiming a vested right may bring an original civil action as\nprovided by G.S. 160D-1403.1.\nH. Miscellaneous Provisions\nThe vested rights granted by this section run with the land except for the use of land for outdoor\nadvertising governed by G.S. 136-131.1 and G.S. 136-131.2 in which case the rights granted by this\nsection run with the owner of a permit issued by the North Carolina Department of Transportation.\nNothing in this section precludes judicial determination, based on common law principles or other\nstatutory provisions, that a vested right exists in a particular case or that a compensable taking has\noccurred. Except as expressly provided in 160D-108, nothing in this section shall be construed to\nalter the existing common law.\n2.17.13 Vested Rights and Site Specific Vesting Plans\nA. Site-Specific Vesting Plan\nConsists of a plan submitted to the town in which the applicant requests vesting pursuant to this\nsection, describing with reasonable certainty on the plan the type and intensity of use for a specific\nparcel or parcels of property. The plan may be in the form of, but not be limited to, any of the\nfollowing plans or approvals: a planned unit development plan, a subdivision plat, a preliminary or\ngeneral development plan, a special use permit, a conditional district zoning plan, or any other\nland-use approval designation as may be utilized by the town. Unless otherwise expressly provided\nby the town, the plan shall include the approximate boundaries of the site; significant topographical\nand other natural features affecting development of the site; the approximate location on the site of\nthe proposed buildings, structures, and other improvements; the approximate dimensions,\nincluding height, of the proposed buildings and other structures; and the approximate location of all\nexisting and proposed infrastructure on the site, including water, sewer, roads, and pedestrian\nwalkways. What constitutes a site-specific vesting plan under this section that would trigger a\nvested right shall be finally determined by the town pursuant to a development regulation, and the\ndocument that triggers the vesting shall be so identified at the time of its approval. A variance does\nnot constitute a site-specific vesting plan, and approval of a site-specific vesting plan with the\ncondition that a variance be obtained does not confer a vested right unless and until the necessary\nvariance is obtained. If a sketch plan or other document fails to describe with reasonable certainty\nTown of Goldston Unified Development Ordinance\n112\n"}, {"page": "122", "text": "the type and intensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property, it may not constitute a\nsite-specific vesting plan.\nB. Establishment of Vested Right\nA vested right is established with respect to any property upon the valid approval, or conditional\napproval, of a site-specific vesting plan as provided in this section. Such a vested right confers upon\nthe landowner the right to undertake and complete the development and use of the property under\nthe terms and conditions of the site-specific vesting plan, including any amendments thereto.\nC. Approval and Amendment of Plans\nIf a site-specific vesting plan is based on an approval required by a local development regulation,\nthe town shall provide whatever notice and hearing is required for that underlying approval. A\nduration of the underlying approval that is less than two years does not affect the duration of the\nsite-specific vesting plan established under this section. If the site-specific vesting plan is not based\non such an approval, a legislative hearing with notice as required by G.S. 160D-602 shall be held. A\nlocal government may approve a site-specific vesting plan upon any terms and conditions that may\nreasonably be necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Conditional approval\nresults in a vested right, although failure to abide by the terms and conditions of the approval will\nresult in a forfeiture of vested rights. The Town shall not require a landowner to waive the\nlandowner's vested rights as a condition of developmental approval. A site-specific vesting plan is\ndeemed approved upon the effective date of the town's decision approving the plan or another date\ndetermined by the governing board upon approval. An approved site-specific vesting plan and its\nconditions may be amended with the approval of the owner and the town as follows: any\nsubstantial modification must be reviewed and approved in the same manner as the original\napproval; minor modifications may be approved by staff, if such are defined and authorized by local\nregulation.\nD. Continuing Review\nFollowing approval or conditional approval of a site-specific vesting plan, the town may make\nsubsequent reviews and require subsequent approvals by the town to ensure compliance with the\nterms and conditions of the original approval, provided that these reviews and approvals are not\ninconsistent with the original approval. The town may, pursuant to G.S. 160D-403(f), revoke the\noriginal approval for failure to comply with applicable terms and conditions of the original approval\nor the applicable local development regulations.\nE. Duration and Termination of Vested Right\n(1) A vested right for a site-specific vesting plan remains vested for a period of two years. This\nvesting shall not be extended by any amendments or modifications to a site-specific vesting plan\nunless expressly provided by the town.\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection, a local government may\nprovide for rights to be vested for a period exceeding two years but not exceeding five years where\nwarranted in light of all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the size and phasing\nof development, the level of investment, the need for the development, economic cycles, and market\nconditions or other considerations. These determinations are in the sound discretion of the town\nand shall be made following the process specified for the particular form of a site-specific vesting\nplan involved in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.\n(3) Upon issuance of a building permit, the provisions of G.S. 160D-1111 and G.S. 160D-1115 apply,\nexcept that a permit does not expire and shall not be revoked because of the running of time while a\nvested right under this section is outstanding.\n(4) A right vested as provided in this section terminates at the end of the applicable vesting period\nwith respect to buildings and uses for which no valid building permit applications have been filed.\nF. Subsequent Changes Prohibited; Exceptions\n(1) A vested right, once established as provided for in this section, precludes any zoning action by a\nlocal government which would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the\nTown of Goldston Unified Development Ordinance\n113\n"}, {"page": "123", "text": "development or use of the property as set forth in an approved site-specific vesting plan, except\nunder one or more of the following conditions:\na.

Miscellaneous Provisions\n(1) A vested right obtained under this section is not a personal right, but attaches to and runs with\nthe applicable property. After approval of a site-specific vesting plan, all successors to the original\nlandowner are entitled to exercise these rights.\n(2) Nothing in this section precludes judicial determination, based on common law principles or\nother statutory provisions, that a vested right exists in a particular case or that a compensable\ntaking has occurred. Except as expressly provided in this section, nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued to alter the existing common law.\n(3) In the event a local government fails to adopt a development regulation setting forth what\nconstitutes a sitespecific vesting plan triggering a vested right, a landowner may establish a vested\nright with respect to property upon the approval of a zoning permit, or otherwise may seek\nappropriate relief from the Superior Court Division of the General Court of Justice.\n2.18 - Enforcement\n2.18.1 - Planning Director\nTown of Goldston Unified Development Ordinance\n114\n"}, {"page": "124", "text": "This Ordinance shall be administered and enforced by the Planning Director or designee.

Classification\nStreets and roads are hereby classified according to the function which they are to serve,\nthe type, speed, and volume they will carry. The broad categories shall be (a) arterials\n(including principal arterials and minor arterials), (b) collectors (including major collectors\nand minor collectors), and (c) local roads. The designation in a transportation plan of\narterials and collectors does not prevent other streets proposed in or adjoining subdivisions\nfrom being similarly classified. Classifications of roads are defined Section 1.2.\nB. Relation to Present, Proposed and Future Road System\n(1) The location and width of all streets and roads shall not be in conflict with any adopted\ntransportation plan. When a subdivision is proposed in an area designated for a future\nright-of-way on any adopted transportation plan and the construction of a road along\nthis right-of-way is not necessary for the purpose of providing access to platted lots, or\ncarrying the traffic that will be generated by the subdivision development, the\nconstruction of this road by the subdivider shall not be required. Such right-of-way\nshall, however, be reserved for dedication to the N.C. Department of Transportation for\nthe purpose of implementing any transportation plan.\n(2) For the purpose of these design standards, existing streets which terminate at or adjoin\na subdivision boundary shall be deemed a part of the subdivision. The proposed street\nsystem shall extend the right-of-way of existing streets at no less width than the\nrequired minimum width. Subdivisions that adjoin only one side of existing streets shall\ndedicate one-half of the additional right-of-way needed to meet minimum width\nrequirements. If any part of the subdivision includes both sides of an existing street all\nthe required additional right-of-way shall be dedicated.\n(3) Where necessary to provide public street access to adjoining landlocked property or\nconnectivity to large tracts with future development potential, proposed public streets\nshall be extended by dedication of right-of-way to the boundary of such property. Legal\ndocuments shall be recorded assuring future public accessibility. Two of the issues to be\nreviewed when considering the extension of public roads are the improvement of traffic\ndistribution to prevent unnecessary congestion and the improvement of public safety by\nproviding increased access for law enforcement and emergency vehicles.\na. If the proposed public street to be extended is to be used as access for any lots, such\nstub street will be required to provide a temporary turn around, located within the\npublic right-of-way and/or a dedicated easement, and in accordance with the\nTown of Goldston Unified Development Ordinance\n149\n"}, {"page": "159", "text": "standards shown for cul-de-sacs in Section 3.6.2C.

The minimum cul-de-sac\npavement radius for curb and gutter section and shoulder section is 40 feet. The\nminimum right-of-way radius for curb and gutter section and shoulder section is 55\nfeet. The roadway into the cul-de-sac shall remain unobstructed.\n(2) Reserve Strips\nThere shall be no reserve strips controlling access to public streets except where the\ncontrol of such strips is placed with the community under conditions approved by the\nTown Board.\n(3) Street Names\nProposed streets which are obviously in alignment with others already existing and\nnamed shall bear the names of existing streets. In no case shall the name for a proposed\nstreet duplicate any existing street names in Chatham County or the towns therein,\nirrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, road, pike, drive, way,\nplace, court, or other derivatives.\n(4) Offer of Dedication\nA developer of roads in subdivisions that are to be public roads shall provide an\nirrevocable offer of dedication prior to Final Plat approval.\nD. Private Roads\n(1) Private roads may be allowed in the following types of developments:\na.\nDevelopments which due to the very nature of their design could not occur if\nrequired to meet the requirements for subdivision roads by the Division of\nHighways.

There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out\nthe strict letter of the Ordinance. In order to determine that there are practical\ndifficulties or unnecessary hardships, the Board must find that the five following\nconditions exist:\ni.\nIf the applicant complies with the provisions of the Ordinance, the applicant can\nsecure no reasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of, the property.\nMerely providing that the variance would permit a greater profit to be made\nfrom the property will not be considered adequate to justify the Board in\ngranting a variance. Moreover, the Board shall consider whether the variance is\nthe minimum possible deviation from the terms of the Ordinance that will make\npossible the reasonable use of the property.\nii.\nThe hardship results from the application of the Ordinance to the property\nrather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship.\niii.\nThe hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such as its\nsize, shape, or topography, which is different from that of neighboring property.\niv. The hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or\nunknowingly violates the ordinance, or who purchases the property after the\neffective date of the ordinance, and then comes to the Board for relief.\nV. The hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property, rather than the result of\nconditions that are widespread. If other properties are equally subject to the\nhardship created in the restriction, then granting a variance would be a special\nprivilege denied to others, and would not promote equal justice.\nb.\nThe variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the Ordinance\nand preserves its spirit.\nC.\nIn the granting of the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured and\nsubstantial justice has been done. The Board shall not grant a variance if it finds\nthat doing so would in any respect impair the public health, safety, or general\nwelfare.\n(3) In granting the variance, the Board may attach therero such conditions regarding the\nlocation, character, and other features of the proposed building, structure, or use as it\nmay deem advisable in furtherance of the purpose of this chapter's regulations. If a\nvariance for the construction, alteration or use of property is granted, such construction,\nalteration or use shall be in accordance with the approved site plan.\n(4)\nThe Watershed Review Board shall refuse to hear an appeal or an application for a\nvariance previously denied if it finds that there have been no substantial changes in\nconditions or circumstances bearing on the appeal or application.\n(5) A variance issued in accordance with this Section shall be considered a Watershed\nProtection Permit and shall expire if a Building Permit or Watershed Protection\nOccupancy Permit for such use is not obtained by the applicant within six (6) months\nfrom the date of the decision.\n(6) If the application calls for the granting of a major variance, and if the Watershed Review\nBoard decides in favor of granting the variance, the Board shall prepare a preliminary\nTown of Goldston Unified Development Ordinance\n213\n"}, {"page": "223", "text": "record of the hearing with all deliberate speed.
