Any\nsuch off-premise sign shall comply with the design standards set forth under division (D)(1)(b).\n(b) Freestanding signs.\n1. Number. One freestanding sign shall be permitted per each 200 linear feet of street frontage of the lot. Lots\ncontaining less than 200 linear feet of street frontage shall be permitted one such freestanding sign.\n2. Area.\na. The area encompassed by freestanding signs shall not exceed .2 square foot per each linear foot of street\nfrontage of the lot.\nb. The maximum total area of all allowable freestanding signs shall be equal to no more than 40 square feet. This\nfigure is also subject to the overall limitation of \u00a7 155.148(D)(1)(d) and may therefore be less than 40 feet in some cases.\n3. Height. No freestanding sign shall exceed six feet in height.\n"}, {"page": "59", "text": "(c) Building signs.\n1. The maximum total area of all allowable building signs shall be equal to no more than 10% of the area of the wall\nof which such sign is a part or to which each sign is attached.\n2. Each separate business establishment within a mall or shopping center may have one building sign not to\nexceed 100 square feet and subject to limitations of division (D)(1)(c)1. above.\n(d) Total sign area and number of signs. The maximum aggregate area of all allowable signs on each lot, not in a mall\nor shopping center, including freestanding, building, or any other signs shall be equal to the lesser of either:\n1. One hundred square feet.\n2. Four percent of the ground floor area of the principal building; or\n3. Two square feet per linear foot of street frontage.\n(e) Signs shall be located such that there is at every street intersection a clear view between the heights of three feet\nand ten feet within the sight triangle described in \u00a7 155.172(H), and shall be located outside of the right-of-way of any public\nstreet.\n(f) No animated sign, nor moving or flashing signs shall be permitted.\n(g) No portable signs shall be permitted.\n(h) No projecting or suspended signs shall be permitted.\n(i) No inflatable signs or tethered balloons shall be permitted.\n(j) No beacons shall be permitted.\n(k) No roof signs other than integral roof signs shall be permitted.

Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or\nother sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, or combination thereof\nthat will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or\ncolor forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure\nagainst which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence\nor wall otherwise meets zoning chapter regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself.\n2. Computation of area of multi-faced signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by\nadding together the area of all sign faces visible form any one point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of\nthe same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one\nof the faces.\n3. Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at\nnormal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of\n(i) existing grade prior to construction, or (ii) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming,\nmounding, or excavating. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be\ncomputed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the\nnearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the\nlot, whichever is lower.\n4. Computation of maximum total permitted sign area for a lot. The permitted sum of the area of all individual signs\non a lot shall be computed by applying the formula contained in division (D)(1)(d) to the lot frontage, building frontage, or\nwall area, as appropriate. Lots fronting on two or more streets area allowed the permitted sign area for each street frontage.\nHowever, the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lot's total sign area\nallocation that is derived from the lot, building, or wall area frontage on that street.\n(2) Landscaping. The landscaping and buffering requirements of $155.172 shall apply to the Quality Design Overlay\nDistrict except where the provisions of this section are more restrictive.\n(3) Access.\n(a) Access points to the development (such as curb cuts or driveways) shall be minimized. There shall be no more\nthan one point of entrance and one point of exit for each road or street frontage on each lot, except that, where a road or\nstreet frontage exceeds 500 feet, there may be two points of entrance and two points of exit. If the frontage exceeds 1,000\nfeet, three such points may be allowed. Three points shall be the maximum allowable. A single access point which serves as\nboth a point of entrance and a point of exit (two-way traffic) shall be considered as both a point of entrance and a point of\n"}, {"page": "60", "text": "exit.\n(b) If a subdivision of land within the Quality Design District occurs subsequent to the effective date of these\nregulations which results in the creation of lots which possess less than 150 feet of street frontage, the preliminary and final\nsubdivision plats for such subdivision shall be approved only if access points for each lot are clearly designated on the plat,\nand the total number of access points designated on the plat for the entire subdivision does not exceed one point of\nentrance and one point of exit per each 150 feet of street frontage.\n1. Joint driveways and interior access roads shall be permitted.\n2. It is the intent of these regulations to exempt from this requirement any subdivision lots clearly intended for\nsingle-family residential development.\n(c) No driveway except residential access shall be allowed within 300 feet of the centerline of an intersecting\nthoroughfare or collector street. No driveway except residential access shall be allowed within 200 feet of the centerline of\nany other intersecting street.\n(d) No driveway except residential access shall be allowed within 30 feet of the side property line of any property or\ndevelopment except where a mutual joint access agreement exists between adjoining owners.\n(e) Any parcel of record on the effective date of this section which has prohibited all vehicular access based on the\nprovisions herein shall be allowed one access point to its street frontage.\n(4) Parking areas.\n(a) Parking areas shall, where possible, be located at either the rear or sides of the principal building(s).\n(b) Parking areas shall be set back a minimum of 20 feet from the front property line or edge of right-of-way,\nwhichever is greater.

Specific conditions applicable to the districts may be proposed by the petitioner or the county or its agencies, but only\nthose conditions mutually approved by the county and the petitioner may be incorporated into the zoning regulations or\npermit requirements. Conditions and site-specific standards imposed on a special use district shall be limited to those that\naddress the conformance of the development and use of the site to county ordinances and an officially adopted land\ndevelopment plan or other plans, and those that address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the\ndevelopment or use of the site. The intent of this process is to ensure compatibility between uses. These conditions may\ninclude but are not limited to the following:\n(1) Location of the use on the property;\n(2) The location and extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways, and access streets;\n(3) The timing of development;\n(4) Location and extent of buffer areas;\n(5) Positioning other special purpose areas on the tract;\n(6) That petitioners shall incorporate in any future conveyance of this property a detailed description of this special use\nand all the conditions imposed; and\n(7) Such other matters as may be imposed by the Board of Commissioners.\n(1996 Code, \u00a7 155.161) (Ord. passed 1-18-1994; Ord. passed 3-20-2006)\n\u00a7 155.162 PROCEDURES FOR WATERSHED OVERLAY DISTRICTS.\n(A) Within the WS-III-BW or WS-IV-PA overlay districts the intent of special use district zoning is not to specify a single\nuse among those permitted uses but to permit an increase in the built- upon or impervious limits for nonresidential uses on a\ncase-by-case basis. Under current watershed requirements built-upon or impervious limits for nonresidential development\ncannot exceed 24% in the WS-III-BW or 36% in the WS-IV-PA, in order to promote economic development, while not\nundermining the intent of the watershed overlay district, the Board of Commissioners may permit new development and\nexpansions to existing development to increase built-upon or impervious limits to 70% on a case-by-case basis. However,\nthe Board cannot allow this increase on more than 10% of the total land area within the WS-III-BW or the WS-IV-PA\nwatershed.\n(B) If the Board of Commissioners intent is to control both the specific use and allow an increase in impervious limits,\nspecial use district zoning permits are needed for each. The Board can approve each permit during the same review\nprocess.\n(1996 Code, \u00a7 155.162) (Ord. passed 1-18-1994; Ord. passed 1-20-1998)\nGROUP DEVELOPMENTS\n\u00a7 155.170 TECHNICAL REVIEW COMMITTEE.\n(A) Purpose.
