These guidelines are a measure to limit the\ndissatisfaction with marketing strategies that dictate designs which are indifferent to local identity and community interests. The main goal is to encourage\ndevelopment that contributes to Lenoir as a unique place by reflecting its physical character and adding to it in appropriate ways.\nCommercial developments depend on high visibility from major public streets. In turn, their design determines much of the character and attractiveness of\nmajor streetscapes in the City. Marketing strategies that place corporate branding over local character can be detrimental to community aspirations and\nsense of place. These strategies often result in massive developments that have little sense of human scale and the proliferation of stock cookie-cutter\nplans that neither contribute to nor integrate with the City in a positive manner. Harsh, uninviting developments also act as a centrifuge by encouraging\nresidential growth to take place further away, thereby exacerbating traffic problems and adding to urban sprawl.\nThe purpose of these standards and guidelines is to codify specific criteria that will aid in the design of buildings and places and, ultimately, render\ndevelopments that enhance their surroundings. The following standards and guidelines are intended to be used by designers in the preparation of site and\nbuilding plans for non-residential developments. They should also be used as a tool by the City staff, Planning Board, and City Council in their review\nprocesses.\n714.2 Applicability\nThese standards and guidelines apply to the following types of development:\n(a) All new non-residential, attached single family, and multi-family structures and developments located in the R-R, R-20, R-15, R-12, R-9, R-6, O&I, B-1, B-2,\nand B-7 zoning districts.\n(b) Expansions of existing projects described in subsection (a) above.\n(c)\n21 of 88\n3/16/24, 14:35\n"}, {"page": "22", "text": "Lenoir, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nWhere such expansions meet the definitions of subsections (a) and (b) above, and such additions result in a 50% or greater increase in building size, the pre-existing\nportions of the same commercial, office, institutional, or government building and the development site must be brought into compliance with these design standards.\n(d) When a substantial improvement is made to any existing structure meeting the definition of subsection (a) above, the pre-existing portions of the\nbuilding and building site must be brought into compliance with these design standards.\n(e) When a structure meeting the definition of subsection (a) above sustains damage exceeding 50% of its tax value at the time of the damage, all repairs,\nalterations, or reconstruction must be in compliance with these design standards.\n(f) Modifications to designated historic structures are excluded from subsections (c) and (d), when the design standards would require modifications that\nwould compromise the historic character of the structure. Site improvements may still be required.\n714.3 Definitions:\nUnless otherwise specifically provided, or unless clearly required by the context, the words and phrases defined in this section shall have the meaning\nindicated when used in this article.\na)\nElement of a building an exterior wall, roof, or site wall which is manmade and constructed.\nb) Public visibility An element of a building shall be deemed publicly visible when any of the following conditions are met:\n1. At least 50 percent of the element occurs above adjacent grade and is visible from any street adjacent to the property; or\n2.\nAt least 50 percent of the element is, upon staff review, deemed visible from an adjacent residentially zoned property;\nor\n3. At least 50 percent of the element is taller than the vegetative buffer at the time of planting.\nc) Exterior walls the vertical or nearly-vertical planes which form the exterior envelope of a building.\nd) Site walls - retaining walls, screen walls or other vertical or nearly- vertical planes which occur on a property, but are not part of the exterior envelope of\na building.\ne) Roof area a single, unbroken, contiguous plane, measured perpendicular to slope.\nf) Flat Roof The external covering of a building having a vertical to horizontal slope of 2:12 slope or less.\ng) Pitched Roof The external covering of a building having a vertical to horizontal slope greater than 2:12.\nh) Facade color a single paint color which is used most extensively in a building's visible facade.\ni) Trim color a single paint color which is used on a building's trim, lesser in proportion to the Facade Color.\nj) Accent color paint colors which are used on a building, in the least proportion of all colors used, not to exceed 5% of the facade area.\nk) Full cutoff fixture a light fixture designed so that no light is projected at or above a 90-degree plane running through the lowest point on the fixture\nwhere the light is emitted, and less than ten percent (10%) of the rated lumens are projected between 90-degrees and 80-degrees.\nI) Facade the face of a building.\nm) Volume any portion of a building which is offset by a minimum of ten feet (10') in plan or in elevation.\nn) IESNA - The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America\no) Primary Public Street The street that adjoins the property that carries the highest volume of vehicular traffic.\n714.4 Development Standards and Guidelines:\nItems referred to in this Article as \"Standards\" are mandatory. \"Guidelines\" are not mandatory, but are provided in order to promote these design\nobjectives to planners, design consultants, developers, engineers and other professionals involved in the preparation of site plans and building plans. These\nstandards and guidelines are to be used in conjunction with all other applicable requirements of the Lenoir Zoning Ordinance.\n714.5 Building Design and Orientation\nGUIDELINE: The intent of this section is to encourage building design and placement that encourages and supports a safe and attractive pedestrian\nenvironment.\nSTANDARD: The primary facade and main building entry shall face the primary public street unless the majority of off-street parking is located to the sides\nor rear of the building.\nThe main building entrance, when not facing the primary public street, shall provide a safe and convenient access for pedestrians from the main building\nentrances to the primary public street. The pedestrian way must provide additional landscape amenities.\nEntrances which are oriented on a diagonal are permitted, provided that they are integrated with the overall architectural design, and not merely angled\nappendages or alcoves.\nGround floor windows or window display boxes shall be provided along at least 60% of the building's ground floor street-facing elevations. Windows and\nwindow display boxes shall be integral to the building design and have include visually prominent sills, shutters, or other such forms of framing. Windows\nmust have vertical dimensions which exceed their horizontal dimensions. Where the interior floor plan and use of the building makes windows technically\ninfeasible, the Planning Director may approve alternative treatments that support street-level pedestrian activity, such as front porches (on residential\nstructures), alcoves with benches or other human-scale features, spandrel glass, or faux window architectural treatments such that intent of this section is\nrealized.\n714.6 Smaller Buildings within a Larger Project:\n22 of 88\n3/16/24, 14:35\n"}, {"page": "23", "text": "Lenoir, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nGUIDELINE: The presence of smaller buildings gives a commercial area a friendlier appearance by creating variety, breaking up large expanses, and\nexpanding the range of the site's activities.

These\ndesign standards are intended to encourage development that contributes to Lenoir as a unique place by reflecting its physical character and adding to it in\nappropriate ways.\nDevelopments within Central Business Districts are dependent upon visibility from adjoining public streets and sidewalks, and this visibility often\nnecessitates diversity in facade design. In turn, these designs determine much of the character and attractiveness of the streetscape within the urban core\nof the City. These design standards are intended to encourage facade development that contributes to the uniqueness of Lenoir by promoting its unique\nsense of place and adding to it in appropriate ways.\nIn addition to all other design and improvement regulations within this Ordinance, sites and buildings within the Central Business District are regulated in\naccordance with specific standards as listed below.\n811.1 Design Criteria\na.\n33 of 88\n3/16/24, 14:35\nCELL (1, 1): \nMinimum Front Yard Setback (residential)\nCELL (1, 2): \n20 ft., or the average of structures on adjoining lots if less than 20 ft\nCELL (2, 1): \nMinimum Front Yard Setback (non-residential)\nCELL (2, 2): \n10 ft. from back-of-curb for the provision of sidewalk/streetscape\nimprovements.

The (FAR) determines the maximum\nresidential floor area, which is the sum of all the area used for residential use, or of all dwelling units measured from the outside faces of the exterior walls\nincluding halls, lobbies, stairways, elevator shafts, enclosed porches, balconies, and below grade floor areas used for habitation and residential access. The\nmaximum residential floor area shall not exceed the number of square feet derived by multiplying the gross residential land area by the floor area ratio\n(FAR). The following areas are not included when computing maximum allowable floor area:\nOpen terraces, patios, or balconies\nCarports and garages\nBasement space not used for living accommodations\nAny commercial or other non-residential space\nSpecial purpose areas such as recreation rooms and special halls\nStaff space for therapy and examination in group care housing\nOpen Space Ratio (OSR) The minimum square footage of open space required for each square foot of land area. Open space is the total gross residential\nland area not covered by buildings or open space closed to the sky, but having two clear unobstructed open or partially open sides. Partially open means\nopen fifty (50%) percent or more. The minimum open space required shall not be less than the number of square feet derived by multiplying the gross\nresidential land area by the open space ratio.\nLivability Space Ratio (LSR) - The part of the total open space appropriately improved and located as outdoor living space for residents and for aesthetic\nappeal. Such space includes lawns, landscaped areas, walkways, paved terraces, and sitting areas. Such space may include natural areas provided that\nundergrowth and noxious weeds are cleaned initially and the areas maintained regularly to minimize regrowth. The minimum livability space required shall\nnot be less than the number of square feet derived by multiplying the gross residential land area by the livability space ratio.\n73 of 88\n3/16/24, 14:35\nCELL (1, 1): \nLAND USE INTENSITY\nCONVERSION CHART\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (2, 1): \nZONE\nCELL (2, 2): \nFLOOR\nAREA\nRATIO\nCELL (2, 3): \n**OPEN\nSPACE\nRATIO\nCELL (2, 4): \nLIVABILITY\nSPACE\nRATIO\nCELL (2, 5): \nRECREATION\nSPACE\nRATIO\nCELL (3, 1): \nR-12\nCELL (3, 2): \n.200\nCELL (3, 3): \n.76\nCELL (3, 4): \n.52\nCELL (3, 5): \n.036\nCELL (4, 1): \nR-9\nCELL (4, 2): \n.283\nCELL (4, 3): \n.74\nCELL (4, 4): \n.48\nCELL (4, 5): \n.042\nCELL (5, 1): \nR-6\nCELL (5, 2): \n.400\nCELL (5, 3): \n.72\nCELL (5, 4): \n.44\nCELL (5, 5): \n.052\nCELL (6, 1): \nO&I\nCELL (6, 2): \n.400\nCELL (6, 3): \n.72\nCELL (6, 4): \n.44\nCELL (6, 5): \n.052\nCELL (7, 1): \nB-1\nCELL (7, 2): \n.400\nCELL (7, 3): \n.72\nCELL (7, 4): \n.44\nCELL (7, 5): \n.052\nCELL (8, 1): \nB-2\nCELL (8, 2): \n.400\nCELL (8, 3): \n.72\nCELL (8, 4): \n.44\nCELL (8, 5): \n.052\nCELL (9, 1): \nB-3\nCELL (9, 2): \n.566\nCELL (9, 3): \n.71\nCELL (9, 4): \n.40\nCELL (9, 5): \n.062\nCELL (10, 1): \nB-4\nCELL (10, 2): \n.400\nCELL (10, 3): \n.72\nCELL (10, 4): \n.44\nCELL (10, 5): \n.052\nCELL (11, 1): \nCELL (11, 2): \nCELL (11, 3): \nCELL (11, 4): \nCELL (11, 5): \n"}, {"page": "74", "text": "Lenoir, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nRecreation Space Ratio (RSR) The minimum square footage of recreation space required for each square foot of land area.
