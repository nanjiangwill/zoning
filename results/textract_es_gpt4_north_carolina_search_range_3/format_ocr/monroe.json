MIXED-USE ZONING DISTRICT PARKING STANDARDS\nA. Generally. Parking requirements for mixed-use districts shall refer to the parking\nrequirements defined in Section 8.4: Parking and Loading. In addition to the parking\nrequirements in Section 8.4 the following shall apply to mixed-use districts:\n1. Placement. Parking placement shall require parking be placed either in the front, rear,\nor side of a property within mixed-use zoning districts, or may allow any type of \"off-\nstreet\" parking placement.\n151\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nActive Use Areas\nCELL (1, 3): \nPermitted\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nEntrances\nCELL (2, 3): \nOriented to Street\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nPlacement\nCELL (3, 3): \nOff-street\nCELL (4, 1): \nParking\nCELL (4, 2): \nShared Parking\nCELL (4, 3): \nPermitted (See Section 5.9)\nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nAccessory Parking\nStructure\nCELL (5, 3): \nPermitted\nCELL (6, 1): \nIncentives Permitted\nCELL (6, 2): \nCELL (6, 3): \nYes (See Section 5.10)\nCELL (7, 1): \nOpen Space\nCELL (7, 2): \nCELL (7, 3): \nSee Section 8.8: Open Space\nCELL (8, 1): \nArchitectural Standards\nCELL (8, 2): \nArchitectural Standards\nCELL (8, 3): \nSee Section 8.7: Design Standards\n"}, {"page": "152", "text": "2. Shared Parking Ratio. The mixture of uses within a building and the provision of on-\nstreet parking, public parking lots, or similar parking facilities allows for an overall\ndecrease in parking demand. To support a decrease in the need for parking, the\nparking requirements contained in Section 8.4: Parking, may be reduced by fifteen\npercent (15%) within the mixed-use districts. Within the DC-MX and DG-MX districts,\nparking may be reduced by twenty percent (20%). This percentage may be modified\nthrough an Alternative Parking Plan (APP) as identified in Section 8.4: Parking and\nLoading.\n3.\nStructures. Accessory parking structures may be allowed as permitted in each district\nstandards development table.\n5.10. MIXED-USE ZONING DISTRICT INCENTIVES\nA. Generally. To promote development and redevelopment of mixed-use zoning districts,\nincentives may be applied to buildings and developments which qualify based upon the\ncriteria of this Section. To encourage certain public benefits and create a more dynamic\npublic realm, density bonuses may be permitted for the items defined below. Each mixed-use\nzoning district development standards table shall define the maximum permitted density\nwhich may be achieved through incentives. Providing 3 of 4 of the incentive categories listed\nin this Section shall permit development at fifty percent (50%) of the maximum density bonus\nthrough incentives. Providing 4 of 4 of the incentive categories listed in this Section shall\npermit development at one hundred percent (100%) of the maximum density bonus through\nincentives. For example, a mixed-use project in the DC-MX district that provides: 1.) Adaptive\nreuse of an existing building, 2.) Streetscape enhancements, and 3.) Additional greenspace in\nthe form of a public plaza, would be able to develop at 12.5 dwelling units/acre.\nB. Priority Land Use Incentives. Priority land uses are recognized from previously adopted City\nplans (i.e., Forward Monroe and the Downtown Master Plan) and represent a community\nvision for a desired land use within a mixed-use zoning district. A mixed-use zoning district\nmay recognize priority land uses and offer density incentives to implement priority land uses\nwithin a vertical or horizontal mixture of uses in a building or development. To qualify for this\nincentive, each building or development must include at least 2 priority land uses, each of\nwhich shall be at least 25 percent of the total.\n152\n"}, {"page": "153", "text": "Table 5.10 Priority Land Use Incentives\nC. Adaptive Reuse.\n1. Adaptive Reuse shall be defined as the process of reusing an existing building or\nstructure for a purpose other than which it was originally designed for.\n2. Any development request for adaptive reuse of a building must be stated on\napplicable City permits.\nD. Streetscape Enhancements.\n1. Incentives for streetscape enhancements shall be limited to the DC-MX and DG-MX\ndistricts. Streetscape enhancements shall be defined as items which increase the\ndesign quality of the street and its visual character by implementing the Downtown\nMaster Plan Section 5.4: Urban Design, including a continuation of sidewalks with\nlarge trees and landscaping, wider planting strip (8 feet to 10 feet), uniform lighting\nwith decorative lamps and other street furniture.\nE. Additional Greenspace.\n1. Additional Greenspace shall be defined as publicly accessible greenspace that exceeds\nthe required open space for the respective mixed-use zoning district development, as\ndefined in Section 8.8: Open Space. For example, a minimum of ten percent (10%) of\nopen space is required within the DG-MX district. To receive the bonus, the project\nwould need to include fifteen percent (15%) of open space.\na.

Uses have been grouped into residential, public, and institutional,\ncommercial, office/medical, industrial, and other. To regulate use, categories of uses\n(\"use categories\") have been established. Use categories provide a systematic basis for\nassigning land uses to appropriate categories or zoning districts with other similar or\ncompatible uses. Use categories classify land uses and activities based on common\nfunctional, product or physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and\namount of activity, the characteristics of customers or residents, how goods or services\nare sold or delivered, and certain site factors.\n7.2.2. USE DETERMINATION\nA. Definitions.\n1. For the purpose of this Section, certain terms or words used in this Section shall\nbe interpreted as follows:\na.

This Section intends to:\n1. Provide for adequate parking, loading and unloading, and safe movement of\nvehicles and pedestrians through off-street parking areas;\n2. Recognize parking and loading demands of permitted uses and provide a flexible\nrange of adequate parking and loading, receptive to market demand;\n3. Allow for alternative parking options in certain defined circumstances;\n4. Reduce the aesthetic impacts of parking areas;\n5. Avoid excessive areas of impervious surfaces dedicated to parking;\n6. Provide for compatibility between uses; and\n7. Provide for high quality, safe designs that will add to the aesthetic wellbeing of\nthe City.\nB. Applicability. Parking must be provided in accordance with this UDO. Off-street parking\nshall be maintained and continued. No permit for construction or addition may be\npermitted until the parking requirements of this UDO have been met. Off-street parking\nshall be located on the same plot or parcel of land it is intended to serve, unless\nspecifically permitted otherwise.\nC. Renovations and Repairs. A building or site may be renovated or repaired without\nproviding additional parking, providing there is no increase in floor area unless the\naddition in area meets the requirements set forth in this UDO. If there is an increase in\nfloor area, the requisite number of parking spaces shall be provided per requirements of\nthis Section.
