A right which has been vested\nunder the provisions of this subsection shall terminate at the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to buildings\nand uses for which no valid building permit has been issued; except that:\n(1) When a vested development plan has been at least 50% completed by the end of the vesting period, the project as\na whole shall be given two more years to complete development in conformance with the approved plan not to exceed a\ntotal vested period of five years; and\n(2) Prior to the vested right terminating at the end of the three-year period, the owner of the property may petition the\nappropriate board for a one-time two-year extension of the vested right not to exceed a total vested period of five years.\n(a) In its deliberations regarding the extension request, the Board may consider, among other things:\n1. The percentage of the project completed;\n2. A demonstration by the petitioner of good faith efforts made towards project completion;\n3. The reasons for the delay of project build-out; and\n4. The compatibility of the planned development with current town plans and the surrounding landscape.\n(b) The Board may choose to extend the vested right for the entire project or only a portion of the project and may\nrequire one or more design features shown on the plan or incorporated in the permit to meet the current code.\n(E) Declaration of a vested right upon voluntary annexation. A petition for annexation filed with the town under G.S. \u00a7\n160A-31 or G.S. \u00a7 160A-58.1 shall contain a signed statement declaring whether or not any zoning vested right with respect\nto the properties subject to the petition has been established. A statement that declares that no zoning vested right has\nbeen established under G.S. \u00a7 160D-108.1 Vested Rights - Site-Specific Vesting Plans, or the failure to sign a statement\ndeclaring whether or not a zoning vested right has been established, shall be binding on the landowner and any such zoning\nvested right which may have existed shall be terminated.\n(2003 Code, \u00a7 8-3.2.2) (Updated 2009) (Amended 6-1-2021)\n\u00a7 8-3.3 ZONING DISTRICTS.\n\u00a7 8-3.3.1 Zoning Districts Established.\n(A) Types of zoning districts. All areas within the zoning jurisdiction of the town are hereby divided into zoning districts\nwithin which the use of land and water areas; the location, height, bulk, appearance and use of structures; the provision of\nparking and loading areas; and the provision of buffers and screening areas are regulated as herein provided. Zoning\ndistricts within the town fall within one of the following three categories.\n(1) General Use Zoning districts. Each General Use District category serves a different purpose and imposes its own\nset of requirements and restrictions on the use of land in addition to the general requirements and restrictions imposed on\nall\nland or uses within the zoning jurisdiction. A General Use District may be layered with an overlay district, which is a special\ntype of General Use District.\n(2) Conditional Zoning Districts.\n(a) Most Conditional Districts are established as parallel or counterpart districts to a General Use District. In such\ncases, references in the zoning ordinance to the General Use District shall be construed to also include the counterpart\nConditional District. In addition, there are several districts which exist only as Conditional Districts and do not have\nCounterpart General Use Districts. Conditional Districts, like General Use Districts, may be layered with Overlay Districts.\n(b) Each Conditional District with a counterpart General Use District is intended to accomplish the purposes of the\ncounterpart district through the development of identified uses at a specific location in accordance with this article. All\nregulations and uses which apply to a General Use District also apply to the counterpart Conditional District and no use shall\nbe allowed in the Conditional District that is not allowed in its counterpart General Use District.\n"}, {"page": "8", "text": "(c) Additional conditions, which may be suggested by the petitioner as part of the rezoning process, shall be binding\nupon property within a Conditional District in perpetuity or until the property is rezoned by the Town Board. The conditions\nmay include increased buffers, architectural features, access, parking, hours of operation or any other feature of the\ndevelopment that is integral to meeting the spirit and intent of this article or that serves to mitigate the impacts of the\ndevelopment on adjacent property or the community at large. The conditions must be enforceable by the town, presented by\nthe petitioner during the public hearing as part of the rezoning petition and agreed to by the Town Board during the rezoning\nprocess.\n(d) This is a voluntary procedure which is intended for firm development proposals. It is not intended or suited for\nsecuring early zoning for tentative or speculative proposals which may not be undertaken for some time. Therefore, the\nrezoning of land to a Conditional Zoning District is appropriate only in response to a firm development proposal.\n(3) Overlay Districts. Overlay Districts are established to provide for certain additional requirements, to permit uses not\notherwise permitted in the underlying district, to prohibit uses allowed in the underlying district or to establish special\ndevelopment requirements for uses permitted. Thus, where Overlay Districts exist and there is a conflict between the\nrequirements and/or uses specified between the overlay and the underlying district, the standards of the Overlay District\nshall prevail. Otherwise, the standards of the underlying district shall also be in effect for any area additionally zoned for an\noverlay district. A zoning map change either establishing or changing any Overlay District shall be subject to the same\nprocedures and requirements as any other zoning map change. In certain areas, two or more Overlay Districts may apply to\nthe same parcel of land.\n(B) Districts named.\n(C) Zoning district boundary interpretation.\n(1) Where district boundaries are shown within a street or alley right-of-way, railroad or utility line right-of-way, recorded\neasement or navigable or non-navigable waterway, the boundaries shall be construed to be in the center of the right-of-way,\neasement or waterway.\n(2) Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow lot lines or town, city or county borders,\nthe lines shall be construed to be the district boundaries, unless otherwise indicated.\n(3) Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets,\nhighways or railroads or rights-of-way of same, the district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at the\ndistance therefrom as indicated on the zoning map. If no distance is shown, the distance shall be determined by use of the\nscale shown on the official zoning maps.\n(4) Where a district boundary line divides a single lot, each part of the lot shall be used in conformity with the standards\nestablished by these regulations for the district in which that part is located.\n(5) If, because of error or omission in the maps, any property within the jurisdiction of this article is not shown as being\nin a zoning district, the property will be classified as OSR until changed by amendment.\n(6) When a zoning case file contains detailed, verifiable information regarding the boundary, that information will be\nCELL (1, 1): \nDistrict Abbreviation\nCELL (1, 2): \nDistrict Name\nCELL (1, 3): \nClassification\nCELL (2, 1): \nDistrict Abbreviation\nCELL (2, 2): \nDistrict Name\nCELL (2, 3): \nClassification\nCELL (3, 1): \nOSR & OSR-CD\nCELL (3, 2): \nOpen Space District\nCELL (3, 3): \nResidential\nCELL (4, 1): \nGR & GR-CD\nCELL (4, 2): \nGeneral Residential District\nCELL (4, 3): \nResidential\nCELL (5, 1): \nNR & NR-CD\nCELL (5, 2): \nNeighborhood Residential\nDistrict\nCELL (5, 3): \nResidential\nCELL (6, 1): \nNC & NC-CD\nCELL (6, 2): \nNeighborhood Center District\nCELL (6, 3): \nMixed Use\nCELL (7, 1): \nTC & TC-CD\nCELL (7, 2): \nTown Center District\nCELL (7, 3): \nMixed Use\nCELL (8, 1): \nHC & HC-CD\nCELL (8, 2): \nHighway Commercial District\nCELL (8, 3): \nCommercial\nCELL (9, 1): \nTND & TND-CD\nCELL (9, 2): \nTraditional Neighborhood\nDevelopment District\nCELL (9, 3): \nMixed Use\nCELL (10, 1): \nCI & CI-CD\nCELL (10, 2): \nCampus Institutional District\nCELL (10, 3): \nMixed Use\nCELL (11, 1): \nCB & CB-CD\nCELL (11, 2): \nCampus Business District\nCELL (11, 3): \nCommercial\nCELL (12, 1): \nSP & SP-CD\nCELL (12, 2): \nSpecial Purpose District\nCELL (12, 3): \nCommercial\nCELL (13, 1): \nGI & GI-CD\nCELL (13, 2): \nGeneral Industrial District\nCELL (13, 3): \nIndustrial\nCELL (14, 1): \nFP\nCELL (14, 2): \nFloodplain District\nCELL (14, 3): \nEnvironmental\nCELL (15, 1): \nMH & MH-O-CD\nCELL (15, 2): \nManufactured Home Overlay\nDistrict\nCELL (15, 3): \nResidential\nCELL (16, 1): \nMF & MF-O-CD\nCELL (16, 2): \nMulti-family Overlay District\nCELL (16, 3): \nResidential\nCELL (17, 1): \nWS-O\nCELL (17, 2): \nWatershed Overlay District\nCELL (17, 3): \nEnvironmental\n"}, {"page": "9", "text": "used as the correct boundary location.\n(7) In instances where none of the above methods are sufficient to resolve the boundary location, the Board of\nAdjustment shall establish the boundary location.\n(2003 Code, \u00a7 8-3.3.1) (Updated 2009)\n\u00a7 8-3.3.2 General and Conditional Districts.\n(A) Open Space Residential District (OSR and OSR-CD).\n(1) Intent. The Open Space Residential District is provided to encourage the development of compact residential\nneighborhoods that set aside significant natural vistas, parkland and landscape features and other rural heritage features for\npermanent conservation. The density of development is regulated based upon the amount of open space which is\npreserved.\n(2) Permitted uses.

The Highway Commercial District is established to provide for auto-dependent uses in areas not amenable to\neasy pedestrian access. It is expected that the Highway Commercial District will serve not only the town's community, but\nthe general region as well. Because of the scale and access requirements of uses in this category, they often cannot be\nintegrated within the Town Center or Neighborhood Center Districts.\n(2) Permitted uses. Uses permitted by right, uses with conditions and uses permitted upon the issuance of a \"special\"\npermit are listed in the Table of Uses in \u00a7 8-3.3.5.\n(3) Dimensional requirements and supplemental standards.\n(a) All lots shall meet the minimum dimensional requirements shown in \u00a78-3.3.4.\n(b) Any lot requested for rezoning to the Highway Commercial District shall be contiguous to an existing HC District or\nshall have direct access to a major thoroughfare.\n(G) Traditional Neighborhood Development District (TND and TND-CD).\n(1) Intent. The Traditional Neighborhood Development District is established to provide for the development of new\nneighborhoods and the revitalization or extension of existing neighborhoods, which are structured upon a fine network of\ninterconnecting pedestrian oriented streets and other public spaces. The characteristics of a TND development include a\nmixture of housing types and prices, prominently sited civic or community building(s) and stores, offices and workplaces that\nprovide a balanced mix of activities. Church and pre-school/elementary school facilities are encouraged. Furthermore, a\nTND development has a recognizable center and clearly defined edges.\n(2) Permitted uses.

A minimum of 1% of the land area of each neighborhood in the development shall be\ndesignated for civic uses (e.g., community buildings, meeting halls, libraries, post offices, schools, child care centers,\nclubhouses, religious buildings, recreational facilities, museums, town buildings and similar uses). A minimum of 2% and a\nmaximum of 30% of each neighborhood in the development shall be designated for street level retail uses.\n(H) Campus Institutional District (CI and CI-CD).\n(1) Intent. The Campus Institutional District is established to provide for large institutional complexes which are already\nin place and for large new institutional complexes that, because of the scale of the buildings or the nature of the use, cannot\nbe fully integrated into the fabric of the community. The Districts are intended primarily for existing institutions, as most new\ninstitutional projects can and should be designed to fit within the fabric of one of the other town districts. The Campus\nInstitutional District is reserved for uses which require very large buildings and/or large parking and loading facilities such as\nhospitals and community colleges.\n(2) Permitted uses.

Expansions to\nstructures classified as existing development must meet the requirements of this District, however, the built upon area of the\nexisting development is not required to be included in the density calculations.\n(f) A maximum of 10% of the town's portion of the watershed outside of the critical area, delineated on 7-1-1995 and\nany portion of the watershed outside of the critical area allocated by the county to the town, may be developed with new\nresidential and non-residential development and expansions to existing development of up to 70% built-upon surface area.\n(This shall be referred to as the 10/70 provision.) Each project must, to the maximum extent practicable, minimize built-upon\nsurface area, direct storm water runoff away from surface waters and incorporate best management practices to minimize\nwater quality impacts.\n(g) Clustering of development is allowed in the Watershed Overlay District under the following conditions.\n1. Minimum lot sizes are not applicable to single-family cluster development projects; however, the total number of\nlots in the development shall not exceed the number of lots allowed for this District.\n2. Total built-upon area shall not exceed the allowed maximum for the District.\n3. All built-upon area shall be designed and located to minimize storm water runoff impact to the receiving waters\nand minimize concentrated storm water flow.\n4. The remainder of the tract not used for development shall remain in a permanent vegetated or natural state.\nSufficient proof of permanent maintenance of open space shall be required prior to development approval by the town.\n(h) Storm water runoff shall be transported by vegetated conveyances to the maximum extent practicable.\n(i) A minimum 30-foot vegetative stream buffer is required along all perennial waters indicated on the most recent\nversions of U.S.G.S. 1:24,000 scale (7.5 minute) topographic maps for all uses except agriculture, where agriculture is the\nprimary use of a lot. Agricultural uses must maintain a minimum ten foot vegetated buffer or equivalent control as determined\nby the Soil and Water Conservation Commission along all perennial waters indicated on the most recent versions of\nU.S.G.S. 1:24,000 scale (7.5 minute) topographic maps. Desirable artificial stream bank or shoreline stabilization is\npermitted.\n(j) No new development is allowed in the stream buffer. Water dependent structures or other structures, such as\nflagpoles, signs and security lights, which result in only minimal increases in impervious area and public projects such as\nroad crossings and greenways may be allowed where no practical alternative exists. These activities shall minimize built-\nupon surface area, direct runoff away from the surface waters and maximize the utilization of storm water best management\n"}, {"page": "14", "text": "practices.\n(4) Review criteria.\n(a) The property under consideration shall be used for industrial, commercial or mixed-use development.

Signs are one of the most noticeable visual elements along every city and county's commercial streets and\nhighways. Signs communicate what a particular establishment offers. They also communicate something about the quality of\nthe businesses and the image of the community in general. Together with other visual elements in the town's environment,\nsigns can play a major role in how people perceive the town's image. Well-designed signs that communicate their message\nclearly, without attempting to compete for attention with the road, will help create a more pleasing visual environment along\nthe town's streets. The goal of this article is to attain a balance between proper levels of safety and to enhance the town's\nstreetscapes with the addition of eye-catching visual design that helps identify businesses and their services.\n(B) Intent. To ensure that signage is designed and placed to complement the character of the town. To minimize the\ndistractions and obstructions that contributes to traffic hazards and endangers public safety. To protect existing development\nand promote high standards of quality in new development by requiring appropriately designed, placed and sized signage.\nTo provide an effective guide for communicating identification through signage while preventing signs from dominating the\nvisual appearance of the areas in which they are located. The following standards shall apply to all signs in all zoning\ndistricts unless otherwise noted.\n(C) Applicability.\n(1) It shall be unlawful to construct, enlarge, modify, move or replace any sign or cause the same to be done, without\nfirst obtaining a zoning permit for the sign from the town.\n(2) Not withstanding the above, changing or replacing the permanent copy on an existing lawful sign shall not require a\npermit, provided the copy change does not change the nature of the sign so as to render it in violation of this article.\n(2003 Code, \u00a7 8-3.6.1) (Updated 2009)\n\u00a7 8-3.6.2 Sign Permit Required.\nExcept as specifically excluded from the provisions of this article, it shall be unlawful for any person to post, display,\nsubstantially change or erect a sign within the town zoning jurisdiction without first having obtained a sign permit. For\npurposes of this article, application for a sign permit and a building permit may be made simultaneously.\n(2003 Code, \u00a7 8-3.6.2) (Updated 2009)\n\u00a7 8-3.6.3 Building Permit Required.\nFor any monument sign or any sign connected to electrical power, it shall be a violation of this article to post, display,\n"}, {"page": "53", "text": "substantially change or erect a sign in the town without first having obtained a building permit.

No sign shall be placed so as to obstruct the clear sight triangle at a street intersection nor\nshall any sign obstruct the view of motorists entering or leaving an off-street parking area.\n(C) Relation to other building elements.\n(1) Signs shall relate in their placement and size to other building elements without obscuring building elements such as\nwindows, cornices or decorative details, except that signs may be placed on the inside of windows.\n(2) Sign material, style and color shall compliment the building facade in terms of design, scale, color and materials.\n(3) Individual shop signs in a single storefront shall relate to each other in terms of design, size, color, placement on the\nbuilding and lettering style.\n(4) Signs placed on the inside of window areas shall conceal no more than 25% of the area of the window on which the\nsigns are located.\n(D) Sign height computation. Sign height shall be computed as the lower of:\n(1) Existing grade prior to construction; or\n(2) The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding or excavating solely\nfor\nthe purpose of locating the sign. The calculation of the height of any sign placed upon a berm or mound shall include the\nheight of the berm or mound.\n(E) Sign area computation. The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one\nface) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle or combination thereof that will\nencompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with any material or color\nforming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure\nagainst which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence or wall when the fence or\nwall otherwise meets zoning ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself.\n"}, {"page": "54", "text": "Sign\nsign\narea\nSION\nSIGN\nAREA\nAREA\n(F) Sign area computation for multi-faced signs. The sign area for a sign with multiple faces shall be computed by adding\ntogether the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When a sign is composed of two or more sign faces only one\nof which can be viewed from any one point and when the sign faces are part of the same sign structure, the sign area shall\nbe computed by the measurement of one of the faces.\n(G) Maintenance of signs. All signs shall be maintained in good structural and aesthetic condition. Deficiencies such as\nchipped paint, broken plastic, missing letters and exposed light bulbs shall be evidence of a lack of maintenance.\n(H) Forfeiture of illegal signs placed on or over public property. Any sign installed or placed on or over public property,\nexcept in conformance with the requirements of this article, shall be forfeited to the public and be subject to confiscation and\ndisposal. In addition to other remedies provided by this article and the Town Code of Ordinances, the town shall have the\nright to recover from the sign owner and/or installer the full costs of removal and disposal of the sign.\n(2003 Code, \u00a7 8-3.6.6) (Updated 2009)\n\u00a7 8-3.6.7 Prohibited Signs.\nNotwithstanding \u00a7 8-3.6.15 and in addition thereto, the following signs, both permanent and temporary, are prohibited in all\nzoning districts:\n(A) Signs extending into the public right-of-way other than those expressly permitted by this article or otherwise approved\nby the Town Manager, if placed along public streets;\n(B) Roof signs;\n(C) Portable signs as defined in this article (for example: trailer signs, balloon signs and the like);\n(D) Flashing, fluttering, swinging, wind-activated or rotating signs, not to include non-flashing time and/or temperature\nsigns;\n(E) Any sign which obstructs the view of motorists, pedestrians or cyclists using any street, sidewalk, bike path or\ndriveway or which obstructs the approach to any street intersection or railroad crossing or which interferes with the\neffectiveness of any traffic sign, device or signal;\n(F) Illuminated or highly reflective signs which hamper the vision of motorists or cyclists;\n(G) Any sign which resembles traffic signals, traffic signs or emergency vehicle lights and any other sign not erected by a\npublic authority which may be erroneously construed as governmental signs or emergency warning signs;\n(H) Beacons, pennants and strings of lights not permanently mounted to a rigid background, except those permitted as\ntemporary signs;\n(I) Any sign which interferes with free passage from or obstructs any fire escape, downspout, window, door, stairway,\nladder or opening intended as a means of ingress or egress or providing light or air except for permitted window signs;\n(J) Any sign placed on any curb, sidewalk, post, pole, hydrant, bridge, tree or other structure or surface located on, over\nor across any public street right-of-way or property unless expressly authorized by this article or the Town Manager;\n(K) Off-premises signs advertising adult establishments;\n(L) Off-premises signs on parcels of land which are zoned residential, used primarily for residential purposes or which do\nnot include an active permitted use as established by this article;\n(M) Inflatable devices or balloons.

This is not intended to prohibit any form of vehicular signage\nsuch as a sign attached to a bus or lettering on a motor vehicle. Delivery vehicles and business vehicles should be parked in\nthe side or rear of the building.\nParking a vehicle in a street frontage area, like\nthe one to the right, that has been designed\nto act as a sign, is strictly prohibited in the\nTown of Mocksville.\nWE CATER\u00ae\n(2003 Code, \u00a7 8-3.6.7) (Updated 2009) (Amended 12-2-2014)\n\u00a7 8-3.6.8 Sign Placement.\nThe following provisions shall apply to the placement of all signs in all Districts.\n(A) In general.\n"}, {"page": "56", "text": "(1) Signs must be located entirely on private property, unless otherwise permitted by this article.\n(2) No sign, including its projections, may extend into or over an existing public right-of-way or within the clear sight\ntriangle, unless expressly permitted by this article.\n(3) Signs should be designed to relate to the architectural features of the building on which they are located and create\nvisual continuity with other storefronts on the same or adjacent buildings.\n(4) Signs should be placed at or near the public entrance to a building or main parking area to indicate the most direct\naccess to the business.\n(5) Signs should be placed consistent with the proportions of the building's facade. For example, a particular sign may\nfit well on an upper, more basic wall, but would overpower and obstruct the finer detail of a lower storefront area. A sign\nappropriate near the building's entry may look tiny and out of place above the ground level.\n(6) Signs should not be located so that they cover or interrupt the architectural details or ornamentation of a building's\nfacade.\n(7) Signs should not project above the edge of the rooflines and should not obstruct windows and/or doorways.\n(8) The location and extent of signs and advertising should not obstruct scenic views.\n(B) Temporary signs.\n(1) Temporary signs shall be located on private property unless expressly permitted by this article to be posted on\npublic property.\n(2) All temporary signs shall be anchored, attached or otherwise affixed to a structure or support so that the sign cannot\nbe easily dislodged by strong winds or heavy rains.\n(C) Specific sign placement guidelines.\n(1) Changeable copy and electronic message boards may be used as wall signs if deemed appropriate by the Town\nBoard of Commissioners.\n(2) Signs on lawnings are limited to ground floor and second floor uses only.\n(3) Directory Signs should be posted at corners of (or along) interior driveways, sidewalks and parking lots and on\nexterior walls only.\n(4) Suspended signs must be placed directly in front of store entrance.\n(5) Wall mounted signs shall not extend above the leave or parapet of any building.\n(6) A wall sign should be located where the architectural features or details of the building suggest a location, size or\nshape for the sign. The best location for a wall sign is generally a band or blank area between the first and second floors of\na building.\n(7) Window signs should be primarily individual letters placed on the interior surface of the window and intended to be\nviewed from outside.\n(8) All parts of freestanding signs must be set back a minimum of five feet from the property line or road/street right-of-\nway.\n(9) No freestanding sign shall be located closer than 15 feet from another structure on the same zoning lot.\n(10) Freestanding signs for primary advertisement shall be limited to monument or ground signs.\n(11) The base of every freestanding sign shall be landscaped with plant materials, including, but not limited to ground\ncovers, perennials and shrubs. The size of the planted landscaped area shall be determined by multiplying the height of the\nsign by the width of the sign divided by two, but in no case shall the planted area be less than 50 square feet.\n(2003 Code, \u00a7 8-3.6.8) (Updated 2009)\n\u00a7 8-3.6.9 Sign Materials.\n(A) Sign materials should be selected with consideration for the architectural design of the building's facade. Sign\nmaterials should complement the materials on the facade and should contribute to the legibility of the sign.\n(B) Sign materials should be very durable. Paper and cloth signs are not suitable for outside because they deteriorate\nquickly. When wood is used, it should be properly sealed to keep moisture from soaking into the wood and causing the\nsign's lettering to deteriorate.\n(C) The following sign materials are encouraged for the town:\n(1) Wood (carved, sandblasted, etched, properly sealed and painted or stained);\n(2) Metal (formed, etched, cast, engraved and properly primed and painted or factory coated to protect against erosion);\n"}, {"page": "57", "text": "(3) Masonry (brick, concrete, stucco and the like);\n(4) Fiberglass; and\n(5) Plastic.\n(2003 Code, \u00a7 8-3.6.9) (Updated 2009)\n\u00a7 8-3.6.10 Sign Illumination.\n(A) Neon, argon and similar lighting fixtures shall not be used anywhere on the exterior of a building; however, the signs if\nnon-flashing and non-moving may be mounted on the inside of store windows.\n(B) Signs shall only be lighted with indirect light sources (e.g., backlighting); knockout signs are encouraged\n(C) All illuminated signs shall be installed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the North Carolina State\nElectrical Code and all detached signs shall be illuminated by an underground electrical source.\n(D) If the sign can be illuminated by an indirect source of light, this is usually the best arrangement because the sign will\nappear to be better integrated with the building's architecture. Light fixtures supported in front of the sign cast light on the\nsign and generally a portion of the building as well. Indirect lighting emphasizes the continuity of the building's surface and\nsigns become an integral part of the facade. Conversely, internally illuminated cabinet signs where only the sign face is\nilluminated tend to stand out and not appear integrated with the building's facade.\n(E) Individually illuminated letters, either internally illuminated or back-lighted solid letters (reverse channel), are a\npreferred alternative to internally illuminated plastic-faced cabinet signs. Signs comprised of individual letters will be better\nintegrated with the building because they use the building's facade as their background.\n(F) If internally illuminated cabinet signs are used, their sign panels should be opaque so that when illuminated only the\nlettering, not the background, is illuminated.
