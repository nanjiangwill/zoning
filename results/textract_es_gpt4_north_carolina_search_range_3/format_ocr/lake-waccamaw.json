The development and execution of this ordinance is based upon the division of the community into districts, within which\ndistricts the use of land and buildings and structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however,\nthat there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics cannot be properly classified in any particular district or\ndistricts, without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the\nparticular use in the particular location. Such conditional uses fall into two (2) categories:\n1. Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest.\n2. Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with\nrespect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.\nB. Initiation of conditional uses. Any person having a freehold interest in land, or a possessory interest entitled to exclusive\npossession, or a contractual interest which may become a freehold interest or an exclusive possessory interest, and which is\nspecifically enforceable, may file an application to use such land for one (1) or more of the conditional uses provided for in this\nordinance in the zoning district in which the land is located.\n69 of 97\n4/20/24, 16:38\n"}, {"page": "70", "text": "Lake Waccamaw, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nC.

Upon receipt in proper form of the written recommendations referred to above, the board of\ncommissioners shall hold at least one (1) public hearing on the proposed conditional use.\nE.

For each application for a conditional use, the planning board shall report to the board its findings and\nrecommendations, including the stipulations of additional conditions and guarantees that such conditions will be complied with\nwhen they are deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest.

That the conditional use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the\npurposes already permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood;\n3.\nThat the establishment of the conditional use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the\nsurrounding property for uses permitted in the district;\n4.

Conditions and guarantees. Prior to the granting of any conditional use, the planning board may recommend, and the board of\ncommissioners may stipulate, such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance, and\noperation of the conditional use as is deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance with the\nstandards and requirements specified above.
