All structures shall be fully integrated into the mixed use project through common\ndesign themes (including but not limited to lighting, benches, landscaping, and other decorative features but not necessarily building design),\nintegration with a variety of uses, non-linear arrangement, common spaces, pedestrian walkways, vehicular access connections and other\nfeatures.\n(ii)\nClearly defined common spaces for gathering interaction and fostering a sense of community. Plazas, courtyards and other areas\nare\nnecessary to provide for public gathering and interaction. Amenities, such as benches, planters, lighting, fountains, art and landscaping that\nfurther the design theme of the project and encourage interaction are required. Specific requirements are described in the common space and\nopen space section of this article.\n(iii) Integrated design of the project. Common architectural theme: Mixed use projects require special attention to building design because of the\nintermixing of land uses in close proximity. Functional integration of residential and commercial uses shall be considered during design of mixed\nuse projects. The following standards are intended to guide development of mixed use projects:\n[A] Physical integration of uses: All mixed use developments shall be designed and developed to provide an appropriate interrelationship\nbetween the various uses and structures within the development.\n[B] Residential and commercial uses may be located within the same or adjoining structures providing appropriate health and safety regulations\nare followed.\n[C] Design: Structures should provide architectural relief and interest, with emphasis at building entrances and along sidewalks, to promote and\nenhance a comfortable pedestrian scale and orientation. Structures shall have consistent scale and massing to create a unified project.\nCompatibility with the immediate context is required. However, gradual transitions in scale and massing are permitted.\n[1] Blank walls shall be avoided by including ground floor windows, recesses, extensions and breaks in roof elevation.\n[2] Design should provide differentiation between ground-level spaces and upper stories. For example, bays or balconies for upper levels,\nand lawnings, canopies or other similar treatments for lower levels can provide differentiation. Variation in building materials, trim, paint,\nornamentation, windows, or other features such as public art, may also be used.\n[3] Design shall ensure privacy in residential developments through effective window placement, sound-proofing, landscape screening or\norientation of outdoor living areas (e.g. balconies, porches, patios and etc.). Opposite facing windows at close distances should be offset\nvertically or horizontally, or employ appropriate materials (e.g. glazed, tinted and etc.) to protect privacy.\n(iv) Housing diversity (size, type and cost).\n[A] Mixed use projects should include attached and detached residential components with a range of prices and sizes.\n[B] Single-family lot sizes shall be varied to provide a mixture of lot sizes.\n(v) Preservation of natural features and open space. Permitted flexibility in lot sizes, setbacks, street widths and landscaping shall be utilized to\npreserve natural features and provide open space consistent with the policies of the comprehensive plan. Specific requirements are described in\nthe common space and open space section of the mixed use ordinance.\n(vi) Connection to the surrounding community. Mixed use developments shall not be gated and shall be interconnected to surrounding\ndevelopments. Mixed use projects shall be designed as an integral part of the surrounding community and not as an isolated development.\n(4) Density.\n(a) Mixed Use Density.\n(i) The base density permitted for areas designated mixed use within the mixed use commercial, highway commercial, employment areas and large-\nscale retail land use categories shall be 0.20 floor area ratio.\n(ii) The base density permitted for areas designated mixed use within the mixed-use office, village-scale retail office, institutional and mixed use\ncommercial land use categories shall be 0.15 floor area ratio.\n(iii) The base density permitted for areas designated mixed use in the watershed categories shall be 0.10 floor area ratio.\n(iv) Maximum density for areas designated mixed use shall be determined by adding the base density to any density bonuses. Density bonuses shall\nbe determined by application of performance measures described in the density bonus section below.\nFloor area ratio (FAR) equals the gross floor area of all buildings in areas designated mixed use divided by the mixed use area (FAR = gross floor\narea\\mixed use area).\n(b) Residential Density.\n(i) The base density permitted for areas designated residential areas in this district shall be seven (7) dwelling units per acre for single family and\ntwelve (12) units per acre for multi-family projects.\n(ii) Maximum density for areas designated residential shall be determined by adding base density to density bonuses. Density bonuses shall be\ndetermined by application of performance measures described in this ordinance.\n(c) Density calculations. Density shall be calculated using land use categories (mixed use or exclusively residential).\n68 of 243\n12/15/2023, 10:15 AM\n"}, {"page": "69", "text": "Clemmons, NC Unified Development Code\nabout:blank\n(i) Mixed use density shall be calculated using only the gross area identified as mixed use (including streets, parking, common space\nopen space\nand other features in the mixed use area).\n(ii) Residential density shall be calculated using only the gross area identified as residential (including streets, parking, common space open space\nand other features in the residential area).\n(iii) Maximum density shall be calculated for each land classification area within the project. Development in that area shall not exceed the density\npermitted in the underlying land classification category except for bonuses permitted in this ordinance. Density shall not be aggregated over the\nentire site except through the procedures defined in section (d) below.\n(iv) If the applicant designates areas classified resource protection or conservation as not to be developed, the density calculation for the more\nintense land classification category may be applied to the entire mixed use or residential area.\n(v) Land preserved for the purpose described in section (iv) above shall only be eligible for full credit towards the minimum open space requirement\nif it is an integral part of the development. If the entire preserved area is located on the periphery of the development, the area shall only be\ncredited for a maximum fifty percent (50%) of the required open space. The purpose of this limit is to ensure open space is not isolated but is an\nintegral part of the development.\n(d)\nDensity\nbonuses: In reviewing a final plan/site plan for a mixed use development, the technical review committee (TRC) shall make a\nrecommendation to the planning board and council if the applicant meets the requirements for receiving bonuses.\nThe increases in density shall be subject to the following procedures:\nThe density bonus for providing any individual shall be one-half (1/2) floor area ratio or two and one-half (2.5) dwelling units per acre for single\nfamily residential and unlimited for multi-family development.

PRDs provide an alternative to conventional subdivision design by promoting\nthe conservation and creation of viable, connected open space and more flexible lot design options while minimizing development costs. The Planned\nResidential Development provides flexibility in utilizing new development concepts. Three (3) distinct types of open space shall be required in PRDs: (1) Active\nOpen Space, (2) Passive Open Space, and (3) Thoroughfare Open Space. In return for development flexibility, additional site plan information may be\nrequired of the developer to assist in evaluating the suitability of proposed PRDs. PRDs are suitable for Growth Management Areas 2, 3, 4, and 5. The\ncharacter of a PRD should be appropriate to the GMA in which the PRD is located along the urban to rural continuum. While maximum open space\npreservation is the primary goal of rural PRDs, open space within urban and suburban PRDs must balance the need for open space preservation with an\nincreased need for integration with surrounding developments through street connectivity and compatibility with adjacent and internal land uses.\n(B) Minimum Size A planned residential development shall be located on a site containing at least three (3) contiguous acres in GMA 3 and 4, and at least five\n(5) contiguous acres in GMA 5. No minimum size requirement exists for PRDs in GMA 2.\n(C) Process Planned Residential Development shall be processed and approved pursuant to section B.6-2.6 Zoning Map Amendment-Special Use District.\n(D) Permitted Principal Uses\n(1) Uses in Underlying Zoning Districts.\nPRDs may include all uses permitted within the underlying zoning district.\n(E) Relationship to Other Applicable Regulations A PRD shall be subject to all applicable standards, procedures, and regulations of these Ordinances and the\nzoning district in which it is located unless otherwise set forth in this section.\n(F) Maximum Density Maximum residential density shall be in accordance with the zoning district in which the planned residential development lies, unless\nthe incentives for density bonuses as set forth in Section B.2-5.60(G) apply.\n(G) Incentives for Density Bonus\n(1) Density Bonus. The permitted density of a PRD may be increased beyond standard allowances if a PRD preserves more than the minimum required\namount of open space for the applicable zoning district. To calculate the allowed density bonus, refer to Table B.2.7a.\n(2) Use of Floodplain in Calculating Density Bonus. F.E.M.A. 100-year Floodplain land shall not be used in the calculation of open space for the purposes\nof\nthe Density Bonus provision. However, floodplain land may be used in calculating minimum open space requirements.\n(H) Development Standards A PRD shall meet the following standards:\n(1) Outside Perimeter Lot Setback Requirements. Any lot which adjoins the outside boundary of the PRD shall be considered an outside perimeter lot.\nInternal street refers to a street that is within the boundary of the PRD. Adjoining street is a street which is not located within the PRD but is adjacent to\nthe outside boundary of the planned residential development. The following setbacks shall be required for outside perimeter lots:\n(a) Lots with access on an internal street. Rear yard setback requirement of the zoning district in which the PRD is located shall be required.\n(b) Lots with access on an adjoining street. Front yard setback requirements of the zoning district in which the PRD is located shall be required.\n(c) Corner lots with access either on an internal or adjoining street. Front yard set back requirements of the zoning district in which the PRD is located\nshall be required on the adjoining street and the front yard set back requirements allowed in the PRD shall be required on the internal street.\n106 of 243\n12/15/2023, 10:15 AM\n"}, {"page": "107", "text": "Clemmons, NC Unified Development Code\n(d) Access Drives.

Subject matter related to premises. The subject matter of any sign must be related to the premises on which the sign is located, except where\nspecifically exempted by the Unified Development Ordinance.\nII. Non-commercial message. Whenever the ordinance permits a commercial sign, a non-commercial message may be substituted for the\ncommercial message. The right to substitute the non-commercial message does not waive any other requirement imposed by this Unified\nDevelopment Ordinance as to the number, size, type, construction, location, lighting, safety, or other regulated attribute.\n(g) Design.\ni. Sign Design.\n1. Material, style, and color. Sign material, style, and color shall complement the building fa\u00e7ade in terms of design, scale, color, and materials.\n2.\nGround signs. Colors for freestanding ground signs and wall signs shall be limited to three (3) colors, including the background color. The\nexterior finish color and materials of the sign and sign cabinet shall complement the colors and materials of the building that the advertised\nbusiness occupies. This shall not apply to federally registered trademarks. While not a requirement, it is recommended that signs have a\ndarker background with lighter colors to improve visibility, especially at night.\n3. Ground Sign Design. Freestanding ground-mounted signs shall be monument style, with the base of the sign being no more than twelve (12)\ninches above the adjacent grade. All monument signs shall be designed with decorative caps or finials on top. The base of the sign shall be\nsurrounded by landscaping, including a variety of annuals and perennials that do not obstruct the sign's face.\n4. Multi-tenant Sign.\na.\nNumber and Size. Any shopping center or multiple proprietorships in one building or connected buildings occupied by four (4) or more\ntenants shall be permitted a fifty percent (50%) increase in ground sign (on-premises) area provided that such signs shall be of the\nmarquee type. If the lot frontage is greater than one hundred fifty (150) feet, two (2) ground signs may be used with seventy-five (75) feet\nseparation between signs and the fifty percent (50%) addition applies to both signs. The fifty percent (50%) additional size applies to the\ncopy area only. The sign height is limited to that authorized in the underlying district.\nb. Freestanding Building Signs. A freestanding building located within designated shopping center parking lots and containing eight hundred\n(800) square feet or more shall be permitted one additional ground sign (on-premises) not to exceed thirty-six (36) square feet.\n5. Cantilevered Ground Signs. The sign must be located at least twenty-five (25) feet from any other ground sign.\n(h) Rules of Measurement.\n(1) Property Frontage. Property frontage is measured as the length of each property boundary that abuts a public street right-of-way.\n(2) Face Sign Area. The following principles shall control the computation of sign area.\na. Computation Area of Single-faced Signs. The area of a sign face shall be computed by means of the smallest square or rectangle that will\nencompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an\nintegral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but\nnot including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets zoning article\nregulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself (see figure B.3-2.1 D of this section).\n145 of 243\n12/15/2023, 10:15 AM\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nTemporary Type 2\nCELL (1, 3): \n1\nCELL (1, 4): \nMinimum 5' setback from\nthe right-of-way\nCELL (1, 5): \n16\nCELL (1, 6): \n5\nCELL (1, 7): \nNo\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nTemporary Wall\nCELL (2, 3): \n1\nCELL (2, 4): \nOn structure\nCELL (2, 5): \n25% percent of the\nmaximum permitted\npermanent wall signage\n(not to exceed 72 sf)\nCELL (2, 6): \n25% percent of the\nmaximum permitted\npermanent wall signage\n(not to exceed 72 sf)\nCELL (2, 7): \nYes\n"}, {"page": "146", "text": "Clemmons, NC Unified Development Code\nCHANNEL\nWindow Sign\nLETTERS\nWidth\nWidth\nIrregular\ncircle\nShape\nWidth\nWidth\nMultiple\nElements\nLogo\nWidth\nFigure B.3-2.1 D Area of Sign Type\nb. Computation Area of Multi-faced Signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all\nsign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any\npoint at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and not more than 42 inches apart, only one side is\ncounted.\nC. Address number on ground signs. The street address number must be included on ground and multi-tenant signs. Numerals must be at least\nnine (9) inches in height. The area of the address is not included in any calculation of the total sign area.\nd. Computation of height.

The Commission may delegate to Commission staff the review and approval of minor works for the Local Historic\nLandmarks (LHL), and for the Historic (H) and Historic Overlay (HO) Districts after approval of Design Review Standards for the Local Historic Landmarks\n(LHL) and each Historic (H) and Historic Overlay (HO) District. Minor works are defined as projects which do not involve substantial alterations, additions,\nor removals that could impair the integrity of an historic landmark, property, and/or a district as a whole or be incongruous with the special character of\nan historic landmark, property, or district. Minor works require a Certificate of Appropriateness. A minor works application may be filed at any time and\nno public notification is required for review of a minor work application. No minor works application may be denied by Commission staff. If Commission\nstaff cannot approve a minor works application, it shall be presented to the Commission for review and formal action.\n(9) Reapplication after Denial. If the Commission determines that a Certificate of Appropriateness should not be issued, a new application affecting the\nsame property may be submitted only if substantial change is made in the application, or if conditions related to the Local Historic Landmark (LHL) or H\nor HO District or surrounding uses have changed. A reconsidered application shall be treated as a new application.\n(10) Demolition Permits. An application for a Certificate of Appropriateness authorizing the relocation or demolition of a designated historic landmark or\nbuilding or structure within an H or HO District may not be denied; however, the effective date of such Certificate may be delayed for not more than\nthree hundred sixty-five (365) calendar days from the date of approval. The maximum delay may be reduced by the Commission when it finds that delay\nwould impose an extreme hardship on the owner or would permanently deprive the owner of all beneficial use or return from such property from such\ndelay. During the period of delay, the Commission may negotiate with the owner and other parties in an effort to preserve the building or structure. If\nthe Commission finds that the building or structure has no particular significance or value toward maintaining the character of the designated landmark\nor district, it shall waive all or part of such period and authorize earlier demolition or removal.\n(11)\nApplicability to County, City, Town, Village and Utility Companies. The County/City/Town/Village and all public utility companies shall be required to\nobtain a Certificate of Appropriateness prior to initiating on a Local Historic Landmark (LHL) or in a H or HO District any changes in the character of street\npaving, sidewalks, trees, utility installations, walls, lighting, fences, structures, and buildings on property, easements, or streets owned or franchised by\nthe County/City/Town/Village or public utility companies.\n(12) Appeals. An appeal of a decision of the Commission in granting or denying any Certificate of Appropriateness shall be taken to the appropriate Board\nof Adjustment. Appeals shall be taken by any aggrieved party by the later of thirty (30) calendar days after the decision is effective or after a written copy\nthereof is delivered in accordance with section B.6-1.5(B)(10), and shall be in the nature of certiorari (only evidence presented at the Commission's\nmeeting shall be considered at the appeal). Appeal from the decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be to the Forsyth County Superior Court.\n(13)\nInspection after Issuance of Certificate. The Zoning Officer shall from time to time inspect the construction or alteration approved by a Certificate of\nAppropriateness and report to the Commission any work not in conformance with the Certificate of Appropriateness.\n(E) After the Fact-Certificate of Appropriateness.\n(1)\nAfter-the-Fact\nCertificate of Appropriateness Applications. An after-the-fact Certificate of Appropriateness application includes any major or minor\nwork projects that have been initiated or completed prior to obtaining the required Certificate of Appropriateness.\n(2)\nAfter-the-Fact Certificate of Appropriateness Application Fee. To discourage activity without a Certificate of Appropriateness and to assist in offsetting\nthe costs associated with the additional staff work that accompanies an after-the-fact application, an escalating fee system has been implemented.

If an after-the-fact application for approval of work, completed without\na\nCertificate of Appropriateness, receives a denial from the Commission, the subsequent Certificate of Appropriateness application, if required, shall be\nconsidered anew. A subsequent Certificate of Appropriateness application must be submitted to the Commission within thirty (30) days of the effective\ndate of the denial of the original after-the-fact application. Commission staff shall determine if the subsequent application qualifies as a major or minor\nwork and said application shall be reviewed accordingly.\n(F)\nStandards for Review A Certificate of Appropriateness shall be issued or denied in accordance with the following standards:\n(1)\nGeneral\nCriteria. In granting a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Commission shall take into account the historic or architectural significance of the\nproperty under consideration and the exterior and interior (where applicable), form and appearance of any proposed additions or modifications to a\nstructure. The Commission shall not consider interior arrangement in H and HO Districts.\n(2) General Restriction on Denial. The Commission shall not refuse to issue a Certificate of Appropriateness except for the purpose of preventing the\nconstruction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or moving of buildings, structures, appurtenant features, or outdoor advertising signs which would\nbe incompatible with the Design Review Standards.\n(3)\nDesign\nReview Standards Required. The requirement for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall not become effective until after the Commission has\nprepared and adopted principles and standards not inconsistent with Part 3C of Article 19 of Chapter 160A of the NCGS. Such principles and standards,\nhereafter referred to as Design Review Standards, shall be prepared for the Local Historic Landmarks (LHL), and for each H and/or HO District and shall\naddress new construction, alterations, additions, moving, and demolition to properties and/or sites. These criteria shall take into account the historic,\narchitectural, and visual elements which are unique to the designated landmarks and districts.\n(4)\nDesign\nReview\nStandards Amendment. Prior to the amendment of Design Review Standards for the Local Historic Landmarks (LHL) or any H or HO\nDistrict, any person may comment upon the proposal. Not less than forty-five (45) days prior to the public hearing at which the Commission proposes to\nact upon the amendment(s), copies of the proposed amendment(s) shall be made available to the Elected Bodies, and any other interested person upon\nrequest. Concurrently, the Commission shall cause notice of the public hearing at which the proposed amendment(s) will be considered for adoption to\nbe published in a newspaper of general circulation in Winston-Salem.\n(G) Compliance.

It is not necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the\nvariance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.\n(ii)\n223 of 243\n12/15/2023, 10:15 AM\n"}, {"page": "224", "text": "Clemmons, NC Unified Development Code\nabout:blank\nThe hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well\nas hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance. A variance may be\ngranted when necessary and appropriate to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a person with a disability.\n(iii)\nThe hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that\ncircumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance is not a self-created hardship.\n(iv) The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the regulation, such that public safety is secured and substantial\njustice is achieved.\n(b) Review of Applications.

If changes are made to the pre-approved site plan or non-residential subdivision plan that will\nrequire a new approval from the Village of Clemmons Council then a new and/or updated traffic impact study may be recommended.\n3. Reserved.\n4. A Traffic Impact Study can only be performed by a Professional Engineer licensed by the North Carolina Board of Registration for Engineers and Land\nSurveyors, to practice engineering in North Carolina and with experience in the preparation of traffic impact studies.\n5. When performing a Traffic Impact Study in the Village of Clemmons the Transportation Impacy Analysis Procedure Manual shall be followed as approved by\nVillage Council in 2011.\nIt is recommended that the contact and/or multi-agency meeting for proposed developments within multiple jurisdictions include a representative from\neach jurisdiction that is familiar with traffic issues concerning each jurisdiction (see the appendix for elected and appointed Boards meeting times, and\nlocations, and phone numbers for each jurisdiction's contact person).\nOther government agencies (both state and local) may be requested by the Director of Planning to review any traffic impact study. When reviewing a\ntraffic impact study in this capacity, other government agencies are to be considered as staff subordinate to the staff of the Planning Board\nrecommending the traffic impact study.\n6. Considerations should also be given to the NCDOT to eliminate any duplication of study recommendations, arrangements will be made by the Village of\nClemmons Planning Department to have a representative from the appropriate NCDOT Division 9 office present at the multi-agency meeting (or send their\nrecommendations). This representative should indicate the NCDOT recommendations for a traffic impact study.\n7. The following areas of investigation will generally be included in a Traffic Impact Study (The exact parameters may be defined at the contact and/or multi-\nagency meeting conference.):\na. An examination of traffic flows, exclusive of the site being studied, defined as \"background traffic\";\nb. An examination of projected traffic flows when site traffic is added, defined as \"total traffic\";\nC. A discussion of mitigation measures (if such measures are recommended);\nd.\nAn examination of projected traffic flows after site is developed and mitigation measures are implemented.\n8. Traffic should be examined as follows:\na.\n240 of 243\n12/15/2023, 10:15 AM\n"}, {"page": "241", "text": "Clemmons, NC Unified Development Code\nabout:blank\nFrom data collected by persons or agencies within the defined study area which is no more than two years old at the time of the pre-study conference;\nb. From traffic counts obtained by the applicant based on the specification established at the pre-study conference (see item 13).\n9. The study area should be determined as follows:\nAs a minimum standard, the study area should include each intersection with a major thoroughfare highway which can be considered as a logical travel\npath between the site and the major thoroughfare highway network. Major thoroughfare highways are so designated by the Winston-Salem/Forsyth\nCounty Thoroughfare and Clemmons Transportation Plan.\nAdditional intersections between the site and the major thoroughfare intersection(s) as well as those intersections that are rationally identified as being\nimpacted by a development should be included in the study area.\n10. The design hour should be determined by:\na. The period for the proposed development which will generate/attract the highest traffic volumes; and/or\nb. The period of highest traffic volumes on the traffic facilities within the study area.\n11. The forecast year should be determined at the contact or multi-agency meeting according to some or all of following criteria:\na. A scheduled phase or the completion of the project (for this and other projects);\nb. The Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Comprehensive Plan (Legacy) and the Clemmons Community Compass;\nC. Locally adopted Transportation or Thoroughfare plan or capital improvement program schedule, or Transportation Improvement Program;\nd. Major transportation system changes.\n12. The following technical procedures and guidelines should be used:\nThe Clemmons Transportation Impact Analysis Procedures Manual shall be the basis for technical procedures and guidelines including the following:\nRoadways and intersections should be analyzed using the appropriate analysis method as depicted in the latest edition of the Highway Capacity Manual,\nTransportation Research Board.\nAdditional analyses may or may not be recommended depending on the traffic concerns expressed at the pre-study conference.\n13. The minimum standard for traffic operations is defined in the Clemmons Transportation Impact Analysis Procedure Manual:\n14. Background traffic should be determined by:\nBackground traffic on roads in the study area should be determined by thoroughfare classification, as per the most current locally adopted Winston-\nSalem/MPO and Clemmons Transportation or Thoroughfare Plan document:\na. By historic and/or projected traffic increase rates on roads classified as being major thoroughfares (arterial or major collectors); and\nb. By developments/trips that have been approved (recorded) on roads classified as minor thoroughfares or streets (minor collectors or local roads).\nExisting zoning activity information is available at the Village of Clemmons Planning Department, at 336-766-7511. Average Daily Traffic (ADT) information\nis available from the Winston-Salem Department of Transportation at 336-727-2707 and/or the NCDOT Division 9 Traffic Engineering Office at\n336-747-7800.\n15. Trip Generation, Distribution and Assignment should be determined by:\nTrip generation should be determined by using the following:\na. The latest edition of the Trip Generation Manual, Institute of Transportation Engineers, (cite land use code and page number); or\nb. Documented local trip generation rates, (as determined through previous or current studies).\nTrip distribution should be determined by using the following:\na. Gravity model;\nb. Trip assignment of the traffic demand forecasting model;\nC. Utilization of demographic data leading to trip purpose and trip tables;\nd. Current directional distribution only if no future changes to land use and no improvements to transportation facilities are expected until the design year;\ne. Trips should be assigned to the study area network during the study's design hour.\n16. Pass-by Trips should be determined by using either of the following:\na. The Institute of Transportation Engineers pass-by trip rates; or\nb. Documented local pass-by trip rates, (as determined through previous or current studies).\n17. Traffic should be apportioned to the proposed project in the following manner:\na. First, the projected level of service for the study area is forecast without the proposed project.\nb. Second, the projected level of service is forecast with the addition of the proposed project.\nThen the two forecasts are evaluated to determine whether the traffic projected to be generated by the proposed development will lower the projected\nLevels of Service (LOS) within the study area as described by the Clemmons Transportation Impact Analysis Procedure Manual.\n241 of 243\n12/15/2023, 10:15 AM\n"}, {"page": "242", "text": "Clemmons, NC Unified Development Code\nabout:blank\n18. When a traffic impact study projects that the intersection(s) or roadway(s) in the study area will be adequate then the following occurs:\nOnce a plan has met the level of service standard, and other recommendations identified in consultation or in the multi-agency meeting no further\napproval for traffic impact is to be recommended by the Village of Clemmons Planning Department except what is included in the procedure manual.\nHowever, it is possible that the NCDOT Division Engineer or the Winston-Salem Department of Transportation may still recommend additional\nanalyses and/or improvements.\n19. When a traffic impact study projects that the intersection(s) or roadway(s) in the study area will be inadequate then either of the following alternatives may\nbe considered by the City-County Planning:\na. The project is deferred or reduced in scope so that the level of service standard is not exceeded, or\nb. A mitigation plan is included in the requirements of the Procedure Manual and submitted for review by the Clemmons Planning Department, the Public\nWorks Department, NCDOT and the designated Village of the Clemmons traffic consultant. The mitigation plan together with the recommendations of\nthe departments are presented to the Planning Board and subsequently to the Village of Clemmons Council. The elected body has the authority to either\napprove or disapprove those projects solely under its jurisdiction.\nC. The improvements recommended in the mitigation plan are the sole responsibility of the developer to implement unless one hundred percent (100%) of\nconstruction costs for the projected improvements are in the subject budget year of the seven year Transportation Improvement Program or the local\nGovernment's Capital Improvements Program.\nd. The developer may agree to pay fees to fund the necessary improvements by written agreement with the Village of Clemmons, WSDOT and/or NCDOT.\n19A. If the existing level of service is inadequate (i.e., \"E\" or \"F\"), or the existing plus the background growth (not including the site) causes an inadequate level of\nservice, then the developer will be expected to mitigate only the traffic to be generated by the proposed project.\n19B. If the proposed development is of significant economic importance it may be recommended that the developer be granted an exception and/or waiver\nwhere improvements are scheduled or included in either the NCDOT TIP or locally approved Capital Improvements Program.\n20. A mitigation plan is shall be included as required by the Clemmons Transportation Analysis Procedure Manual:\na. As part of the traffic impact study, (the recommendation for which is identified by preliminary study results);\nb. Intended to identify specific causes of lowered levels of service (traffic impacts);\nC. Recommends improvements that will moderate the effects of projected traffic impacts;\nd. Recommends transportation demand management options.\nWhere legally allowed, examples of possible mitigation plan improvements may include, but are not limited to: construction of new roads, road\nimprovements, traffic signals, ridesharing programs, off-site parking facilities and para-transit, signal timing/phasing changes, channelization\nmodifications, changes in ingress/egress points, reducing the number of entrances, and/or lane widening.\n21. Mitigation Plan improvements may be phased and shall be sensitive to the following:\na. Timing of short-term and long-term network improvements that are already planned, scheduled and/or funded;\nb. Time schedules of adjacent developments;\nC. Size and timing of individual phases of development;\nd. Right-of-way needs and availability of additional right-of-way within appropriate time frames;\ne. Local priorities for transportation improvements and funding;\nf. Local priorities for transportation demand management strategies;\ng. Necessary lead time for additional design and construction;\nh. That the sum of improvements are proportional to the projected impact.\nAnalysis of traffic needs by development phase should provide the information needed to determine the appropriate sequence of improvements.\n22.

Individual users are virtually unaffected by the presence of others in the traffic stream. Freedom to select desired speeds and to maneuver\n242 of 243\n12/15/2023, 10:15 AM\n"}, {"page": "243", "text": "Clemmons, NC Unified Development Code\nabout:blank\nwithin the traffic stream is extremely high. The general level of comfort and convenience provided to the motorist, passenger, or pedestrian is excellent.\nTurning movements are easily made.\nLOS B Upper range of stable operation, but the presence of other users in the traffic stream begins to be noticeable. Freedom to select desired speeds is\nrelatively unaffected, but there is a slight decline in the freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream from LOS A. The level of comfort and convenience\nprovided is somewhat less than at LOS A, because the presence of others in the traffic stream begins to affect individual behavior.\nLOS C Mid range of stable flow, but is the beginning of the range of flow in which the operation of individual users becomes significantly affected by\ninteractions with others in the traffic stream, but not objectionably so. The selection of speed is now affected by the presence of others, and maneuvering\nwithin the traffic stream requires substantial vigilance on the part of the user. Back-ups may develop behind turning vehicles. The general level of comfort\nand convenience declines noticeably at this level.\nLOS D High density, but stable flow. Speed and freedom to maneuver are severely restricted, and the driver or pedestrian experiences a generally poor level of\ncomfort and convenience. Small increases in traffic flow will generally cause operational problems at this level. Delays to vehicles approaching signalized\nintersections may be substantial peak hours.\nLOS E Unacceptable, operations near capacity. All speeds are reduced to a low, but relatively uniform value. Freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream is\nextremely difficult, and it is generally accomplished by forcing a vehicle a vehicle or pedestrian to \"give way\" to accommodate such maneuvers. Comfort and\nconvenience levels are extremely poor, and driver or pedestrian frustration is generally high. Operations at this level are usually unstable, because small\nincreases in flow or minor perturbations within the traffic stream will cause breakdowns.\nLOS F Unacceptable, forced or breakdown flow, representing jammed conditions. The amount of traffic approaching an intersection cannot be accommodated\nadequately.\n(C-UDO-79, \u00a7 1, 8-27-18)\nGROWTH MANAGEMENT PLAN\nTRANSLATION FROM VISION 2005 TO LEGACY\n243 of 243\n12/15/2023, 10:15 AM\nCELL (1, 1): \nVision 2005\nGMA Numbers\nCELL (1, 2): \nVision 2005\nOld Names\nCELL (1, 3): \nLegacy\nNew Names\nCELL (1, 4): \nLegacy\nGMA Numbers\nCELL (2, 1): \nGMA 1\nCELL (2, 2): \nCentral Business District\nCELL (2, 3): \nCity/Town Centers\nCELL (2, 4): \nGMA 1\nCELL (3, 1): \nGMA 2\nCELL (3, 2): \nCentral Area\nCELL (3, 3): \nUrban Neighborhoods\nCELL (3, 4): \nGMA 2\nCELL (4, 1): \nGMA 3\nCELL (4, 2): \nUrban Area\nCELL (4, 3): \nSuburban Neighborhoods\nCELL (4, 4): \nGMA 3\nCELL (5, 1): \nGMA 4a (used without GMA 4b)\nCELL (5, 2): \nShort-Range Growth Area\nCELL (5, 3): \nSuburban Neighborhoods\nCELL (5, 4): \nGMA 3\nCELL (6, 1): \nGMA 4a (used with GMA 4b and/or\nhigher GMA numbers)\nCELL (6, 2): \nShort-Range Growth Area\nCELL (6, 3): \nFuture Growth Area\nCELL (6, 4): \nGMA 4\nCELL (7, 1): \nGMA 4b\nCELL (7, 2): \nLong-Range Growth Area\nCELL (7, 3): \nFuture Growth Area\nCELL (7, 4): \nGMA 4\nCELL (8, 1): \nGMA 5\nCELL (8, 2): \nRural Area\nCELL (8, 3): \nRural Area\nCELL (8, 4): \nGMA 5\nCELL (9, 1): \nGMA 6\nCELL (9, 2): \nConservation Area\nCELL (9, 3): \nRural Area\nCELL (9, 4): \nGMA 5\n"}], "town": "clemmons"}
