The governing board is not bound by the recommendations, if any, of the planning\nboard.\n1. Hearing with Published Notice. Before adopting, amending, or repealing any ordinance or\ndevelopment regulation authorized by this Chapter, the governing board shall hold a legislative\nhearing. A notice of the hearing shall be given once a week for two successive calendar weeks in a\nnewspaper having general circulation in the area. The notice shall be published the first time not\nless than 10 days nor more than 25 days before the date scheduled for the hearing.

The owners of affected parcels of land and the owners of all parcels of land\nabutting that parcel of land shall be mailed a notice of the hearing on a proposed zoning map\namendment by first-class mail at the last addresses listed for such owners on the county tax\nabstracts. For the purpose of this section, properties are \"abutting\" even if separated by a street,\nrailroad, or other transportation corridor. This notice must be deposited in the mail at least 10 but\nnot more than 25 days prior to the date of the hearing. If the zoning map amendment is being\nproposed in conjunction with an expansion of municipal extraterritorial planning and development\nregulation jurisdiction under G.S.160D-202, a single hearing on the zoning map amendment and\nthe boundary amendment may be held. In this instance, the initial notice of the zoning map\namendment hearing may be combined with the boundary hearing notice and the combined hearing\nnotice mailed at least 30 days prior to the hearing.\n3. Posted Notice. When a zoning map amendment is proposed, the local government shall\nprominently post a notice of the hearing on the site proposed for the amendment or on an adjacent\npublic street or highway right-of-way.

Plan Consistency. When adopting or rejecting any zoning/UDO text or map amendment, the\ngoverning board shall approve a brief statement describing whether its action is consistent or\ninconsistent with an adopted comprehensive plan. The requirement for a plan consistency\nstatement may also be met by a clear indication in the minutes of the governing board that at the\ntime of action on the amendment the governing board was aware of and considered the planning\nboard's recommendations and any relevant portions of an adopted comprehensive plan. If a zoning\nmap amendment is adopted and the action was deemed inconsistent with the adopted plan, the\nzoning amendment shall have the effect of also amending any future land-use map in the approved\nplan, and no additional request or application for a plan amendment shall be required. A plan\namendment and a zoning amendment may be considered concurrently. The plan consistency\nstatement is not subject to judicial review. If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a \"large-scale\nrezoning\" under G.S.160D-602(b), the governing board statement describing plan consistency may\naddress the overall rezoning and describe how the analysis and policies in the relevant adopted\nplans were considered in the action taken.\n7. Additional Reasonableness Statement for Rezonings. When adopting or rejecting any petition\nfor a zoning map amendment, a statement analyzing the reasonableness of the proposed rezoning\nshall be approved by the governing board. This statement of reasonableness may consider, among\nother factors, (i) the size, physical conditions, and other attributes of the area proposed to be\nrezoned, (ii) the benefits and detriments to the landowners, the neighbors, and the surrounding\ncommunity, (iii) the relationship between the current actual and permissible development on the\ntract and adjoining areas and the development that would be permissible under the proposed\namendment; (iv) why the action taken is in the public interest; and (v) any changed conditions\nwarranting the amendment. If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a \"large-scale rezoning\" under\nG.S.160D-602(b), the governing board statement on reasonableness may address the overall\nrezoning.\n8. Single Statement Permissible.-The statement of reasonableness and the plan consistency\nstatement required by this section may be approved as a single statement.\n9. Voting and Rehearings. A simple majority vote is required for adoption of an amendment to the\nZoning/UDO Ordinance. No such proposed change in the UDO or zoning map if denied by action\nof the Board of Aldermen may be resubmitted within a period of one (1) year from the date of\nsuch denial by the Board, unless the Board shall unanimously find that changing conditions in the\narea or new information concerning the property requested for rezoning warrant a resubmission\nfor change in the UDO or map. An application for a rehearing may be made in the same manner\nas provided for an original hearing. Evidence in support of the application shall initially be\nlimited to that which is necessary to enable the Board to determine whether there has been a\nsubstantial change in the facts, evidence, or conditions in the case. The application for rehearing\nshall be denied by the Board if from the record it finds that there has been no substantial change in\nfacts, evidence or conditions. If the Board finds that there has been a change, it shall thereupon\ntreat the request in the same manner as any other application.\nTown of Madison UDO\n13 Page\n"}, {"page": "14", "text": "ARTICLE 3 - LEGISLATIVE AND QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES\nSection 3.2 QUASI-JUSICIAL PROCEDURES.

The Board of Adjustment will hear and decide special use permits in\naccordance with principles, conditions, safeguards, and procedures specified in this ordinance.\nPermitting Special Uses adds flexibility to the UDO. Subject to high standards of planning and\ndesign, certain property uses are allowed in the several districts where these uses would not\notherwise be acceptable. By means of controls exercised through the Special Use Permit\nprocedures, property uses which would otherwise be undesirable in certain districts can be devel-\noped to minimize any bad effects they might have on surrounding properties. The Board of\nAdjustment shall follow quasi-judicial procedures in determining special use permits.\na. Application. The owner(s) or anyone with a possessory interest entitled to exclusive\npossession or anyone with a contractual interest soon to be a freehold interest in the\nproperty included in the petition for a Special Use Permit shall submit an application to the\nAdministrator least 60 days before the meeting of the Board of Adjustment at which it is to\nbe heard.\nb. Findings. The Board of Adjustment must find that all of these conditions exist along with\nspecific condition required for each use or the application will be denied.\ni. That the use or development is located, designed, and proposed to be operated SO as\nto maintain or promote the public health, safety, and general welfare;\nTown of Madison UDO\n15 Page\n"}, {"page": "16", "text": "ARTICLE LEGISLATIVE AND QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES\nii. That the use or development complies with all required regulations and standards\nof this ordinance and with all other applicable regulations;\niii. That the use or development is located, designed, and proposed to be operated SO as\nto maintain or enhance the value of contiguous property or that the use or\ndevelopment is a public necessity; and\niv. That the use or development conforms to the general plans for the land use and\ndevelopment of Town of Madison as embodied in this chapter and in the Town of\nMadison Development Guide.\nC.\nConditions. In granting the Special Use Permit, the board may designate additional\nconditions that will, in its opinion, assure that the use in its proposed location will be\nharmonious with the area in which it is proposed to be located, is within the spirit of this\nordinance and clearly in keeping with the public welfare. All such additional conditions\nshall be entered into the minutes of the meeting at which the Special Use Permit is granted,\non the Special Use Permit itself and on the approved plans. The Special Use Permit and\nany other specific conditions shall run with the land and shall be binding on the original\napplicants, their heirs, successors and assigns.\n2. VARIANCE. To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this\nordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions a literal\nenforcement of the provisions of this ordinance will result in undue hardship, and SO that the spirit\nof this ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done.\na. Application. The owner(s) or anyone with a possessory interest entitled to exclusive\npossession or anyone with a contractual interest soon to be a freehold interest in the\nproperty included in the petition for a Variance shall submit an application to the\nAdministrator least 60 days before the meeting of the Board of Adjustment at which it is to\nbe heard.\nb. Findings. When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of a\nUDO regulation, the Board of Adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of the UDO\nregulation upon a showing of all of the following.\ni. Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the regulation. It\nshall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no\nreasonable use can be made of the property.\nii. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as\nlocation, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as\nwell as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood\nor the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance. A variance may\nbe granted when necessary and appropriate to make a reasonable accommodation\nunder the Federal Fair Housing Act for a person with a disability.\niii. The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property\nowner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that\nmay justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created\nhardship.\niv. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the\nregulation, such that public safety is secured and substantial justice is achieved.\nC. Conditions. No change in permitted uses may be authorized by a variance. Appropriate\nconditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the conditions are reasonably\nTown of Madison UDO\n16 Page\n"}, {"page": "17", "text": "ARTICLE 3 - LEGISLATIVE AND QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES\nrelated to the variance.

The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of appeals\nor other matters referred to it, and given notice thereof to the parties in interest, and decide\nthe same within a reasonable time. The official whose decision or his or her successor if\nthe official is no longer employed, must appear as a witness to the appeal.\nC.\nStays. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless\nthe Building Inspector certifies to the Board after the notice of appeal shall have been filed\nwith him by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would in his opinion cause\nimminent peril to life or property, or because the violation charged is transitory in nature\nand a stay would interfere with enforcement of the ordinance. In such case, proceedings\nshall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the\nBoard or by a Court of Record on application, on notice to the Building Inspector and on\ndue cause shown.\nSECTION 3.3.

The failure to satisfy\nany of the terms and conditions SO imposed will result in a forfeiture of vested rights.\n3. Notwithstanding divisions (1) and (2) above, approval of a site-specific=vesting plan with the\ncondition that a variance be obtained shall not confer a zoning vested right unless and until the\nnecessary variance is obtained.\n4. A site-specific vesting plan shall be deemed approved upon the effective date of the approval\nauthority's action or ordinance relating thereto.\n5.\nThe establishment of a zoning vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning that\nimposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or\nordinances or regulations that are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to\nTown of Madison UDO\n17 Page\n"}, {"page": "18", "text": "ARTICLE LEGISLATIVE AND QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES\nland use regulation by the Town, including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical,\nand mechanical codes.

Such nonconformances are declared by\nthis ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts in which they are located.\nIt is further the intent of this UDO that nonconformances shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extend-\ned, or used as grounds for adding other structures, or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.\nSECTION 9.2. NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD\nA. Single Lots. In any district a permitted use may be constructed by right on any single lot made non-\nconforming by this UDO as long as approval is granted by the Building Inspections Department and the\nstructure and customary accessory buildings do not encroach into required front, rear and side yard\nsetbacks. If a proposed building on a nonconforming single lot is approved by the Building Inspections\nDepartment but would encroach into required setbacks, a variance shall be sought from the Board of\nAdjustment.\nB. Single Ownership Lot with Continuous Frontage. Wherever two or more nonconforming lots in\nsingle ownership with continuous frontage exist, permitted structures may be erected on each lot if all\nsetback requirements can be met. If all setbacks cannot be met, the lands involved shall be considered to\nbe an individual parcel for the purposes of this ordinance. No portion of the parcel shall be used or sold\nwhich does not meet the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance.\nC. Lots with Contiguous Frontage in Single Ownership. Where two or more adjoining\nnonconforming vacant lots that have contiguous frontage are held in one ownership, such lots must be\ncombined to create a single lot for the purposes of development. If said combination, however, results in\nthe creation of a single lot that is more than 1 1/2 times the minimum lot width or area required in the\nplanning area, then the lots may be combined into lots, which need only meet the planning district setback\nrequirements for the development purpose.\nA nonconforming lot may be developed if, at the effective date of this UDO, the subdivision in which the\nlot is located had received preliminary or final plat approval.\nSECTION 9.3. NONCONFORMING USES OF OPEN LAND\nThis category of nonconformances consists of lots used for storage yards, used car lots, auto wrecking,\njunk yards, golf driving ranges, and similar open uses where the only buildings on the lot are incidental\nand accessory to the open use of the lot and where such use of the land is not permitted to be established\nhereafter, under this ordinance, in the district in which it is located.\n1.

Intent. The watershed overlay districts are established to impose higher development standards on\nzoning districts that are upstream of and drain into drinking water supply than is generally imposed on\nland uses in those districts. The intent is to exclude certain activities and to maintain current development\npatterns in order to prevent the risks of pollution from more intense land uses. The watershed is divided\ninto two parts: a) the critical area which is an area half a mile upstream from the water intake and draining\ninto the Dan River; and b) the protected area which is the area 10 miles upstream and draining into the\nriver, minus the critical area. Because the risk of pollution is directly related to the proximity to the water\nsupply, development standards are higher in the critical area than in the protected area. Only new\ndevelopment activities that require an erosion/sedimentation control plan under State Law or approved\nlocal program are required to meet the provisions of this article when located in the WS-IV watershed.\nB. Statutory Authority and Jurisdiction. Pursuant to the authority given to municipalities in G.S.160D-\n926 and G.S. 143-214.5, Water Supply and Watershed Protection, the Madison Board of Aldermen does\nhereby ordain and enact into law this Article to protect the Drinking Supply Watershed of the Town of\nMadison.\nThe provisions of these regulations shall apply within the area designated as a Public Water Supply\nWatershed by the N.C. Environmental Management Commission and shall be defined and established on\nthe \"Madison Watershed Protection Map\" which is adopted simultaneously with this text and is a part of\nthese regulations.\nC. Exceptions to Regulations. Existing development, (See Section 2 Definitions) is not subject to these\nregulations. Expansions to structures classified as existing development must meet the requirements of\nthese regulations, however, the built-upon area of the existing development is not required to be included\nin the density calculations.\nA pre-existing lot owned by an individual before the effective date of these regulations, regardless of\nwhether or not a vested right has been established, may be developed for single family residential\npurposes without being subject to the restrictions of these regulations.\nD. Criminal Penalties. In addition to the penalties imposed by Article XVII, Section 8 of the Madison\nUDO, the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission may assess civil penalties in\naccordance with G.S. 143-215.6(a). Each day that the violation continues shall constitute a separate\nviolation.\nSECTION 10.2. DEFINITIONS\nThe following definitions apply specifically to the watershed overlay districts. The words contained in this\nArticle shall have the meaning assigned to them. Those terms not defined herein but defined in the Article\nIV of this UDO shall be given the meaning assigned to them in Article IV.

Built-upon areas shall include that portion of a development project\nthat is covered by impervious or partially impervious cover including buildings, pavement, gravel roads,\nrecreation facilities (e.g. tennis courts), etc. (Note: wooden slatted decks and the water area of a\nswimming pool are considered pervious.)\nCluster Development. The grouping of buildings in order to conserve land resources and provide for\ninnovation in the design of the project. This term includes non-residential development as well as single-\nfamily residential subdivisions and multi-family developments that do not involve the subdivision of land.\nCritical Area. The area adjacent to a water supply intake or reservoir where risk associated with\npollution is greater than from the remaining portions of the watershed. The critical area is defined as\nextending either one-half mile from the normal pool elevation of the reservoir in which the intake is\nlocated or to the ridge line of the watershed (whichever comes first); or one-half mile upstream from the\nintake located directly in the stream or river (run-of-the-river), or the ridge line of the watershed\n(whichever comes first). Local governments may extend the critical area as needed. Major landmarks\nsuch as highways or property lines may be used to delineate the outer boundary of the critical area if these\nlandmarks are immediately adjacent to the appropriate outer boundary of one-half mile.\nDevelopment. Any land disturbing activity which adds to or changes the amount of impervious or\npartially impervious cover on a land area or which otherwise decreases the infiltration of precipitation into\nthe soil.\nDischarging Landfill. A facility with liners, monitoring equipment and other measures to detect and/or\nprevent leachate from entering the environment and in which the leachate is treated on site and discharged\nto a receiving stream.\nExisting Development. Those projects that are built or those projects that at a minimum have established\na vested right under North Carolina zoning law as of the effective date of this ordinance based on at least\none of the following criteria: substantial expenditures of resource (time, labor, money) based on a good\nfaith reliance upon having received a valid local government approval to proceed with the project, or\nhaving an outstanding valid building permit as authorized by the General Statutes\nHazardous Material. Any substance listed as such in: SARA section 302, Extremely Hazardous\nSubstances, CERCLA Hazardous Substances, or Section 311 of CWA (oil and hazardous substances).\nIndustrial development.

Findings of Fact\n1. The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the Town of Madison are subject to periodic\ninundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of\ncommerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and\nrelief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and\ngeneral welfare.\n2. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing\nincreases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses\nvulnerable to floods or other hazards.\nC. Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote public health, safety, and\ngeneral welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas\nby provisions designed to:\n1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion\nhazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;\n2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected\nagainst flood damage at the time of initial construction;\n3.\nControl the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers,\nwhich are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;\n4.\nControl filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood\ndamage; and\n5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or\nwhich may increase flood hazards to other lands.\nD. Objectives.
