Part I contains common notice requirements at Section 4.3. An explanation of the\nlength of time before a permit expires is listed at Section 4.4. Section 4.5 explains\n\"permit choice\". Permit choice is a requirement of N.C. statute that applies to the City.\nPermit choice means that a permit applicant may choose the version of the UDO to\nfollow if the UDO is amended after a complete permit application is submitted but before\nit is approved.

Quasi-judicial means that the board hearing the\nmatter must follow some of the due-process requirements found in the N.C. courts. For\nexample, all witnesses must take an oath administered by the Chair; witnesses may be\ncross-examined; evidence and witnesses may be subpoenaed; the N.C.

Introduction and Purpose.\nDevelopment projects often occur in multiple phases over several years,\nrequiring a long-term commitment of public and private resources. Such\ndevelopments may create community impacts and opportunities that are\ndifficult to accommodate within traditional zoning processes. Because of their\nscale and duration, such projects require careful coordination of public capital\nfacilities planning, financing and construction schedules and phasing of the\nprivate development. Such large projects involve substantial commitment of\nprivate capital, which developers are usually unwilling to risk without sufficient\nassurances that development standards will remain stable through the\nextended period of the development. Such developments often permit the city\nand developers to experiment with different or non-traditional types of\ndevelopment standards and concepts while managing impacts on surrounding\nareas. To better structure and manage development approvals for such\ndevelopments and ensure their proper integration into local capital facilities\nprograms, the City needs flexibility to negotiate such developments. 30\nTherefore, the City may enter into development agreements subject to the\nrequirements of this section.\n4.13.2.

For\nexample, a large tract may be developed with a mix of single-family and multi-family housing, with\npart of the site also devoted to commercial and office uses. The PUD district allows for greater\nflexibility in dimensional standards (such as lot sizes and setbacks) upon approval of an overall\nmaster plan for the entire development. The district does not require a rigid separation of\ndifferent land uses. Uses are limited to the uses identified in the Table of Uses and Activities. All\nof the site-specific standards and conditions, including a site plan are incorporated into the zoning\ndistrict regulations for the PUD.

Signs obstruct\nviews, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other\nproblems that legitimately call for regulation. The purpose of this section is to\nregulate the size, color, illumination, movement, materials, location, height, and\ncondition of all signs placed on private property for exterior observation, thus\nensuring the protection of property values, the character of the various\nneighborhoods, the creation of a convenient, attractive, and harmonious\ncommunity, protection against destruction of or encroachment on historic\nconvenience to citizens, the promotion of traffic safety, to ensure that residents\nand visitors can locate desired services, goods and destinations, to avoid\nconflicts between advertising and public safety signage, to minimize any\ndetrimental effects of signs on adjacent properties and encouraging economic\ndevelopment. This article allows adequate communication through signage while\nencouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location, size, and purpose of all\nsigns. This article must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First\nAmendment guarantee of free speech.
