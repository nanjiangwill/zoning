This is\nachieved through managing location, design and operation of driveways, median openings, and\nstreet connections to a roadway. Additionally, access management involves the use of auxiliary\nlanes, such as turn lanes or bypass lanes, to remove turning vehicles from through-traffic\nmovement.\n1)\nTraffic Impact Study Required. A Traffic Impact Study (TIS) shall be prepared and\nsubmitted by the developer of projects when a TIS is recommended by the NC DOT\nDistrict Engineer or when required as part of a special use permit as necessary to protect\nthe functional integrity of the affected roads or highways. The traffic impact study shall\nbe prepared by a qualified transportation or traffic engineer or certified planner and shall\ninclude the following information:\na)\nExisting traffic conditions within the study area boundary, as determined by the\nNC DOT;\nb)\nTraffic volumes generated by the existing and proposed development on the\nproject area, including the morning peak, afternoon or evening peak, and average\nannual traffic levels;\nc)\nThe distribution of existing and proposed trips through the street network;\nd)\nAnalysis of capabilities of intersections and access points located within the study\narea boundary;\ne)\nRecommendations for improvements designed to mitigate traffic impacts of the\nproposed development and to enhance pedestrian access to the development from\nthe public right-of-way, and;\nf)\nOther pertinent information including but not limited to accidents, noise, and\nimpacts on air quality and other natural resources.\n2)\nLocation of Access Points.

No\ncommercial driveways or road rights-of-ways shall be placed within five-hundred (500)\nfeet of an I-40 interchange rights-of-way. When conflict exists between NC DOT policy\nand these regulations, the stricter of the two standards applies.\n4)\nOff-Site Traffic Improvements. Transition tapers and deceleration lanes shall be required\nfor all IOD development projects where a site access study requires or a recommendation\nfrom NC DOT indicates that such improvements are necessary. The costs of such\nimprovements shall be the responsibility of the owner or the developer of the property.\n5)\nShared Access. Mutual shared access agreements shall be required between adjacent\nproperty owners with frontage on existing or proposed arterials and major collectors\nwhen site plans are submitted concurrently. When access is to be shared, easements,\nliability arrangements, and a maintenance agreement must be submitted to the local\ngovernment prior to occupancy.

Channelization, or the separation of conflicting traffic movements into\nwell-defined paths of travel by traffic islands or significant pavement markings, shall be\nconsidered when a site access study is required. All Planned Unit Developments, group\ncommercial projects, and group industrial projects shall provide for the installation of a\nmedian-type entranceway when located on proposed or existing arterials and major\ncollectors.\n8)\nSignalization. Signalizations may be installed only after all other traffic improvements\nhave been explored. Although traffic signals may reduce the frequency of turning\nconflicts, signals significantly disrupt efficient traffic flow.\n9)\nStreet Design.\n-46-\n"}, {"page": "47", "text": "a)\nAll streets shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to NC DOT road\nstandards.

Typical plantings must include a minimum of fourteen (14) shade trees per 1,000\nlinear feet which are at least eight (8) feet tall at planting and will be a minimum of\ntwenty (20) feet tall at maturation.\nJ.\nBuffers. The use of buffers and screening in the design of developments in the IOD is required\nto\nenhance the natural beauty by creating the appearance that manmade development is situated\nwithin a natural setting. Additionally, these requirements are designed to reduce the impact of\ndevelopment on neighboring uses and residential communities existing and developed within the\nIOD. As such, development should occur in a manner that maintains and enhances the pre-\nexisting, surrounding natural landscape and appearance along the corridor. The following\nbuffers are required in addition to those in Article XII of this Ordinance.

The conditional zoning district included herein allows for the consideration of certain uses\nthat, because of their nature or scale, have particular impacts on both the immediate area and the\ncommunity as a whole and are created or established for selected criteria as indicated in the applicability\nsection below. The development of these uses cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district\nregulations. In addition, circumstances arise when a general zoning district designation would not be\nappropriate for certain property, but specific uses permitted under the district would be consistent with\nthe objectives of this section. To accommodate those situations, this section establishes the conditional\nzoning district process. A conditional zoning district is not intended for securing speculative zoning for a\nproposal but rather is based on a firm development proposal.\nB.\nApplicability. Conditional zoning districts may be appropriate when a planned unit development\n(PUD) is proposed.\n49\n"}, {"page": "50", "text": "C.\nApplication.

North Carolina\nGeneral Statutes governing the regulation of Wireless Telecommunication Facilities, \u00a7160D, Article 19,\nPart 3E., provide for the safe and efficient integration of facilities necessary for the provision of\nadvanced wireless telecommunications services throughout the community and to ensure the ready\navailability of reliable wireless services to the public, government agencies and first responders, with the\nintention of furthering the public safety and general welfare.\nState Statute SB 831 established certain requirements and limitations regarding applications for Cellular\ntowers and Wireless Facilities and established certain procedures that are currently in effect and require\nthat the Town change its regulations to comport with the new state law. The Town of Hildebran thus\nfinds it necessary to revise its regulations regarding the permitting of towers and Wireless\nTelecommunication Facilities to comply with SB 831 and to reflect changes in wireless technology, the\nuse of wireless communications, the trend and need to locate wireless facilities in residential\nneighborhoods and to strike a balance between the industry's technical needs and desires and the public\nwelfare, safety, interest and benefit.\nThe Town of Hildebran finds that Wireless Telecommunications Facilities may pose significant\nconcerns to the health, safety, public welfare, character and environment of the Town and its inhabitants.\nThe Town also recognizes that facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be an\neconomic development asset to the Town and of significant benefit to the Town and its residents. In\norder to assure that the placement, construction or modification of Wireless Telecommunications\nFacilities is consistent with the Town's land use policies, the Town is adopting a single, comprehensive,\nWireless Telecommunications Facilities application and permitting process. The intent of this ordinance\nis to minimize the physical impact of Wireless Telecommunications Facilities on the community, protect\nthe character of the community to the extent reasonably possible, establish a fair and efficient process\nfor review and approval of applications, assure an integrated, comprehensive review of environmental\nimpacts of such facilities, address the economic development needs of the Town and its residents and\nprotect the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Town of Hildebran.\nSection 14.2 Severability.\nA.\nIf any word, phrase, sentence, part, section, subsection, or other portion of this ordinance or any\napplication thereof to any person or circumstance is declared void, unconstitutional, or invalid\nfor any reason, then such word, phrase, sentence, part, section, subsection, or other portion, or\nthe proscribed application thereof, shall be severable, and the remaining provisions of this\nordinance, and all applications thereof, not having been declared void, unconstitutional, or\ninvalid, shall remain in full force and effect.\nB.\nAny Special Use issued with Town Council approval issued pursuant to this Ordinance shall\nbe\ncomprehensive and not severable.
