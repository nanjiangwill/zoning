Merely proving that the variance would\npermit a greater profit to be made from the property will not be considered adequate to justify the Board\nin granting a variance. Moreover, the Board shall consider whether the variance is the minimum possible\ndeviation from the terms of the subchapter that will make possible the reasonable use of his or her\nproperty.\n2.\nThe hardship results from the application of this subchapter to the property rather\nthan from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship.\n3. The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such as its\nsize, shape or topography, which is different from that of neighboring property.\n4. The hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or\nunknowingly violates this subchapter or who purchases the property after the effective date of this\nsubchapter and then comes to the Board for relief.\n5. The hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property, rather than the result of\nconditions that are widespread. If other properties are equally subject to the hardship created in the\nrestriction, then granting a variance would be a special privilege denied to others and would not promote\nequal justice.\n(b) That the variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter and\npreserves its spirit; and\n(c) That in the granting the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured and\nsubstantial justice has been done. The Board shall not grant a variance if it finds that doing SO would in\nany respect impair the public health, safety or general welfare.\n2016 S-5\n"}, {"page": "566", "text": "222Z\nHaw River - Land Usage\n(3) Conditions to granting a minor variance.

The Watershed Review Board may refuse to hear\nan appeal or an application for a variance previously denied if it finds that there have been no substantial\nchanges in conditions or circumstances bearing on the appeal or application.\n(5) Watershed protection permit. A variance issued in accordance with this subchapter shall\nbe considered a watershed protection permit and shall expire if a building permit or watershed occupancy\npermit for such use is not obtained by the applicant within six months from the date of the decision.\n(D) If an application calls for the granting of a major variance and if the Board of Adjustment\ndecides in favor of granting the variance, the Board shall prepare a preliminary record of the hearing\nwith all deliberate speed, to include the following:\n(E) The preliminary record shall be sent to the N.C.
