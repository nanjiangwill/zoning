For example, a\nswimming pool/tennis court complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a\nresidential subdivision or multi-family development and would be regarded as accessory to\nsuch principal uses, even though such facilities, if developed apart from a residential\ndevelopment, would require a special-use permit.\nhtps://siler.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=null\nPage 114 of 488\n"}, {"page": "115", "text": "Print Preview\n3/1/24, 4:02 PM\n(b) For purposes of interpreting Subsection (a):\n(1) A use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial\nin and of itself or in relation to the principal use,\n(2) To be \"commonly associated\" with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory\nuse to be connected with such principal use more times than not, but only that the\nassociation of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient\nfrequency that there is common acceptance of their relatedness.\n(c) Without limiting the generality of Subsections (a) and (b) the following activities, so long as\nthey satisfy the general criteria set forth above, are specifically regarded as accessory to\nresidential principal uses:\n(1) Offices or studios within an enclosed building and used by an occupant of a residence\nlocated on the same lot as such building to carry on administrative or artistic activities\nof a commercial nature, so long as such activities do not fall within the definition of a\nhome occupation\n(2) Hobbies or recreational activities of a noncommercial nature.\n(3) The renting out of one or two rooms within a single-family residence (which one or\ntwo rooms do not themselves constitute a separate dwelling unit) to not more than\ntwo persons who are not part of the family that resides in the single-family dwelling.\n(4) Yard sales or garage sales, so long as such sales are not conducted inconsistent with\n\"Section 23-27. - Regulations.\" of the Town of Siler City Code of Ordinances.\n(5) Temporary health care structures.

The General Assembly finds it is the public policy of this State to\nprovide persons with disabilities with the opportunity to live in a normal residential\nenvironment.\n(1) As used in this section:\na. \"Family care home\" means a home with support and supervisory personnel\nthat provides room and board, personal care and habilitation services in a\nfamily environment for not more than six (6) resident persons with disabilities.\nb. \"Person with disabilities\" means a person with a temporary or permanent\nphysical, emotional, or mental disability including but not limited to mental\nretardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, hearing and sight impairments,\nemotional disturbances and orthopedic impairments but not including mentally\nill persons who are dangerous to others as defined in G.S. 122C-3(11)b.\n(2) A family care home shall be deemed a residential use of property for zoning purposes\nand shall be a permissible use in all residential districts. The Town may not require\nthat a family care home, its owner, or operator obtain, because of the use, a special\nuse permit, or variance from any such zoning regulation. A family care home shall be\ndeemed a residential use of property for the purposes of determining charges or\nassessments imposed by the Town or businesses for water, sewer, power, telephone\nservice, cable television, garbage and trash collection, repairs or improvements to\nroads, streets, and sidewalks, and other services, utilities, and improvements.\n(b) Manufactured Homes\nhttps://siler.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=null\nPage 131 of 488\n"}, {"page": "132", "text": "Print Preview\n3/1/24, 4:02 PM\n(1) Per 160D-910\na. The General Assembly finds that manufactured housing offers affordable\nhousing opportunities for low- and moderate-income residents of this State\nwho could not otherwise afford to own their own home. The General Assembly\nfurther finds that some Towns have adopted zoning regulations that severely\nrestrict the placement of manufactured homes. It is the intent of the General\nAssembly in enacting this section that Towns reexamine their land use\npractices to assure compliance with applicable statutes and case law, and\nconsider allocating more residential land area for manufactured homes based\nupon local housing needs.\nb. For purposes of this section, the term \"manufactured home\" is defined as\nprovided in G.S. 143-145(7).\nC. The Town may not adopt or enforce zoning regulations or other provisions that\nhave the effect of excluding manufactured homes from the entire zoning\njurisdiction or that exclude manufactured homes based on the age of the\nhome.\nd. The Town may adopt and enforce appearance and dimensional criteria for\nmanufactured homes. Such criteria shall be designed to protect property\nvalues, to preserve the character and integrity of the community or individual\nneighborhoods within the community, and to promote the health, safety and\nwelfare of area residents. The criteria shall be adopted by ordinance.\ne.\nIn accordance with the Town's comprehensive plan and based on local\nhousing needs, the Town may designate a manufactured home overlay district\nwithin a residential district. Such overlay district may not consist of an\nindividual lot or scattered lots, but shall consist of a defined area within which\nadditional requirements or standards are placed upon manufactured homes.\nf. Nothing in this section shall be construed to preempt or supersede valid\nrestrictive covenants running with the land. The terms \"mobile home\" and\n\"trailer\" in any valid restrictive covenants running with the land shall include the\nterm \"manufactured home\" as defined in this section.\n(2) The Town of Siler City Manufactured Home Park Ordinance is set forth as Appendix I\nto this Ordinance.\na. All future manufactured home park communities shall have a minimum lot size\nof six thousand (6,000) square feet for each lot and a maximum density of\nseven (7) units per acre. House numbers shall be posted on each unit.\nb. All manufactured homes located on existing non-conforming lots shall be\ngrandfathered. If a grandfathered manufactured home park is sold by the\nexisting owner, the park will remain grandfathered.\nhttps://siler.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=null\nPage 132 of 488\n"}, {"page": "133", "text": "Print Preview\n3/1/24, 4:02 PM\n(3) All manufactured homes shall satisfy each of the following additional criteria:\na.

Manufactured home skirting shall be installed under every home:\n1. Material shall be durable, weather resistant, continuous, unpierced\n(except for required ventilation and access);\n2.

The former\nsituation may lead to traffic congestion of parking violations in adjacent streets as well as\nunauthorized parking in nearby private lots. The latter situation wastes money as well as\nspace that could more desirably be used for valuable development or environmentally useful\nopen space. Therefore, as suggested in $278 the permit-issuing authority may permit\ndeviations from the presumptive requirements of $279 and may require more parking or allow\nless parking whenever its finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set\nforth in $279.\n(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the permit-issuing authority may allow\ndeviations from the parking requirements set forth in $279 when it finds that:\n(1) A residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly;\n(2) A business is primarily oriented to walk-in trade.\n(c) Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive\nparking requirements set forth in $279, it shall enter on the face of the permit the parking\nrequirement that it imposes reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation.\n(d) If the permit-issuing authority concludes, based upon information it receives in the\nconsideration of a specific development proposal, that the presumption established by $279\nfor a particular use classification is erroneous, it shall initiate a request for an amendment to\nthe Table of Parking Requirements in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article XX.\n281 Parking Space Dimensions\n(a) Subject to $281(b and $281(c), each parking space shall contain a rectangular area at least\nnineteen (19) feet long and nine (9) feet wide.

Height: 20-40 feet; Spread: 8-16 feet. The River Birch is a native\ntree which usually grows along stream banks. In landscape design, it is adaptable to either\nhigh or low locations. This tree has an interesting papery bark and a graceful branching habit.\nIt has no special pest or maintenance problems.\n(b) American Hornbeam, Ironwood (Carpinus carolina). Height: 20-30 feet; Spread: 15-20 feet.\nThis native tree has a natural yet refined appearance. It is slow growing, but at maturity it\nserves as an excellent shade tree. Its fluted muscular trunk is an interesting feature. In the\nwild, the American Hornbeam is common in moist rich soil, yet, when used in landscape\ndesign, it is soil tolerant and does not require an unusual amount of water. It has no pests\nand no special maintenance problems.\nAmended August 17, 2015 & November 21, 2016\nE-12 Large Trees For Evergreen Screening\nThe following trees are ideal for screening large scale areas such as shopping centers and industrial\nsites. They are also effective in combination with other smaller screening plants. Both are moderate\nto fast growers. They are not considered to be shade trees.\n(a) Deodar Cedar (Cedrus deodara). Height: 40-150 feet; Spread: 30 feet +. The Deodar Cedar\nis a useful and attractive evergreen. It should be allowed plenty of room in order to assume\nits beautiful natural form. Its pendulous branches should be allowed to touch the ground. It\nprefers relatively dry soils, grows rapidly, and is easy to maintain. \"True Cedars\" such as the\nDeodar are not native to North America, but they have become quite popular in the South as\na landscape tree.\n(b) Southern Magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora). Height: 40-60 feet; Spread: 25 feet +. Magnolias\nare striking trees which serve well as screens when their branches are allowed to grow to the\nground. Generally this tree does well in town conditions, but it should be planted in quite rich\nacidic soils. Furthermore, magnolias require ample space for growth. If planted in full\nsunlight, they will grow rapidly. Because it drops large waxy leaves, seed pods, and flowers,\nthe magnolia may present a litter problem.\nAmended August 17, 2015\nE-13 Large Trees For Shading\nThe following trees may be used for screening, but they are recommended especially for shading\nstreets and parking lots. Unless otherwise noted, they will grow rapidly.

Height: 40-50 feet; Spread: 25 feet +. This tree is an example of a\nmaple which is not recommended where there will be high concentrations of air pollution.\nHowever, with its excellent shading characteristics and beautiful colors, it should not be\nignored. This tree grows rapidly, but, unlike the Norway Maple, it does not become brittle with\nage. The Red Maple is a native tree which is usually found in moist, even swampy areas, but\nit adapts well to a variety of situations. Although subject to maple insects and diseases, it is\nusually a long-lived tree. Limit planting to parks, residential areas, or areas not surrounded by\npavement.\n(b) Honeylocust (Gleditisia triacanthos). Height: 50-75 feet; Spread: 25 feet +, Its open,\nspreading form and feathery leaves may give the Honeylocust a frail appearance, but it is in\nfact a quite sturdy tree, notable for its resistance to storm damage. It is a native tree which is\ndrought resistant and adaptable to town conditions. Grass and shrubs thrive beneath a\nHoneylocust because it casts light shade. This tree is especially useful for its ability to be\ntransplanted at a relatively advanced age. Accordingly, it may be used for immediate effect in\na landscape design. The Honeylocust has its pests and diseases, but it is fairly hardy.\nThornless and fruitless varieties such as \"Moraine\" are recommended.\nAmended August 17, 2015\nE-14 Small Shrubs For Evergreen Screening\nThe following shrubs are recommended for informal (unclipped) hedges or screens. Each species\ngrows to a height of less than six (6) feet; therefore, these shrubs are appropriate for semi-opaque\nscreens.\n(a) Glossy Abelia (Abelia grandiflora). Height: 4-6 feet; Spread: 3-5 feet. Abelia is quite common\nin local nurseries and tends to be less expensive than other shrubs on this list. it bears pale\npink flowers throughout summer. Although it has proven quite popular for informal hedges, it\nhas several drawbacks. Abelia should be pruned and thinned to maintain its best form. It may\ndrop its leaves due to low temperatures, lack of pruning, or starvation.\n(b)\nCarissa Holly (llex cornuta). Height: 3-4 feet; Spread: 4-6 feet. Carissa holly is a compact,\ndense evergreen shrub with small, glossy, dark green leaves, each with a single terminal\nspine. The somewhat-showy clusters of fragrant, springtime, white flowers are followed in fall\nand winter by bright red berries. However, the berry display is mostly inferior to llex cornuta\n'Burfordii'. The shrub stays small, eventually growing to about 8 feet. Most carissa holly\nplants are kept smaller than this. The plant occasionally reverts back to a 'Rotunda' holly leaf\nform, a plant to which it is closely related. 'Rotunda' has many spines along the margins of\nthe leaf.\nAmended August 17, 2015\nE-15 Large Shrubs For Evergreen Screening\nThe following shrubs are recommended for high hedges or screens.

Height: 8-10 feet; Spread: 10-12 feet. Bright yellow\nflowers in spring; autumn color is green with a tinge of purple (mild interest only). Full sun;\nwell-drained soils; tolerates alkaline soil and air pollution. Irregular, due to a mix of upright\nand arching stems.\n(b) Winter Honeysuckle (Lonicera fragrantissima). Height 6-10 feet; Spread: 6-10 feet. Easily\ngrown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soil in full sun to part shade. Adapts to wide\nrange of soils, including dry ones, but prefers moist, loamy soils. Prune to shape after\nflowering. Winter honeysuckle is a somewhat stiff-branched, deciduous shrub with a bushy,\nspreading habit. Extremely fragrant (lemony), short-tubed, creamy white flowers appear in\nearly spring before the leaves emerge. Flowers are followed by small, somewhat\ninconspicuous, red berries which mature in late spring to early summer. Oval, dark green\nfoliage sometimes has bluish tinge. Flowers are a harbinger of spring. Budded branches may\nbe cut for an early, fragrant, indoor arrangement. No serious insect or disease problems.\nSome susceptibility to leaf spot, blight and powdery mildew. Potential insect pests include\naphids, scale, sawfly, whitefly, loopers, plant hoppers, flea beetles and webworm.

In order to determine that\nthere are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, the Board\nmust find that the five following conditions exist:\ni. If he complies with the provisions of the Ordinance, the\napplicant can secure no reasonable return from, nor make\nreasonable use of, his property. Merely proving that the\nvariance would permit a greater profit to be made from the\nproperty will no be considered adequate to justify the Board in\ngranting a variance. Moreover, the Board shall consider\nwhether the variance is the minimum possible deviation from\nthe terms of the Ordinance that will make possible the\nreasonable use of his property.\nii. The hardship results from the application of the Ordinance to\nthe property rather that from other factors such as deed\nrestrictions or other hardship.\niii. The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's\nproperty, such as its size, shape, or topography, which is\ndifferent from that of neighboring property.\niv. The hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who\nknowingly or unknowingly violates the Ordinance, or who\npurchases the property after the effective date of the\nOrdinance, and then comes to the Board for relief.\nV. The hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property, rather that\nthe result of conditions that are widespread. If other properties\nare equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction,\nthen granting a variance would be a special privilege denied to\nothers and would not promote equal justice.\n2. The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the\nOrdinance and preserves its spirit.\n3. In the granting of the variance, the public safety and welfare have been\nassured and substantial justice has been done. The Board shall not\ngrant a variance if it finds that doing so would in any respect impair the\npublic health, safety, or general welfare.\nC. In granting the variance, the Board may attach thereto such conditions\nregarding the location, character, and other features of the proposed building,\nstructure, or use as it may deem advisable in furtherance of the purpose of this\nordinance. If a variance for the construction, alteration or use of property is\ngranted, such construction, alteration or use shall be in accordance with the\napproved site plan.\nhttps://siler.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=null\nPage 389 of 488\n"}, {"page": "390", "text": "Print Preview\n3/1/24, 4:02 PM\nd.

For the purposes of this section, a permit is issued\neither in the ordinary course of business of the applicable governmental agency or by\nthe applicable governmental agency as a court directive.\n(2) Except where a longer vesting period is provided by statute or land development\nregulation, the statutory vesting granted by this section, once established, expires for\nan uncompleted development project if development work is intentionally and\nvoluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than 24 consecutive months, and the\nstatutory vesting period granted by this section for a nonconforming use of property\nexpires if the use is intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period of not less\nthan 24 consecutive months. The 24-month discontinuance period is automatically\ntolled during the pendency of any board of adjustment proceeding or civil action in a\nState or federal trial or appellate court regarding the validity of a development permit,\nthe use of the property, or the existence of the statutory vesting period granted by this\nsection. The 24-month discontinuance period is also tolled during the pendency of\nany litigation involving the development project or property that is the subject of the\nvesting.\n(e) Multiple Permits for Development Project. Subject to subsection (d) of this section, where\nmultiple local development permits are required to complete a development project, the\ndevelopment permit applicant may choose the version of each of the local land development\nregulations applicable to the project upon submittal of the application for the initial\ndevelopment permit. This provision is applicable only for those subsequent development\npermit applications Page 8 Session Law 2020-25 Senate Bill 720 filed within 18 months of\nthe date following the approval of an initial permit. For purposes of the vesting protections of\nthis subsection, an erosion and sedimentation control permit or a sign permit is not an initial\ndevelopment permit.\n(f) Multi-Phased Development. A multi-phased development is vested for the entire\ndevelopment with the land development regulations then in place at the time a site plan\napproval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased development. A right which has\nbeen vested as provided for in this subsection remains vested for a period of seven (7) years\nfrom the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased\ndevelopment.\n(g) Continuing Review.

A site-specific vesting plan consists of a plan submitted to the\nTown in which the applicant requests vesting pursuant to this section, describing with\nreasonable certainty on the plan the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels\nof property. The plan may be in the form of, but not be limited to, any of the following plans or\napprovals: a planned unit development plan, a subdivision plat, a preliminary or general\ndevelopment plan, a special use permit, a conditional district zoning plan, or any other land-\nuse approval designation as may be utilized by the Town. Unless otherwise expressly\nprovided by the Town, the plan shall include the approximate boundaries of the site;\nsignificant topographical and other natural features affecting development of the site; the\napproximate location on the site of the proposed buildings, structures, and other\nimprovements; the approximate dimensions, including height, of the proposed buildings and\nother structures; and the approximate location of all existing and proposed infrastructure on\nthe site, including water, sewer, roads, and pedestrian walkways. What constitutes a site-\nspecific vesting plan under this section that would trigger a vested right shall be finally\ndetermined by the Town pursuant to a development regulation, and the document that\ntriggers the vesting shall be so identified at the time of its approval. A variance does not\nconstitute a site-specific vesting plan, and approval of a site-specific vesting plan with the\ncondition that a variance be obtained does not confer a vested right unless and until the\nnecessary variance is obtained. If a sketch plan or other document fails to describe with\nreasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property,\nit may not constitute a site-specific vesting plan.\n(b) Establishment of Vested Right. A vested right is established with respect to any property\nupon the valid approval, or conditional approval, of a site-specific vesting plan as provided in\nthis section. Such a vested right confers upon the landowner the right to undertake and\ncomplete the development and use of the property under the terms and conditions of the site-\nspecific vesting plan, including any amendments thereto.\nhttps://siler.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=null\nPage 409 of 488\n"}, {"page": "410", "text": "Print Preview\n3/1/24, 4:02 PM\n(c) Approval and Amendment of Plans.\n(1) If a site-specific vesting plan is based on an approval required by a local development\nregulation, the Town shall provide whatever notice and hearing is required for that\nunderlying approval. A duration of the underlying approval that is less than two (2)\nyears does not affect the duration of the site-specific vesting plan established under\nthis section. If the site-specific vesting plan is not based on such an approval, a\nlegislative hearing with notice as required by G.S. 160D-602 shall be held. The Town\nmay approve a site-specific vesting plan upon any terms and conditions that may\nreasonably be necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Conditional\napproval results in a vested right, although failure to abide by the terms and\nconditions of the approval will result in a forfeiture of vested rights.\n(2) The Town shall not require a landowner to waive the landowner's vested rights as a\ncondition of developmental approval. A site-specific vesting plan is deemed approved\nupon the effective date of the Town's decision approving the plan or another date\ndetermined by the governing board upon approval. An approved site-specific vesting\nplan and its conditions may be amended with the approval of the owner and the Town\nas follows: any substantial modification must be reviewed and approved in the same\nmanner as the original approval; minor modifications may be approved by staff, if\nsuch are defined and authorized by local regulation.\n(d) Continuing Review. Following approval or conditional approval of a site-specific vesting\nplan, the Town may make subsequent reviews and require subsequent approvals by the\nTown to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval, provided\nthat these reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original approval. The Town\nmay, pursuant to G.S. 160D-403(f), revoke the original approval for failure to comply with\napplicable terms and conditions of the original approval or the applicable local development\nregulations.\nhttps://siler.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=null\nPage 410 of 488\n"}, {"page": "411", "text": "Print Preview\n3/1/24, 4:02 PM\n(e) Duration and Termination of Vested Right.\n(1) A vested right for a site-specific vesting plan remains vested for a period of two (2)\nyears.

Public policy makers, citizens, and developers all have a stake\nin understanding and responding to additional demands on the transportation system. A traffic\nimpact analysis (TIA) is a tool used to evaluate the incremental impacts that development,\nredevelopment and/or change or development use may have on the surrounding transportation\nsystem which helps local decision makers evaluate whether a development is appropriate for a site,\nor identify certain mitigation measures that are necessary to maintain safety and integrity of the\ntransportation network.\nL-2 Responsibility For TIA\nAfter a completed development application (zoning permit, rezoning, etc.) has been filed, and upon\ninitial submittal of a site or sketch plan, the Town of Siler City (Town) Planning Director or his/her\ndesignee shall determine the need for a TIA. Types of development applications could include, but\nare not limited to, multifamily residential, single family residential, commercial, or industrial. If\nwarranted, the transportation consultant assigned by the Town shall prepare the TIA. At the\ndiscretion of the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) and the Town, a\nTransportation Technical Memorandum (TTM), in lieu of a full TIA report, may be allowed for some\ndevelopments. If proposed street connections are not consistent with adopted plans, Town policies,\nor professional standards, then an explanation or proposed transportation mitigation alternative that\nis equal or better should be discussed in the study. The NCDOT and the Town will be responsible for\ndetermining whether the alternative mitigation plan meets and/or exceeds the performance\nstandards of the proposed street connections in the adopted plans and policies. The TIA review\nschedule will be determined as agreed to on the Town's TIA scoping requirements, generally based\non the number of study intersections.\nL-3 Minimum Thresholds For TIAS\nhttps://siler.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=development&name=null\nPage 452 of 488\n"}, {"page": "453", "text": "Print Preview\n3/1/24, 4:02 PM\nA TIA will be required to accompany a development plan when expected gross trip generation is\n1000 total trips or more both entering and exiting the site in a 24-hour period, and/or 100 total trips\nboth entering and exiting the site during either the AM or PM peak (prior to any trip reductions\nare\napplied)- see L-8(h) below.

In the event that a site\ndoes not generate 1000 total trips both entering and exiting a site in a 24 hour period, and/or 100\ntotal trips both entering and exiting the site during the AM or PM peak, a TIA may still be required for\nany site or sketch plan if the subject development reduces an intersection's level-of-service (LOS),\nand/or poses a potential safety challenge to the public or as otherwise set forth herein.

Local\ntrip generation rates may be acceptable if appropriate validation is provided by the applicant\nto support them. Any deviation from the ITE trip generation rates shall be discussed in the\nmandatory scoping meeting and documented in the MOU if approved by the Town and\nNCDOT. The NCDOT Municipal School Transportation Assistance (MSTA) calculator shall\nbe used to calculate trip generations for school sites.\n(1) Internal Capture - Base trip generation may be reduced by rate of internal capture\nwhen two or more land uses are proposed using methodology recommended in the\nmost current Trip Generation Handbook published by the ITE, or research published\nby the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Transportation\nResearch Board. Reductions for internal capture shall be applied to multi- or mixed-\nuse sites only, and reductions greater than 10% in any peak hour require consultation\nand acceptance by the Town and NCDOT. The internal capture reduction shall be\napplied before pass-by trips are calculated.\n(2) Pass-by Trips - Pass-by trips are those made as intermediate trips between an origin\nand primary destination (i.e., home to work, home to shopping, etc.). However, pass-\nby trips are not diverted from another roadway. Base trip generation may be reduced\nby rate of pass-by capture using methodology recommended in the most current Trip\nGeneration Handbook published by the ITE. Pass-by trips associated with the\ndevelopment program may not exceed 10% of the existing peak-hour volume\nreported for the adjacent public street network. This network shall include the streets\nthat provide primary access to/from the site. For example, a site access drive that\nconnects to a low-volume local street, which its primary access is to a major collector\nroad, the traffic on the major collector shall be used as the adjacent street for pass-by\ncalculation purposes. Evaluation of diverted trips may apply depending on the specific\nof each site. A trip generation table shall summarize all trip generation calculations for\nthe project.\n(k) Trip Distribution - External trip distribution shall be determined on a project-by-project basis\nusing one of several sources of information available to transportation and land planning\nprofessionals. Potential sources for determining project trip distribution may include the\nregional travel demand model, market analysis, existing traffic patterns, or professional\njudgment. At the Town's direction, multiple trip distributions may be required for differing land\nuse types. Regardless of methodology, the procedures followed and logic for estimating trip\ndistribution percentages must be well-documented in the TIA.

Existing\nsignalized intersections shall be modeled based on existing signal timing plans\nprovided by either the Town or NCDOT. Existing signal timing plans shall be included\nin the appendix of the TIA report. If a traffic signal is part of a coordinated system, it\nmust be analyzed as such under all conditions. Other standard practices and default\ninput values for evaluating signalized intersections shall be consistent with the most\nrecent guidelines published by the NCDOT, Traffic Engineering and Safety Systems\nBranch, Congestion Management Unit (\"Capacity Analyses Guidelines\"). The Town\nmay also require safety, traffic simulation, gap and/or other analyses appropriate for\nevaluating a development application. Additional analyses and/or traffic capacity or\nsimulation tools (such as VISSIM) required for the TIA shall be identified during the\nscoping meeting. Capacity calculations shall be included for the existing and all future\nyear scenarios, as described in L-8(i).

Recommendations for left and right turn lanes serving the\nsite shall be designed to both account for the NCDOT warrants described above and to meet\nfuture year capacity needs identified through the capacity analyses in the TIA report. For\nprojects that include drive-through facilities, pick-up/drop-off areas, or entrance gates, a\nqueuing analysis may be required by the Town to ensure that vehicle stacking will not\nadversely impact the public transportation system.
