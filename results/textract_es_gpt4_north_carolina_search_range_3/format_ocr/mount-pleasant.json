APPLICATION PROCESS\nThe specific procedures followed in reviewing various Applications for Development Approval may vary. Generally,\nthe procedures for all applications have four common elements: (1) submittal of a complete application, including\nrequired fee payment and appropriate information; (2) review of the submittal by appropriate staff and boards; (3)\naction to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application; and (4) issuance of a permit, based on complete\nand approved plans.\n3.1.3.1. Pre-Application Conference\nThe applicant shall meet with the Administrator to discuss the nature of the proposed application, application submittal\nrequirements, the procedure for action, and the standards for evaluation of the application.\n3.1.3.2. Application Materials\nCurrent application materials shall be made available at the Town Hall. Such applications shall be filed in advance of\nany public hearing or pubic meeting required pursuant to this Ordinance or the NCGS. The Administrator may\nestablish a schedule to file any application. The schedule shall provide adequate time for notice and/or publication\nconsistent with this Ordinance.\n3.1.4. RECORDS\nThe Administrator shall provide for minutes to be written and retained, shall record the evidence submitted within the\nallotted hearing time, and shall include a summary of the considerations and the action of the Board.\n3.1.5. NOTICE PROVISIONS\nThe notice requirements for each type of application for development approval are prescribed in the individual\nsubsections of this Article and/or the NCGS.\nA.\nUnless provided for otherwise, the notice given for legislative proceedings, including amendments to this\nOrdinance, or the Official Zoning Map, shall be provided as set forth in NCGS 160D-602.\nB. Unless provided for otherwise, the notice given for quasi-judicial proceedings shall be provided as set forth in\nNCGS 160D-406.\n3.1.6. SCOPE OF ACTION\nThe reviewing body may take any action on the application that is consistent with the notice given, including approval\nof the application, conditional approval (if applicable), or denial. The reviewing body may allow minor amendments\nto the application which: (1) proposes fewer dwelling units, floor area or impervious surface than that requested on\nthe original application; (2) reduces the impact of the development; or (3) reduces the amount of land involved from\nthat indicated in the notices of the hearing. The reviewing body shall not, in any case, permit: a greater amount of\ndevelopment, a use falling in a different general use category, a larger land area than indicated in the original\napplication, or a greater variance than was indicated in the notice. In addition, the reviewing body shall not reduce or\neliminate conditions for a special use or Conditional Zoning district unless a new notice is provided prior to the\nmeeting at which a final decision is to be made.\n3.1.7. TECHNICAL REVIEW COMMITTEE\nThe Technical Review Committee (TRC) is intended to assist the Administrator in ensuring that adequate public\nfacilities are available and that proposed development is in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local\nrequirements. It shall be the responsibility of the Administrator to provide TRC comments to the applicant to be\naddressed prior the approval of a development or issuance of a permit. The reviewing government agencies and\n3-3\n"}, {"page": "32", "text": "MOUNT PLEASANT DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nArticle 3\nofficials that make up the TRC may include, but need not be limited to the following (as applicable): Public Works\nDepartment, Fire Department, Fire Marshal, Sheriff's Department, Building Inspector, Town Engineer, Town\nAttorney, North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT), North Carolina Department of Environmental\nQuality (NCDEQ), Utilities Providers, Cabarrus Health Alliance, Board of Education, Metropolitan Planning\nOrganization (MPO), US Army Corps of Engineers, contracted expertise, and other agencies as needed.\n3.1.8. ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS\nAdministrative decisions are routine, non-discretionary zoning ordinance implementation matters carried out by the\nstaff, including issuance of permits for permitted uses. In general, the Administrator is a purely administrative agent\nfollowing the literal provisions of this ordinance. The Administrator may engage in some fact finding, (for example,\nas in making an initial determination as to whether a nonconforming use was in existence at the time a zoning provision\nwas adopted). This involves determining objective facts that do not involve an element of discretion. In contrast to\nquasi-judicial hearings, administrative decisions are made without a hearing at all, with the staff member reviewing\nan application to determine if it is complete and compliant with objective standards set forth in this Ordinance. In the\ncase of Major Subdivision Preliminary Plats, the Planning & Zoning Board is acting as an extension of the\nAdministrator and reviewing the plat for compliance with the Ordinance.\n3.1.9. QUASI-JUDICIAL HEARING PROCEDURES\nSubject to NCGS 160D-406, the provisions of this subsection apply to any application for a Special Use Permit,\nvariance, appeal, or any other quasi-judicial action. In making quasi-judicial decisions, the decision-makers must\ninvestigate facts, or ascertain the existence of facts, hold hearings, weigh evidence, and draw conclusions from them,\nas a basis for their official action, and to exercise discretion of a judicial nature. In the land use context, these\nquasi-judicial decisions involve the application of land use policies to individual situations, such as variances, Special\nuse permits, and appeals of administrative determinations. These decisions involve two key elements: 1.) the finding\nof facts regarding the specific proposal and 2.) the exercise of some discretion in applying the standards of the\nordinance. Due process requirements for quasi-judicial decisions mandate that certain standards be observed when\nthese decisions are made. This includes a hearing with the right of the parties to offer evidence, have sworn testimony,\nand have findings of fact supported by competent, substantial, and material evidence.\n3.1.10. LEGISLATIVE AND ADVISORY HEARINGS\nThe purpose of a legislative or advisory review public hearing is to provide the public an opportunity to be heard.\nUnlike quasi-judicial hearings, a legislative proceeding does not require due process protections, such as right of the\nparties to offer evidence, sworn testimony, or findings of fact. Like quasi-judicial hearings, legislative hearings are\npublic hearings preceded by notice to interested parties. Public hearings are required for legislative review hearings,\nsuch as amendments to the Comprehensive Plan, and amendments to this Ordinance (including zoning provisions of\nthis Ordinance and the Zoning Map).\n3.1.11. NEIGHBORHOOD MEETING FOR CERTAIN MAP AMENDMENTS\nThe Town will not advance an application for map amendment that increases density or intensity unless:\nall adjacent property owners have been contacted and given an opportunity to meet with the applicant at a\nmeeting established at a reasonable time; and\na summary report is provided indicating results of meeting.\nThe Administrator may act as a facilitator if requested by the Applicant. No member of the decision-making entity\nmay participate in a neighborhood meeting. The applicants may conduct additional neighborhood meetings prior\nto\nthe hearing at their discretion.\n3-4\n"}, {"page": "33", "text": "MOUNT PLEASANT DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nArticle 3\n3.1.12. DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL DURATION\nSubject to NCGS 160D-108, the following shall apply to approval validity:\nA.

The decision of the Administrator to revoke\nthe permit shall be based on Section 3.1.12.2, below.\n3.1.13.2.\nGrounds for Revocation\nThe following shall be considered grounds for revocation of a permit:\nThe applicant intentionally supplies misleading information.

Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the regulation. It is not necessary to demonstrate\nthat, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.\nB. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography.\nHardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common\nto the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance. A variance may be granted\nwhen necessary and appropriate to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a\nperson with a disability.\nC. The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing\nproperty with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance is not a self-created\nhardship.\nD.\nThe requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the regulation, such that public safety\nis secured and substantial justice is achieved.\nE. The variance does not result in a change of permitted uses within a zoning district.\n3.3.5.2.

Because of the refinement of this option, the Town strongly encourages\nits use for such situations. Conditional zoning affords a degree of certainty when making land use decisions that is\nnot possible when rezoning to a general zoning district, which allows the full range of uses permitted in the district\nand does not provide the flexibility to propose or require binding site specific conditions to address unique issues that\naffect the subject property or any potential adverse impacts on adjacent property.\n3.4.6.1 Procedures\nA.\nApplications for Conditional Zoning district rezoning approval shall be filed with the Administrator in the same\nmanner as set forth in Section 3.3 and as illustrated in Figure 3.4-1. A \"CZ\" rezoning shall only be initiated at\nthe request of the property owner or their authorized agent. A \"CZ\" rezoning shall not be initiated by the Town\nBoard, Planning & Zoning Board, or administrative staff.\nB. The Applicant shall submit an application for a \"CZ\" rezoning and a preliminary major site plan as set forth in\nSection 3.6 and Appendix B of this Ordinance to the Administrator. Following approval of the rezoning, the\napplicant shall file an application for a final site plan with the Administrator that is consistent with the approved\nsite-specific plan and any supplemental conditions set forth as part of the Conditional Zoning district approval.\nC. The applicant shall describe the exact land use(s) proposed for the \"CZ\" rezoning. Such use(s) may be selected\nfrom any of the uses, whether permitted by right or conditional, allowed in the general zoning district upon which\nthe \"CD\" rezoning is based. The applicant may also submit any other conditions limiting the type, scope or\nintensity of development or use of the subject property for consideration by the decision-making body.\nD. The Planning & Zoning Board shall hear the Conditional Zoning district rezoning request and review the site-\nspecific plan concurrently.\n3.4.6.2 Permitted Uses and Conditions\nA. Within a \"CZ\" district, only those uses permitted by the zoning district with which the \"CZ\" rezoning corresponds\nshall be permitted. Such action approving the preliminary major site plan may further specify:\nthe location of units\nthe location and extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways, and access streets\nthe location and extent of rights-of-way, and other areas to be dedicated for public use, and\nother such matters as the applicant may propose as conditions upon request.\nB.\nThe decision-making body may also impose additional reasonable and appropriate safeguards to serve the purpose\nand intent of this chapter, public welfare, and justice. In the event of a \"CZ\" rezoning, the final major site plan is\nitself a condition of the rezoning. Specific conditions may be proposed by the petitioner or the local government\nor its agencies, but only those conditions approved by the local government and consented to by the petitioner in\nwriting may be incorporated into the zoning regulations.

A violation of a condition of rezoning to a Conditional Zoning district as set forth in the final development plan\nand a violation of other related official documents associated with such rezoning are considered violations of this\nOrdinance subject to the same remedies and penalties. Upon determining that such a violation has occurred, the\nAdministrator shall notify the property owner of his findings and set a reasonable time for the violation to be\ncorrected or abated in accordance with Section 1.6.

Final major site plans shall be reviewed by the Administrator in accordance with\nSection 3.6.4 of this Ordinance.\nB. The approval of a final major site plan shall constitute approval of the use(s) requested in the application and\napproved by the Planning & Zoning Board.

SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES\n5.6.4.1. Purpose & Findings\nA. The Town Board of the Town of Mount Pleasant finds that this Ordinance is necessary in order to protect the\nTown from the potential secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses including crime, the protection of the\nTown 's retail trade, the prevention of the blighting of neighborhoods and the maintenance of property values,\nprotecting and preserving the quality of the Town 's neighborhoods and the Town 's commercial districts, the\nprotection of the Town's quality of life, the increased threat of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, and\nthe protection of the peace, welfare and privacy of persons who patronize sexually oriented businesses.\nExperience in this Town as well as in cities and counties within and outside of North Carolina including the\nCounty of Los Angeles, the City of Garden Grove and the cities of Renton, Washington; Seattle, Washington;\nDetroit, Michigan; Austin, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Phoenix Arizona; have demonstrated that such uses\nhave objectionable secondary effects upon immediately adjacent residential and commercial areas. The Town\nrecognizes and relies upon the experience of these other cities and counties in adopting sexually oriented business\nregulations including the County of Los Angeles (as discussed in Smith V. County of Los Angeles 211 Cal. App.\n3d 188 (1989)); City of Renton, Washington (as discussed in City of Renton V. Playtime Theatres, Inc. 475 U.S.\n41 (1976)); the City of Seattle Washington (as discussed in Northend Cinema V. City of Seattle 90 Wash. 2d 709,\n585 P.2d 1153 (1978)); and the County of Palm Beach, Florida (as discussed in Movie & Video Work V. Board of\nCounty Commissioners 723 F. Supp. 695 (S.D. Fla. 1989)) in support of this Ordinance. The City also recognizes\nand relies upon the studies done by: (1) the 1979 Adult Use Study by the Phoenix Planning Department; (2)\nTucson, Arizona (1990); (3) the 1991 report to the City of Garden Grove by Drs. McCleary and Meeker on the\nrelationship between crime and adult business operations; (4) the City of Los Angeles in 1977); (5) the 1984\n\"Analysis of Adult Entertainment Businesses in Indianapolis\" by the Department of metropolitan Development;\n(6) Minneapolis, Minnesota (1980); (7) Cleveland, Ohio (1977); (8) Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (1986); (9)\nAustin, Texas' study on effects of adult businesses; (10) Amarillo, Texas (1977); (11) Beaumont, Texas (1982);\n(12) Houston, Texas (1983); and (13) Seattle, Washington (1989).\nB. The Town Board believes the following statements are true, in part based upon its understanding of the\nexperiences of the various jurisdictions identified:\n1. Crime rates tend to be higher in residential areas surrounding sexually oriented businesses than in industrial\nareas surrounding sexually oriented businesses;\n2. Areas within close walking distance of single and multiple family dwellings should be free of sexually\noriented businesses;\n3.\nSexually oriented businesses should be located in specific areas of the Town which are a specified distance\nfrom sensitive uses such as residences, parks, religious institutions and schools, irrespective of whether\nphysical barriers are present. This necessary to (1) ensure that the impact on such sensitive uses by adverse\nsecondary effects caused by sexually oriented businesses are mitigated to the maximum extent possible; (2)\nto prevent ad hoc decisions with respect to a potential sexually oriented business site which does not meet\nthe criteria set forth herein; and (3) to provide certainty to the residents of the Town and sexually oriented\nbusiness operators with respect to potential adult use sites.\n4.\nThe image of the Town as an attractive place to reside will be adversely affected by the presence of sexually\noriented businesses in close proximity to residential uses, schools, religious institutions and parks;\n5. The existence of sexually oriented businesses in close proximity to residential areas has been shown in some\ncities to reduce the property values in those residential areas;\n6. A reasonable regulation of the location of sexually oriented businesses protects the image of the community\n5-20\n"}, {"page": "116", "text": "MOUNT PLEASANT DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nArticle 5\nand its property values and protects its residents from the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented\nbusinesses while providing those who desire to patronize sexually oriented businesses an opportunity to do\nSO in appropriate areas in the Town; and\n7.\nThere is substantial evidence that an increase in crime tends to accompany, concentrate around, and be\naggravated by sexually oriented businesses, including but not limited to an increase in the crimes of narcotics\ndistribution and use, prostitution, pandering, and violence against persons and property. The studies from\nother cities establish convincing evidence that sexually oriented businesses which are not regulated as to\npermissible locations often have a deleterious effect on nearby businesses in residential areas, causing, among\nother adverse secondary effects, an increase in crime and a decrease in property values. Regulations for\nsexually oriented businesses should be developed to prevent deterioration and/or degradation of the vitality\nof the community before the problem exists, rather than waiting for problems to be created.\nC. The Town Board recognizes and relies on the findings set forth in the 1986 N.C. Attorney General's Report on\nPornography in support of this Ordinance including, but not limited to its recommendations that local\ngovernments ban certain features of video booths that facilitate carnal sexual encounters.\nD. The Town Board finds the following, in part based upon its understanding of the documents and judicial decisions\nin the public record:\n1.\nEvidence indicates that some dancers, models and other persons who publicly perform specified sexual\nactivities or publicly display specified anatomical parts in sexually oriented businesses (collectively referred\nto as \"performers\") have been found to engage in sexual activities with patrons of sexually oriented\nbusinesses on the site of the sexually oriented business;\n2. Evidence has demonstrated that performers employed by sexually oriented businesses have been found to\noffer and provide private shows to patrons who, for a price, are permitted to observe and participate with the\nperformers in live sex shows;\n3. Evidence indicates that performers at sexually oriented businesses have been found to engage in acts of\nprostitution with patrons of the establishment;\n4.\nAs a result of the above, and the increase in incidents of AIDS and Hepatitis B, which are both sexually\ntransmitted diseases, the Town has a substantial interest in adopting regulations which will reduce, to the\ngreatest extent possible, the possibility for the occurrence of prostitution and casual sex acts at sexually\noriented businesses.\n5. The Town Board has determined that the establishment of a sexually oriented business development permit\nprocess is a legitimate and reasonable means of ensuring that:\n6.\nOperators of sexually oriented businesses comply with the reasonable regulations of this Ordinance;\n7. The recognized secondary impacts of a proposed sexually oriented business in a specific location are\nmitigated; and\n8.\nOperators of sexually oriented businesses have specific guidelines with respect to where they can establish\nor operate a sexually oriented business.\nE. It is not the intent of the Town Board in adopting this Ordinance to suppress any activities protected by the First\nAmendment, but rather to enact a content neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects that sexually\noriented businesses have on the Town.\nF. The Town Board desires to protect the rights conferred by the United States Constitution to sexually oriented\n5-21\n"}, {"page": "117", "text": "MOUNT PLEASANT DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nArticle 5\nbusinesses in a manner that ensures the continued and orderly development of property within the Town and\ndiminishes those undesirable negative secondary effects the previously mentioned studies have shown to be\nassociated with the development and operation of sexually oriented businesses.\nG.

The purpose of Conservation Development design is an optional residential development design tool intended to\npreserve agricultural and forestry lands, natural and cultural features and environmentally sensitive areas that\nwould be likely lost through conventional development approaches.\nB. The conservation development design option may be utilized for any residential development of greater than 10\nunits within any zoning district in which residential uses are permitted.\n6.7.2. DEVELOPMENT DENSITY AND DIMENSIONS\nA. The development density shall not exceed the overall density permitted in the zoning district in which the\ndevelopment is located (except as set forth in Section 6.7.3.). Areas with slopes of greater than 25% and floodway\nareas shall not be included in the overall allowable density calculation.\nB. Lot widths and setbacks may be reduced by up to 50% of the minimum required for the zoning district in which\nthe development is located, subject to the requirements set forth in this section. The district setbacks set forth in\nSection 4.7 (Table 4.7-2) shall apply along the boundaries of the development in addition to any buffers required\nin Article 7.

CONSERVATION DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL PROCESS\nApproval of conservation development shall follow the same approval process for major subdivisions as set forth in\nSection 6.4, except that the following steps shall be added to the sketch plan phase:\nA. During the first step, the total yield for the property is calculated based on the total property area and the density\nfor zoning district, minus the minimum open space for the base zoning district, as set forth in Section 6.5. (Density\nbonuses may be given in accordance with Section 6.7.3)\nB. Next, all potential Conservation Areas (primary, secondary, and tertiary), as defined in Section 6.5.4 shall be\nidentified, using the Existing Features Plan described in Section 6.5.2.\nC. During the third step, potential building sites (up to the maximum identified in Step 1) are tentatively located.\nHouse sites should generally be located not closer than 50 feet to Primary Conservation Areas.\nD. The fourth step consists of aligning proposed streets to provide vehicular access to each house in the most\nreasonable and economical way. When lots and access streets are laid out, they shall be located in a way that\navoids, or at least minimizes, adverse impacts on the Conservation Areas.

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION STANDARDS\n9.3.1. PUPRPOSE AND AUTHORITY\n9.3.1.1. Statutory Authorization\nThe Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; 160D-9-23; and Article 8 of\nChapter 160A of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt\nregulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the governing body of the\nTown of Mount Pleasant, North Carolina does ordain as follows:\n9.3.1.2. Findings Of Fact\nA. The flood hazard areas of the Town are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property,\nhealth and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public\nexpenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the\npublic health, safety, and general welfare.\nB. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood\nheights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.\n9.3.1.3. Statement of Purpose\nThe purpose of the Flood Damage Prevention Standards is to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and\nto minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:\nRestrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards or that\nresult in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;\nRequire that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage\nat the time of initial construction;\nControl the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved\nin the accommodation of floodwaters;\nControl filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and\nPrevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may\nincrease flood hazards to other lands.\n9.3.1.4. Objectives\nThe objectives of the Flood Damage Prevention Standards are to:\nProtect human life, safety, and health;\nMinimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\nMinimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense\nof the general public;\nMinimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;\nMinimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer\nlines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;\nMinimize damage to private and public property due to flooding;\nMake flood insurance available to the community through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP);\nMaintain the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains;\nHelp maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas; and\nEnsure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area\n9-5\n"}, {"page": "234", "text": "MOUNT PLEASANT DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nArticle 9\n9.3.2.

PURPOSE\nThe purpose of these overlay districts is to implement the Water Supply Watershed Protection Act (the Act) (NCGS\n143-214.5 & 143-214.6). The Water Supply Watershed Protection Rules adopted by the North Carolina\nEnvironmental Management Commission (the \"EMC\") requires that all local governments having land use jurisdiction\nwithin water supply watersheds adopt and implement water supply watershed protection ordinances, and maps. The\nTown of Mount Pleasant has adopted watershed protection overlay restrictions as part of its development ordinance.\nIt is the intent of this Section to continue these restrictions. While the restrictions previously codified separately are\ncombined herein and rewritten for clarity and it is the intent of this Ordinance to carry forth these regulations which\npreviously existed and which have been approved by the EMC.\n9.4.2. JURISDICTION\nThe provisions of this Ordinance shall apply within the areas designated within the following watershed overlay\ndistricts as shown on the Official Zoning Map. All explanatory matter contained thereon accompanies and is hereby\nmade a part of this Ordinance.\n9.4.3. ESTABLISHMENT\nThe watershed overlay zones listed in this subsection have been established by the Town of Mount Pleasant. Said\noverlay zoning districts are also established and continued in effect by this Ordinance. The watershed protection\ndistricts, the watershed classification, and the jurisdiction within which the watershed districts are established, are as\nlisted in Table 9.4-1.\n9.4.4. CRITICAL AREA BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENTS\nThe Planning Board may, in carrying out its plan review authority under this Ordinance, including its subdivision\nreview authority under the Subdivision Ordinance, adjust the boundary of a Watershed Critical Area Overlay District\nto fit existing or proposed streets, lot lines or other features provided that such adjustments are agreed to by the\nproperty owner(s) involved and provided that any such adjustment is made with no loss of total area in the affected\nWatershed Critical Area Overlay District.\n9.4.5.\nINTERPRETATION OF THE WATERSHED BOUNDARIES\nA. The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to make adjustments to the exterior boundary of Watershed\nOverlay Districts by removing all or part of a piece of property from a Watershed Overlay District where it finds\nthat all or part of such property actually lies outside the drainage area of such Watershed. In any case where there\nis a dispute as to whether a property or any part of a property that is shown on the Official Zoning Map as being\nin a Watershed Overlay District actually drains to that Watershed, the Board of Adjustment shall, upon appeal by\nthe owner, make a determination as to the facts of the matter as it affects the subject property.\nB. In determining whether a property or part of a property drains to the Watershed as indicated on the Map, the\nBoard of Adjustment shall base its determination on actual field conditions of the property as determined by\ntopographical conditions. In making its determination, the Board of Adjustment may require the appellant to\nproduce relevant expert testimony and exhibits.\nC. After hearing such appeal, the Board shall find that the subject property (all or part) is either in the designated\nWatershed or out of the designated Watershed. If the Board shall find that the subject property is out of the\ndesignated Watershed, the Board shall order the Map to be adjusted to show the subject property to be outside the\n9-31\n"}, {"page": "260", "text": "MOUNT PLEASANT DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nArticle 9\ndesignated Watershed. In making such order, the Board of Adjustment shall designate the Watershed in which\nthe subject property is located. If such designation causes the subject property to be located in another Watershed\nOverlay District, the order shall cause the Map to be adjusted to show the same.\n9.4.6.\nGENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL WATERSHED OVERLAY\nDISTRICTS\nThe following general provisions apply to all Watershed Overlay Districts. These provisions and the provisions\ncontained in the Individual Watershed Overlay Districts are designed to protect the water quality of the Water\nSupply\nWatersheds that lie within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance and to implement the rules adopted by the North Carolina\nEnvironmental Management Commission for the classified watersheds pursuant to North Carolina General Statutes\n143-214.5.\nA. The construction of new roads and bridges and non-residential development should minimize built-upon area,\ndivert stormwater away from surface water supply waters as much as possible, and employ best management\npractices (BMPs) to minimize water quality impacts. To the extent practicable, the construction of new roads in\nthe critical area should be avoided. The NC Department of Transportation BMPs as outlined in their document\nentitled \"Best Management Practices for the Protection of Surface Waters\" shall be used in all road and bridge\nconstruction projects in the Watershed Overlay Districts.\nB. All development activities within Watershed Overlay Districts, in addition to those activities specifically\nregulated by these provisions, are subject to the standards, usage conditions and other regulations contained in\nthe Rules and Requirements of the Surface Water Supply Protection Rules adopted by the North Carolina\nEnvironmental Management Commission.\nC. A minimum 50 foot vegetative buffer for development activities is required along all perennial waters, including\nstreams, rivers and impoundments, indicated on the most recent versions of United States Geodetic Survey\n(USGS) 1: 24,000 scale topographic maps; provided, that nothing in this Subsection shall prevent artificial\nstreambank or shoreline stabilization. No new development is allowed in the buffer, except that water dependent\nstructures, or other structures such as flagpoles, signs, and security lights, which result in only de minimis increase\nin impervious area and public works projects such as road crossings and greenways may be allowed where no\npracticable alternative exists. These activities shall minimize built-upon surface area, direct runoff away from\nthe surface water, and maximize the utilization of BMPs.\nD. Where otherwise permitted in the underlying Primary Zoning District, Cluster Development is allowed on a\nproject-by-project basis as follows:\n1.\nThe overall density of the project meets the density requirements of this Ordinance;\n2. The appropriate vegetative buffer in Subsection (C) above is provided;\n3. Built upon areas are designed and located to minimize stormwater runoff impact to the receiving waters,\nminimize concentrated stormwater flow, and maximize the flow length through vegetated areas;\n4.\nAreas of concentrated development are located in upland areas and away, to the maximum extent practicable,\nfrom surface waters and drainage ways;\n5. Remainder of tract to remain in vegetated or natural state;\n6.\nThe area in the vegetated or natural state may be conveyed to a property owners association; a local\ngovernment for preservation as a park or greenway; a conservation organization; or placed in a permanent\nconservation or farmland preservation easement.

All development in Watershed Overlay Districts, shall, to the maximum extent practical, minimize built-upon\nsurface area, direct stormwater runoff away from surface waters and incorporate best management practices to\nminimize water quality impacts.\nF. Existing development, as defined in this Ordinance, is not subject to the requirements of the overlay provisions.\nExpansions to structures classified as existing development must meet the requirements of these provisions,\nprovided however, the built-upon area of the existing development is not required to be included in the density\ncalculations. In determining expansions to existing development, the maximum permitted additional built-upon\narea is derived by multiplying the area of the portion of the property that is not built-upon by the appropriate\npercent built-upon limitation for the Overlay District in which the property is located.\nG.

The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration\nof features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.\nC. Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense\nof historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall\nnot be undertaken.\nD. Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historical significance in their own right shall\nbe retained and preserved.\nE.\nDistinctive features, finishes, and constructive techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a\nproperty shall be preserved.\nF.\nDeteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires\nreplacement of a distinctive feature, the new one shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual\nqualities and where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary,\nphysical, or pictorial evidence.\nG. Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used.\nThe surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible.\nH. Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must\nbe disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.\nI.\nNew additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historical materials that\ncharacterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the\nmassing, size, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.\nJ.\nNew additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in\nthe future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.\n11-36\n"}, {"page": "332", "text": "MOUNT PLEASANT DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nArticle 11\n11.4.4.2. Maintenance of Historic Features\nProperty owners should take care to properly maintain and repair historic buildings in a way that will preserve the\nimportant architectural features and elements of the building that are consistent with the established architectural\npattern of Downtown Mount Pleasant. Some basic guidelines to keep in mind are as follows:\nA. Preserve historic entrances by preventing enclosure or relocation. If an entrance requires modification to meet\nADA requirements, modification shall occur in a manner that has minimal impact on the location and\nconfiguration of the original entrance and meets the NC Building Code standards for rehabilitation.\nB. Preserve existing display and transom windows openings. Property owners can achieve restoration of covered or\naltered window openings by carefully removing cladding or infill material.\nC. Transom windows should be retained to add light to the building interior. Repair glass and framing using original\nstyle materials. Do not paint or fill in transom windows.\nD. Remove any inappropriate cladding that covers historic materials.\nE. To prevent deterioration and rusting, property owners should paint, or seal in a proper manner, any wood or metal\nfeatures, including doors, trim bulkheads and cornices.\nF. Property owners should properly maintain and repoint any damaged joints in brick, stone or other material to\nprotect from water infiltration and deterioration.\nG. Replace broken glass in display windows, transoms and doors.\nH.\nUse interior storm windows or approved awnings to reduce heat gain and improve energy efficiency.\nI.\nIf new framing is required for insulated glass, install it SO that the framing matches the exterior profile and material\nof the existing historic storefront.\nJ.\nIn order to match the design and material of intact features, the following methods should be employed:\nLook for physical evidence (shadow lines) of missing features.\nLook for evidence of missing features in historic photographs.\nLook for features on similar buildings nearby to replicate.\n11-37\n"}, {"page": "333", "text": "MOUNT PLEASANT DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nArticle 11\n11.4.5.

STOREFRONT DESIGN\nThe storefront is the public face of a building and the most prominent feature at the pedestrian scale. A storefront\ndesigned to be open and inviting will help to welcome patrons inside, while a storefront that is hardened presents the\nopposite message. Most storefronts have an abundance of glass, which is a contributing factor in good storefront\ndesign since the openness of the glass invites browsing and allows pedestrians to see interior activity. Good storefront\ndesign also allows for pedestrians to be able to view the interior of the building from the main portion of the sidewalk.\nTherefore, excessively recessed storefronts are discouraged since they require a passerby to leave the main sidewalk\nto see clearly into the storefront. The following storefront design standards requirements shall apply to all new\nconstruction and reconstruction of storefronts:\nA. Buildings shall be designed SO that the majority (greater than 50%) of the width of the storefront wall is located\nimmediately adjacent to the public sidewalk. Storefronts shall run the length of the first-floor facade between the\nexterior building piers.\nB. No more than 20% of the storefront wall may be recessed beyond eight (8) feet from the public sidewalk.\nC. Storefront design shall be proportional to that of other buildings within the same block on the same side of the\nstreet without being an exact replication of those buildings.\nD. Bulkheads should be neither too high, blocking the view of pedestrians, nor too low, SO that a completely glass\nwalled storefront is created. Bulkheads shall be constructed along all storefront areas, excluding customer\nentrances. Bulkheads shall be a minimum of 24 inches and maximum of 36 inches in height. Bulkheads may be\nconstructed of brick, wood, or a combination of those two materials. Bulkheads shall include architectural\ndetailing such as inlays, trim, changes in color or changes in material.\nE. A minimum of 70% and maximum of 90% of the surface area of the storefront shall consist of transparent glass\nbetween a height of two (2) feet and 10 feet above the grade of the adjacent sidewalk.

BUILDING MODULATION\nBuilding modulation is the varying of the footprint of a building by projecting or recessing portions of the fa\u00e7ade from\nthe base plane of the building wall. The use of a modulated fa\u00e7ade helps to define the most important portion(s) of a\nbuilding (such as customer entrances), reduces monotony along building walls and helps to distinguish adjacent\nbuildings from each other by encouraging distinctive designs. The following building modulation standards apply to\nall non-residential buildings of greater than 50 linear feet on the primary fa\u00e7ade:\nA. Primary building walls shall be modulated through the use of projections or recessions of the building wall from\nthe base wall plane.\nB.

The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration\nof features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.\nC. Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense\nof historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall\nnot be undertaken.\nD. Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historical significance in their own right shall\nbe retained and preserved.\nE.\nDistinctive features, finishes, and constructive techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a\nproperty shall be preserved.\nF.\nDeteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires\nreplacement of a distinctive feature, the new one shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual\nqualities and where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary,\nphysical, or pictorial evidence.\nG. Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used.\nThe surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible.\nH. Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must\nbe disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.\nI.\nNew additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historical materials that\ncharacterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the\nmassing, size, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.\nJ.\nNew additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in\nthe future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.\n11-36\n"}, {"page": "400", "text": "MOUNT PLEASANT DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nArticle 11\n11.4.4.2. Maintenance of Historic Features\nProperty owners should take care to properly maintain and repair historic buildings in a way that will preserve the\nimportant architectural features and elements of the building that are consistent with the established architectural\npattern of Downtown Mount Pleasant. Some basic guidelines to keep in mind are as follows:\nA. Preserve historic entrances by preventing enclosure or relocation. If an entrance requires modification to meet\nADA requirements, modification shall occur in a manner that has minimal impact on the location and\nconfiguration of the original entrance and meets the NC Building Code standards for rehabilitation.\nB. Preserve existing display and transom windows openings. Property owners can achieve restoration of covered or\naltered window openings by carefully removing cladding or infill material.\nC. Transom windows should be retained to add light to the building interior. Repair glass and framing using original\nstyle materials. Do not paint or fill in transom windows.\nD. Remove any inappropriate cladding that covers historic materials.\nE. To prevent deterioration and rusting, property owners should paint, or seal in a proper manner, any wood or metal\nfeatures, including doors, trim bulkheads and cornices.\nF. Property owners should properly maintain and repoint any damaged joints in brick, stone or other material to\nprotect from water infiltration and deterioration.\nG. Replace broken glass in display windows, transoms and doors.\nH.\nUse interior storm windows or approved awnings to reduce heat gain and improve energy efficiency.\nI.\nIf new framing is required for insulated glass, install it SO that the framing matches the exterior profile and material\nof the existing historic storefront.\nJ.\nIn order to match the design and material of intact features, the following methods should be employed:\nLook for physical evidence (shadow lines) of missing features.\nLook for evidence of missing features in historic photographs.\nLook for features on similar buildings nearby to replicate.\n11-37\n"}, {"page": "401", "text": "MOUNT PLEASANT DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nArticle 11\n11.4.5.

STOREFRONT DESIGN\nThe storefront is the public face of a building and the most prominent feature at the pedestrian scale. A storefront\ndesigned to be open and inviting will help to welcome patrons inside, while a storefront that is hardened presents the\nopposite message. Most storefronts have an abundance of glass, which is a contributing factor in good storefront\ndesign since the openness of the glass invites browsing and allows pedestrians to see interior activity. Good storefront\ndesign also allows for pedestrians to be able to view the interior of the building from the main portion of the sidewalk.\nTherefore, excessively recessed storefronts are discouraged since they require a passerby to leave the main sidewalk\nto see clearly into the storefront. The following storefront design standards requirements shall apply to all new\nconstruction and reconstruction of storefronts:\nA. Buildings shall be designed SO that the majority (greater than 50%) of the width of the storefront wall is located\nimmediately adjacent to the public sidewalk. Storefronts shall run the length of the first-floor facade between the\nexterior building piers.\nB.

SITE SPECIFIC VESTING PLANS\n13.2.9.1. Site-Specific Vesting Plan\nA site-specific vesting plan consists of a plan submitted to the Town in which the applicant requests vesting pursuant\nto this section, describing with reasonable certainty on the plan the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or\nparcels of property. The plan may be in the form of, but not be limited to, any of the following plans or approvals: a\nplanned unit development plan, a subdivision plat, a preliminary or general development plan, a Special Use Permit,\na Conditional Zoning district plan, or any other land-use approval designation as may be utilized by the Town. Unless\notherwise expressly provided by the Town, the plan shall include the approximate boundaries of the site; significant\ntopographical and other natural features affecting development of the site; the approximate location on the site of the\nproposed buildings, structures, and other improvements; the approximate dimensions, including height, of the\nproposed buildings and other structures; and the approximate location of all existing and proposed infrastructure on\nthe site, including water, sewer, roads, and pedestrian walkways. What constitutes a site-specific vesting plan under\nthis section that would trigger a vested right shall be finally determined by the Town pursuant to a development\nregulation, and the document that triggers the vesting shall be SO identified at the time of its approval. A Variance\ndoes not constitute a site-specific vesting plan, and approval of a site-specific vesting plan with the condition that a\nvariance be obtained does not confer a vested right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained.

Establishment of Vested Right\nA vested right is established with respect to any property upon the valid approval, or conditional approval, of a site-\nspecific vesting plan as provided in this section. Such a vested right confers upon the landowner the right to undertake\nand complete the development and use of the property under the terms and conditions of the site-specific vesting plan,\nincluding any amendments thereto.\n13.2.9.3. Approval and Amendment of Plans\nA. If a site-specific vesting plan is based on an approval required by a local development regulation, the Town shall\nprovide whatever notice and hearing is required for that underlying approval. A duration of the underlying\napproval that is less than two (2) years does not affect the duration of the site-specific vesting plan established\nunder this section. If the site-specific vesting plan is not based on such an approval, a legislative hearing with\nnotice as required by NCGS 160D-602 shall be held.\nB. The Town may approve a site-specific vesting plan upon any terms and conditions that may reasonably be\nnecessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Conditional approval results in a vested right, although\nfailure to abide by the terms and conditions of the approval will result in a forfeiture of vested rights. The Town\nshall not require a landowner to waive the landowner's vested rights as a condition of developmental approval.\nA\nsite-specific vesting plan is deemed approved upon the effective date of the Town's decision approving the plan\nor another date determined by the governing board upon approval. An approved site-specific vesting plan and its\nconditions may be amended with the approval of the owner and the Town as follows: any substantial modification\nmust be reviewed and approved in the same manner as the original approval; minor modifications may be\napproved by staff, if such are defined and authorized by local regulation.\n13.2.9.4. Continuing Review\nFollowing approval or conditional approval of a site-specific vesting plan, the Town may make subsequent reviews\nand require subsequent approvals by the Town to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original\napproval, provided that these reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original approval. The Town may,\npursuant to G.S. 160D-403(f), revoke the original approval for failure to comply with applicable terms and conditions\nof the original approval or the applicable local development regulations.\n13-7\n"}, {"page": "460", "text": "MOUNT PLEASANT DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nArticle 13\n13.2.9.5.

PURPOSE OF DRIVEWAY ORDINANCE.\nApplicability. This Appendix D shall apply to all driveways or access points planned to connect to a Town\nmaintained street. This provisions of this Appendix shall regulate only that portion of a private driveway that\nconnects to a public and extends to the edge of a public right-of-way. The regulation of private driveways on private\nproperty is subject to the standards of Article 8 of this Ordinance.\nThe safety and efficiency of a roadway is impacted by the amount and type of interference experienced by the\nvehicles moving on it. Some interference may result from other vehicles on the roadway, moving in either the\nsame or the opposite direction. The major form of interference, however, is from vehicles entering, leaving, or\ncrossing the roadway at intersecting streets and driveways. In order to reduce interference with traffic flow,\nminimize accidents and assure the best overall utilization of the roadway by the motoring public, it is necessary\nto regulate vehicles entering and leaving roadside developments and intersecting streets.\nThe Town of Mount Pleasant recognizes the legal rights of the abutting property owners to have access to their\nproperty. However, it must also consider the right of other roadway users to travel with relative safety and\nfreedom interference. Since these rights are at times in conflict, it is the Town's responsibility to reconcile and,\nto the extent feasible, satisfy the needs and desires of all roadway users.\nTo accomplish this, the critical areas of driveway location, design and operation must be addressed. The Town\nof Mount Pleasant has therefore adopted this driveway ordinance to establish standards for the location and\ndesign of driveways providing access from public roadways to developments on abutting property. This\nordinance has been established to meet the following objectives.\n(a)\nTo provide maximum safety and protection to the public through the regulation of vehicles entering and\nexiting public streets and,\n(b)\nTo provide a uniform ordinance for the design, location, operation and construction of driveways\nthroughout the Town, and,\n(c)\nTo provide owners of abutting property with the maximum service feasible, consistent with the safe and\nefficient use of Town streets.\nThe Town's intent is to further increase safety and decrease congestion along specified major thoroughfares. In\norder to accomplish these objectives, certain goals have been identified. These goals are:\n(a)\nTo prohibit driveways within a certain distance of intersecting streets unless alternate access is not\navailable,\n(b) To decrease the number of driveways along major thoroughfares, and\n(c)\nTo increase the distance between adjacent driveways along major thoroughfares.\nThis Appendix D is to be administered by the Town of Mount Pleasant Public Works Director and/or his/her\ndesignee(s). The issuance of a Driveway permit as prescribed by this Appendix D shall be issued by the Mount\nPleasant Public Works Director his/her designee(s).\nD-2. DRIVEWAY PERMIT APPLICATION PROCEDURE.\nThe procedure for driveway permit application differs according to the type of use of a particular parcel, tract or\ndevelopment.\nDriveway permits for \"new\" detached, single-family residential construction are not required, however they\nmust meet the standards of this ordinance. For existing single family residential development, modifications to\nthe driveways will require a driveway permit. The Department will attempt to accommodate these applicants on\nD-2\n"}, {"page": "587", "text": "MOUNT PLEASANT DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nAppendix D\na walk-in-basis.\nTo apply for a driveway permit for a commercial, industrial or multi-family residential development, two (2)\ncopies of an adequate site plan showing all required information must be submitted to the Public Works\nDirector or their designee. A minimum of three (3) working days is required for the initial review of the site\nplans.\nIn that the permit issued under this ordinance is actually a permit for use of public rights-of-way, the permitting\nprocess also applies to any and all work or activity performed in the public right-of-way other than normal daily\nvehicular and pedestrian traffic. Such uses include but are not limited to street and sidewalk cuts, and private\nstreet intersections with public streets. Please consult the Public Works Director or their designee for\ninformation about permit requirements for any of these activities.\nThe North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) is required to review all connections to state\nsystem streets. This includes both driveway and street connections, with the exception of single family\nresidential drives, which are exempt from state review requirements. State system streets are those streets\nwithin the Town for which the state retains the ultimate responsibility. However, the more restrictive Driveway\nOrdinance (NCDOT or Town of Mount Pleasant) shall apply.\nDriveway permits on state system streets, within the Town limits of Mount Pleasant, should be submitted to the\nTown of Mount Pleasant for the initial review. Upon the Town of Mount Pleasant's approval, the site plans and\nNCDOT driveway permit forms will be forwarded to NCDOT for their approval.\nAny questions concerning the application procedure or the requirements of this ordinance should be directed to\nthe the Town of Mount Pleasant Department of Public Works.\nD-3.
