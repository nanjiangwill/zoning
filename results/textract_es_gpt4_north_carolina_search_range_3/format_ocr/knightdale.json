Building Type Standards\n7\n6.1. Purpose and Intent\nThe architectural vocabulary of the Town represents a wide variety of traditional forms that avoid a\nperception of monotony. This UDO has established regulations specific to these forms. Consequently,\nbuildings that are stylized in an attempt to use the building itself as advertising are discouraged, particularly\nwhere the proposed architecture is the result of a \"corporate\" or \"franchise\" design. The standards in this\nChapter are intended to attach the same or greater level of importance to the overall building design as is\nplaced on the use contained within. Buildings are expected to be added to the Town of Knightdale as long-\nterm additions to the architectural vibrancy of the community.\n6.2.

However, these areas are known to increase stormwater volume and\nvelocity, increase the levels of surface pollutants, increase surface-level heat and glare, reduce the efficiency of the\nconnecting street system, and increase the number of potential conflict points with the surrounding pedestrian\nnetwork. This chapter regulates the construction, expansion, and renovation of vehicle accommodation areas in a\nmanner that seeks to minimize and mitigate these known impacts.\nB.\nApplicability. The standards of this Section are applicable across all zoning districts, except as described in this\nsection.\n1.\nTown Center (TC) District.\na.\nDevelopments which do not involve an increase of more than twenty-five (25) percent in the building\nfloor area are exempt from the standards of this Section;\nb.\nDevelopments which involve only a change of use and which will not increase the number of parking\nspaces required under this chapter by more than ten (10) percent are exempt from the standards of this\nSection; and\nC.\nRequired loading areas must still be provided but may be designated on-street and/or within public alleys.\n2.\nCentral Business District.

Landscaping and Tree Protection\nA. Purpose and Intent.\n1. The protection of existing trees and the provision of landscaping are essential components of the built urban\nform of the Town. The purpose of this section is to regulate the protection, preservation, installation, and long-\nterm management of vegetation within the Town of Knightdale. Landscaping requirements are intended to:\na.\nMinimize potential nuisances such as visual impacts from adjacent properties;\nb. Minimize transmission, noise, dust, odor, litter, and glare of lights;\nC.\nProvide for a separation of space and establish a sense of privacy;\nd. Promote the preservation of open space; and\ne.\nMitigate adverse grade changes between adjacent properties.\n2. The appropriate use of existing and supplemental landscaping improves the aesthetic appearance of new\ndevelopment, thereby enhancing the local business economy while preserving and protecting the identity and\ncharacter of Knightdale. Furthermore, the use of native evergreen and deciduous plant materials blend new\nconstruction with the existing natural and built environments while maintaining the aesthetic character of the\nTown, and the installation of drought-tolerant plant materials promotes good soil management and water\nconservation.\nB. Applicability.\n1.\nExpansions and Changes of Use. These regulations shall apply to all newly developed properties as well as\nchanges of use, expansions which increase the gross heated square footage of an existing building by more than\ntwenty-five (25) percent, and expansions of vehicle accommodation areas by more than twenty-five (25)\npercent.\n2.\nModification of Standards. Where necessary to accommodate creativity in site design, or where topographic\nor physical site conditions are not feasible, the Land Use Administrator may modify these requirements,\nprovided that the type and amount of landscaping or other features are equivalent in effectiveness.\n3.\nEnhanced Standards. The Town may require additional landscape beyond the landscape required in this\nSection in areas identified as Gateways in the Knightdale Next Comprehensive Plan.\n4.\nEmergencies. In the case of emergencies such as windstorms, ice storms, fire, or other disasters, the\nrequirements of this Ordinance may be waived by the Town during the emergency period SO that the\nrequirements of this Ordinance will in no way hamper private or public work to restore order in the Town.\nThis shall not be interpreted to be a general waiver of the intent of this Ordinance.\n5.

Lighting\nA.\nPurpose and Intent. The purpose of this Chapter is to define practical and effective measures by which the\nobtrusive aspects of outdoor light usage may be reduced; while preserving safety, security, and the nighttime use and\nenjoyment of property. Poorly designed lighting contributes to excessive light trespass, strong glare, and poor color\nrendering that can adversely impact adjacent properties, neighboring areas, and motorists. These measures are\nintended to:\n1.\nCurtail the degradation of the nighttime visual environment;\n2.\nreduce light trespass and glare by encouraging lighting practices that direct appropriate amounts of light where\nand when it is needed and prohibiting the use of poorly shielded or inappropriately directed lighting fixtures;\nand\n3.\nreduce energy waste by increasing the use of energy-efficient sources.\nB.\nApplicability. The standards of this Chapter are applicable for new development across all zoning districts, except\nas described below. Changes to existing non-conforming lighting are subject to the provisions of Section 13.8.\n1.\nOutdoor Recreational Lighting. Because of their unique requirements for nighttime visibility and limited\nhours of operation, the lighting of active recreation areas, such as ball fields and tennis courts, are not\nconsidered in this Chapter. However, lighting fixtures for such uses shall be mounted and aimed SO that the\nillumination falls within the primary playing area and immediate surroundings and SO that no direct light\nillumination is directed off site.

General Roadway Design Criteria\nA.\nHorizontal Curve Street Design Criteria. Design Criteria for design speed centerline radius, reverse curve tangent\ndistance, and maximum rate of superelevation rates for streets are summarized in Table 10.1 (D)(2)(a).\nSuperelevation rates, minimum runoff lengths and methods of distribution should be in accordance with AASHTO\nguidelines. The minimum tangent length approach an intersection should be at least fifty (50) feet for alleys and\nstreets. All other streets shall have a tangent section no less than one-hundred (100) feet approaching an\nintersection.\nNote: NCDOT may limit max super to 0.04 on NCDOT curb and gutter facilities.\nB.\nVertical Curve Street Design Criteria. Whenever practical, streets should follow the existing contours of a site SO\nas to avoid excessive grading and removal of vegetation. Street grades shall not be less than three-quarters (0.75) of\none percent. Standards for vertical street design are listed in Table 10.1 (D)(2)(b). At signalized intersections, the\nmaximum grade approaching the intersection should not exceed two (2) percent and extend a minimum distance of\none-hundred (100) feet in each direction. For intersections not controlled by a traffic signal, the maximum grade\napproaching the intersection should not exceed five (5) percent and extend a minimum distance of fifty (50) feet in\neach direction.\nNote: The rate of vertical curvature, K, is the length of curve (feet) per percent algebraic difference in intersecting grades (A). K = L/A\nNote: May grade of 5% is desirable where pedestrian facilities are present.\nC. Roadway Sight Design. All sight distance lengths and methods of measuring sight distance along a roadway shall\nbe in accordance with AASHTO guidelines. Sight distance is the length of the roadway visible to the driver. The\nminimum sight distance available on the roadway shall be sufficiently long to enable a vehicle traveling at or near\nthe design speed to stop before reaching a stationary object in its path. Minimum stopping sight distances shall be\nprovided in both the horizontal and vertical planes for planned roadways as related to the assumed driver's eye\nheight and position.

Recreational open space shall be planned and improved to provide focal points\nfor a neighborhood and are centrally located SO that they are accessible and usable by persons living within a\nhalf (1/2) mile walking distance. A central square or green, for example, may comprise a majority of the area\nrequired for dedication. Improved shall mean cleared of underbrush and debris and containing active or passive\nenhancements as described in Section 11.2 (C)(7).\n3.\nPreservation of Natural Aesthetic Features. Significant stands of trees, stream bed areas, and other valuable\nnatural aesthetic features shall be preserved within the recreational open space areas where practical.\n4.\nPlacement of Amenities. Recreational open space amenities such as playground equipment, statues, and\nfountains should be located toward the interior of squares and parks, sufficiently away from the public right-of-\nway, to provide for the adequate safety of users.\na.\nPet waste stations shall be provided along public greenways every 2,000 feet. Placement consideration shall\nbe based on proximity to other existing waste stations, proximity to other open space amenities and access\nto roads for collection purposes. If the public greenway segment being constructed is less than 2,000 feet,\nthe requirement may be waived unless the segment connects into the existing greenway network and\ncreates a 2,000 feet greenway segment without a pet waste station. The pet waste station design shall be in\naccordance with the Town's Standard Specifications and Details Manual.\nb.\nBenches shall be provided along public greenways every 2,000 feet. Placement consideration shall consider\nthe location of other amenities, presence of shade, providing rest from climbing hills and/or taking\nadvantage of viewsheds. If the public greenway segment being constructed is less than 2,000 feet, the\nrequirement may be waived unless the segment connects into the existing greenway network and creates a\n2,000 feet greenway segment without a bench. Bench designs shall be in accordance with the Town's\nStandard Specifications and Details Manual.\n5.\nOwnership. Dedicated recreational open space may be held in private ownership, provided that the necessary\neasements are recorded with the Wake County Register of Deeds in a form approved by the Town. Otherwise,\ndedicated recreational open space shall be separately deeded to a homeowner's association, a non-profit land\ntrust or conservancy, Wake County, or the Town of Knightdale (upon approval by the Town Council).\nC.\nRecreational Open Space Dedication. All developments with more than eight (8) residential units shall be\nrequired to dedicate recreational open space. The amount of recreational open space required for dedication shall be\ndetermined using the following Recreational Open Space Dedication Matrix (\"Dedication Matrix\") included in\nTable 11.2(C)(4). The Dedication Matrix is based upon similar dedication requirements throughout the State of\nNorth Carolina with a few enhancements:\nTown of Knightdale\nChapter 11 - Subdivision Standards\nKnightdale Next UDO Update\nPage 2 of 18\n"}, {"page": "239", "text": "Recreational Open Space\n1.\nProximity to Improved Publicly Dedicated Recreational Open Space Credits. The Dedication Matrix\naccounts for the availability of accessible recreational open space in close proximity to the proposed\ndevelopment, referred to as \"Proximity Zone.\" The portion of a development within a half (0.5) mile walk\n(along sidewalks or other pedestrian access within a public right-of-way or public easement) to existing publicly\ndedicated recreational open space (parks, greenways, etc.) are granted a reduction in required recreational open\nspace dedication of twenty-five (25) percent. Similarly, the portion of a development within a quarter (0.25)\nmile of existing publicly dedicated recreational open space is granted a fifty (50) percent reduction in required\ndedication. Publicly dedicated recreational open space means that the property has been dedicated to the Town\nof Knightdale or other government agency, is actively maintained through a maintenance agreement or\nacceptance for maintenance by the government agency, and has been improved as provided for in Section\n11.2(B)(2).\n2.\nDensity (Dwelling Units/Acre). To encourage the preservation of proportional acres of land in higher\ndensity developments, the Dedication Matrix provides for an increasing requirement in the dedication of\nrecreational open space as gross density also increases.\n3.\nNumber of Bedrooms. In addition to density, the Dedication Matrix was also designed to base recreational\nopen space requirements on the estimated number of bedrooms in a given development rather than the more\ntypical dedication based upon the number of dwelling units, since bedroom counts better represent the actual\nnumber of residents for whom an appropriate amount of recreational open space is needed. For the purposes\nof good faith estimation, all single-family developments will dedicate open space at a rate of three and one-half\n(3.5) bedrooms per unit unless otherwise stipulated. In the absence of known building specifications, duplexes,\ntownhomes, and multifamily will dedicate open space at a rate of two and one-half (2.5) bedrooms per unit.\n4.\nRecreational Open Space Dedication Matrix.

Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA).\n1.\nPurpose. TIAs are used to evaluate whether or not the scale of development is appropriate for a particular site\nand what improvements may be necessary, on and off the site, to provide safe and efficient access and traffic\nflow. It is an essential part of the development review process to assist developers and government agencies in\nmaking land use decisions involving annexations, subdivisions, rezoning, special land uses, and other\ndevelopment reviews.\nAs a specialized study that evaluates the effects of a development's traffic on the surrounding transportation\ninfrastructure, the TIA helps identify where the development may have a significant impact on safety, traffic\nand transportation operations, and provides a means for the developer and government agencies to mitigate\nthese impacts.\n2.\nThreshold. A TIA, meeting the requirements of Section 12.3(J), is necessary in the following instances:\na.\nFor any proposed rezoning, preliminary subdivision, or master plan if the nature of the proposed rezoning\nor development is such that the number of trips it can be expected to generate equals or exceeds one-\nhundred fifty (150) new peak hour trips; or\nb.\nWhen the Land Use Administrator determines:\ni.\nThat a new project's traffic will substantially affect an intersection or a roadway segment already\nidentified as operating at a failing level of service (LOS), or\nii.\nThat a project may create a hazard to public safety, or\niii.\nThat a project will substantially change the off-site transportation system or connections to it.\nE. Vehicular Connectivity. Traffic studies have shown that highly connected street networks provide much greater\ntraffic throughput and mobility for a community, at less cost. A high degree of connectivity should occur not only\nat the level of arterials but also on collector, local, and other secondary roads. Such connectivity vastly improves a\nstreet network's performance. The street pattern should not force short trips of one (1) or two (2) miles onto\narterials; it should be possible to make trips of this sort by using collector or other secondary streets. With a highly\nconnected street network, cross-town trips should be possible using fairly direct secondary roads.\n1.\nGeneral Street Layout. In general, streets should be designed and located SO that they relate to the\ntopography, preserve natural features such as streams and tree growth, and provide adequate public safety and\nconvenience for motorists, cyclists and pedestrians alike. To accomplish this, local public and private streets\nmay incorporate traffic calming devices in conformance with the Town's \"Traffic Calming Policy\" as most\nrecently adopted by the Town Council.\nThe proposed street layout shall also be coordinated with the existing street system of the surrounding area.\nWhere a through street or a series of streets establishes a connection between two (2) public streets, such street\nshall be a public street.\n2.\nStreet Classification.

The number of\nfurther open and functioning vehicular access points shall be controlled and determined by the development's\nTown-approved TIA (Section 12.3 (J)). If a TIA should establish a higher standard for the number of open and\nfunctioning vehicular access points from the existing public street system, the requirement of the TIA shall\nprevail. The requirements herein shall not preclude a development from also meeting the following\nconnectivity index required in Section 11.3(E)(7). For purposes of this section, a median-divided vehicular\naccess point counts as a single vehicular access point.

A Connectivity Index shall be used to determine the adequacy of street layout design.\nThis is calculated as the ratio of the number of street links (road sections between intersections) in the project's street\nlayout divided by the number of street nodes (intersections and cul-de-sac heads). For comparison purposes, a\nperfect grid has a Connectivity Index of 2.00 or higher, while a conventional cul-de-sac subdivision is often\n1.00 or less.

Standards for Review. Approval of development through a Planned Unit Development Overlay\nDistrict rezoning, including modifications to the requirements of this UDO, is a privilege and will be\nconsidered by the Town only in direct response to the accrual of tangible benefits from the planned\nunit development to the Town or the neighborhood in which it would be located. These benefits shall\nbe in the form of exceptional amenities, outstanding environmental, landscape, architectural, or site\ndesign, or the conservation of special man-made or natural features of the site. In reviewing an\napplication for a planned unit development, the LURB and/or the Town Council, as the case may be,\nshall be required to make certain findings based on the following standards:\na) Required Findings. No application for a Planned Unit Development Overlay District Rezoning\nshall be approved unless all the following findings are made about the proposal:\n(i)\nComprehensive Plan. The planned unit development shall conform with the general\nplanning policies of the Town as set forth in the Comprehensive Plan and other adopted\npolicy documents.\n(ii) Public Welfare. The planned unit development shall be SO designed, located, and proposed\nto be operated and maintained that it will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to\nadjacent property and will not substantially increase the danger of fire or otherwise endanger\nthe public health, safety, and welfare.\n(iii) Impact on Other Property. The planned unit development shall not be injurious to the use\nor enjoyment of other property in the neighborhood for the purposes permitted in the\ndistrict, shall not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of\nsurrounding properties for uses permitted in the zoning district, shall not be inconsistent\nwith the community character of the neighborhood, shall not alter the essential character of\nthe neighborhood and shall be consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies set forth in\nthe Comprehensive Plan, and shall not substantially diminish or impair property values\nwithin the neighborhood, or be incompatible with other property in the immediate vicinity.\n(iv) Impact on Public Facilities and Resources. The planned unit development shall be SO\ndesigned that adequate utilities, road access, drainage, and other necessary facilities will be\nprovided to serve it. The planned unit development shall include such impact donations as\nmay be reasonably determined by the Town Council. These required impact donations shall\nbe calculated in reasonable proportion to the impact of the planned unit development on\npublic facilities and infrastructure.\n(v) Archaeological, Historical, or Cultural Impact. The planned unit development shall not\nsubstantially adversely impact a known archaeological, historical, or cultural resource located\non or off the parcel(s) proposed for development.\nTown of Knightdale\nChapter 12 - Administrative Standards\nKnightdale Next UDO Update\nPage 44 of 72\n"}, {"page": "299", "text": "Development Processes\n(vi) Parking and Traffic. The planned unit development shall have or make adequate provision\nto provide necessary parking and ingress and egress to the proposed use in a manner that\nminimizes traffic congestion in the public streets and provides adequate access for\nemergency vehicles.\n(vii) Adequate Buffering. The planned unit development shall have adequate landscaping,\npublic open space, and other buffering features to protect uses within the development and\nsurrounding properties.\n(viii) Performance. The applicant shall demonstrate a successful history of having completed one\nor more recent projects of comparable value and complexity to provide the Town with\nreasonable assurance that, if authorized, the planned development can be completed\naccording to schedule as designed.\nb)\nModification Standards. In addition to the findings required above, the following standards\nshall be utilized in considering Site Development Allowances. These standards shall not be\nregarded as inflexible but shall be used as a framework by the Town to test the quality of the\namenities, benefits to the community, and design and desirability of the proposal.\n(i) Place Making.\n(ii) Integrated Design. A planned unit development shall be laid out and developed as a unit in\naccordance with an integrated overall design. This design shall provide for safe, efficient,\nconvenient, and harmonious grouping of structures, uses, and facilities, and for appropriate\nrelation of space inside and outside buildings to intended uses and structural features.\n(iii) Beneficial Common Open Space. Common open space in excess of what is required by\nthis UDO in the planned unit development shall be integrated into the overall design. Such\nspaces shall have a direct functional or visual relationship to the main building(s) and not be\nof isolated or leftover character. The following would not be considered usable common\nopen space:\n1.\nAreas reserved for the exclusive use or benefit of an individual tenant or owner.\n2.\nDedicated streets, alleys, and other public rights-of-way.\n3.\nVehicular drives, parking, loading, and storage area.\n4.\nIrregular or unusable narrow strips of land less than fifteen (15) feet wide.\n5.

A development approach in which a building is sited on one (1) or more lot lines\nwith no yard. Conceivably, three (3) of the four (4) sides of the building could be on the lot lines. The\nintent is to allow more flexibility in site design and to increase the amount of usable open space on\nthe lot. Virtually all zoning ordinances retain yard requirements; where zero lot line developments\nhave been permitted, they have been handled through group development procedures, or other\nprocesses which allow for site plan review. The few ordinances which specifically authorize the zero\nlot line approach do SO as an exception to prevailing regulations and under clearly defined\ncircumstances. In Knightdale, GR, UR, RMX, NMX, TC and HB districts allow for zero lot line\ndevelopment.\nB.\nZoning. A police power measure, enacted via ordinance and including both text and a map by\ngeneral purpose units of local government, in which the community is divided into districts or zones\nwithin which permitted and special uses are established, as well as regulations governing lot size,\nbuilding bulk, placement and other development standards. Zoning requirements vary from district\nto district.\nC.\nZoning Amendment. An amendment to or a change in the zoning ordinance. An amendment can\ntake three (3) forms:\nZoning amendments, like enactment of the original ordinance, are legislative acts that cannot be\ndelegated to administrative officials. According to state law, planning boards make recommendations\nand town councils approve or deny zoning amendments.\nC.\nZoning District. A section of a town designated in the zoning ordinance text and delineated on the\nzoning map, in which requirements for the use of land and building and development standards are\nprescribed.\nD.\nZoning Map.
