The Comprehensive Plan serves as the statement of goals, recommendations,\nand\npolicies guiding the development of the physical environment of the Town, its extraterritorial jurisdiction, and any other geographic areas specifically addressed by the Comprehensive Plan. The goals, vision,\nrecommendations, and policies of the Comprehensive Plan may be amended from time to time to meet the changing requirements of the Town and any other geographic areas addressed by the Comprehensive\nPlan. Any reference to the Comprehensive Plan in effect prior to January 24, 2017 shall be interpreted as referring to the Cary Community Plan adopted on January 24, 2017 and associated documents, as\namended. Procedures for amending the Comprehensive Plan are set forth in Section 3.2. The Comprehensive Plan serves as the plan required by G.S. 160D-501.\n1.4.2 Legal Effect\nAll development and redevelopment within the Town and its extraterritorial jurisdiction should be in accordance with the policy direction provided by all of the applicable elements or volumes of the\nComprehensive Plan, as adopted or amended by the Town Council. Amendments to the text of this Ordinance (see Section 3.3) and/or rezoning of property (see Section 3.4) may be required in order to ensure\ncompliance with this section.\n1.4.3 Components of the Comprehensive Plan\nThe Comprehensive Plan consists of the following documents:\n(A) Cary Community Plan\nThe Cary Community Plan is a long-range policy document that expresses the Town's official long-term vision, values, and policies related to a wide range of topics including housing and neighborhoods;\neconomic growth and resilience; economic development; land development and urban form; public transportation facilities and services; and a wide range of municipal public services, including utilities, public\nsafety, environmental protection, solid waste, and others. As such, the Cary Community Plan provides guidance to the Town's current and future decision-makers regarding land development, capital\nimprovements, public facilities and services, and public programs. It directs growth by providing a policy framework to guide the evaluation and consideration of zoning map and text amendments, annexations,\nand development plans. The plan is also used to direct provision of public infrastructure, programs, and services, and aid and inform decisions for private sector investment.\nWhile the Cary Community Plan is primarily a policy-based plan, it also provides overarching guidance for the geographic arrangement of future development. This is provided via a \"Future Growth\nFramework,\" expressed in Chapter 6, \"Shape\". The Future Growth Framework includes a Future Growth Framework Map that geographically organizes the Town's physical layout, structure and character\ninto\nvarious development categories for residential and commercial uses, mixed use areas, business and employment areas, and open spaces. The plan also provides specialized policy guidance for a number of\n\"Special Planning Areas,\" which are geographic subareas of the overall planning area. For each Special Planning Area, the plan provides a unique vision, policies, and a more highly detailed future growth\nframework and maps.\nThe Town's Comprehensive Transportation Plan consists of Chapter 7, \"Move,\" and its associated appendices from the Cary Community Plan, together with the 2012 Greenways Master Plan Map and\nChapter 6, \"Greenways & Trails,\" from the 2012 Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Master Plan and any associated appendices and updates.\n(B) Appendices of the Cary Community Plan\nThe following plans are expressly incorporated into the Cary Community Plan and are contained in its Appendix. All of the documents in the Appendix are considered part of the Cary Community Plan and\nthe Comprehensive Plan.\n(1) Chatham/Cary Joint Land Use Plan\nThe Chatham-Cary Joint Land Use Plan covers over eighteen thousand (18,000) acres located east of Jordan Lake in Chatham County. The area is bordered by White Oak Creek to the south, Wake\nCounty to the east, Durham County to the north and Jordan Lake to the west. The Plan is an official policy document adopted by the Chatham County Board of Commissioners and Cary Town Council meant to\nguide future land use regulations, public infrastructure improvements and development. By guiding and limiting future development and infrastructure improvements, the Plan aims to maintain the rural form and\ncharacter\nof most of the area, while still accommodating a limited amount of suburban growth in the area closest to Research Triangle Park and the Western Wake Freeway. The plan also seeks to protect water\nquality in Jordan Lake.\n(2) Historic Preservation Master Plan\nThe Historic Preservation Master Plan provides a framework for the development of the Town's formal preservation program, and will serve as a guide for proactive preservation decision-making. The Plan\nsynthesizes the Town's existing preservation efforts with the desires expressed by the community during the planning process, and recommends actions for integrating historic preservation into Town policies and\nregulatory activities. The scope of this Plan includes the Town's entire planning area, which includes Cary's extraterritorial jurisdiction.\n(3) Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Resources Master Plan\nThe Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Resources Master Plan charts a course for providing a balanced system of cultural arts, active recreation, passive recreation, and conservation facilities to all residents.\nIt recognizes current needs within the Town and allows for the flexibility to incorporate future facilities that will address trends and the needs of residents as the Town grows.\n(4) Public Art Master Plan\nThe Public Art Master Plan suggests venues, art types, and themes for public art based on public input and an urban design analysis of existing and desired conditions, and identifies numerous educational\nand outreach programs for implementation\n(5) Consolidated Housing Plan\nThe Consolidated Housing and Community development plan provides a framework for the Town to assess its affordable housing and community development needs, and to make data-driven, place-\nbased investment decisions in response to them. The consolidated planning process also serves as the mechanism for community dialogue to identify housing and community development priorities that inform\nand focus funding from the federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program and from the Town's general fund.\n1.4.4 Other Plans, Ordinances and Manuals\nIn addition to the Comprehensive Plan, other plans and manuals contain additional recommendations, policies, and standards regarding development within the Town. It is the intent of the Town to administer\nthis Ordinance in accordance with these supplemental plans and manuals, including subsequent amendments. Amendments to these supplemental plans and manuals shall not be required to follow the\nprocedures for amending the Comprehensive Plan set forth in Section 3.2.\nPlans, manuals and ordinances containing recommendations, policies, and standards regarding development within the Town include, but are not limited to, the following:\n(1) Town of Cary Code of Ordinances\n(2) Standard Specifications and Details Manual\n(3) Community Appearance Manual\n(4) Site Design Standards\n(5) Downtown Streetscape Master Plan\n(6) Swift Creek Land Management Plan\n(7) Long Range Water Resources Plan\n(8) Reclaimed Water Master Plan\n(9) Wastewater Collection System Plan\n(10) Water Distribution System Plan\n(Ord.

The Planning and Development Services Department will keep and maintain the Zoning Map.\n1.5.2 Interpretation of District Boundaries\nWhere uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the zoning districts shown on the Zoning Map, the Planning Director shall use the rules set forth below to interpret the Zoning Map. Appeals shall be\nmade to the Zoning Board of Adjustment pursuant to Section 3.21.\n(A) Where the Zoning Map shows a zoning district boundary line located within or following a street or alley right-of-way, railroad or utility line right-of-way, easement, or waterway, the district boundary shall\nbe considered to be in the center of the right-of-way, easement, or waterway.

LDO section)\nE Evidentiary\n(G) [Reserved]\n(H) Expanded Published Notice Authorized\nIf a zoning map amendment proposes to change the zoning designation of more than fifty (50) properties, owned by at least fifty (50) different property owners, expanded published notice may be given in\nlieu of written (mailed) notice as provided in G.S. 160D-602(b).\n3.1.7 Hearing Procedures\nThe procedures and requirements set forth in this section shall apply to all hearings required by this Ordinance, both legislative public hearings and quasi-judicial evidentiary hearings at which evidence is\nsubmitted and testimony given under oath, unless a contrary intent is indicated.\n(A) When the Town has determined that an application is complete and that a hearing is required by this Ordinance, the Director shall schedule a date, time, and place for the required hearing, and shall\nensure that all notices are provided pursuant to Section 3.1.6 above.\n(B) If any resident or property owner submits a written statement regarding a proposed amendment, modification, or repeal to a zoning regulation, including a text or map amendment, to the Town Clerk at\nleast two business days prior to the proposed vote on such change, the Clerk shall deliver such written statement to the Town Council. If the proposed change is the subject of a quasi-judicial proceeding, the Clerk\nshall provide only the names and addresses of the individuals providing written comment, and the provision of such names and addresses to the decision-making body shall not disqualify any member of the body\nfrom voting.\n(C) Any person may appear and speak at a legislative public hearing. Legislative public hearing comments should be directed toward the substance of the proposed action. In quasi-judicial evidentiary\nhearings, the applicant, Town staff, and any person who would have standing to appeal the decision under G.S. 160D-1402(c) may participate as a party. Other witnesses may present competent, material, and\nsubstantial evidence that is not repetitive.\n(D) Each person who appears at a hearing shall identify himself or herself and his or her address and, if appearing on behalf of an organization, shall state the name and mailing address of the organization,\nand shall observe any rules related to the conduct of the hearing adopted by Council or the appropriate board.\n(E) All testimony and evidence given in a quasi-judicial evidentiary hearing in front of the Zoning Board of Adjustment, the Historic Preservation Commission, or the Town Council shall be given under oath or\nby affirmation to the body conducting the hearing.\n(F) In a quasi-judicial evidentiary hearing, any party participating in the hearing or their legal representative may, upon receiving proper recognition from the chairperson of the body conducting the hearing,\nquestion or cross-examine other persons appearing as witnesses who present adverse evidence or testimony.\n(G) In a quasi-judicial evidentiary hearing, the chairperson of the body conducting the hearing may exclude any testimony, evidence, or questioning that the chairperson finds to be incompetent, irrelevant,\nimmaterial, or unduly repetitious.\n(H) In a quasi-judicial evidentiary hearing, at any time upon reasonable request, any person may examine the application and materials submitted in support of or in opposition to an application. The Town\nshall ensure that copies of such materials are made available.\n3.1.8 Conditions of Approval\nSome procedures set forth in this chapter authorize the decision-making body to impose such conditions upon the premises benefited by the approval as may be necessary to reduce or minimize any potential\nadverse impact upon other property in the area, or to carry out the general purpose and intent of the Comprehensive Plan and this Ordinance. In such cases, any conditions attached to approvals shall be directly\nrelated to the impacts of the proposed use or development and shall be reasonable and appropriate. In no case shall a condition of approval be less restrictive than the requirements of this Ordinance.\n3.1.9 Simultaneous Processing of Development Applications\nWhere possible without creating an undue administrative burden on the Town's decision-making bodies and staff, this Ordinance intends to accommodate the simultaneous processing of applications for\ndifferent permits and approvals that may be required for the same development project in order to expedite the overall review process. Review and decision-making bodies considering applications submitted\nsimultaneously shall render separate recommendations and decisions on each application based on the specific standards applicable to each approval.\n(A) Examples of concurrent filing and processing of applications include, but are not limited to:\n(1) A development plan along with a special use;\n(2) A development plan and a proposed amendment to a planned development master plan; and\n(3) A variance along with a special use or development plan.\n(B) No rezoning application shall be accepted or processed while an application for any of the permits or approvals listed in this chapter is pending for the same property, and vice versa. This general rule has\nthe following exceptions:\n(1) A rezoning application may be submitted along with an owner-initiated annexation petition (see Section 3.1.10 below).\n(2) A rezoning application may be submitted along with a development plan provided that the plan complies with the zoning already in place at the time the plan is submitted.\n(3) A rezoning application to a conditional use district may be submitted along with a development plan even if the plan does not conform to current zoning, provided the development plan will be a condition\nof the conditional use zoning.\n(4) A rezoning application to a flexible use district may be submitted along with a development plan.\n(C) Some forms of approval depend on the applicant having previously received another form of approval, or require the applicant to take particular action within some time period following the approval\nin\norder to avoid having the approval lapse. Therefore, even though this Ordinance intends to accommodate simultaneous processing, applicants should note that each of the permits and approvals set forth in this\nchapter has its own timing and review sequence.\n3.1.10 Owner-Initiated Annexation Petitions\n(A) Where the owner or developer of a property wishes the Town to annex the property into the Town's corporate boundaries as well as to approve proposed development on the property, then an owner-\ninitiated annexation petition must be processed and considered by the Town Council. The petition shall be accompanied either by a rezoning application consistent with Sections 3.4 and 4.1.3 of this Ordinance or\na development plan for the property.\n(1) All owner-initiated annexation petitions shall be submitted and reviewed in accordance with the Town's policy statements on owner-initiated annexation petitions and annexation policy, as may be\namended from time to time by the Town Council. The Town Council has discretion as to whether it annexes the property. The owner-initiated annexation petition shall include all the property that is subject to the\nrezoning or development plan.\n(2) For properties located within the Town's extraterritorial jurisdiction, if a rezoning application is submitted with the annexation petition, the rezoning and annexation shall be processed and approved\nsimultaneously. For properties located outside the Town's extraterritorial jurisdiction, the annexation petition must be approved prior to the rezoning application.\n(3) If a development plan is submitted with the annexation petition, the decision-making body responsible for approving the development plan may not approve the plan until the annexation has been\napproved.\n(B) All proposals to connect to the Town's water and/or sanitary sewer system shall be required to submit a petition for annexation into the Town's corporate boundaries at the time an application for rezoning\nor development plan approval is filed with the Town.\n(C) Any development plan seeking to create a use that is considered to be urban development, and is inside the Town's extraterritorial jurisdiction, shall be required to submit an annexation petition regardless\nof whether or not connection to Town's water and/or sanitary sewer system is necessary.\n3.1.11 Processing Cycles\nThe Planning Director shall issue timetables for reviewing each type of development application or procedure under this chapter. Processing timetables will be advisory, and failure to meet processing goals will\nnot result in deemed approvals. Failure by an applicant to meet processing goals may result in a delayed review process. Timetables may be revised from time to time and may include:\n(A) Dates of regular meetings of review bodies and decision-makers;\n(B) Deadlines for receipt of a complete application for consideration of such application at a particular meeting; and\n(C) Schedule and routing of staff and agency reviews.\n3.1.12 Inaction by Review and Decision-Making Bodies\n14 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "15", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be..\nWhen a review or decision-making body fails to take action on an application within the time required (which varies by type of application), such inaction shall be deemed a denial of the application, unless the\ndecision-making body agrees to an extension of the time frame.\n3.1.13 Lapse of Approval\nThe lapse of approval time frames established by the procedures of this chapter may be extended only when all of the following conditions exist:\n(A) The provisions of this chapter must expressly allow the extension;\n(B) An extension request must be filed prior to the applicable lapse-of-approval deadline;\n(C) The extension request must be in writing and include justification; and\n(D) Unless otherwise noted, authority to grant extensions of time shall rest with the decision-making body that granted the original approval (the one being extended).\n3.1.14 Common Review and Approval Procedures\nDevelopment application review shall be discontinued, and development permits shall expire, pursuant to G.S. 143-755 and G.S. 160D-108. For purposes of this section, \"development permit\" has the\nmeaning set out in G.S. 143-755.\n3.1.15 Development Approval\nA development approval shall be in writing and may be provided in print or electronic form; if electronic form is used, then it must be protected from further editing. Unless provided otherwise by law, all rights,\nprivileges, benefits, burdens, and obligations created by development approvals made pursuant to this chapter attach to and run with the land.\n3.1.16 Revocation of Development Approval\nIf any development approval is revoked pursuant to this Ordinance, the review and approval of the revocation shall follow the same development review and approval process required for issuance of the\ndevelopment approval, including any required notice or hearing.

The Director may submit a proposed cosmetic amendment to the Town Council for their approval\nif the Director desires advice and consent from the Council. Cosmetic changes submitted to the Town Council for review do not require a public hearing, public notification, or action by the Planning and Zoning\nBoard.\n3.2.2 Regular Review of the Comprehensive Plan\nThe Planning Director shall initiate a regular review of the Comprehensive Plan, assisted as necessary by the directors of other Town departments and advisory boards. Such Review shall include an overall\nassessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the existing Plan, including identification of new issues not adequately addressed by the Plan, issues which require further study and investigation, suggested\nimprovements, and specific revisions to Plan maps and policies requested by citizens. As a result of a review, the Planning Director may pursue one or more of the following major planning processes:\n(1) Preparation of a new comprehensive plan;\n(2) An update to the existing plan such that a new or expanded vision is introduced.\nThe major planning processes above shall include opportunities for citizen engagement in plan preparation.

The purpose is not to relieve particular hardships, nor to confer special privileges or rights\non any person, but only to make adjustments to the Zoning Map that are necessary in light of changed conditions or changes in public policy, or that are necessary to advance the general welfare of the Town.\n(B) Conditional Use and Flexible Use District Rezonings Distinguished\n(1) Applications for the rezoning of property to a conditional use district are governed by the procedures set forth both in this Section 3.4.1 and also in Section 3.4.2. For purposes of this Ordinance,\nconditional use district zoning means \"conditional zoning\" as defined by G.S. 160D-102(7), and conditional use district means \"conditional district\" as permitted by G.S. 160D-703.\n(2) An application for rezoning to a general use district shall not be converted into an application for rezoning to a conditional use district at any point in the application review process, nor shall an\napplication for rezoning to a conditional use district be converted into an application for rezoning to a general use district. If such a conversion is desired, the applicant must submit a new application for rezoning to\nthe other type of district in accordance with the requirements of this Section 3.4.\n(3) Applications for the rezoning of property to the MXD Flexible Use District are governed by the procedures set forth in Section 3.4.5.\n(C) Relationship to the Comprehensive Plan\nWhere a proposed rezoning appears to be inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan, the Planning Director or the applicant may initiate a substantive plan amendment as provided in Section 3.2. A plan\namendment and a zoning amendment may be considered concurrently.\n(D) Procedure\n(1) Initiation of Amendments and Filing of Applications\nA rezoning may be initiated by any review or decision-making body; by application from any owner (or owner's agent) of land for which the rezoning is requested; or by any owner or resident of land within\nfive hundred (500) feet of the land for which the rezoning is requested, but only as long as the rezoning is not a \"down-zoning\" as defined in G.S. 160D-601. When the owner of land is not an individual, then the\nrezoning application shall include a disclosure statement that indicates the type of entity involved, and the name and address of each person who holds ten (10) percent or more of the business entity. When the\nowner of land is publicly-owned business entity, then the rezoning application shall include a disclosure statement that indicates the name and address of each person who holds twenty-five (25) percent or more\nof the business entity. An application requesting the rezoning shall be filed with the Planning Department.\n(2) Pre-Application Conference\nBefore filing an application, a private-party applicant may request a pre-application conference with the Planning Director. See Section 3.1.5.\n(3) Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA)\nA Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) or Traffic Analysis Report (TAR) is required if the proposed new zoning district could result in a use or mix of uses that can be expected to generate one hundred (100) or\nmore total peak hour trips. Total peak hour trips represent gross trips expected to be generated by the proposed new zoning district prior to applying any reduction for internal trips.\n(a) Preparing the TIA\nThe Town shall prepare or have prepared (using Town staff or a retained consultant) the written TIA.\n(b) Study Area Boundaries\nThe extent of the study area for the TIA depends upon the location and size of the rezoning and the prevailing conditions of the surrounding area. The study area is defined in the following table.\nControlled access roadways are not included in the study area or analysis; the controlled access ramp intersections with non-controlled access roadways are subject to analysis. The distances described below\nare to be measured from the property boundaries and include those intersections within the identified area.\n(c) Trip Generation Standards\nTrip generation data for each project shall be based upon the Institute of Traffic Engineers' Trip Generation Manual or, at the discretion of the Town, other sources of trip generation data (e.g., local data)\nif this source data is deemed more representative of the proposed development use. The following other standards also apply to projects:\n1. Defining Peak Hour Trips\nPeak hour trips are those occurring on peak travel demand days on the adjacent roadway (e.g., daily trips on a Sunday may not be applicable). It is not the intent of this section to require a TIA for a\nuse that generates trips that meet or exceed the threshold but do not occur during the adjacent roadway system's peak hour. For example, facilities designed for sporting events, concerts or other similar uses may\nnot require a traffic analysis because the events occur during a non-peak hour or non-peak day. If a traffic study is required for a use, then the analysis shall be based upon the normal trip generation for\nthe\nproposed use and not that associated with special event(s).\n2. Credit for Mixed Use, Pass-By Trips\nThe determination of the number of trips generated shall also take into account pass-by trips, internal trip capture for integrated mixed use projects (e.g., roadway and/or pedestrian connectivity) and\nany proposed transportation demand management system, provided that adequate guarantees can be provided to the Town to ensure that such demand management system will function as claimed for the life of\nthe project. In addition, if the proposed development is designed and integrated with an adjacent mixed use project (e.g., roadways), then a credit for trips may be permitted.\n3. Estimated Trips for Rezonings/PDDs\nIn evaluating the impact of a proposed rezoning or planned development where the specific uses or exact number of dwelling units have not been specified, estimates shall be based upon the highest\nlevel of density or intensity of use that would be authorized by the requested approvals. However, if the highest level of intensity of use is a use that generates trips that meet or exceed the threshold but do not\noccur\nduring\nthe\nadjacent roadway system's peak hour, such as athletic fields, outdoor amphitheaters, or other similar uses, then the analysis shall be based upon the normal trip generation for the proposed use\nand not that associated with special event(s).\n(d) Submission Requirements\nAt the time of the initial submission, the applicant is required to submit the following information:\n1. Traffic analysis base information, site location map, site layout, if applicable;\n2. Data on the existing/proposed land use;\n3. Description of the project.\n4. Additional information as may be requested by staff.\n5. Study Fee\nAfter preliminary review of the data submitted under item (d) above, the Town shall prepare an estimate of consulting fees for the analysis of traffic impact for the project.

After completion of the analysis, the Town shall evaluate\nthe actual costs incurred for the study and will reimburse to the applicant any remaining balance of the fee paid.\n(e) Required Factors to Include in Study\nThe TIA shall evaluate the projected impact of the proposed rezoning on the public facilities in question at the time of projected build-out, which will be assumed to be five (5) years from the date the\nrezoning application was submitted. This analysis will take into account not only the status of existing facilities and the impact of the proposed development, but also the projected impact of the following on the\ncapacity of those facilities:\n1. Future capital improvements that will increase the capacity of the facilities in question should be considered if construction of the improvements has received all necessary governmental approvals\nand funding is in place, or that such approvals and funding appear reasonably certain.\n2. All residential dwelling lots (excluding those for multi-family uses) that have received final plat approval but that do not contain a completed dwelling.\n3. All development plans that have been approved, so long as such approvals have not expired.\n4. For any developments for which the notice to proceed has been granted for a traffic study, even if the traffic study is not complete at the time of scoping the background traffic for a subsequent study\nto\nbe conducted. If there is no additional action with regards to the project within six (6) months after the completion to the traffic study (such as a rezoning application submitted or approved), the traffic from the\ncompleted study will no longer be included in the background traffic for the subsequent study.\n5. No traffic from a previously approved planned development should be included as background traffic for the same planned development, if no development plan approval has been granted.\n6. Typical background traffic increases that are not directly related to known previously approved development.\n(f) Tracking of Required Factors\nThe staff shall develop a system of keeping track of the factors described in subsection (e) above.\n(g) Level of Service\nThe TIA shall measure and report the Level of Service (LOS) at peak hours for each intersection within the required study area, with LOS as defined by the most current edition of the Highway Capacity\nManual. If the projected LOS for any intersection in the central zone, as defined in Section 7.11.16 of the LDO, is LOS \"F\", the TIA shall list potential transportation system improvements that would ensure there\nis\nno increase in average delay for the intersection (measured in its entirety). If the projected LOS in the base zone, as defined in Section 7.11.16 of the LDO, falls below LOS \"D\" based upon the standard ITE\naverage peak hour, the TIA shall list potential transportation system improvements that would ensure there is no increase in average delay for the intersection (measured in its entirety). However, no transportation\nsystem improvements shall be listed for intersections for which the existing intersection configuration already meets the requirements of the Comprehensive Transportation Plan.\nAll forms of transportation system improvements should be considered at non-signalized intersections, including separate left and right turn lanes, geometric modifications, alternative access\nmanagement strategies, and signalization. Signalization should not be considered the primary solution. Installation of new signals at existing or new intersections should only be considered when the intersection\nmeets required warrants for a signal; the signal does not cause an undesirable delay in the surrounding road system; and other transportation improvements do not result in acceptable levels-of-service.\n(h) Expiration of TIA\nThe TIA shall expire after five (5) years.\n(i) No application for a rezoning shall be accepted by the Town of Cary until the draft findings of the TIA have been received unless the Development Review Committee agrees in advance that the draft\nfindings may be submitted within a week after the date of the rezoning application.\n(4) Neighborhood Meeting\n(a) Applicability\nThis section 3.4.1(D)(4) shall apply to all rezoning applications filed and accepted as complete.\n(b) Procedure\nNeighborhood meetings for complete rezoning applications shall be held at a date, time and location established and scheduled by staff. At the neighborhood meeting, each applicant shall conduct a\nmeeting with any attendee interested in that proposed rezoning. The applicant shall record meeting minutes and provide the Town a digital copy of the written meeting minutes. The purpose of this neighborhood\nmeeting is to ensure that nearby property owners are aware of the request and have an opportunity to inform the applicant of issues and concerns prior to the public hearing.\nA general orientation meeting shall be conducted by staff for all applications at the beginning of each neighborhood meeting.\n(c) Alternative Outreach for Certain Rezoning Cases\nAn alternative means of conducting public outreach, such as one (1) or more open houses, may be utilized in lieu of the neighborhood meeting for widespread zoning changes initiated for the general\npurpose of implementing the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan. Examples of such changes include the establishment and application of new types of zoning districts or widespread changes to the\napplicability of or location of existing zoning districts or overlay districts. The Town shall provide outreach and input opportunities as needed to ensure that citizens have an opportunity to ask questions and\nunderstand the proposed rezoning prior to the public hearing. Notification shall include posting on the Town's web site, and, based on the nature of the change and the number of parcels affected, either mailing of\na\nnotice to individual property owners affected, or publication of a half (1/2) page ad in a local newspaper.\nThe standard neighborhood meeting shall be required for all citizen-initiated rezoning requests and all town-initiated rezoning requests for Town-owned property.\n(5) Public Notice\nPublished, written, and posted notice of public hearings shall be provided in accordance with Section 3.1.6.\n(6) Public Hearings\nAt\nleast one (1) public hearing shall be held before Town Council in accordance with Section 3.1.7, provided, however, that only the first public hearing shall require written (mailed) notice.\nThe Planning Director shall review each proposed rezoning in light of the approval criteria of paragraph (E) and distribute the application to the Development Review Committee and, as deemed necessary,\nto other reviewers. Based on the results of those reviews, the Director shall provide a report to the Town Council at the initial public hearing on the proposed rezoning. This report shall include a discussion of all\nplans and policies that have been adopted by the Town and are relevant to the proposed amendment.\n(7) Planning and Zoning Board Recommendation on Rezoning\nFollowing the initial public hearing before the Town Council, the Planning and Zoning Board shall consider the proposed rezoning and shall submit a written recommendation to the Town Council that\naddresses whether the proposed amendment is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and other officially adopted applicable plans and addresses other matters deemed appropriate by one (1) or more Board\nmembers. The Planning and Zoning Board shall determine their recommendation within ninety (90) days of the first meeting at which the proposed rezoning is presented to them for review. The Planning and\nZoning Board may request an extension of time from the Town Council. If no recommendation is determined and no extension is granted within ninety (90) days, then the Town Council may act on the proposed\nrezoning without a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Board.\n(8) Town Council Action\n(a) After reviewing the reports of the Planning Director and recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Board, the Town Council may call for a second public hearing or take one of the following actions\nbased on the rezoning considerations of paragraph (E):\n1. Approve the rezoning by ordinance;\n2. Reject the proposed rezoning;\n3. Refer the proposed rezoning back to the Planning and Zoning Board for further consideration;\n4. Table the proposed rezoning; or\n5. Rezone the property by ordinance to any zoning district that is classified higher than the district requested in the application for rezoning, but only with the consent of the applicant. See Section\n4.1.1 for an explanation of \"higher\" districts versus \"lower\" districts.\nPursuant to G.S. 160D-605, when approving or rejecting a rezoning, Town Council shall approve 1) a brief statement describing whether its action is consistent or inconsistent with the Comprehensive\nPlan, and 2) a statement analyzing the reasonableness of the proposed rezoning. The statement of reasonableness and the plan consistency statement may be approved as a single statement. If Town Council\napproves a rezoning and finds the rezoning to be inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan, the rezoning shall have the effect of also amending the Future Growth Framework Map in the Comprehensive Plan,\nand no additional request or application for a plan amendment shall be required. If a plan amendment was initiated as described in Section 3.4.1(C) and ran concurrently with the rezoning, the Future Growth\nFramework Map shall be amended in accordance with the plan amendment.\n(b) Failure of the Town Council to take one (1) of the actions listed above within ninety (90) days of the delivery of the Planning and Zoning Board's recommendation at a Council meeting shall be deemed\na denial of the rezoning request.\n(9) Withdrawal of Application\nA rezoning application not initiated by a Town review or decision-making body may be withdrawn by the applicant at any time prior to final Town Council action on the application. If an applicant fails to\npursue a rezoning application for a period of six (6) months, the application shall be deemed withdrawn.\n18 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "19", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be..\n(E) Rezoning Considerations\nWithout limiting Council's broad discretion, in reviewing proposed rezonings, Council may, among other things, consider whether:\n(1) The proposed rezoning corrects an error or meets the challenge of some changing condition, trend, or fact;\n(2) The proposed rezoning furthers the purposes and policies set forth in this Ordinance, including those set forth in Section 1.3 of this Ordinance; or\n(3) The proposed zoning classification is suitable for the subject property.\n(F) [Reserved]\n(G) Waiting Period for Subsequent Applications\n(1) When a rezoning application has been approved or denied by the Town Council, or has been withdrawn by the applicant after notice has been given of the public hearing on the application, no rezoning\napplication covering the same property shall be accepted or considered within twelve (12) months after the date of the approval, denial, or withdrawal. This restriction shall apply regardless of whether the new\napplication is for a different zoning classification than the original application.\n(2) The inclusion of an additional lot or lots in the new application shall not be permitted when it is evident that the inclusion of the new lot or lots is for the express purpose of avoiding these restrictions.\n(3) The waiting period required by this section may be waived in an individual case, for good cause shown, by the affirmative vote of three-fourths (3/4) of the members of the Town Council.\n(H) [Reserved]\n(I) Repair of Zoning Map Errors\nWhere errors are found on the Official Zoning Map, the repair of these errors is not considered to be a rezoning as described in Section 3.4 of this Ordinance. As a result, Zoning Map errors may be corrected\nupon adoption by the Town Council of a resolution noting and approving the correction. Though not required, Council may, in its discretion, call for a public hearing on the matter as part of its consideration. The\nmatter shall not be considered by the Planning and Zoning Board and action by the Council may be taken following the hearing.\n3.4.2 Rezonings to Conditional Use Districts\n(A) Purpose of Conditional Use Districts\nIf the regulations and restrictions of a general use zoning district are inadequate to ensure the compatibility of the proposed development with the immediately surrounding neighborhood in accordance with\nthe principles of the Comprehensive Plan and this Ordinance, the property owner may apply for rezoning to a conditional use district that bears the same designation as a general use zoning district but is a\nconditional use zoning district subject to additional conditions in which limited uses are permitted and that are contained in the ordinance approving the conditional use district.\n(B) Process Required\nA person petitioning for rezoning of a tract of land may elect to request a conditional use district for that tract. The conditional use district application must specify the intended use or usesand the proposed\nconditions for the property specified in the petition. The intended use or uses must be permitted in the corresponding general use district. The Town Council is to approve or disapprove the application on the basis\nof the specific use or uses and conditions proposed. Development in a conditional use district requires approval of a single application similar to a general use district rezoning application, which shall be reviewed\nby the Town Council through a legislative process.\n(1) Conditional Use Rezoning Process\nRezoning to a conditional use district shall require submission and approval of an application for a rezoning in accordance with the general procedures set forth in Section 3.4.1, as modified by this Section\n3.4.2. A rezoning to a conditional use district may be initiated only by an application signed by all of the owners of the property or by an agent authorized by all of the owners to file such application, which\napplication shall include the affidavit required by Section 3.4.2(C)(4) and (5). If the application is approved, the Town Council shall adopt an ordinance authorizing the requested use with such reasonable\nconditions as mutually approved by the applicant and Town Council and determined to be desirable in promoting public health, safety and general welfare.\n(C) Conditions\n(1) The conditional use rezoning application shall specify the use or uses that are intended for the property or any use or uses that are prohibited, as well as any additional conditions on the use of the\nproperty that the applicant may propose be conditions of the rezoning. The applicant may propose conditions regarding building design elements as defined in G.S. 160D-702 and other development\nconsiderations. Conditions are limited to:\n(a) Those that address conformance of the development and use of the site to Town ordinances or officially adopted plans; or\n(b) Those that address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development and use of the site.\n(2) An applicant may include a concept plan as a zoning condition in addition to written zoning conditions. A concept plan is a conceptual, illustrative plan that may not be used to eliminate or reduce any\nLDO or other requirement unless such elimination or reduction is designated as such and specifically provided for in this Ordinance. A concept plan shall show the overall site layout for the proposed development\nor a portion thereof including, but not limited to, development features such as:\n(a) Land uses;\n(b) Maximum number of residential units or non-residential square footage;\n(c) Any building setbacks and/or buffers that exceed minimum requirements of the LDO;\n(d) Natural open space areas to remain undisturbed;\n(e) Improved open space areas, including stormwater management devices; and\n(f) Vehicular and pedestrian access and circulation.\n(3)\nNo condition shall be less restrictive than the standards of the parallel general use district or the standards of any overlay district that applies to the property.\n(4) No condition shall be made part of the application, or shall be attached to approval of the conditional use district, which specifies the ownership status, race, religion, or character of the occupants\nof\nhousing units, the minimum value of improvements, or any other exclusionary device; which states that the use of the property will not be subject to regulations or restrictions set forth in this Ordinance which\nwould apply to the property in any event, such as the regulations for an overlay district which covers the property; or which sets a minimum square footage of any structures subject to regulation under the North\nCarolina Residential Code for One- and Two-Family Dwellings.\n(5) The applicant shall make no changes to proposed zoning conditions within fifteen (15) business days of a meeting at which the rezoning case is scheduled for consideration. Changes to proposed\nzoning conditions received after publication of the notice of the initial public hearing must be more restrictive than the conditions initially advertised. A revised affidavit meeting the requirements of Section 3.4.2(C)\n(6) which includes the revised conditions must be received by the Planning Department prior to the meeting at which the rezoning request is to be presented.\n(6) The conditional use rezoning application shall include an affidavit listing all proposed zoning conditions and provisions and attaching any proposed concept plan. A revised affidavit shall\nbe\nsubmitted\neach time the applicant proposes new zoning conditions or a new concept plan. The initial and revised affidavit shall state that:\n(a) All zoning conditions and provisions are freely offered as proposed zoning laws, based solely on the property owner/applicant's independent judgment;\nand\n(b) The property owner/applicant is not relying upon any statement by the Town staff or any member of the Town Council in connection with the decision to offer any zoning conditions, provisions or\nconcept plans; and\n(c) The property owner/applicant understands that other parties that have standing in the rezoning proceeding are relying on the validity of the zoning conditions, provisions and concept plans; and\n(d) The property owner/applicant intends for all future owners of the property to be bound by the zoning conditions, provisions and concept plans, should the Town Council adopt them as part of\nthe\nrezoning; and\n(e) The property owner/applicant will take all appropriate measures to ensure that future property owners are aware of the zoning conditions, provisions and concept plans.\n(D) Changes to Conditions of Approved Conditional Use District\n(1) Written Zoning Conditions\nAny change to written conditions attached to an approved conditional use rezoning shall be considered a change to the conditional use district, and shall be processed as a new conditional use application\nin accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 3.4.2.\n(2) Concept Plan\nStaff may only approve changes to approved concept plans if such changes fall within the criteria allowed for administrative approval under Section 3.19, Minor Modifications. Proposed changes that do not\nfall\nwithin the criteria allowed for approval in Section 3.19 shall proceed in the same manner as the original rezoning.\n(3) Eligibility for Zoning Amendments\nIf multiple parcels of land are subject to a conditional use district, the owners of individual parcels may apply for modification of the conditions applicable to their property so long as the modification would\nnot result in other properties failing to meet the terms of the conditions. Any modifications approved shall only be applicable to those properties whose owners petition for the modification.\n19 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "20", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be..\n3.4.3 Rezonings to Planned Development Districts\n(A) Applicability and Scope\nA planned development district (PDD) is a type of conditional zoning. No approval for construction of any on-site or off-site improvements in a PDD shall be granted until a master plan for the planned\ndevelopment is approved in accordance with the procedures and requirements of this section.\n(B) Rezoning Procedures Apply\nApplications requesting a rezoning to a PDD classification shall be submitted in accordance with the general rezoning procedures set forth in Section 3.4.1, as modified by the specific procedures set forth in\nthis Section 3.4.3.\n(C) Coordination with Review of Development Plans\nAn application for PDD master plan approval and any required application for development plan approval (Section 3.9) may be filed simultaneously. The review and processing of these applications shall be\ncoordinated and consolidated as much as possible. The Development Review Committee, the Planning and Zoning Board, and the Town Council, however, shall render separate reports, recommendations, and\ndecisions on each application based on the specific standards applicable to each approval.\n(D) Procedure\n(1) Pre-Application Conference\nBefore filing an application for PDD master plan approval, the applicant may request a pre-application conference with the Development Review Committee. See Section 3.1.5. The applicant shall provide\nthe Development Review Committee with the following information at the pre-application conference:\n(a) Size and location of the parcel proposed for development as a planned development;\n(b) Proposed gross density and/or the amount of non-residential square footage for the proposed planned development and net density of individual parcels within the PDD;\n(c) A concept plan showing general land uses proposed for the planned development including location, acreage, park, open space areas and school sites, if applicable;\n(d)\nNumber of acres and location of land within the parcel proposed for development as a planned development within a Watershed Protection Overlay district; and\n(e) A schematic description of utility and circulation improvements for the planned development.\n(2) Application Filing\nAn application for a PDD rezoning approval shall be filed and processed in accordance with the rezoning procedures set forth in Section 3.4.1. In addition, the application shall be accompanied by a master\nplan and supporting plans and documents as specified by the Planning Department. The application shall also include an affidavit, and a revised affidavit shall be submitted each time the applicant proposes\nrevisions to the master plan, stating that:\n(a) All zoning conditions and provisions are freely offered as proposed zoning laws, based solely on the property owner/applicant's independent judgment; and\n(b) The property owner/applicant is not relying upon any statement by the Town staff or any member of the Town Council in connection with the decision to offer any zoning conditions or provisions; and\n(c) The property owner/applicant understands that other parties that have standing in the rezoning proceeding are relying on the validity of the zoning conditions and provisions; and\n(d) The property owner/applicant intends for all future owners of the property to be bound by the zoning conditions and provisions should the Town Council adopt them as part of the rezoning; and\n(e) The property owner/applicant will take all appropriate measures to ensure that future property owners are aware of the zoning conditions and provisions.\n(3) Review by Town\nThe Development Review Committee, the Planning and Zoning Board, and the Town Council shall review the application and the proposed master land use plan for compliance with the requirements of\nSection 3.4.1 and also this Section 3.4.3.\n(4) Review by Other Bodies\nThe Development Review Committee may transmit the proposed master plan to the Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Resources Advisory Board, and/or any other board or commission, including the Wake\nCounty Board of Education, deemed appropriate by the Town Council for review and comment.\n(E) Considerations\nIn addition to the general approval considerations for rezonings set forth in Section 3.4.1(E), and without limiting council's broad discretion, council may, when reviewing a proposed PDD rezoning request,\nconsider whether the PDD designation is necessary to address a unique situation or represents a substantial benefit to the Town, compared to what could have been accomplished through strict application of\notherwise applicable zoning district standards.\n(F) Effect of Approval\n(1) The approval of a PDD application and a master plan shall not become effective until the applicant has submitted to the Planning Department a copy of the master plan incorporating all changes, if any,\nthat were required as conditions to Town Council approval, and such additional information as the Town Council may have required as a condition of PDD or master plan approval.\n(2) Upon receipt of all required submittals, the Planning Director shall mark and sign the master plan as approved, and return a marked and signed copy of the master plan to the applicant. A copy marked\n\"ORIGINAL\" shall be retained for the records of the Planning Department.\n(3) Actual development of the property comprising the approved PDD shall be subject to all applicable state requirements, development plan approvals, and other permits and approvals otherwise required\nby\nthis Ordinance. Such development shall comply with all requirements of this Ordinance unless the approved PDD documents specifically state otherwise.\n(G) Submission of Conditions\nConditions proposed by the applicant in the master plan are limited to those that address conformance of the development and use of the site to Town ordinances or officially adopted plans, or those that\naddress the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development and use of the site. The applicant may propose conditions regarding building design elements as defined in G.S. 160D-702 and\nother development considerations.

There is common management of the developments controlling the form of physical development or disposition of parcels of the development.\n(b) There is a reasonable closeness in time between the completion of eighty (80) percent or less of one (1) development and the submission to the Town of a master plan or series of plans or drawings\nfor the other development that is indicative of a common development effort.\n(c) The voluntary sharing of infrastructure that is indicative of a common development effort or is designated specifically to accommodate the developments.\n(d) There is a common advertising scheme or promotional plan in effect for the developments.\n(e) Any information provided by the applicant that the project is not being phased or subdivided to avoid requirements of this Ordinance.\n(3) Two Types of Plans\nThe applicant has the option to submit either a \"full plan\" application or a \"sketch plan\" application:\n(a) Full Plan Application\nA full plan application shall include information and supporting materials required as specified by the Planning Director. Once the application is complete, the Planning Department shall transmit the\napplication to the Development Review Committee. If the Committee determines that the materials comply with all applicable requirements of this Ordinance and Town specifications, then the Planning Director\nshall mark the plans as approved. If the Committee determines that the materials do not comply with all applicable requirements, or that meeting the applicable requirements would require a change to the plan\nthat could not be approved by the Planning Director using the Minor Modification process (see Section 3.19), then the Development Review Committee shall submit the plans to the Zoning Board of Adjustment for\nreview, modification, and approval or denial.\nDevelopment plans shall meet the required improvements listed in Section 8.1.3(A) unless plans meet the criteria of Section 8.1.3(B), Exceptions to General Requirements.\n(b) Sketch Plan Application\nAt the option of the applicant, a \"sketch plan\" instead of a full plan may be submitted. The information and supporting materials required shall be as specified by the Planning Director. This option is\nintended to give an applicant a preliminary review of their proposed development without having to prepare complete construction plans, which are required for a full plan application. This option is a two (2)-step\nprocess, with the applicant first submitting for approval of a sketch plan, followed by submittal of the construction plans (incorporating the sketch plan approval) in order to receive complete \"full plan\" approval to\nmove forward to construct the proposed development.\n1. Approval of Sketch Plan Conditional on Approval of Construction Drawings\nIf the application is submitted under the sketch plan submission option, approval of the sketch plan shall automatically be conditioned on the Development Review Committee's subsequent approval of\nconstruction drawings for all improvements required in the plan.\n2. One Year Deadline to Submit Construction Drawings\nConstruction drawings shall be submitted to the Planning Department no more than one (1) year after the date the sketch plan is approved. Failure to submit the construction drawings within this one\n(1) year period shall result in the lapse of approval of the sketch plan. The Planning Director may grant a single, one (1) year extension of this time limit for good cause shown, upon receiving a request from the\napplicant.\n3. Review by Development Review Committee of Construction Drawings Following Approval of a Sketch Plan\na. If the Committee determines that the materials comply with all requirements of this Ordinance and applicable Town specifications, then the Planning Director shall mark the construction drawings as\napproved.\nb. If the Development Review Committee determines that the materials do not comply with all applicable requirements, or that meeting the applicable requirements would require a change to the plan\nthat could not be approved by the Planning Director using the Minor Modification process, then the Development Review Committee shall submit the construction drawings to the Town Council for review,\nmodification, and approval or denial.\n(C) Owner-Initiated Annexation Petition Required\nIf the property within the proposed plan boundaries requires annexation into the Town limits, then official approval of the plan connecting to Town utilities is contingent on annexation into the Town. See\nSection 3.1.10.\n(D) Coordination of Plan Review with Special Use and/or Subdivision Plat Review\n(1) The review and approval of development plans should be coordinated with the review and approval of Special Uses (see Section 3.8) to the maximum extent possible. An application for approval of a\ndevelopment plan may be submitted at the same time as an application for approval of a special use for the same development. However, the Development Review Committee shall render separate\nrecommendations and the decision-making body (if subject to its approval) shall render a separate decision on each application, recognizing the applications as distinct and subject to different standards for\napproval. However, the decision-making body may choose to approve both applications with one (1) vote.\n(2) Application for a subdivision plat may only be submitted following development plan approval, unless a development plan is not required (see Section 3.9.3(B)).\n(E) Plans in Nonconforming Structures or Lots\nIf a proposed plan involves one (1) or more structures or lots that do not conform to the regulations of the district in which the plan is located, then, this plan may be reviewed as a Re-use/Redevelopment\nPlan provided that the proposal is consistent with the requirements in Section 3.11.2. If the proposal is not consistent with Section 3.11.2, or includes an expansion of the nonconforming use, structure, or site,\nbeyond that allowed by Section 3.11.3 then such proposal shall be required to obtain special use approval (see Section 3.8) unless the applicant has previously obtained the necessary variances from the Zoning\nBoard of Adjustment. In cases where a variance has been granted, such plans would follow the normal development plan process.\n(F) Approval Authority\n(1) Approval by Zoning Board of Adjustment\nThe Zoning Board of Adjustment shall have final decision-making authority on the following types of development plans, which shall be reviewed using the procedure set forth in this Section:\n(a) Plans for uses that require approval of a Special Use; and\n(b) Plans that propose one hundred (100) residential units or more, or that would construct one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet of nonresidential floor area or more, or that would construct a new\ndrive-through facility or expand an existing drive-through facility; excepting plans meeting the following criteria, which plans shall be reviewed by the Planning Director:\n1. A rezoning for the property was approved within the two (2) calendar years prior to the date of application for the development plan and the plan is not otherwise subject to review by the Zoning Board\n24 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "25", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be.\nof Adjustment pursuant to Section 3.9.2(F)(1)(a); or\n2.

Notice of\nthe\nhearing shall be provided and the hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Sections 3.1.6 and 3.1.7. The decision-making body may approve, or conditionally approve, any plan by a majority vote. The\ndecision shall be reduced to writing and reflect the decision-making body's determination of contested facts and their application to the applicable standards. The written decision shall be approved by Town\nCouncil and signed by the Mayor or his designee, or approved by the Zoning Board of Adjustment and signed by the Chair of the Zoning Board of Adjustment or his designee.

In addition, the applicant shall cause the Wake County Register of\nDeeds to mail a copy of the original recorded instruments to the Transportation and Facilities Department.\n(3) For development plans requiring a subdivision plat, such instruments must be recorded prior to, or in conjunction with the recording a subdivision plat for the development unless otherwise allowed\nwithin this Ordinance. Failure to satisfy this requirement shall render approval of the plan null and void.\n(K) Effect of the Plan Approval\n(1) Approval of a plan shall authorize the applicant to proceed with any applications for environmental permits, building permits, and other permits and approvals required in order to develop the property in\nconformity with the approved plan.

Owners of such properties may submit a re-use/ redevelopment plan in lieu of a full development plan (see Section 3.9). For purposes of this Section 3.11,\na nonconforming site is a site that was lawful at the time it was established and was part of an approved development plan at the time it was established, but which fails to comply with one (1) or more of the\napplicable regulations or standards of this Ordinance, including development plan requirements.\n26 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "27", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be...\n3.11.1 Intent\nThe intent of the re-use/redevelopment plan process is to encourage the utilization of existing nonconforming buildings and sites as opposed to their remaining vacant while at the same time reducing such\nnonconformities to the extent practical. The process allows owners to make improvements to an existing structure or site without having to go through a lengthy review process, produce a detailed development\nplan, reach compliance with all provisions of this Ordinance, or make roadway improvements.\n3.11.2 Changes Allowed for Nonconformities\nNotwithstanding the provisions of this Section, development proposals for vacant nonconforming structures or conforming structures on nonconforming sites may utilize the provisions of Section 8.1.3(B) to\nmake minor or inconsequential changes provided that there is no net increase in the amount of building square footage or improved floor area.\n3.11.3 Eligibility Requirements\nTo qualify for submission of a re-use/redevelopment plan, the following conditions must exist:\n(1) The proposed use is permitted within the zoning district, and provided that the new or expanded use does not generate twenty percent (20%) more traffic compared to the amount of traffic generated by\nthe existing and/or previous use as determined by the ITE Trip Generation Manual.\n(2) The previous use was part of an approved development plan (whether approved by the Town of Cary or other jurisdiction such as Wake County).\n(3) The redeveloped use will occupy an existing building(s) on the site, with no expansions or additions proposed.\n(4) If the site is in the Watershed Protection Overlay district, the requirements of Section 7.3 Stormwater Management must be addressed; or if the site is outside of the Watershed Protection Overlay\ndistrict, no more than twelve thousand (12,000) square feet of additional area is disturbed as a part of the proposal.\n(5) The proposed new use does not expand existing encroachments into required buffers or streetscapes.\n(6) The site will be in compliance with the provisions of Chapter 9, Signs.\n(7) The structure or site has been abandoned for a period of one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or more.\n3.11.4 Limitations\nProposed uses only allowable through an overlay district designation may not utilize the re-use/redevelopment plan process. Proposals which do not meet the eligibility requirements of Section 3.11.3 are\nrequired to undergo the normal development plan review process and/or the special use process (see Sections 3.8 and 10.1.8) in cases of expansion or major alteration.\nProposals involving a change in use that, although may be permitted within the underlying zoning district, will increase the intensity of the use(s) originally approved, will be required to demonstrate compliance\nwith\nthe current Ordinance requirements applicable to the proposed change prior to the issuance of a Building Permit and/or Certificate of Occupancy. Demonstrating compliance can be accomplished either\nthrough the development plan or re-use/redevelopment plan process, whichever is applicable.\nProposals for nonconforming sites or structures that have been vacant for less than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days and do not involve, either proposed or required, any changes to the site or exterior\nof the structure shall be reviewed during the Building Permit and/or Certificate of Occupancy process for compliance with the approved development plan or ordinance requirements in effect at the time it was\nestablished.

Vested rights may also be established pursuant to G.S.\n160D-108 or by application of common law principles.\n3.17.2 Establishment and Effect of Site-Specific Vesting Plan\nA vested right shall be deemed established with respect to any property upon the approval of a site-specific vesting plan, pursuant to the provisions of this Section. Such vested right shall confer upon the\nlandowner the right to undertake and complete the development and use of said property under the terms and conditions of the site-specific vesting plan. This right to carry out the development in accordance with\nthe approved plan shall attach to and run with the land, rather than being personal to the recipient of plan approval.\n3.17.3 Vested Rights Period\n(A) A vested right to develop under a site-specific vesting plan shall terminate two (2) years after the effective date of approval of the site specific vesting plan with respect to all buildings and uses for which\nthe developer has not, by that time, filed a valid building permit application in accordance with Section 3.14 of this Ordinance.\n(B) In approving a site-specific vesting plan, the Town Council may extend the two (2)-year vested rights period to a period of up to five (5) years, where warranted in light of all relevant circumstances,\nincluding, but not limited to, the size and phasing of development, the level of investment, the need for the development, economic cycles, and market conditions or other considerations. This decision shall be in\nthe sound discretion of the Town Council\n3.17.4 Procedure\nIn order to be entitled to the vested rights period set forth in Section 3.17.3 above, the owner or developer of the property must apply for a site-specific vesting plan with the Planning Department.\n(A) Applicability; application\nAn applicant who wishes to obtain a site-specific vesting plan shall apply for such at the time of an initial development plan application. The site-specific vesting plan application shall include the approximate\nboundaries of the site; significant topographical and other natural features affecting development of the site; the approximate location on the site of the proposed buildings, structures, and other improvements; the\napproximate dimensions, including height, of the proposed buildings and other structures; and the approximate location of all existing and proposed infrastructure on the site, including water, sewer, stormwater,\nroads, and pedestrian walkways.\n(1) Planning Director Review, Report, and Recommendation\nThe Planning Director shall review each proposed site-specific vesting plan and development plan and shall distribute the application to the Development Review Committee. The Development Review\nCommittee shall determine if the development plan complies with this Ordinance. If the Development Review Committee finds the development plan complies with this Ordinance, the Director shall provide a\nreport to the Town Council for consideration. This report shall include a discussion of all plans and policies that have been adopted by the Town and are relevant to the application as well as the Development\nReview Committee's recommendation.\n(2) Town Council Action\nIf the development plan requires review by the Zoning Board of Adjustment pursuant to Section 3.9.2, the development plan must first be considered and approved by the Zoning Board of Adjustment. If\nthe development plan does not require Zoning Board of Adjustment review and approval, or if the Zoning Board of Adjustment has approved the development plan, then the site-specific vesting plan will be\ntransmitted to the Town Council. The Town Council, after holding a legislative public hearing, may approve, conditionally approve, or deny the application for the site- specific vesting plan. The Town Council may\napprove a site-specific vesting plan upon any terms and conditions that may reasonably be necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.\n(B) Notice and Conduct of Public Hearings\nPublic hearings on site-specific vesting plans shall be legislative public hearings and shall be published and posted in accordance with the general notice requirements of Section 3.1.6, and shall be\nconducted in accordance with the general provisions of Section 3.1.7.\n(C) Effect of Denial or Withdrawal of Application\nNo application for a site-specific vesting plan covering the same property will be considered until after a lapse of twelve (12) months from the date of denial or withdrawal of the application. This twelve (12)-\nmonth provision may be waived for good cause shown by a four-fifths (4/5) vote of the Town Council.\n3.17.5 Exceptions\nThe provisions of Section 3.17.2 shall not apply in the following instances:\n(A) Where the property owner consents, in writing, to making the development conform to the requirements of this Ordinance, or any amendment thereto, which would make the development nonconforming;\n(B) Where the Town Council finds, after notice and a quasi-judicial evidentiary hearing, that natural or man-made hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious\nthreat to the public health, safety, and welfare if the project were to proceed as contemplated in the site-specific vesting plan;\n(C) Where the Town Council finds, after notice and a quasi-judicial evidentiary hearing, that the property owner or his or her representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material\nmisrepresentations which made a difference in the Town's approval of the site-specific vesting plan;\n32 of 232\n6/27/2024. 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "33", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be...\n(D) Where the state or federal government has enacted or promulgated a law or regulation which precludes developing the property as contemplated in the approved site-specific vesting plan, in which case\nthe Town Council may, by ordinance, modify the affected provisions of the approved plan upon finding, after notice and a quasi-judicial evidentiary hearing, that the change in state or federal law has a\nfundamental effect on the approved site-specific vesting plan;\n(E) Where the Town has compensated the property owner for all costs, expenses, and other losses incurred by the property owner after approval of the vested rights certificate, including but not limited to all\nfees paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and other consulting fees, together with interest as provided under G.S. 160D-106, not including any diminution in the value\nof the property.\n3.17.6 Amendments to Approved Plan\nThis Ordinance provides for situations in which the property owner or developer may obtain Town approval for particular changes to a site-specific vesting plan that the Town has already approved. The effect\nof such changes is as follows:\n(A) Amendments approved by Planning Director\nWhere the change is an amendment to a development plan that may be approved by the Planning Director under the terms of this Ordinance then approval of the change shall have no effect on the vested\nrights\nperiod and site specific vesting plan. The Director's approval of the proposed change shall not be deemed to extend or renew the vested rights period.\n(B) Changes Requiring Approval of the Zoning Board of Adjustment\nWhere the change is an amendment to a development plan that requires the approval of the Zoning Board of Adjustment under the terms of this Ordinance, then the property owner or developer must submit\nan application for a new site specific vesting plan along with the application for approval of the development plan change in order to extend or renew the vested rights period. In no case shall the total period of\nvesting for any piece of property be longer than five (5) years, no matter how many major changes are made to the property. The new site specific vesting plan may be approved only in accordance with the\nrequirements of Section 3.17.4 above.\n(C) Changes Requiring a Variance\nWhere the change is one that requires a variance from the Zoning Board of Adjustment, then the vested rights period set forth in Section 3.17.3 shall terminate immediately upon the Zoning Board of\nAdjustment's approval of the variance.\n3.17.7 Provisions to Which Vesting Does Not Apply\nThe establishment of a vested right for a site specific vesting plan shall not preclude the Town from applying overlay zoning or other development regulations which impose additional requirements but that do\nnot affect the allowable type or intensity of use, regulations governing nonconformities that appear in Chapter 10 of this Ordinance, or regulations that are general in nature and apply to all property subject to\ndevelopment regulation by the Town, including but not limited to building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes. All other regulations shall become effective with respect to the property upon the\nexpiration or termination of the vested rights period set forth in Section 3.17.3.\n3.17.8 Statutory and Common Law Vested Rights; Owner-Initiated Annexation\n(A) A person claiming a statutory or common law vested right may submit information to substantiate that claim to the Planning Director, who shall make an initial determination as to the existence of the\nvested right. The decision of the Planning Director may be appealed as provided in Section 3.21. On appeal, the existence of the vested right shall be reviewed de novo. In lieu of seeking a determination or\npursuing an appeal, a person claiming a vested right may bring an original civil action as provided by G.S. 160D-1403.1.\n(B) A petition for annexation filed with the Town under G.S. 160A-31 or G.S. 160A-58.1 shall contain a signed statement declaring whether or not any zoning vested right with respect to the properties subject\nto the petition has been established under G.S. 160D-108 or 160D-108.1. A statement that declares that no zoning vested right has been established, shall be binding on the landowner and any such zoning\nvested right shall be terminated.\n(Ord. No. 04-001, 1-8-04; Ord.

In determining if \"practical difficulty\" exists, the factors set forth in Section\n3.20.5, \"Approval Criteria\" (for Variances) shall be considered. In granting a minor modification allowed under this section, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may require conditions that will secure substantially the\nobjectives of the standard that is modified and that will substantially mitigate any potential adverse impact on the environment or on adjacent properties, including but not limited to additional landscaping or\nbuffering. Requests for modifications that exceed the percentages in Table 3.19-1 shall be treated as requests for a variance.\n(3) Noted on Pending Application\nStaff shall specify any approved minor modifications and the justifications for such modifications on the pending development application for which the modifications were sought.\n3.19.2 Minor Modifications to Approved Development Plans, Plats, and PDD, MXD, and Conditional Use Zoning Districts\n(A) Approved Development Plans or Plats\n(1) The Planning Director may approve the following minor modifications to plans or plats approved either through an administrative or quasi-judicial process, provided that those changes meet the\nrequirements of this Ordinance:\n(a) Approved Development Plans\nChanges to an approved development plan to allow:\n1.

Relocation of a road or intersection;\n2. Minor field alterations to accommodate physical site conditions involving interior features of the site design, including relocation of the buildings or uses shown on an approved master plan, PDP, or\nconcept plan, which represents the same general building relationships, topography, landscaping, and minimum utility standards; and\n3. A reduction of intensity of use necessary to meet minimum development standards of the LDO.\n(b)\nIn some cases, the ability to implement or strictly follow zoning conditions can be problematic (i.e. conditions requiring specimen trees to be preserved, but the trees have subsequently died due to\nnatural causes following the approval). In such cases, the Planning Director shall implement the condition in a way that most closely meets its original intent. These situations include, but are not limited to:\n1. Undisturbed buffers/streetscapes which may be beyond the applicant's ability to implement due to road widenings, utility relocation, driveways and/or clear sight distance areas;\n2. Specimen or champion trees required to be preserved, but which have been removed due to natural consequences or infrastructure relocation.\nThe Director may decide to permit re-vegetation when such conditions exist depending upon the extent of the disturbance, the size and quality of the existing vegetation remaining, and the long term\nviability/benefit of retaining the existing vegetation versus re-forestation.\n(2) Any other proposed change not listed above shall be accomplished in the same manner as the original zoning approval. In no circumstance shall a modification be granted under this section that results\nin:\n(a) A change in overall project density;\n(b) A change in permitted uses or mix of uses;\n(c) An increase in building height beyond twenty (20) percent of the structure's original height;\n(d) A reduction in buffer width or buffer standards adjacent to residential development;\n(e) A change to the overall concept of the plan; or\n(f) A change in any other zoning condition.\n3.19.3 Minor Building Encroachments into Required Setbacks\nThe Planning Director may approve encroachments of a principal building or accessory structure into any required setback up to a maximum of fifteen percent (15%) of the applicable required setback, provided\nthat:\n(A) The request involves encroachment into two (2) or fewer required setbacks per lot; and\n(B) The encroachment is a result of a construction error by the property owner or a person acting on his or her behalf whether discovered during the construction process or afterwards, or special\ncircumstances or conditions exist (e.g., narrowness, exceptional topographic conditions, or the shape of the property) that are not common to other properties that are similarly situated.\n(C) The encroachment, if approved, will not pose substantial danger to public health and safety.\nIn addition, the Director may grant additional encroachments for structures that were constructed prior to May 13, 1999 (Implementation Date of Required Foundation Surveys) which do not meet the setback\nand other requirements of this Ordinance provided that Item (B) is met above and building permits were obtained and approved for the structure.\n(Ord.

The above districts are ranked and represent, within the residential and\nthe non-residential categories, a progression from the most restrictive (the \"highest\" classification) to the least restrictive (the \"lowest\" classification).\n4.1.2 Relationship to Conditional Use Districts and Overlay Districts\nLands within the Town and its extraterritorial jurisdiction may be classified into one (1) of the following:\n(A) General use districts set forth in Section 4.2;\n(B) One (1) or more of the conditional use districts set forth in Section 4.3;\n(C) One (1) or more of the overlay districts set forth in Section 4.4.\n(D) Some lands within a general use district may also be classified as \"conditional\" when the land was previously designated as a conditional use district prior to July 1, 2003, but which designation was\nremoved concurrent with adoption of this Ordinance. In such cases, any conditions associated with the land remain in effect regardless of the land's current designation as a general use district.\nWhere the property is classified in an overlay district as well as either a general use district or a conditional use district, then the regulations governing development in the overlay district shall apply in addition to\nthe regulations governing development in the underlying district. In the event of an express conflict between the standards set forth in Section 4.2 and the standards set forth in Section 4.4 for an overlay district,\nthe standards set forth in Section 4.4 shall control. In the event of an express conflict between the standards set forth in Section 4.4 and the provisions set forth in a particular conditional rezoning, then the more\nrestrictive provision of either shall control.\n4.1.3 Annexed Lands and Lands Added to the Town's Extraterritorial Jurisdiction\n(A) Zoning Designation\n(1) The Town Council shall determine the zoning designation and future growth framework development category (if applicable) of properties added to the Town's planning and development regulation\njurisdiction through extraterritorial boundary changes or annexation. Such determination shall be based on, but not be limited to, the following factors: the property's future growth framework development category,\nthe property's current land use, the existence of a previously-approved development plan, the character of adjacent properties, current zoning designations, property owner requests or other factors considered\nrelevant at the time of the annexation.\n(2) Any property owner within the land to be added to the Town's planning and development regulation jurisdiction may submit a petition requesting a specific zoning designation. If such a petition is\nreceived prior to the time the land is added to the Town's jurisdiction, then the public hearing for zoning may be held concurrently with any public hearing required for addition of the property. If no such petition is\nreceived prior to the time of addition of the property, then Section 3.4 of this Ordinance shall govern any subsequent rezoning of the property.\n(B) Effect of Zoning Designation on Nonconforming Lot Status\nWhere a legal, conforming lot existing in a residential zoning district at the time the lot was added to the Town's extraterritorial jurisdiction does not contain sufficient land to permit conformance with the lot\nsize or lot width of this Ordinance, such lot may be used as a building site for a single-unit dwelling notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Chapter 10 of this Ordinance. However, all development on such lot\nshall comply with the setback requirements of Chapter 6 of this Ordinance.\n(Ord. No. 2017-LDO-01, 1-24-17; Ord. No. 2021-LDO-01, 6-24-21; Ord.

The goals and objectives of this overlay are to:\n(1) Encourage environmentally sound planning;\n(2) Protect open space and natural resources;\n(3) Create attractive living environments;\n(4) Encourage the creative placement of dwelling units;\n(5) Limit the consumption of scenic, historic, and forested land for development;\n(6) Design residential developments using natural topography, drainage ways and advanced water-quality protection techniques; and\n(7) Create a contiguous network of open spaces by linking the open space areas within the residential development to open space on adjoining land wherever possible.\n50 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "51", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be..\nTo further these goals and objectives, the overlay district provides the opportunity for residential developments to receive an increase in the number of potential dwelling units (based on the underlying zoning\nrequirements) when such residential developments meet open space and other design requirements set forth within this Section.\n(B) Location of District and Applicability\nThe provisions of the Conservation Residential Overlay District shall apply to the geographic areas designated as such on the Town of Cary Official Zoning Map. For properties designated as Conservation\nResidential on the Town of Cary Official Zoning Map and located outside of the Town's extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ), annexation and rezoning in accordance with this Section and all other applicable sections of\nthe Land Development Ordinance is required before applicants may utilize the density bonus provisions of Sections 4.4.3(D) through (H).\nThis overlay district does not preclude any residential or non-residential uses allowed within the underlying zoning districts, provided that all applicable Land Development Ordinance requirements are met.\nProperties may be rezoned to residential or non-residential districts if supported by the Comprehensive Plan and in accordance with applicable sections of the Land Development Ordinance. Parcels zoned as\nPlanned Development Districts and parcels subject to development plans approved before July 15, 2004, are exempt from the application of this Section for so long as the PDD or development plan remains valid.\nThe density bonus provisions of Sections 4.4.3(D) through (H) are optional. However, all development within the overlay district shall, in addition to all other requirements of the Land Development\nOrdinance, provide a buffer of fifty (50) feet in width along the American Tobacco Trail. The buffer shall function as visual separation between the public trail and private property; it shall contain native plant\nmaterial, supplemented where necessary with deciduous and evergreen trees to provide an opaque screen for the benefit of trail users and adjoining property owners. The buffer shall conform to the requirements\nof a Type 'A' Buffer as described in LDO Section 7.2.3(D).\n(C) Subdistricts Created and Defined\nDue to the existing character and desired types of future development in the Conservation Residential Overlay District, differing residential densities, dimensional standards, open space requirements, and\nother related development standards are set forth within this Section. In order to present the full range of zoning and development requirements for each different area, this overlay zoning district is divided into two\n(2) subdistricts as follows:\n(D) Eligibility and Process to Obtain Density Bonus\nAn increase in the number of lots (density bonus) above the number of lots that could be achieved utilizing the underlying zoning (base number of lots) is allowed, provided the development plan meets open\nspace requirements and other design requirements set forth within this Section.\nNew residential developments within the Conservation Residential Overlay District seeking to utilize the density bonus provisions of this Section shall require submission of a development plan in accordance\nwith Section 3.9 of this Ordinance, and approval of such plan by the appropriate decision-making body. To be eligible to gain additional units above the base number of lots, the minimum size of the site shall be\nten (10) acres.\n(1) Rezoning\nFor property located within the overlay district as shown on the Town of Cary Official Zoning Overlay Map, rezoning is not required in order to submit development plan applications that meet the\nrequirements stated in Sections 4.4.3(D) through (H).\nFor properties within the Conservation Residential Overlay District but not within the Town Limits and/or Extraterritorial Zoning Jurisdiction (ETJ), annexation and rezoning is required before such properties\ncan be developed pursuant to Sections 4.4.3(D) through (H). Annexation and rezoning (to establish initial zoning) to the Residential-40 district and Conservation Residential Overlay District must be approved\nbefore a proposed development plan using the provisions of Section 4.4.3(D) through (H) can be submitted for review.\nRezonings to non-residential and institutional uses may be permitted if consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. Rezonings to non-residential and institutional districts are not required to be subject to the\nrequirements of this Overlay District.\n(E) Calculating the Base Number of Lots\nThe base number of lots is defined as the lot yield based on the implementation of the requirements of the underlying zoning district. The base number of lots is the starting point from which extra lots may be\npermitted if non-regulatory or bonus open space, as defined below, is provided and other design requirements are met.\nThe applicant shall choose one (1) of the following methods for calculating the base number of lots:\n(1) The base number of lots may be determined by taking ninety (90) percent of the potential developable area of the site and multiplying by the maximum density (based on lot area requirements) for the\nunderlying zoning district. The purpose of reducing the potential developable acreage by ten (10) percent is to account for the approximate area that would be allocated to roadways within a conventional\nsubdivision. \"Potential developable area\" within this Section is defined as the total land area of the site excluding all regulatory floodplains, streetscapes and other required areas (see Chapter 7: Development and\nDesign Standards). For sites that contain and/or are adjacent to the American Tobacco Trail, a buffer of at least fifty (50) feet in width is required. This minimum buffer width is considered regulatory/required area,\nand shall not be included in the calculation of potential developable area.\nExample: Site A\nTotal Site Acres: One hundred (100)\nAcres in regulated/protected areas: Twenty (20)\nPotential Developable Area Including Roadways: One hundred (100) Twenty (20) = Eighty (80) Acres\nCalculated Developable Area: Eighty (80) Acres X Ninety (90) percent = Seventy-two (72) Acres\nBase Number of Lots: Seventy-two (72) Acres X 1.09 (density permitted in R-40) = Seventy-eight (78) lots\n(2) The base number of lots may be determined based on the applicant providing a sketch development plan that fully complies with the development requirements of the underlying zoning district for the\nsite.\n(F) Increases to Base Density; Residential Use Type Allowed; and Minimum Dimensional Standards\n(1) Increase in Density An increase in the number of lots (density bonus) is provided in exchange for the permanent preservation of non-regulatory (referred to as \"bonus\") open space and compliance\nwith other design requirements. An increase in the number of lots is achieved by allowing a smaller minimum lot size and increasing the permitted density (see Table 4.4-2 below).\n(2) Allowance for Attached Dwelling Units All lots developed in accordance with Sections 4.4.3(D) through (H) shall be for single-unit detached dwelling units with the exception of lots within the\nConservation Residential Low Density (LCR) subdistrict. Within this subdistrict, attached, semi-detached, detached patio dwelling and townhome units shall be permitted, but shall not exceed twenty (20) percent\nof the total development yield. The lots for attached dwellings and detached patio dwellings shall use the Transitional Residential (TR) dimensional requirements, and therefore may have smaller lot sizes than the\nminimum lot size for detached lots as prescribed below.\n(3) Specific Requirements by Subdistrict\n51 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nTABLE 4.4-1: CONSERVATION RESIDENTIAL OVERLAY SUBDISTRICTS\nCELL (1, 2): \nTABLE 4.4-1: CONSERVATION RESIDENTIAL OVERLAY SUBDISTRICTS\nCELL (2, 1): \nSubdistrict\nCELL (2, 2): \nDescription\nCELL (3, 1): \nLCR\nCELL (3, 2): \nConservation Residential, Low Density\nCELL (4, 1): \nVLCR\nCELL (4, 2): \nConservation Residential, Very Low Density\nCELL (1, 1): \nTABLE 4.4-2: MAXIMUM DENSITY, MINIMUM LOT SIZE AND OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS BY SUBDISTRICT\nCELL (1, 2): \nTABLE 4.4-2: MAXIMUM DENSITY, MINIMUM LOT SIZE AND OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS BY SUBDISTRICT\nCELL (1, 3): \nTABLE 4.4-2: MAXIMUM DENSITY, MINIMUM LOT SIZE AND OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS BY SUBDISTRICT\nCELL (1, 4): \nTABLE 4.4-2: MAXIMUM DENSITY, MINIMUM LOT SIZE AND OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS BY SUBDISTRICT\nCELL (1, 5): \nTABLE 4.4-2: MAXIMUM DENSITY, MINIMUM LOT SIZE AND OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS BY SUBDISTRICT\nCELL (1, 6): \nTABLE 4.4-2: MAXIMUM DENSITY, MINIMUM LOT SIZE AND OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS BY SUBDISTRICT\nCELL (2, 1): \nOverlay\nSubdistrict\nCELL (2, 2): \nMaximum\nDevelopment\nDensity (d.u./acre)\nCELL (2, 3): \nMinimum Lot Size\nif Site Contains\nLess than Twenty\n(20) Percent of the\nTotal Area in\nregulatory open\nspace (sq. ft.)\nCELL (2, 4): \nMinimum Lot Size\nif Site Contains\nbetween Twenty\n(20) and Less\nthan Thirty (30)\nPercent of the\nTotal Area in\nregulatory open\nspace (sq. ft.)\nCELL (2, 5): \nMinimum Lot Size\nif Site Contains\nThirty (30) Percent\nor more of the\nTotal Area in\nregulatory open\nspace (sq. ft.)\nCELL (2, 6): \nBonus Open\nSpace Required\nPer Additional Lot\nCELL (3, 1): \nConservation\nResidential, Low\nDensity (LCR)\nCELL (3, 2): \n2.5\nCELL (3, 3): \n10,000\nCELL (3, 4): \n8,000\nCELL (3, 5): \n6,000\nCELL (3, 6): \n8,872 sq. ft\nCELL (4, 1): \nConservation\nResidential, Very\nLow Density\n(VLCR)\nCELL (4, 2): \n1.5\nCELL (4, 3): \n15,000\nCELL (4, 4): \n8,000\nCELL (4, 5): \n6,000\nCELL (4, 6): \n14,816 sq. ft.\n"}, {"page": "52", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be..\nNotes:\nReduction in lot size due to twenty (20) percent or greater area in regulatory open space will be reduced incrementally until the maximum development density or minimum lot size is achieved, whichever occurs first.\nThe amount of bonus open space required is based on the following ratio:\nIn\nVLCR, a density bonus equal to three percent (3%) of the base number of lots is allowed for each one percent (1%) of bonus open space provided from the potential developable area of the site.\nIn\nLCR, a density bonus equal to five percent (5%) of the base number of lots is allowed for each one percent (1%) of bonus open space provided from the potential developable area of the site.\nLCR Example (continued from 4.4.3(E)(1) above):\n(G) Bonus Open Space Requirements\nAll bonus open space provided must meet the following standards:\n(1)\nBonus open space shall be retained in a natural, undisturbed state, with the exception of those activities allowed by this Section. No more than five percent (5%) of the bonus open space area may be\ndisturbed and allowed to be planted with grass or improved with other pervious ground cover in order to provide common informal gardens and/or play/open areas for the development or for the extension of main\nwater and sewer lines. The five percent (5%) does not include disturbed areas due to the installation of required pedestrian systems (e.g., sidewalks, trails). However, active recreation facilities (e.g., basketball\nand tennis courts) are not permitted in the bonus open space used to obtain additional lots.\n(2) In order to use the bonus density provisions of the Conservation Residential Overlay District, per part (F) of this Section, the subdivision must, at a minimum, provide an eighty (80) foot deep Type A\nopaque streetscape buffer along all of the subdivision's thoroughfare and collector road frontage. The amount of the eighty (80) foot deep streetscape buffer that is in excess of the amount of streetscape buffer\nnormally required for a conventional subdivision under the requirements of Chapter 7 (See Section 7.2.4) qualifies as non-regulatory or bonus open space. Credit for bonus open space beyond a thirty (30) foot\nstreetscape width may be allowed along thoroughfares that are designed as only two (2) lane roadways (similar to a collector roadway).\n(3) Bonus open space shall be no less than thirty (30) feet in width at any point.\n(4) Pedestrian access trails to the bonus open space areas shall be provided.\n(5) No portion of the bonus open space shall be separated into non-contiguous segments smaller than thirty percent (30%) of the total bonus open space area. Open space divided by a roadway shall be\ndefined as contiguous as well as open space adjacent to or across a roadway from regulatory stream and/or urban transition buffers.\n(6) Credit for bonus open space may be provided for the preservation of contributing historic structure(s) within the Green Level National Register Historic District. This refers to the primary contributing\nstructure on the site, such as the main farmhouse, as identified in the Green Level Historic District National Register Nomination document. The primary contributing structure must be located within a site\ncontaining at least one (1) acre of contiguous open space in order to better maintain the structure within its context in the landscape. Preservation is defined as the active restoration or rehabilitation and the\nongoing maintenance of a structure. To qualify a primary contributing structure for the density bonus option, the property owner shall enter a preservation agreement with a qualified preservation organization.\nPreservation agreements may include, but are not limited to, historic preservation easements, facade and exterior covenants, or other methods acceptable to the Town.\nThe primary contributing structure within the Green Level National Register Historic District shall count as one (1) acre of bonus open space, provided that the structure is preserved and/or rehabilitated to\nthe\nSecretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. The primary structure must also be included within at least one (1) acre of bonus open space to preserve rural character features. This bonus open\nspace may be used in a way that reflects the historic use of the property. If these requirements are met, a minimum of two (2) acres of open space may be credited to obtain bonus\nlots.\n(7) The bonus open space shall be shown on the development plan, with a notation to indicate that the bonus open space shall not be used for future structures.\n(8) The developer shall establish and incorporate a Homeowners' Association (HOA), which shall own the bonus open space and have the responsibility for maintaining the bonus open space and\nassociated facilities at its own expense. An exception to the ownership of a portion of the bonus open space surrounding a contributing historic structure(s) within the Green Level National Register Historic District\nmay be provided on a case by case basis. As an alternative to an HOA, a private, non-profit organization, whose primary purpose is open space conservation or preservation can own and manage the bonus open\nspace.\n(9) A portion or all of the bonus open space may be conveyed to the Town for use as greenways and parkland, provided it meets Town standards for such facilities and is agreed to by the Town. Such\nconveyance would occur at no cost to the Town.\n(H) Additional Design Requirements\n(1) Lot Dimensions\n(a) For LCR lots, all dimensional requirements (i.e., setbacks, lot width) shall conform to R-8: Residential District standards with the exception of side yards. Side yards shall be a minimum of five (5) feet\nand an aggregate minimum of fifteen (15) feet. Residential lots less than eight thousand (8,000) square feet shall conform to TR: Transition Residential District standards.\n(b) For VLCR, R-12 dimensional requirements shall be used for lots twelve thousand (12,000) square feet and greater in size. For lots between eleven thousand nine hundred ninety-nine (11,999) and\neight thousand (8,000) square feet, R-8 dimensional requirements shall be used. For lots less than eight thousand (8,000) square feet, TR dimensional requirements shall be used.\n(2) Where lots abut other residential lots within an existing subdivision that is not developed pursuant to Sections 4.4.3(D) through (H), said lots shall have a side and rear yard setback not less than the\nrequired side and rear yard setback required on the abutting property or the side and rear yard setback of the Residential 40 District.\n(3) All streetscapes along thoroughfares and collectors shall be planted to a Type A standard.\n(4) American Tobacco Trail (ATT) Buffer A buffer of fifty (50) feet in width is required along the American Tobacco Trail. The buffer shall function as visual separation between the public trail and private\nproperty; it shall contain native plant material, supplemented where necessary with deciduous and evergreen trees to provide an opaque screen for the benefit of trail users and adjoining property owners. The\nbuffer shall conform to the requirements of a Type 'A' Buffer as described in LDO Section 7.2.3(D). The fifty (50) foot wide buffer is not counted as bonus open space.\n(5) No lot(s) shown on a development plan may be cleared or graded until the building permit for the lot is approved. Exceptions to this requirement may be considered based on factors related to the\ninstallation of roadways, public utilities or significant topographic issues. This exception must be approved by the Town based on written justification.\n(6)\nStreets shall be designed and located as to preserve and maintain the natural topography and topographic features, as well as to minimize cut and fill practices.\n(7) [Reserved]\n(8) The requirements of Section 7.3, Stormwater Management, shall be achieved using LID site planning and techniques or a combination of LID and conventional stormwater management practices. The\ngoal of LID is to develop site design techniques, strategies, and best management practices (BMPs) to store, infiltrate, evaporate, retain, and detain run-off on the site to more closely replicate pre-development\nrun-off characteristics and to better mimic the natural and unique hydrology of the site thereby limiting the increase in pollutant loads caused by development. To the extent practical, stormwater shall be treated at\nits source through the use of small, non-structural BMPs and natural conveyance devices (swales, etc.). All BMPs shall be located in areas owned by the HOA or other entity (see 4.4.3(G)(8)) to ensure adequate\nmaintenance. Structural BMPs may not be located in the bonus open space.\n(9) Pedestrian Connectivity: A comprehensive pedestrian system shall be provided that makes the contiguous open space accessible to neighborhood residents and connects the open space to\nneighborhood streets. Limited pedestrian access shall be provided through Urban Transition Buffers and floodplain areas in accordance with the standards of this Ordinance.\nPedestrian connectivity shall be provided through an integrated combination of: primary trails, consisting of public sidewalks and greenways; and secondary trails consisting of private trails that provide\nconnections within the development from public sidewalks and greenways to open space areas.\nPublic greenway trails shall be those depicted on the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Facilities Master Plan. Such trails shall be ten (10) feet wide and constructed within a thirty (30) foot wide\npermanent Town of Cary greenway easement. The Town shall maintain all public greenway trails.\nSecondary trails shall be constructed of asphalt, with a minimum width of eight (8) feet. Where feasible, secondary trails shall be located within Homeowners' Association (HOA) maintained common open\nspace. In cases where this is not feasible, a twenty (20)-foot wide private pedestrian easement centered on these trails must be recorded and any required building setback shall be calculated from the outside\nboundary of the easement on the lot. All secondary trails shall be owned and maintained by the subdivision HOA and shall be available for public use.\n4.4.4 [RESERVED]\n4.4.5 Airport Overlay\n(A) Purpose and Intent\nThe Airport Overlay is established to accomplish the following purposes:\n52 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nSize of Site\nCELL (1, 2): \nBase Number of Lots\n[see Section 4.4.3 (E)]\nCELL (1, 3): \nBonus Open Space\nCELL (1, 4): \nAdditional Lots\n(Density Bonus)\nCELL (1, 5): \nGross Density\n(d.u./acre)\nCELL (2, 1): \n100 Acres\nCELL (2, 2): \n78\nCELL (2, 3): \n16 acres (20% of\npotential developable\narea)\nCELL (2, 4): \n78 (100% more)\nCELL (2, 5): \n1.6\nCELL (3, 1): \n100 Acres\nCELL (3, 2): \n78\nCELL (3, 3): \n24 acres (30% of\npotential developable\narea)\nCELL (3, 4): \n117 (150% more)\nCELL (3, 5): \n2.0\n"}, {"page": "53", "text": "Firefox\nhhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be...\n(1) To limit allowable land uses in the immediate vicinity of Raleigh-Durham International Airport to non-residential uses, such as industrial, agricultural, commercial, or conservation uses, which are not\nsubject to high population concentrations, and to keep residential and institutional uses from developing in those areas that are subject to the highest levels of aircraft noise;\n(2) To ensure that such uses are located, designed, constructed, and maintained in a manner that does not impair the safe operation of the airport;\n(3) To ensure that such uses contribute to the attractiveness of the roadside, which will in turn contribute to and enhance trade, tourism, capital investment, property values, and the general welfare; and\n(4) To ensure that such uses are in compliance with the Raleigh-Durham International Airport Height Zoning Ordinance and other supplemental regulations.\n(B) Location and Applicability; Compliance Required\nThe Airport Overlay is an overlay district that applies over lands in the vicinity of the Raleigh-Durham International Airport.

Requirements pertaining to\nsedimentation and erosion control are addressed in Section 14.4 of this Ordinance.\n(C) Procedures for Development Approval\n(1) Development Review\nAll development within the Watershed Protection Overlay shall demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this Section 4.4.6 at the time of approval of a development plan. Applicants complying with\nthe standards of this section must also satisfy all other applicable requirements and obtain all other necessary approvals or permits under this Ordinance.\n(2) Protection Measures Prerequisite to Certificate of Occupancy\nA Certificate of Occupancy shall not be issued for any development in the Watershed Protection Overlay until all of the watershed protection measures required by this section have been approved and are\nin place on the property.\n(D) Overview of High Density and Low Density Development Options\nThere are two (2) development options in the Watershed Protection Overlay, a Low Density Option and a High Density Option, each with different provisions related to either the Swift Creek Watershed or the\nJordan Lake Watershed as well as to sub-areas within either watershed.\n(1) Impervious Surfaces\nThe maximum allowable amount of impervious surface within a proposed development is limited based upon the Low or High Density Option, and differs from Watershed to watershed as depicted in Table\n4.4-5.\n(2) Calculation of Impervious Surfaces\nCalculation of impervious surface area shall include the pavement area of all existing and proposed internal public and private streets, one-half (1/2) of the width of roadways on the perimeter of the project,\ndriveways, rooftops, parking lots, patios, and all other impervious surfaces. For the purpose of calculating the impervious surface of roadways on the perimeter of a project, the ultimate pavement cross section of\nthe roadway based on the Comprehensive Transportation Plan and any sidewalk(s) or greenway(s) along the perimeter roadway will be included in the calculation. For purposes of calculating the percentage of\nimpervious area coverage, the total project area shall be regarded as the actual area of the property plus the area within the rights-of-way of the internal and perimeter streets included in the calculation of\nimpervious area.\n(3) Residential Density\nIn addition to limitations on the amount of impervious surface, the Low and High Density Development Options limit the gross residential densities of projects based upon the watershed where they are\nproposed, with higher densities allowed under the High Density Option as depicted in Table 4.4-5.\n(4) Runoff Control\nEngineered stormwater control measures intended to contain the runoff from the first one (1) inch of rainfall are required in any development utilizing the High Density Option in either watershed.\n(E) Restrictions on Allowed Uses\nThe uses allowed within the Watershed Protection Overlay are the same as the uses permitted in the general use zoning district within which the land is located, pursuant to Table 5.1-1. However, the\nfollowing uses are allowed within the overlay district only if they comply with the performance standards set forth in this Section 4.4.6.\n(1) Swift Creek Watershed and the Jordan Lake Watershed\n(a) All industrial service uses;\n(b) All waste-related uses;\n(c) Uses producing and/or storing toxic and/or hazardous materials; and\n(d) Any use discharging sewage, industrial waste and/or non-process industrial waste.\n(2) Jordan Lake Watershed Critical Water Quality Area\nAll uses set forth in paragraph (1) above; and all agricultural uses.\n(F) Limitations on Impervious Surface Area and Density\n(1) Low Density Option\nMaximum impervious surface limits for the Low Density Option are set forth in the table below. Separate regulations are provided for the Jordan Lake and Swift Creek areas. The Jordan Lake regulations\nrecognize two sub-areas, the Critical Area and the remainder of the watershed; while the Swift Creek regulations distinguish between three (3) different sub-areas: New Suburban, New Urban, and Existing Urban\ndevelopment.

Flexible use zoning districts allow opportunity for greater flexibility in design and development of property. Since flexible use zoning is\nnot tied to a corresponding general use zoning district and its associated zoning standards, applicants requesting a flexible use zoning district for property may propose zoning and development standards that are\nspecific to that particular property (or district) that can be more or less restrictive than standards associated with general use districts. Flexible use districts permit multiple, coordinated uses in an integrated\nconcept; require an overall master development plan; and provide suitable open space amenities, resource protection, gathering spaces, recreational opportunities; and architectural cohesion.\n(B) Process Required\nRezoning to a flexible use district shall require submission and approval of an application for a rezoning in accordance with the general procedures set forth in Section 3.4.1, and any modifications applicable\nto the particular type of flexible use district requested. A rezoning to a flexible use district may be initiated only by an application signed by all of the owners of the property to be included in the district or by an\nagent authorized by all of the owners to file such application. If the application is approved, the Town Council shall adopt an ordinance authorizing the requested use with such reasonable conditions as are\nmutually approved by the applicant and Town Council and determined to be desirable in promoting public health, safety and general welfare.\n(C) Conditions\n(1) Rezoning applications for a flexible use rezoning district shall, depending on the type of flexible use district requested, include a master land use plan, preliminary development plan or development plan\nthat specifies the use or uses that are intended for the property, as well as any additional conditions on the use of the property that the applicant may propose as conditions of the rezoning. The applicant may\npropose conditions regarding building design elements as defined in G.S. 160D-702 and other development considerations. Conditions are limited to:\n(a) Those that address conformance of the development and use of the site to Town ordinances or officially adopted plans; or\n(b) Those that address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development and use of the site.\n(2) No condition shall be made part of the application, or shall be attached to approval of the flexible use district, which specifies the ownership status, race, religion, or character of the occupants of housing\nunits, the minimum value of improvements, a minimum square footage of any structures subject to regulation under the North Carolina Residential Code for One- and Two-Family Dwellings, or any illegal\nexclusionary device; or which states that the use of the property will not be subject to regulations or restrictions set forth in this Ordinance which would apply to the property in any event, such as the regulations for\nan overlay district which covers the property.\n4.5.2 MXD: Mixed Use District\nThis Mixed Use District (MXD) was established on August 13, 2009 and may only be used in areas already zoned Mixed Use Overlay District (MUOD). In support of the MUOD provisions, the Mixed Use\nDistrict (MXD) is a type of flexible zoning district that allows property owners to rezone land subject to specific requirements set forth in a preliminary development plan.\n(A) Intent\nEvery rezoning to a MXD district must be accompanied by a preliminary development plan (PDP) that illustrates how the proposed district is consistent with and furthers policies identified in the\nComprehensive Plan, applicable requirements of the Land Development Ordinance, and other applicable plans, ordinances and manuals identified in Section 1.4. Depending upon the location and the existing\nnature of development, it is not the intent of a MXD district to require each separate building or every individual development site to include a complete, integrated mix of land uses but rather for the Mixed Use\nOverlay District as a whole to contain a mix of uses designed to meet the Town's overall planning objectives.\n(B) Approval Procedure\n57 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nTABLE 4.5-1: FLEXIBLE USE DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED\nCELL (1, 2): \nTABLE 4.5-1: FLEXIBLE USE DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED\nCELL (2, 1): \nDistrict Name\nCELL (2, 2): \nAbbreviation\nCELL (3, 1): \nMixed Use District\nCELL (3, 2): \nMXD\nCELL (4, 1): \nMinor Planned Development District\nCELL (4, 2): \nPDD Minor\nCELL (5, 1): \nMajor Planned Development District\nCELL (5, 2): \nPDD Major\n"}, {"page": "58", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be...\nApproval of a MXD district shall require a rezoning pursuant to the procedure set forth in Section 3.4.5 which shall include submission, review, and approval of a preliminary development plan (PDP) or\ndevelopment plan.\n(C) Geographic Coverage\nUnless there is no adjacent or closely located property under the same or closely related ownership that qualifies for MXD zoning a single, small parcel or portion of a parcel should not be rezoned to a MXD\ndistrict when a larger geographic area of developable or redevelopable land could be included. In keeping with the Town's longstanding preference for comprehensively planned areas, the intent of this district is to\nencompass as much land area as practicable to successfully implement the Comprehensive Plan. However, depending upon the location, size and scale of the Mixed Use Overlay District, nature of the property\nproposed to be rezoned, the existing zoning in the vicinity, whether or not the adjoining land is developed or vacant, and ownership patterns, the amount of land included in any MXD rezoning case may vary and\ncannot be predicted in advance. Following a required presubmittal meeting, the Development Review Committee staff will recommend the extent of property(ies) that should be included in any Mixed Use District\nrezoning application.\n(D) General Use and Development Standards\n(1) Uses Allowed\nThe extent of appropriate uses and development intensity within Mixed Use Overlay Districts increases from neighborhood to community to regional in scale. Table 5.1-1 found in Chapter 5 of this\nOrdinance identifies allowed uses within each category.\n(2) Applicable Standards\nThere shall be no minimum dimensional standards for developments in a MXD district. Dimensional standards shall be stated on the approved preliminary development plan. The applicant shall\ndemonstrate that the requirements of the proposed MXD district satisfy applicable approval criteria.\n(a) Development in a MXD district shall be subject to all applicable overlay district regulations in Chapter 4, all applicable use regulations set forth in Chapter 5, and all applicable general regulations set\nforth in Chapters 6, 7, and 8, unless otherwise waived or modified by the approved preliminary development plan. The application shall include development conditions assuring that the proposed preliminary\ndevelopment will meet or exceed the standard requirements of the aforementioned chapters. The preliminary development plan may modify procedural requirements of this Ordinance. Where the preliminary\ndevelopment plan is silent as to a term or requirements, the requirements/standards of this Ordinance and the approved policies and procedures of the Town shall control.\n(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, in no case shall the Town Council approve an MXD zoning district and associated preliminary development plan that waives or modifies environmental or\ninfrastructure adequacy standards for a proposed MXD zoning district including but not limited to:\n1. Zones 1, 2, and 3 of urban transition buffers;\n2. [Reserved];\n3. Stormwater control requirements, and\n4. Nitrogen reduction requirements.\n(E) Considerations for Mixed Use District Rezonings\nIn addition to the considerations for a general rezoning contained in Section .4.1(E), and without limiting council's broad discretion, council may, when reviewing a proposed rezoning request to a MXD\ndistrict, consider whether\n(1) The preliminary development plan includes an appropriate intensity, type, and mix of land uses, as outlined by the guidelines contained in the Comprehensive Plan. This may be assessed in relation to\nthe scale of the Mixed Use Overlay District and the mix and relationship of existing and planned uses, including residential, commercial, office, and institutional uses;\n(2) The preliminary development plan shows how the proposed development will meet or exceed the Site Design Standards and other established Town standards, including connections and linkages to\nimmediately adjacent properties;\n(3)\nThe preliminary development plan provides the expected land uses, including medium- and higher-density housing, outlined by the numerical and other guidelines contained in the Comprehensive Plan;\n(4) The preliminary development plan includes some formal outdoor space(s) for public use, such as a park, village green, or plaza; and\n(5) The preliminary development plan demonstrates that the proposed development is appropriate for the context and location, responds to the unique conditions of the area, and provides reasonable\ntransitions within and adjacent to the district.\n(F) Changes to the Preliminary Development Plan Component of an Approved MXD District\nChanges to preliminary development plans associated with previously-approved MXD zoning districts shall only be allowed in accordance with the provisions in Section 4.4.2(H) or as otherwise stated in this\nOrdinance.\n4.5.3 PDD: Planned Development Districts\nThis section sets forth regulations for the two (2) types of planned development district (PDD) zoning districts. All PDD zoning districts shall be established either as initial zoning at the time of annexation, or\nthrough a rezoning pursuant to the procedures and criteria for rezoning to PDD set forth in Section 3.4.3. PDDs are base zoning districts under this Ordinance (rather than overlay districts, which they were under\nthe previous Unified Development Ordinance).\n(A) General Intent/Purposes of the PDD Districts\nThe PDD zoning districts allow projects of innovative design and layout that would not otherwise be permitted under this Ordinance because of the strict application of zoning district or general development\nstandards. The PDD districts encourage innovative land planning and design concepts by:\n(1) Reducing or eliminating the inflexibility that sometimes results from strict application of zoning and development standards that were designed primarily for individual lots;\n(2) Allowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access, light, open space, and design amenities;\n(3) Allowing greater freedom in providing a mix of land uses in the same development, including a mix of housing types, housing prices, lot sizes, densities, and non-residential uses in a planned\ndevelopment;\n(4) Promoting quality urban design and environmentally sensitive development by allowing development to take advantage of special site characteristics, locations, and land uses; and\n(5) Encouraging quality urban design and environmentally sensitive development by allowing increases in base densities when such increases can be justified by superior design or the provision of\nadditional amenities such as public and/or private open space.\nIn return for greater flexibility in site design requirements, planned developments are expected to deliver exceptional quality community designs that preserve critical environmental resources, provide above-\naverage open space amenities, incorporate creative design in the layout of buildings, open space and circulation; assure compatibility with surrounding land uses and neighborhood character; and provide greater\nefficiency in the layout and provision of roads, utilities, and other infrastructure. The PDD districts shall not be used as a means of circumventing the Town's adopted land development regulations for routine\ndevelopments.\n(B) Types of PDD Districts\n(1) Major PDD District\nLands rezoned to the Major PDD district shall be twenty-five (25) acres or more in size.\n(2) Minor PDD District\nLands rezoned to the Minor PDD district shall be at least ten (10) and less than twenty-five (25) acres in size.\n(C) Designation Procedure\nDesignation of either a Major or Minor PDD shall require a rezoning pursuant to the procedure set forth in Section 3.4.3, which shall include submission, review, and approval of a planned development\nmaster plan. Simultaneous submission of a development plan is optional for a Major or Minor PDD application.\n(D) General Use and Development Standards for All PDD Districts\n(1) Uses Allowed\nA planned development may contain any or all of the uses specified in the approved PDD master plan, provided such uses are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. A wide range of uses is possible in\na\nPDD district, and the specific uses allowed may be different in each PDD district, so the use tables in Chapter 5 (Table 5.1-1) do not include the PDD districts. All uses that are set out in an approved master plan\nshall be treated as permitted uses within the planned development, except that uses which are prohibited in this Ordinance shall not be permitted within a PDD. Any use not set out in an approved master plan is\na\nprohibited use. The PDD master plan and/or document shall specify the particular use(s) permitted and their locations within the areas of the PDD. Specific use designations in the PDD shall use the same\ncorresponding terms listed in Chapter 5 of this Ordinance.\n(2) Mixed Uses Encouraged\n(a) Mixed use developments are strongly encouraged in the PDD zoning districts, including the mixing of principal residential uses with principal non-residential uses. Mixed use development may occur\nby having two (2) or more principal uses located in the same building (e.g., retail on ground floor, office space above) or by having two (2) or more principal uses located in different buildings sited on the same lot\n58 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "59", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be...\nor parcel (e.g., freestanding child day care center located on the same parcel as an office building).\n(b) Planned developments containing both residential and non-residential uses shall be designed, located, and oriented on the site so that non-residential uses are directly accessible to residents of the\ndevelopment. For the purposes of this section, \"directly accessible\" shall mean pedestrian and vehicular access by way of improved sidewalks or paths and streets that do not involve leaving the planned\ndevelopment or using a major thoroughfare. \"Directly accessible\" does not necessarily mean that non-residential uses need to be located in a particular location, but that the siting of such uses considers the\naccessibility of the residential component of the development to the non-residential use.\n(3) Applicable Standards\n(a) Dimensional standards for development within a PDD zoning shall be stated on the approved master land use plan and/or in the associated document(s). Development in a PDD district shall be\nsubject to all applicable overlay district regulations in Chapter 4, all applicable use regulations set forth in Chapter 5, and all applicable general regulations set forth in Chapters 6, 7, and 8, unless otherwise waived\nor\nmodified by the Town in the terms of the approved master land use plan. In case of any conflict between a specific regulation set forth in this Section 4.5.3 and any regulation set forth in Chapters 4, 5, and 7,\nthe regulation in this section shall apply unless otherwise expressly allowed.\n(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, in no case shall the decision-making body waive or modify the following standards for a proposed PDD zoning district:\n1. Zones 1, 2, and 3 of stream buffers;\n2. Design guidelines;\n3. [Reserved]\n4. Ownership requirements for any open space, buffers, or streetscapes unless otherwise permitted within this Ordinance;\n5. Preservation of existing vegetation in streetscapes, floodplains, and/or buffers;\n6. Street connectivity requirements;\n7. Sidewalk and greenway requirements;\n8. Mixed Use Center requirements (if applicable);\n9. Stormwater control requirements;\n10. Nitrogen reduction requirements; and\n11. Setback reduction below the minimum required by section (c) below.\n(c) There shall be no minimum dimensional standards for planned developments, provided that dimensional standards are stated in the master land use plan and/or the associated development plan, with\nthe following exception:\n1. A building setback of less than three (3) feet is permitted only where firewalls are provided in accordance with all applicable building code requirements.\nWhere the master land use plan and other documents approved as part of the PDD zoning are silent as to a term or requirements, the requirements/standards of this Ordinance and the approved policies\nand procedures of the Town that are applicable to that aspect of development shall control.\n(4) Transportation and Circulation System\nThe planned development's master plan shall demonstrate a safe and adequate on-site transportation system that addresses vehicular, bicycle, transit and pedestrian circulation. The on-site transportation\nsystem shall be integrated with the off-site transportation circulation system of the Town.\n(5) Off-Street Parking and Loading\nThe planned development's master plan shall comply with the off-street parking and loading requirements of Section 7.8, except that variations from these standards may be permitted if a comprehensive\nparking and loading plan for the development is submitted as part of the master plan that is suitable for the development and consistent with the intent and purpose of the off-street parking and loading standards\nof this Ordinance.\n(6) Landscaping\n(a) Compliance with General Landscaping Requirements\nLandscaping shall comply with the standards of Section 7.2, except that variations from these standards may be permitted where it is demonstrated that the proposed landscaping sufficiently buffers uses\nfrom each other, ensures compatibility with land uses on surrounding properties, creates attractive streetscapes and parking areas, and is consistent with the urban design objectives and/or character of the area.\n(b) Stream Buffers Not Variable\nVariations from the minimum state-mandated stream buffers including any Neuse River Riparian Buffer shall not be allowed without requisite approvals from the appropriate state agency.\n(7) Recreational and Open Space Requirements\n(a) Dedication of Recreation Land\nEach residential planned development (or residential portion of a mixed use planned development) shall dedicate recreational open space consistent with the requirements in Chapter 8.\n(b) Common Open Space\nEach residential planned development (or residential portion of a mixed use planned development) shall provide common open space as a percentage of the entire parcel according to the following table:\n(c) Open Space Utilization\nEach residential planned development (or residential portion of a mixed use planned development) shall provide adequate private, common open space facilities including both active and passive\nrecreational uses.\n(d) Timing of Completion of Open Space Requirements\nAll open space and recreational amenities shall be completed and conveyed before certificates of occupancy may be issued for more than fifty (50) percent of the dwelling units in the planned\ndevelopment or, if the approved master plan divides the development into phases, in that phase of the development of which the amenity is a part.\n(e) Contingency Plan for Reserve Land\nPlanned developments with seven hundred (700) or more residential units which are required to set aside reserve land for potential purchase by the Town for use as recreation land shall be required to\ninclude alternative contingency plans for the reserve land in the event it is not acquired by the Town.\n59 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nTABLE 4.2-4: COMMON OPEN SPACE PROVISION IN PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS\nCELL (1, 2): \nTABLE 4.2-4: COMMON OPEN SPACE PROVISION IN PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS\nCELL (1, 3): \nTABLE 4.2-4: COMMON OPEN SPACE PROVISION IN PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS\nCELL (2, 1): \nNumber of Acres in\nDevelopment\nCELL (2, 2): \nPercent of Parcel to\nbe Used as Open\nSpace\nCELL (2, 3): \nAverage Gross Density\nCELL (1, 1): \nTABLE 4.2-4: COMMON OPEN SPACE PROVISION IN PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS\nCELL (1, 2): \nTABLE 4.2-4: COMMON OPEN SPACE PROVISION IN PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS\nCELL (1, 3): \nTABLE 4.2-4: COMMON OPEN SPACE PROVISION IN PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS\nCELL (2, 1): \nNumber of Acres in\nDevelopment\nCELL (2, 2): \nPercent of Parcel to\nbe Used as Open\nSpace\nCELL (2, 3): \nAverage Gross Density\nCELL (3, 1): \n10 to 49\nCELL (3, 2): \n5.0\nCELL (3, 3): \n0 to 4 units per acre\nCELL (4, 1): \n10 to 49\nCELL (4, 2): \n5.0\nCELL (4, 3): \n4.1 to 8 units per acre\nCELL (5, 1): \n51 to 75\nCELL (5, 2): \n7.5\nCELL (5, 3): \n0 to 4 units per acre\nCELL (6, 1): \n51 to 75\nCELL (6, 2): \n7.5\nCELL (6, 3): \n4.1 to 8 units per acre\nCELL (7, 1): \n76 and above\nCELL (7, 2): \n10.0\nCELL (7, 3): \n0 to 4 units per acre\nCELL (8, 1): \n76 to 100\nCELL (8, 2): \n10.0\nCELL (8, 3): \n4.1 to 8 units per acre\nCELL (9, 1): \n101 to 200\nCELL (9, 2): \n12.5\nCELL (9, 3): \n4.1 to 8 units per acre\nCELL (10, 1): \n201 and above\nCELL (10, 2): \n15.0\nCELL (10, 3): \n4.1 to 8 units per acre\n"}, {"page": "60", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be.\n(Ord.

[For example, if the development plan shows a fifty (50) foot rear yard setback, then the required setback will be fifty (50) feet even though the corresponding zoning district may be\nonly twenty-five (25) feet.] In such case, however, the setbacks may be reduced to that required within the zoning district if the homeowners' association concurs (HOA written approval will be deemed final).\nWhere there is no homeowners' association, the setbacks in the zoning district will control.\n(b) If setbacks are shown on the development plan only, and those setbacks are less than that required in the corresponding zoning district, then the setbacks in the zoning district will control.\n(2) Setbacks Shown on Recorded Plat\nIf setbacks are shown on the recorded plat, those setbacks shall control. This shall apply even if the setbacks on the recorded plat are in conflict with those shown on the plan and/or the requirements for\ncorresponding zoning district set forth in Section 6.1 of this Ordinance. This applies even if changes are made to this Ordinance subsequent to plat recordation that would require greater setbacks than those\nshown on the plat.\n(3) No Setbacks Shown Anywhere\nIf there are no setbacks on any documents, such as the development plan or recorded plat, the setbacks shown for the corresponding zoning district in Section 6.1 of this Ordinance shall apply.\n(H) Guidelines for Determining Residential Setbacks Within Planned Developments\n(1) Setbacks Shown on the Development Plan Only\nIf setbacks are shown on the development plan only, then such setbacks shall control.\n(2) Setbacks Shown on the Recorded Plat or the Master Plan for the Planned Development\nIf setbacks are shown on the master plan for the planned development, then such setbacks shall control. However, if a plat was approved and recorded with larger setbacks than what the master plan\nwould allow, an applicant must utilize the setbacks in the approved plat.\n(3) No Setbacks Shown Anywhere\nIf no setbacks are shown on any documents, then the setbacks for a structure or portion of a structure receiving building permit approval after January 14, 2010, shall be those applicable to the general\nzoning district to which the approved use and density of a particular property most closely conform. A structure or portion of a structure that received building permit approval prior to January 14, 2010, shall be\ndeemed conforming with regard to building setbacks if documentation is provided demonstrating that the initial construction was approved by the homeowner's association.\n6.3.2 Setback Requirements\n(A) General Requirements\n(1) A building, structure, or lot shall not be developed, used, or occupied unless it meets the minimum setback requirements set forth in Section 6.1 for the zoning district in which it is located, except as\notherwise established in this Ordinance for particular uses or unless a variance has been granted.\n(2) A setback, court, or other open space required by this Ordinance shall not be included as part of a setback or other open space required by this Ordinance for another building or structure or lot.\n(B) [Reserved]\n(C) Setbacks from Required Buffers and Streetscapes\nBuildings, structures and parking areas shall be set back from required perimeter, streetscape, and Urban Transition Buffers as provided below:\nFor a printer-friendly, PDF version: Table 6.3-01\n103 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nTable 6.3-01 Setbacks From Required Buffers\nCELL (1, 3): \nTable 6.3-01 Setbacks From Required Buffers\nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nPerimeter Buffer and Streetscape Buffer\nCELL (2, 4): \nUrban Transition Buffer\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nTable 6.3-01 Setbacks From Required Buffers\nCELL (3, 3): \nTable 6.3-01 Setbacks From Required Buffers\nCELL (3, 4): \nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (4, 3): \nPerimeter Buffer and Streetscape Buffer\nCELL (4, 4): \nUrban Transition Buffer\nCELL (5, 1): \nNeuse River Basin: Lot Created Prior to July 22, 1997\nJordan Lake Protected Watershed: Lot Created Prior to July 27, 2000*\nCELL (5, 2): \nNeuse River Basin: Lot Created Prior to July 22, 1997\nJordan Lake Protected Watershed: Lot Created Prior to July 27, 2000*\nCELL (5, 3): \nNeuse River Basin: Lot Created Prior to July 22, 1997\nJordan Lake Protected Watershed: Lot Created Prior to July 27, 2000*\nCELL (5, 4): \nCELL (6, 1): \nSingle-Unit\nResidential Use\nCELL (6, 2): \nPrincipal Use\nCELL (6, 3): \n10' if existing vegetation meets required\nbuffer standards;\n0' if new vegetation is installed to meet\nrequired buffer standards\nCELL (6, 4): \nNA\nCELL (7, 1): \nCELL (7, 2): \nAccessory Use or\nVehicular Use Area\nCELL (7, 3): \n5' if existing vegetation meets required\nbuffer standards;\n0' if new vegetation is installed to meet\nrequired buffer standards\nCELL (7, 4): \nNA\n"}, {"page": "104", "text": "Firefox\nhtps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be.\n*Date of adoption of Riparian Buffer Rules by the NC Department of Environment and Natural Resources.\n(1)\nSILL CORNICE\nPORCHES\nOR ORNAMENTAL\nBALCONIES\nFEATURE\n& DECKS\nMAX\n5'MAX\nMAX\nREQUIRED\nREQUIRED\nSETBACK\nSETBACK\n(2)\nDRIVEWAYS AND\nLANDSCAPE\nUNCOVERED\nFEATURES\nPARKING PADS\nREQUIRED\nSETBACK\nSETBACK\n(3)\nACCESSORY BUILDINGS\nAND/OR STRUCTURES\n5 MAX\nREQUIRED SETBACK\nLINES\nPROPERTY LINE\nPATIOS AND TERRACES\nAT GRADE LEVEL\nFeatures Allowed within Required Setbacks\n(D) Features Allowed within Required Setbacks or Yards\n(1) A building, structure, or lot shall not be developed, used, or occupied unless it meets the minimum lot size, setback, and yard requirements set forth for the zoning district in which it is located, except as\notherwise established in this Ordinance.\n(2) A yard, court, or other open space required by this Ordinance shall not be included as part of a yard or other open space required for another building or structure.\n(3) Trees, shrubs, flowers, fences, walls, hedges, other landscape features, driveways, and uncovered parking pads may be located within any required setback and/or yard.\n(4) The buildings or structures on a lot shall not be located in whole or in part within a required setback or yard, except in certain cases.

These requirements are intended to carry out the following\nobjectives:\n(A) To promote and increase design compatibility between different land uses, while ensuring attractive views from streets and adjacent properties;\n(B) To assist in delineating separations of spaces, structures, uses, and activities on a site, or between adjacent sites;\n(c) To shield adjacent properties from potentially adverse external impacts of development, and development from potential negative impacts of adjacent land uses and activities;\n(D) To enhance the streetscape by separating the pedestrian from motor vehicles; abating glare and moderating temperatures of impervious areas; filtering air of pollutants, fumes, and dust; providing shade;\nattenuating noise; and reducing the air temperature, heat, amount and rate of stormwater runoff, and visual impact of large expanses of pavement;\n(E) To promote the preservation of open space; existing tree canopy and vegetation; and natural diversity and wildlife habitat, using supplemental plantings when necessary to meet the performance criteria of\nthis section;\n(F) To mitigate adverse grade changes between adjacent properties;\n(G) To improve the quality of the built and natural environments through air quality enhancements; heat reduction; carbon capture; energy conservation; reductions in the amount and rate of stormwater runoff\nand erosion; stormwater runoff quality improvements; and increase in the capacity for groundwater recharge; the provision of health, economic values, and social benefits; and\n(H) To enhance the appearance and value of both residential and non-residential properties.\nPRINCIPLES OF INTERPRETATION\nThe Landscaping, Buffering, Screening, and Tree Protection section contains requirements for\nthe following: perimeter buffers, streetscape and street front landscaping, tree and vegetation\nprotection, vehicular use area landscaping, fences and walls, screening, and miscellaneous\nlandscaping requirements.\n7.2.2 General Provisions\n(A) Landscaping Plans\n(1) In order to implement the requirements of this section, landscaping plans are required as part of each development plan required under Section 3.9 of this Ordinance. Plans shall be developed by\nindividuals or professional firms having the competence and knowledge to satisfactorily develop plans required by this Section.\n(2) Landscaping plans shall be designed to improve efficiency of irrigated areas (if applicable) through minimizing slopes, preserving topsoil, and retaining stormwater drainage on-site\n(3) Landscaping plans shall meet the standards of this Section 7.2, and shall be consistent with the standards contained in the Community Appearance Manual and the Site Design Standards, which\ncontain standards, guidelines, examples, and details needed to make this section easy to understand and apply in various situations, including examples of required plans, recommended plant species for various\napplications, and illustrated examples of what Cary considers to be good site design.\n(B) Violations\nViolations of this section are subject to fines, replacement of damaged vegetation, stop-work orders, or any combination of the penalties listed in Section 7.2.13 or Chapter 11.\n7.2.3 Requirements for Perimeter Buffers and Landscape Areas\n(A) Applicability\n(1) All uses subject to the requirements of this chapter shall provide an undisturbed buffer to separate that use from adjacent land uses in accordance with Table 7.2-1. The buffer shall have the width,\namount of vegetation, and other features to properly mitigate negative effects of continuous land uses. Whenever new landscape material must be used, such material shall consist of native or non-invasive non-\nnative, drought-tolerant plantings to reduce the need for irrigation systems and promote restoration of a natural forest.\n112 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "113", "text": "Firefox\ntps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be\n(2) Within the area inside the outer perimeter of the Town Center District, including all subdistricts and conditional use districts, and individual Mixed Use Overlay Districts, the requirements of this section\nshall apply only to boundaries between properties located within the district and properties located outside the districts.\n(3) If an undisturbed buffer does not exist on the site, or has been disturbed as allowed in this section, then a re-vegetated natural buffer may be installed. The intent of the re-vegetated buffer is to restore\nthe natural area (i.e., sufficient upper-story trees to achieve a closed canopy in the future and, preferably, no installation of turf grasses).\n(4) The developer of a site/subdivision development shall install the required landscaping within all streetscapes and buffers when: (1) construction activity is discontinued for more than 180 days; and/or (2)\nthe area graded exceeds the initial phase of development. In such instances, all required streetscapes and buffers shall be installed following the completion of the installation of site stabilization measures for all\nareas graded.\n(B) Type and Width of Required Buffer\n(1) Buffers Based on Land Use Class\nTable 7.2-1 specifies the type of undisturbed buffer or landscaped buffer that must be in place. The buffer type is indicated by letter and the total buffer width in feet is indicated by number. Depending on the\nland use classification of the proposed use and the use of the adjacent property Table 7.2-1 requires an undisturbed buffer or landscaped area (if permitted) of a particular type and a particular minimum width.\nSubsection\n7.2.3(C) below identifies the land uses that fall within each land use class shown in Table 7.2-1. This information is also listed by use type in Table 5.1-1 of this Ordinance. Subsection 7.2.3(D) below\nidentifies the performance standards for each buffer type (i.e., A, B, or C).\n(2) Buffer Adjacent to American Tobacco Trail\nA\nfifty (50) foot wide Type A buffer shall be provided adjacent to the American Tobacco Trail as required by Section 4.4.3(H)(4) of this Ordinance.\nFor a printer-friendly, PDF version: Table 7.2-1\n(1) No buffer is required between shared public uses (e.g., a park adjacent to a school, library, or other shared public facility).\n(2) Required landscaping areas to be provided between two Class 2 uses are not subject to the ownership restrictions applied to other buffers, and may be located within the platted portion of a lot.\n(3) Once a detached dwelling has been constructed and occupied, in instances where the landscaping area (planted to a Type B standard) between two (2) type 2 uses is located within the individual\nbuilding lot, the landowner(s) may remove or supplement vegetation on the lot.\n(C) Land Use Classes\nThe seven land use classes appearing in Table 7.2-1 include the following uses and structures (refer to Table 5.1-1 for definition of use categories):\nFor a printer-friendly, PDF version: Table

are as follows. Detailed illustrations and supplemental information on buffer configurations are available in the Community\nAppearance Manual.\n(a) Type A\n1. This buffer is intended to provide the greatest degree of screening feasible and minimize visual contact between uses, creating a strong impression of total separation from the ground to a height of at\nleast eighteen (18) feet. Vegetative material within this buffer shall meet the following criteria:\na) Upper-story trees shall be planted at a density of four (4) trees for every one hundred (100) linear feet of buffer, with a maximum spacing of thirty (30) feet between trees. Upper-story trees shall\nattain a height at maturity of no less than sixty (60) feet.\nb) Evergreen understory trees shall be planted at a density of fourteen (14) trees for every one hundred (100) linear feet of buffer, with a maximum spacing of ten (10) feet between trees. Understory\nevergreen trees shall attain a height at maturity of no less than eighteen (18) feet.\nc) Type A buffers that are wider than thirty (30) feet shall also incorporate shrubs planted at a density of ten (10) shrubs per one hundred (100) linear feet of buffer. Shrubs shall attain a height at\nmaturity of no less than three (3) feet.\nd) Type A buffers may include a wall, fence, landscaped earthen berm, planted vegetation, existing vegetation, or any appropriate combination of these elements.\n2. The Planning Director may modify the planting criteria for a Type A buffer pursuant to this section, where shown on any development plan requiring or identifying a Type A or opaque buffer or\nlandscape area, including such plans approved prior to the effective date of this ordinance, and/or pursuant to Section 4.3.5(D)(3) where such buffer is required as a zoning condition, if the Planning Director\ndetermines in accordance with established horticultural guidelines that achieving the desired degree of buffer opacity while maintaining existing healthy vegetation within the buffer may not be feasible due to a\ncombination of the factors listed below, provided that the intended performance standard is achieved to the extent practicable:\na) type and conditions of significant vegetation remaining within the landscape area or buffer,\nb) availability of sunlight;\nc) dimension of required planting area;\nd) separation between plants;\ne) impact of installation of new plant material on root zones of any existing material;\nf) topography;\ng) proximity of man-made features such as utilities, buildings, sidewalks and retaining walls; and\nh)\nother unique site factors or conditions affecting plant growth and long-term health of the buffer, streetscape or landscape area.\n(b) Type B\nThis buffer is intended to function as a semi-opaque screen from the ground to at least a height of six (6) feet. Vegetative material within this buffer shall meet the following criteria:\n1. Mid- or upper-story trees shall be planted at a density of four (4) trees for every one hundred (100) linear feet of buffer, with a maximum spacing of thirty (30) feet between trees. Mid- or upper-story\ntrees shall attain a height at maturity of no less than forty (40) feet.\n2. Shrubs shall be planted at a density of sixteen (16) shrubs for every one hundred (100) linear feet of buffer, with a maximum spacing of eight (8) feet between shrubs. At least seventy-five (75)\npercent of the shrubs shall be an evergreen species locally adapted to the area.\n3. Type B buffers may include a wall, fence, landscaped earthen berm, planted vegetation, existing vegetation, or any appropriate combination of the elements.\n(c) Type C\nThis buffer area is intended to function as an intermittent visual obstruction from the ground to a height of at least twenty (20) feet, and create the impression of spatial separation without eliminating\nvisual contact between uses. Vegetative material within this buffer shall meet the following criteria:\n1. Upper-story trees shall be planted at a density of three (3) trees for every one hundred (100) linear feet of buffer, with a maximum spacing of forty (40) feet between trees. Upper-story trees shall\nattain a height at maturity of no less than sixty (60) feet.\n2. Understory or ornamental trees shall be planted at a density of five (5) trees for every one hundred (100) linear feet of buffer, with a maximum spacing of twenty-five (25) feet between trees.\nUnderstory or ornamental trees shall attain a height at maturity of no less than fifteen (15) feet.\n3. Type C buffers may include a wall, fence, earth berm, planted vegetation, existing vegetation, or any appropriate combination of these elements.\n(2) Buffer plantings shall conform to the following standards:\n(a) The new plantings comprising the buffer shall be evenly distributed throughout the buffer. In instances where planting in a row or rows is necessary to achieve the desired performance objective, trees\nshall be planted in staggered rows whenever practicable. In cases where the entire buffer width may not be needed to achieve the desired performance objective of the buffer type, the remainder of the required\nbuffer area should have a minimum spacing of trees as required by the associated buffer type.\n(b) Buffer performance requirements must be achieved in the quickest time possible (preferably no more than five (5) years).\n(c) When detailed information regarding existing vegetation is not available at the time of development plan approval, then a Town Zoning Compliance Officer shall determine when existing vegetation\nmay be utilized in-lieu of new plantings prior to the approval of a Certificate of Occupancy.\n115 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nRecreation, general outdoor (commercial/private).\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nUses permitted under the Retail Sales and Service use category, except farm markets and funeral\nhomes.\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nUses permitted under the Telecommunications Facilities use category up to 225 feet in height\nfrom the finished grade elevation to the top of the tower (not including antennae).\nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \nUses permitted under the Vehicles and Equipment use category.\nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nUses permitted under the Warehouse and Freight Movement use category, except outdoor\nstorage and railroad stations and yards.\nCELL (6, 1): \nCELL (6, 2): \nCommuter rail transit station.\nCELL (7, 1): \nClass 7\nCELL (7, 2): \nUses permitted under the Aviation use category.\nCELL (8, 1): \nCELL (8, 2): \nUses permitted under the Industrial Service use category.\nCELL (9, 1): \nCELL (9, 2): \nUses permitted under the Manufacturing and Production use category.\nCELL (10, 1): \nCELL (10, 2): \nMotor vehicle raceways.\nCELL (11, 1): \nCELL (11, 2): \nUses permitted under the Non-Governmental Utilities use category, except minor utility\nsubstations and rail transit stations.\nCELL (12, 1): \nCELL (12, 2): \nOutdoor storage.\nCELL (13, 1): \nCELL (13, 2): \nUses permitted under the Public Accommodation use category, except guest houses, that are\nlocated adjacent to a residential district\nCELL (14, 1): \nCELL (14, 2): \nPublic utility facilities.\nCELL (15, 1): \nCELL (15, 2): \nRailroad stations and yards.\nCELL (16, 1): \nCELL (16, 2): \nUses permitted under the Telecommunications Facilities use category above 225 feet in height\nfrom the finished grade elevation to the top of the tower (not including antennae).\nCELL (17, 1): \nCELL (17, 2): \nUses permitted under the Waste-Related Uses category.\n"}, {"page": "116", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be\n(d) Depending on actual field conditions, additional trees and shrubs may be required in addition to the existing vegetation to meet these buffer requirements.\n(e)\nIn instances where planting requirement calculations produce a fraction, the plants shall be rounded up to the next whole number (e.g. five and one-tenth (5.1) required shrubs shall equal six (6)\nprovided shrubs).\n(E) Determination of Buffer Width and Responsibility for Installation\n(F) Location of Buffers\n(1) The perimeter buffers and/or perimeter landscaped areas required by this Section shall be located along the outer perimeter of the parcel and shall extend to the parcel boundary line or right-of-way line;\nhowever, the buffers may be located along shared access easements between parcels in non-residential developments.

Additional buffer area shall be required when easements\nand other similar features intrude in the buffer.\n(G) Existing Vegetation, Fences, Walls, and Berms\n(1) Existing significant vegetation within the required buffer shall be preserved and credited toward standards for the type of buffer required, unless the existing vegetation is seriously diseased, damaged\nand treatment would not be practical, or vegetation has or will give rise to a nuisance situation. Wherever practical, vegetation removal will be limited to just those portions of the vegetation area necessary to\ncorrect any problems, while the remainder of the vegetation area without problems shall be left intact.\n(2) Existing berms, walls, or fences within the buffer, but not including chain link fencing, may be used in part to fulfill the requirements for the six (6)-foot tall screen where required, provided that these\nelements are in a condition of good repair. Where fences or walls are used, they shall be screened pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 7.2.7(C). Other existing site features within the required buffer area which\ndo\nnot otherwise function to meet the standards for the required buffer shall be screened from the view of other properties or removed, as determined during review and approval of the development plan.\n(3) If existing significant vegetation and other site features do not fully meet the standards for the type of buffer required, then additional vegetation and/or site features (including fences) shall be planted or\ninstalled within the required buffer area to meet the performance criteria outlined in this section.\n(H) Development within Required Buffers\nNo grading, development, land-disturbing activities, or removal of vegetation shall occur within buffers or associated tree protection areas with exception of the following, unless otherwise explicitly permitted\nin this Ordinance. Where disturbance within the buffer is allowed, damage to existing vegetation shall be minimized to the extent practicable and supplemental planting shall be provided as necessary to meet the\nperformance standard of the applicable buffer type.\n(1) Sidewalks, street-side trails and public transit amenities;\n(2) Utilities, including but not limited to water and sewer lines, stormwater drainage channels or piping, and similar features, provided that no reasonable alternative location exists; and\n(a) they are located perpendicular to the buffer or at an angle of at least seventy-five (75) degrees; or\n(b) they are located at an angle less than seventy-five (75) degrees, and the area contained in the disturbed area is replaced with an equal amount of buffer area meeting the applicable buffer standard, in\nproximity to the disturbed area.\n(3) Stormwater impoundment areas or other BMPs provided that no reasonable alternative location exists.\n90.00 Preferred\nMin:\nDevelopment within Required Buffers\n(I) Zoning Change\nA revised plan will be required if changes of use or change in zoning classification occur for an existing use or parcel and such change results in a higher land use classification per criteria listed in\nsubsection 7.2.3(C) above.

For this reason, existing healthy vegetation\nshall be supplemented, if necessary, to achieve a Type A (opaque) standard.\n(2) Non-Residential Development\n(a) Selective thinning of trees less than six (6) inches DBH may occur to improve the viability of trees within the streetscape. An evaluation of the existing vegetation and recommendation for thinning shall\nbe prepared by a certified arborist or by a certified forester and submitted in support of any request involving the removal of trees two (2) inches in DBH or larger. Viable ornamental trees two (2) inches in caliper\nor larger must be saved.\n(b) An applicant may request an exception to remove a portion of existing trees and undergrowth less than two (2) inches DBH to improve the viability of the remaining trees or to allow for greater visibility\nof\nthe site, unless this vegetation is needed to meet the minimum planting requirements for a streetscape. Viable ornamental trees two (2) inches in caliper or larger must be saved.\n(c) All proposals for thinning streetscapes shall be accompanied by a report from a registered landscape architect, certified arborist, or other such specialist justifying the request and containing a more\ndetailed tree survey showing all plant material two (2) inches in caliper or larger that is located within the area of streetscape to be thinned. The Planning Director may require that a portion of existing saplings be\nleft intact to help ensure that the streetscape can function as a natural tree stand.\n(d) Non-Residential sites containing existing forest vegetation within an area designated as the streetscape that is subsequently removed due to construction-related activity shall be revegetated to\npartially re-establish a native forest condition meeting the following criteria:\n1. Existing vegetation or planted upper-story deciduous and evergreen trees shall attain a height at maturity of no less than sixty (60) feet.\n2. At least fifty (50) percent of the required upper-story trees, and at least seventy-five (75) percent of the required shrubs shall be native, evergreen species locally adapted to the area.\n3. The re-established forest shall contain rows of upper-story trees with each row spaced at least fifteen (15) feet apart. Within each row of upper-story trees the trees shall be spaced no wider than\ntwenty (20) feet between tree trunks. The new forest shall also contain native ornamental trees spaced no wider than twenty (20) feet, and one shrub six (6) feet high randomly placed for every ten (10) feet of\nstreetscape length.\n4.\nA re-forested streetscape may include a wall, fence, or landscaped earthen berm, but must also include all required plant material required by this section.\n(B) Installation of Planted Vegetation Along Roadways\nThe Director may allow the installation and maintenance of a planted streetscape in lieu of preservation of the existing vegetation along any streets which are adjacent to the site upon sound justification\nrelated to topography, drainage, site configuration, quality and quantity of existing healthy vegetation, the road construction requirements, or other similar issue. If a planted streetscape is permitted, then the\nfollowing requirements shall apply:\n(1) Any required vegetation shall be installed to reforest the buffer in an amount comparable to what existed naturally (given time for maturity at a later date).\n(2) Existing healthy vegetation may be removed after review and approval by the Planning Director for the following purposes:\n(a) to achieve required automobile sight distance triangles at intersections, driveways, or ingress/egress points;\n(b) to provide drive access to the site;\n(c) to locate sidewalks, street-side trails and public transit amenities;\n(d) to locate residential and non-residential monument signs, provided that no trees greater than six (6) inches dbh are removed for such purpose unless there is no alternative sign location of lesser\nimpact to vegetation outside of the sight distance triangle that would provide adequate visibility for the sign;\n(e) to locate stormwater impoundment areas or other BMPs provided that no reasonable alternative location exists.\n(3)\nThe applicant may appeal the Director's decision by electing to have the development plan forwarded to Town Council for consideration.\n(C) Required Width of Streetscapes for all Types of Development\n(1) The width of the streetscape for non-residential uses shall be a minimum of thirty (30) feet along thoroughfares and collectors designated on the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan or otherwise\ndesignated by the Town, as measured from the ultimate right-of-way line, except as provided.\n(2) For residential developments along thoroughfares, the width of the streetscape shall be a minimum of fifty (50) feet, except as provided; along collectors, a minimum of thirty (30) feet shall be provided,\nexcept as provided.\n(3) To protect the historic character of the Carpenter community, an historic character preservation streetscape is hereby established. New development (residential and non-residential) located along the\nfollowing streets shall provide a fifty (50) foot historic character preservation streetscape outside the right-of-way and/or any public access easements:\n(a) Both sides of Morrisville Carpenter Road from its intersection with Good Hope Church Road to its intersection with Louis Stephens Drive;\n(b) Both sides of existing Good Hope Church Road from its intersection with Morrisville Carpenter Road to a point one thousand one hundred (1,100) feet north;\n(c) Both sides of Saunders Grove Lane;\n(d)\nThe west side of Louis Stephens Drive from its intersection with Morrisville Carpenter Road to a point nine hundred (900) feet north; and\n(e)\nThe west side of Louis Stephens Drive from its intersection with Morrisville Carpenter Road to a point five hundred (500) feet south.\n(4) If existing healthy vegetation is located within the streetscape, a ten (10) foot building/five (5) foot vehicular use area setback from the streetscape is required.\n117 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "118", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be\n(5) According to Section 7.2.10, Allowable Modifications and Reductions, the Planning Director may allow averaging of the width of a residential streetscape to no less than thirty (30) feet only if the\nremaining streetscape effectively mitigates the impact of the adjacent roadway (i.e., through the use of walls or berms with a substantially more intensive landscape plan). Only the Zoning Board of Adjustment\nmay permit other reductions in buffer or streetscape widths.\n(6) Non-residential developments located on local or private streets shall provide a fifteen (15) foot streetscape. In situations where property across the street is zoned or used for residential purposes, the\nstreetscape shall be installed in accordance with the Type A standards.\n(7) The Zoning Board of Adjustment may reduce the prescribed width of streetscape to as little as ten (10) feet at the time of development plan approval. On redeveloped sites or existing non-conforming\nsites, the staff may reduce the streetscape to no less than the streetscape shown on a previously approved plan for the site to promote redevelopment and reuse of existing sites where it is impractical to meet\ncurrent requirements (see Section 7.2.10, Allowable Modifications and Reductions).

Preserving trees and vegetation on a site should not prevent the reasonable development of a site, given its zoning classification. This section 7.2.5 is\ndesigned to recognize unique site conditions and to allow flexibility in meeting the requirements.\nThe Town Council finds that preserving trees and healthy vegetation on a site during development:\n(a) Maintains and enhances the visual character and aesthetic qualities and appearance of the community and preserves community values;\n(b) Conserves and enhances the value of buildings and land\n(c) Conserves the natural resources and environmental quality of the Town and its environs;\n(d) Screens and softens the impact of construction and buildings and balances the scale of buildings;\n(e) Preserves wildlife habitat, controls surface water runoff, and moderates temperatures; and\n(f) Conserves water due to increased absorption ability and reduced heat effects.\n(2) Requirement to Protect Champion Trees\n119 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "120", "text": "Firefox\nhhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be...\nNo champion tree may be disturbed or removed except as specifically allowed by this Ordinance. Preserved champion trees and their associated tree protection areas must be shown on development\nplans and reuse/redevelopment plans as located in a buffer, streetscape, private open space, or other designated permanent tree protection area. In addition, champion trees permitted to be included on a\nresidential lot must be shown on plans for the purpose of designating tree protection fencing during the development and prior to the certificate of occupancy for buildings/structures.\n(3) Tree Survey Requirements\nA tree survey aids in the protection of trees by locating trees on a site before development plans are fully designed so modifications can be made to the plans to protect trees. A tree survey prepared by a\nlicensed surveyor, engineer, or landscape architect is required with the submission of all development plans. Surveys shall have been reviewed and signed by a certified arborist to confirm tree species, especially\nunderstory champion trees. A tree survey is required for development plansand reuse/redevelopment plans that propose to disturb areas that contain or are within the critical root zone of champion trees or\nspecimen and significant trees within required buffers, streetscapes, and floodplains.\nThe survey shall, at a minimum, provide the following information:\n(a) The number, caliper size, and location of either:\n(i) All champion and upperstory specimen trees within all areas to be disturbed, all champion trees within one hundred (100) feet of all areas to be disturbed, and all upperstory specimen trees within fifty\n(50) feet of all areas to be disturbed; or\n(ii) All champion trees located throughout the development plan boundaries, all upperstory specimen trees located within any buffer or streetscape, and all upperstory specimen trees located within fifty\n(50) feet of any buffer or streetscape; and\n(b) All significant trees within the interior ten (10) feet of all buffers, streetscapes, and floodplains; and,\n(c) A general description of the forest or forest stands on site located outside of buffers, streetscapes, and floodplains, including information on the type of trees and general size ranges.\n(4) Incentives and Design Flexibility\nSection 7.2.10 provides incentives and design flexibility for preserving existing healthy trees and forest stands and for protecting the critical root zone of specimen trees located outside of buffers,\nstreetscapes, and floodplains. For example, the Planning Directormay permit the exchange of trees otherwise required to be preserved for the preservation of trees within certain non-residential buffers and may\ngrant parking reductions if trees or forest stands that are not otherwise required to be preserved or are located outside of buffers, streetscapes, and floodplains, are preserved.\n(5) Definitions\nFor purposes of Sections 7.2.5 and 7.2.10 of this Ordinance, the following definitions apply:\n(a) Adversely impacted means that twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the critical root zone of a champion tree will be, or, within the three (3) years prior to the date of application, was disturbed.\n(b) Disturbed means any use of land that results in a change in the natural cover or topography. This may include the grading, digging, cutting, scraping, compaction, or excavation of soil, placement of\nfill\nmaterials,\npaving, construction, substantial removal of vegetation, or any activity which bares soil or rock or involves the diversion or piping of any natural or man-made watercourse. Routine maintenance of\nlandscape areas is not included as \"land disturbance.\"\n(c) Grouping means that the critical root zone of two (2) or more champion trees or champion tree(s) and specimen tree(s) overlap.\n(d) Open Space means all buffers, streetscapes, or floodplains; open space required through rezoning conditions; permanent tree protection areas; designated community gathering spaces; bonus open\nspace for conservation residential subdivisions; and other non-regulated permanent open space.\n(e) Large Champion Tree means any upperstory champion tree forty (40) caliper inches and larger or any understory champion tree fifteen (15) caliper inches and larger.\n(f)\nSmall Champion Tree means any upperstory champion tree less than forty (40) caliper inches or any understory champion tree less than fifteen (15) caliper inches.\n(g) Prominent Location means areas: along any thoroughfare or collector roadway; along a public/private street interior to the site; surrounded by buildings/homes on at least two (2) sides; or immediately\nadjacent to or within twenty (20) feet of a public greenway easement or public greenway property boundary.\n(h) Tree protection area means areas that are required by this ordinance to be encircled and enclosed within a tree protection fence.\n(i) Tree protection fencing means the fencing required by Section 7.2.5(B)(2) of this Ordinance.\n(B) Tree Protection During Construction\n(1) Owner's Responsibility\nDuring development of the property, the owner, developer, and/or builder shall be responsible for the erection of tree protection fencing to protect existing and/or installed vegetation from damage during\ndevelopment and prior to certificate of occupancy for buildings/structures. Any disturbance within the boundaries of such tree protection areas that is not authorized by the terms of this Ordinance shall result in\nfines as identified in Section 11.5.2(B)(2)(b), in addition to any other fines and replanting requirements for the removal or damage of vegetation within tree protection areas.\n(2) Tree Protection Fencing\n(a) Where Required\nAll existing trees and vegetation that are to be preserved shall be completely encircled and enclosed within a fence that meets the requirements of this Ordinance before grading begins. Additionally, tree\nprotection fencing shall be required around champion trees and shall extend in a circular manner a distance of at least one and one-quarter (1.25) feet from the tree for each inch of caliper (excluding existing and\nundisturbed non-pervious area on redevelopment/reuse sites). The distance may be reduced if allowed under Section 7.2.10 of this Ordinance. Tree protection fencing of areas adjacent to existing and proposed\nroadways is also required. Tree protection fencing is required on all Town transportation projects that are adjacent to streetscapes or buffers. Existing site conditions shall be taken into consideration in determining\nthe exact location of any tree protection fencing and staff may authorize field adjustments to the amount of tree protection fencing needed.\n(b) Type of Tree Protection Fencing\nAll tree protection fencing required by this section shall be four (4) feet orange polyethylene laminar fencing a minimum four (4) feet high and of durable construction. Passive forms of tree protection may\nbe\nutilized to delineate tree save areas that are remote from areas of land disturbance at the discretion of the Planning Director.\n(c) Signage\nSigns shall be installed on the tree protection fence visible on all sides of the fenced-in area (minimum one (1) on each side and/or every three hundred (300) linear feet). The size of each sign must be a\nminimum of two (2) feet by two (2) feet and shall contain the following language in English and Spanish: \"TREE PROTECTION ZONE, KEEP OUT.\"\n(d) When Required\nThe tree protection fencing shall be clearly shown on the development plan. No construction, grading, equipment or material storage, or any other activity shall be allowed within the tree protection area.\nTree protection fencing shall be maintained until the final site inspection prior to the Certificate of Occupancy is scheduled (including any required perimeter buffer for single-unit dwelling construction). The tree\nprotection fencing shall be removed prior to final site inspection for the Certificate of Occupancy.\n(3) Disturbance\nDisturbance within the area required to be designated as a tree protection area, shall occur only if approved by staff on the development plan. If such a disturbance is permitted for reasons such as location\nof minor utility lines, the following preventive measures shall be employed:\n(a) Clearing Activities\nThe disturbance of land, including disturbance caused by the removal of trees adjacent to tree protection areas can cause inadvertent damage to the trees in the tree protection area. If trees are being\nremoved adjacent to tree protection areas, a minimum one and one-half 1/2)-foot trenches must be cut along the limits of land disturbance, so as to cut, rather than tear, roots. Trenching shall be required for the\nprotection of specimen and/or champion tree critical root zones immediately adjacent to or within the land disturbance area (see Community Appearance Manual for further guidance).\n(b) Soil Compaction\nWhere compaction might occur due to traffic or the transportation of materials through the tree protection area, the tree protection area must first be mulched with a minimum four (4)-inch layer of\nprocessed pine bark or wood chips or a six (6)-inch layer of pine straw (see Community Appearance Manual). Equipment or materials storage shall not be allowed within tree protection areas.\n(C) Protection of Champion Trees\n(1) Intent/Purpose\nOne purpose of this subsection is to protect healthy champion trees during the development process. This shall be accomplished through the review and implementation of development plans and reuse/\nredevelopment plans. Trees, including champion trees located on existing single-unit lots, that are otherwise not subject to regulation under Chapter 7 of this Ordinance, are not subject to these requirements.\nFlexibility in site design is provided for in Section 7.2.10 which permits area used to preserve champion trees that is not otherwise required to be preserved to be offset by deducting area from other required\nlandscape/buffer areas.

The Planning Director shall approve all berms. Berms proposed to be greater than four (4) feet in height may be permitted by the Director if the four (4) foot maximum height is not practicable due to\nphysical site constraints, such as topography, presence of stream buffers or other natural features, or lot dimensions; or due to presence of existing development or infrastructure.\n(2) Proposed berms to be placed over an existing or proposed utility easement(s) shall be approved by the Development Review Committee.\n(3) All berms, regardless of size, shall be stabilized with a ground cover or other suitable vegetation according to the Town's Standard Specifications and Details\n(4) The Directors of Public Works, Transportation and Facilities, and Planning shall approve all berms proposed to be placed along street right(s)-of-way. Such berms shall be designed and constructed to\nprovide adequate sight distances at intersections and along all other roads.\n(5) Berms proposed to satisfy the buffer requirements specified in subsection 7.3.2 shall be vegetated as required by this section. Berms must be stabilized with ground cover to prevent erosion and\nsedimentation. Use of berms as a substitute for existing healthy vegetation is strongly discouraged. However, if berms are allowed to replace existing vegetation that already meets the standards contained in this\nsection, then they must also meet the buffer standards and must be approved by the Planning Director.\n(6) Berms shall in no case damage the roots of existing healthy vegetation designated to be preserved.\n(F) Easements\nNothing shall be planted or installed within an underground or overhead utility easement or a drainage easement without the consent of the Town and the easement holder at the time of site plan approval.\n(G) Designated Utility Corridors\nIn order to reduce the damage to root systems of existing vegetation within streetscapes, buffers or any other tree save areas, designation of planned utility connection corridors is required to be shown on all\ndevelopment plans to coordinate the location of electrical, telephone, cable, and other similar utilities.\n(H) Additional Requirement for Clear-Cut Sites or Sites with Removed Vegetation in Required Vegetation Protection Areas\nLarger trees up to four (4) inches in caliper and/or up to double the amount of the required number of trees and shrubs may be required by the Planning Director if the site and/or the required vegetation\nprotection areas specified in this Ordinance were clear cut within five (5) years prior to submittal of a development plan.\n(I) It is recommended that all common areas and similar areas used as general unspecified open space be stabilized using warm season grasses or planted with trees to increase canopy cover.\n(J) Variety of Plant Species Required\nNo single species of tree shall constitute more than twenty-five (25) percent of the plant material of its type installed on a single development site. This restriction may be modified by the Planning Director on\nsites smaller in size than two (2) acres provided that an acceptable variety of plant material is proposed.\n(K) Soil Amendments Required\nSoil amendments shall be specified and used to improve the quality of soil used as planting media for trees. This requirement applies to all development, except for residential single-unit lots. Common areas\nof subdivisions and townhouse developments are subject to the requirements of this section.\n(1) A registered Landscape Architect shall provide a recommended soil amendment schedule based on the existing soils found on-site and the type of plant material proposed. This schedule shall be\nincluded as part of the required landscape plan submitted as part of a development plan.\n(2) Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, a certified statement shall be provided to town staff Cary Site Inspector attesting to the fact that the soil amendment schedule was followed as\nspecified in the approved development plan. This statement shall be certified by a registered landscape architect, certified arborist, or other such specialist.\n(L) Reforestation of Cut and Fill Slopes\nWhere portions of a site have been graded due to, but not limited to, topography, cut and fill slopes associated with road and/or parking lot construction; with transitional perimeter grading; or with the\ninstallation of major utilities, and other similar areas, the development plan shall contain a reforestation plan prepared by a landscape architect, a certified arborist, a registered forester, or another such\nprofessional specialist. The reforestation plan shall conform to the following standards:\n(1) Loblolly Pine (Pinus taeda) seedlings shall be installed on a staggered grid with a spacing of ten (10) feet within a row and fifteen (15) feet between rows.\n(2)\nAlternate tree species or planting arrangements may be approved by the Planning Director in response to site-specific characteristics that dictate such a change.\n(3) The plantings required by this subsection shall not be subject to the requirements of subsections (J) and (K) above.\n(M) Separation from Utility Appurtenances\nIn order to prevent conflicts and allow for appropriate maintenance, canopy trees shall be placed at least ten (10) feet from electrical transformers and twenty (20) feet from light poles.\n7.2.10 Allowable Modifications and Reductions\n(A) This Section 7.2.10 provides flexibility and presents alternative ways to meet the standards set forth in this Ordinance, while encouraging the preservation of existing healthy vegetation and innovation in\nsite design.\n(1) Existing healthy vegetation and the area of land used to maintain the vegetation may be counted toward meeting the performance criteria for buffers, streetscapes, and vehicular use areas set out in\nSections 7.2.3, 7.2.4, and 7.2.6.\n(2) Up to a twenty (20) percent reduction in the number of parking spaces required on the site shall be allowed to the extent that the reduction in the amount of required pavement will preserve existing\nhealthy trees in an undisturbed, natural condition.\n(3) Reduction of the buffer width may be approved, as provided below.\n(a) The Zoning Board of Adjustment may reduce the width of required streetscapes and buffers to no less than ten (10) feet pursuant to this section. Buffer reductions between uses may be considered\nbased on the use of innovative site/building design concepts. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may make exceptions to this minimum width for development within the Town Center District and for reuse/\nredevelopment sites. Reductions in the width of streetscapes and buffers should only be allowed when:\n(1) At least one (1) of the following conditions exists:\na. meeting the required width prevents reasonable use of the property based on the zoning; or\nb. additional open space beyond that already required is provided elsewhere on the site; and\n(2) The modification advances the goals and purposes of the LDO.\nThe Planning Director may allow reuse/redevelopment sites to maintain their existing buffer and streetscape widths even if such width is less than current ordinance requirements so long as the proposed\ndevelopment plan does not reduce the existing buffer or streetscape width on the site. If existing pavement, curbs, and/or buildings are being removed from the required buffer and streetscape widths, the Planning\nDirector may require plantings to reasonably meet the intent of the landscape requirements (i.e., parking lot screening, streetscape/buffer and parking lot trees).\n(4) An average buffer/streetscape width that equals the width of the required buffer/streetscape may be approved, provided that all of the following requirements are met:\n(a) The buffer/streetscape average equals the required width {'{'}for example, a required fifty (50) foot buffer could average a minimum of fifty (50) feet in width.{'}\n(b) In no case shall a buffer/streetscape that is adjacent to single-unit residential development be less than thirty (30) feet in width.\n(c) All buffer/streetscape areas that are less than the required minimum width must include additional vegetation, walls/fencing, and/or other measures.\n(5) Where spacing of required streetscape trees evenly across the frontage of the property or existing vegetation would interfere with the visibility of features or landscapes intended specifically for public or\ncivic purposes such as art, monuments, memorials, and historic structures, the required number of trees may be staggered, clustered and otherwise arranged as deemed appropriate in order to promote optimal\ngrowth and health of the vegetation. In addition, existing vegetation may be removed from the streetscape for visibility of features provided that an area equal to the area of vegetation being removed is preserved\nelsewhere on the site (in addition to required buffers).\n(6) The area used for preserving existing healthy non-champion trees within the site may be used as credit for required perimeter non-residential buffers and interior buffers, at a rate of one and one-half\n(1.5) times. For example, if the area taken up by the preserved vegetation is one thousand two hundred (1,200) square feet, then the applicant may deduct an area equal to one thousand eight hundred (1,800)\nsquare feet from other required landscape/buffer areas. However, the application of this subsection is subject to the limits provided under Section 7.2.10. In addition, the area removed from required perimeter\nbuffers should not contain specimen tree stands. For purposes of this section, \"area taken up by preserved vegetation\" includes the area under the tree canopies.\n(7) Interior buffer areas may be relocated provided that the square footage of area is relocated elsewhere on the site (preferably to save more existing vegetation).\n(8) The required streetscape along thoroughfares and collectors may be reduced to ten (10) feet, and building setbacks from the streetscape to zero (0) when buildings are placed close to the street inside\nMixed Use Overlay Districts.\n125 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "126", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be...\n(B) In addition to subsection (A) above, and in order to provide for flexibility in site design and landscape requirements to preserve champion trees, the Planning Director shall administratively approve the\nbelow modifications in the order listed and only to the extent necessary to preserve champion trees. Specifically, the area preserved in association with saving champion trees may be exchanged for area used to\nmeet the other LDO requirements referenced below.

The installation of these requirements shall comply with the required planting standards set forth in the Town's\nCommunity Appearance Manual and the soil erosion and sedimentation control provisions in Section 7.4. Installation of required landscaping (i.e., trees and shrubs) shall be strongly discouraged during the\nmonths of April through September. The use of alternative water source (other than public water) is encouraged to ensure plantings are healthy after first growing season. Projects which require installation of\nlandscaping between April through September are required to have a landscape agreement in place prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy.\n(B) Extensions and Exceptions\nThe Planning Director may grant exceptions and extensions to the above time limit in the following circumstances and under the following conditions:\n(1) Exceptions may be granted due to unusual environmental conditions, such as drought, ice, over-saturated soil (deep mud), or inappropriate planting season for the plant species (plantings between April\nthrough September are strongly discouraged), provided that the developer or property owner provides the Town with a certification on a form approved by the Planning Department ensuring the installation of the\nremaining landscape materials. In such cases, the Planning Director may issue a conditional Certificate of Occupancy for a period of thirty (30) to one hundred eighty (180) days, depending on the Director's\nrecommendation for the next earliest planting season.\n(2) Exceptions may be granted due to the substitution or unavailability of plant species or acceptable plant size as specified on the development plan, provided that the developer or property owner provides\nthe\nTown with a certification on a form approved by the Planning Department to ensure that the unavailable plants will be installed on the property. In such cases, the Director may issue a temporary Certificate of\nOccupancy for a term of up to one hundred eighty (180) days or to the next planting season, whichever comes first. Only twenty (20) percent of the plant materials to be installed on the property may be delayed\nunder this exception. All such substitutions shall be marked on the \"as-built\" landscaping plans submitted to the Planning Director, and must be signed, dated, and approved by that Director prior to installation.\n(3) Exceptions may be granted due to circumstances beyond the developer's or property owner's control, such as incomplete construction or utility work to occur in a proposed landscaped area within thirty\n(30) days after expected site completion, provided that the developer or property owner submits a letter from the utility company stating the estimated installation date, and provides a certification on a form\napproved by the Planning Department to ensure installation of the required landscaping. In such cases, the Inspections and Permits Department may issue a temporary conditional Certificate of Occupancy.\n7.2.12 Implementation of Landscape Plan; Inspections\n(A) Inspections Prior to Certificate of Occupancy\nThe Planning Department shall inspect the site prior to the issuance of a permanent Certificate of Occupancy for the development and the Inspections and Permits Department shall not issue the permanent\nCertificate of Occupancy if the landscaping required under this section is not living or healthy or is not installed in accordance with the standards set forth in this section and in accordance with the approved\ndevelopment plan.\n(B) Inspections After First Year\nThe Planning Department shall inspect the site one (1) year after the issuance of a permanent Certificate of Occupancy in order to ensure compliance with the approved development plan and to ensure that\nthe landscaping is properly maintained.

Colored renderings may be required, but shall not be a substitute for this requirement. In addition to listing the color(s), the SAC shall also\ndescribe how and where the color will be used. It is recognized that the same color on a different material may not match exactly.\n(B) Accent Colors\nThese colors may be used as a secondary unifying element provided they are used throughout the development. Non-illuminated accent bands (e.g. canopies with gas stations and the roof of fast food\nbuildings on roofs, canopies, or other features shall be one (1) of the primary colors of the development or be white or earth tone in color.\n(C) Exterior Materials\nThe dominant material or combination of materials shall be defined. For each building material selected, the color of that material shall also be defined.\n(D) Architectural Features\nArchitectural features refer to a number of building elements that are repeated throughout the development. These include, but are not limited to: roof lines, canopies, building ornamentation, patterns, and\nbuilding form. Any architectural feature designated as a unifying element throughout all buildings shall contribute to the identity of the development and not be just a minor architectural detail.\n(1) Use of Awnings\nNo lawnings/canopies shall be internally lit. All lawnings/canopies shall utilize the same design and color throughout the development.\n(2) Roof Type\nOutparcels may use a different roof type (e.g., pitch vs. flat) than the main buildings within centers provided that the building on the outparcel is a size where the different roof type does not dominate the\ncenter and/or the roof type has a tie to the other buildings (e.g., mansard roofs).\n(3) Detached Canopies\nDetached canopies are subject to the provisions of the Community Appearance Manual, including color and roof pitch requirements.\n(E) Landscaping\nPlant materials may be used in such a way as to reinforce compatibility depending on the type of plant materials selected and their placement on the site. This previous statement is not intended to limit\ncreative landscape designs within the center, but to promote general compatibility in materials. Drought tolerant or native species (including trees, shrubs, and turf grasses) that do not require extensive watering\nare strongly recommended.\n(F) Setbacks and Building Placement\nThe use of common setbacks and building orientation from a street right-of-way may be an appropriate unifying element where a number of freestanding buildings occur within the development.\n(G) Building Height\nA standard height among a group of buildings can usually tie the buildings together visually.\n(H) Lighting\nA consistent type of lighting fixture repeated throughout the development as well as a similar wattage, height, type of light produced and/or color of light are to serve as a unifying element. Light pole height,\nwattage, pole/fixture/light color should all be the same.\n7.7.6 Recording Requirements\nWhere non-residential development plans or residential multi-family development plans are approved, no lots shall be recorded without noting the general requirements for architectural compatibility on the\nmaps for recordation. Owners of properties with non-residential development plans which include outparcel lots are strongly recommended to record architectural compatibility covenants which refer to these\nrequirements on record in the Planning Department. These covenants shall run with the land and be administrated by a property owners' association or similar organization.\n7.7.7 Amendment Process\n(A) The SAC may be amended if the amendments are signed by the owner of the non-residential center or overall project and approved by the Planning Director. The Director shall review the amendments\nbased on their ability to meet the intent of this Ordinance. The SAC for the main structures of the development shall be approved as part of the first development plan within a development.\n(B) Any revision to the SAC that involves a change in the primary characteristics of an existing development (such as a change in color or addition of a canopy) shall be reviewed and approved by those with\nthe authority to approve plans and all owners of property falling under the SAC governance. Any change in primary or secondary characteristics shall be implemented comprehensively throughout the entire\ndevelopment including outparcels within a reasonable time frame (i.e., less than one year unless otherwise approved by the Planning Director). Any approved changes shall meet the criteria of Section 7.7.5.\n(Ord. No. 06-009, adopted 4-27-06; eff. 4-27-06; Ord. No. 2008-LDO-01, 9-25-08; Ord. No. 2012-LDO-06, 8-9-12; Ord.

However, where off-street parking spaces are provided,\nthey shall be considered \"Required Parking Spaces\" for the purpose of determining the proportionate number of required handicapped parking spaces per Section 7.8.2(F).\n(B) Effect on New and Existing Uses\n(1) Parking Spaces Required\nPermanent off-street parking spaces shall be provided as specified by this section for all uses occupying land or facilities (or portions thereof). Such parking spaces may be provided in a parking garage.\nThe requirements of this section shall be met:\n(a) At the time a Certificate of Occupancy is issued for a building or structure in which an approved use takes place;\n(b) At the time any principal or ancillary use or building is enlarged or increased in capacity, such as by adding dwelling units, guest rooms, seats, floor area, or other units of measurement used in Table\n7.8-1, which follows; or\n131 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "132", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be..\n(c) Before conversion from one (1) type of use or occupancy to another, or any change in the manner in which the use is constructed that would result in additional parking requirements.\n(2) Certification\nEach development plan that is submitted for approval shall include information as to the number, location, and dimensions of all off-street parking and loading spaces and the means of ingress and egress\nto such spaces. This information shall be illustrated in sufficient detail to indicate whether the requirements of this Section are met. In those cases where no development plan is required, the applicant must show\nthat the number of parking spaces and the design and construction of all parking areas meet the requirements of this Section in order to receive a Certificate of Occupancy.\n(3) Timing of Construction\n(a) Except as provided in paragraph (B)(2) above, all parking areas required under this Section shall be completed prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the use or uses that they serve.\n(b) Parking areas for phased development projects shall be provided in accordance with Table 7.8-1.\n(C) Computation of Off-Street Parking Requirements\n(1) Calculations\nWhen measurements of the number of required spaces result in fractions, the space requirements shall be rounded upward to the next highest whole number.\n(2) Different Use Areas\nExcept as provided for in this chapter, parking shall be calculated separately for each different use area in a building or on a site, including all ancillary uses.\n(3) On-Street Parking\nExcept as provided for in this chapter, on-street parking within public or private streets, driveways, or drives, shall not be used to satisfy the off-street parking requirements prescribed by this section, except\nfor townhouse developments. Townhouses may count delineated, on-street parking spaces within the development towards their visitor parking requirements.\n(4) Commercial Parking Maximums\n(a) For uses classified as commercial, the number of spaces shown in Table 7.8-1 shall be considered the maximum number of surface spaces allowed for such uses for the purpose of reducing\nunnecessary/rarely-used parking and decreasing the amount of impervious surface on sites.\n(b) Parking spaces provided within a parking deck or other parking structure shall not count toward the maximum parking requirement. For the purposes of this subsection, a parking structure includes\nany structure that provides parking vertically on more than one (1) level or that provides parking underneath a building that has occupied floor(s) above the parking level.\n(c) As part of the review and approval of any procedure set forth in Chapter 3, the Planning Director may approve an increase in the maximum number of surface parking spaces of up to thirty (30)\npercent only if the additional surface parking is necessary to satisfy the parking expected for the use, based on factors including, but not limited to, the number of employees per square foot; the number of trips\ngenerated by the use, and the time of day when the use generates the most trips.\n(d) The Zoning Board of Adjustment may approve an increase in the maximum number of surface parking spaces above thirty (30) percent only if it finds, after conducting a quasi-judicial hearing, that the\nincrease advances the goals and purposes of this Ordinance and is necessary to satisfy the demand for parking expected for the use based on factors including, but not limited to, the number of employees per\nsquare foot; the number of trips generated by the use; and the time of day when the use generates the most trips.\n(5) Parking Based on Seating\nWhen requirements use seating as a unit of measurement, all calculations shall be based on the design capacity of the areas used for seating.\n(6) Parking Based on Floor Area\nExcept as provided for in this Section, when requirements use amount of square footage in buildings as a unit of measurement, all calculations shall be based on gross floor area\n(7) Parking Based on Students, Staff, and Occupants\nExcept as provided for in this chapter, when requirements use number of students, staff, or occupants as a unit of measurement, all calculations shall be based on the maximum enrollment, the largest\nnumber of persons working on any single shift, or the maximum fire-rated capacity, whichever is applicable and results in the greater number of required spaces.\n(8) Residential Parking\n(a) Driveways may be used to satisfy minimum on-site parking requirements, provided that sufficient space is available to prevent vehicle encroachment onto sidewalk and/or into adjoining vehicular travel\nlanes.\n(b) All parking required by Table 7.8-1 shall be located directly at the dwelling unit for which the parking is intended, or not more than two hundred (200) feet away from the dwelling unit. Adequate off\nstreet pedestrian access shall be provided between the required parking space(s) and the dwelling unit. With appropriate justification, this distance may be increased by the Planning Director.\n(c) Visitor Parking. Visitor parking shall be installed in accordance with Section 7.8.2(G).\nVisitor parking for townhouses shall not be more than three (300) feet from the dwelling unit(s) for which it is provided to serve. These spaces may be provided via delineated on-street or off-street\nparking spaces.\n(d) Parking for single-unit and duplex dwelling units shall be considered an accessory use subject to requirements of Section 5.3.4(K).\n(9) Parking for Unlisted Uses\nParking requirements for uses not specifically listed in Table 7.8-1 shall be determined by the Planning Director based on the requirements for the closest comparable use, as well as on the particular\nparking demand and trip generation characteristics of the proposed use. The Planning Director may alternately require the submittal of a parking demand study that justifies estimates of parking demand based on\nthe recommendations of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE), and includes relevant data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same or comparable to the proposed use in terms of density,\nscale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location.\n(10) Unimpeded Parking\nGenerally, no parking spaces shall be located so as to require the moving of any vehicle on the premises in order to enter or leave any other space. Notwithstanding the above, the Planning Director may\nallow stacking spaces provided for auto-related uses to count toward the minimum required parking, as long as such spaces are not part of areas required for site ingress or egress, or areas intended for fueling.\n(D) Required Off-Street Parking Spaces\n(1) Schedule \"A\"\nUnless otherwise expressly stated in this Ordinance, off-street parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with Table 7.8-1. Off-street parking spaces for uses within the Town Center District shall be\nprovided according to Section 6.1.3 of this Ordinance. For uses classified as commercial, the number of motor vehicle spaces shown on the table shall be considered the maximum allowed for such uses.\nExceptions to the maximum parking allowed may be approved if justified in accordance with Section 7.8.2(C)(4).\nFor a printer-friendly, PDF version: Table 7.8-1\nTABLE 7.8-1: OFF-STREET PARKING SCHEDULE \"A\"\n(\"du\" = dwelling unit;

Parking areas shall provide suitable maneuvering room so that all vehicles\nmay enter an abutting street in a forward direction. The backing of a motor vehicle onto a public street from a parking area shall be prohibited, except for residential parking. The Director of Transportation and\nFacilities may allow parking on public streets within the Town Center, and Mixed Use Overlay Districts provided that the design is consistent with the Site Design Standards or other applicable policies and plans\nand does not create a safety issue. Pedestrian pathways shall be provided within parking areas in accordance with Section 7.10.4 of this ordinance and consistent with the Site Design Standards.\n(2) All parking areas shall be designed, constructed, and drained in accordance with the Town's Standard Specifications and Details Manual\n(3) Parking facilities shall be continually maintained in compliance with the approved development plan and shall be free of litter and debris at all times.\n(4) Each parking area shall meet all applicable landscaping, screening, and buffering requirements set forth in Section 7.2 of this Ordinance.\n(5) All parking areas shall be separated at least ten (10) feet from buildings, in order to allow room for sidewalks, landscaping, and other plantings between the building and the parking area. This separation\nmay be eliminated in the rear of buildings in areas designed for unloading and loading of materials; this applies primarily to industrial and warehousing buildings.\n(6) The visibility of parking areas shall be reduced by placing at least thirty (30) percent of the parking to the rear or side of buildings for all non-residential developments greater than five (5) acres. An\nalternative to this requirement is to screen the parking from the public roadway with a Type A streetscape and/or berm. No parking is allowed between non-residential buildings and the right-of-way for individual\nbuildings located on sites at the intersection of thoroughfares and/or collectors designated on the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan unless the building floor elevation is ten (10) feet or more below the\ngrade of the adjacent roadway.\n(7) [Reserved]\n(8) For residential uses requiring designated visitor parking and consisting of more than one (1) building, the total number of required visitor parking spaces shall be provided in small groups evenly\ndispersed throughout the entire site.\n(9) Each parking pod/bay shall not exceed two hundred (200) spaces without being separated by streets, primary travel ways, and/or pedestrian plazas (see Site Design Standards for examples and\nadditional guidance). Exceptions can be made by the Planning Director for single tenant spaces forty thousand (40,000) square feet and over.\n(10) Parking in front of main building entrances along private streets and/or primary travel ways is required with the exception of those areas used for loading and unloading, fire lanes, outdoor display of\nmerchandise, and pedestrian access from the main entrance to parking areas. Parking on public streets may be provided if approved by the Transportation and Facilities and Planning Directors, and depending on\nanticipated vehicular speeds, traffic volumes, pedestrian conflicts, and the particular design and geometry of parking. The intent of these streets is to provide the primary circulation network through and within a\ndevelopment.\n(H) Reduction in Number of Required off-street parking spaces\n(1) As part of the review and approval of any procedure set forth in Chapter 3, the Planning Director may approve a reduction of up to fifteen (15) percent in the number of designated parking spaces only if\nthe reduced number of parking spaces will be sufficient to satisfy the demand for parking expected for the use, based on the nature of the use, the number of trips generated by the use, the times of day when the\nuse generates the most trips, and the extent to which other establishments are located on the same property and may reduce the number of vehicle trips required between different establishments.\n(2) As part of the review and approval of any procedure set forth in Chapter 3, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may allow the following reductions. Review of a parking reduction request does not change\nthe\napplicable approval authority for the development plan as a whole. Any request for parking reduction in excess of the reductions permitted here shall be processed as a variance request (Section 3.20).\n(a) The Zoning Board of Adjustment may allow a reduction of up to thirty (30) percent in the number of designated parking spaces upon holding a quasi-judicial hearing and finding that the such reduced\nnumber advances the goals and purposes of the Ordinance and will be sufficient to satisfy the demand for parking expected for the use, based on the nature of the use, the number of trips generated, the times of\nday when the use generates the most trips, and the extent to which other establishments are located on the same property and may reduce the number of vehicle trips required between different establishments.\n(b) The Zoning Board of Adjustment may allow a reduction of up to fifty (50) percent in the number of designated parking spaces for a development in the Town Center (TC) zoning district upon holding a\nquasi-judicial hearing and finding that such reduced number advances the goals and purposes of the Ordinance and will be sufficient to satisfy the demand for parking expected for the use, based on the following:\n1. Nature of the use;\n2. The number of trips generated;\n3. The times of day when the use generates the most trips;\n4. The extent to which other establishments are located on the same property and may reduce the number of vehicle trips required between different establishments; and\n5. The availability of nearby on-street spaces or public parking facilities.\n(3) In cases where no development plan is required, or where a previously approved plan remains in effect for the property, the Planning Director may grant a reduction of up to fifteen (15) percent of the\nrequirements of subsection 7.8.2(D) above only if the reduced number of parking spaces will be sufficient to satisfy the demand for parking expected for the use, based on the nature of the use, the number of trips\ngenerated by the use, the times of day when the use generates the most trips, and the extent to which other establishments are located on the same property and may reduce the number of vehicle trips required\nbetween different establishments.\n(I) Violation Resolution\nIn cases where no plan previously approved remains in effect for the property, the Planning Director may grant reductions from the requirements of subsection 7.8.2(D) above only upon finding that the\nreduced number of parking spaces will be sufficient to satisfy the demand for parking expected for the use, based on the nature of the use, the number of trips generated by the use, the times of day when the use\ngenerates the most trips, and the extent to which other establishments are located on the same property and may reduce the number of vehicle trips required between different establishments. This section shall\napply only when reducing the required number of parking spaces is necessary to resolve a violation of this Ordinance or of the previously approved plan.\n7.8.3 Parking Alternatives\nAmerican Legal\nPublishing\nNew Ordinance Notice:\nPublisher's Note: Section 7.8 has been amended by Ord. 2023-LDO-04 approved 11/16/2023, effective 11/16/2023.\n138 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nTABLE 7.8-4: HANDICAPPED PARKING FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL USES\nCELL (1, 2): \nTABLE 7.8-4: HANDICAPPED PARKING FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL USES\nCELL (2, 1): \nTotal Number of Required Parking Spaces\nCELL (2, 2): \nNumber of Required Handicapped Spaces\nCELL (3, 1): \n1-25\nCELL (3, 2): \n1\nCELL (4, 1): \n26-50\nCELL (4, 2): \n2\nCELL (5, 1): \n51-75\nCELL (5, 2): \n3\nCELL (6, 1): \n76-100\nCELL (6, 2): \n4\nCELL (7, 1): \n101-150\nCELL (7, 2): \n5\nCELL (8, 1): \n151-200\nCELL (8, 2): \n6\nCELL (9, 1): \n201-300\nCELL (9, 2): \n7\nCELL (10, 1): \n301-400\nCELL (10, 2): \n8\nCELL (11, 1): \n401-500\nCELL (11, 2): \n9\nCELL (12, 1): \n501-1,000\nCELL (12, 2): \n2 percent of total spaces\nCELL (13, 1): \nAbove 1,000\nCELL (13, 2): \n20 spaces, plus one space for each 100 over 1,000 spaces or\nfraction thereof.\n"}, {"page": "139", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be...\nThe Planning Director shall be authorized to approve alternatives to providing the number of off-street parking spaces required by Table 7.8-1 in accordance with the following standards:\n(A) Shared Parking\nThe Planning Director may approve shared parking facilities for developments or uses with different operating hours or different peak business periods if the shared parking complies with all of the following\nstandards:\n(1) Location\n(a) Where the principal use is located in the Town Center Zoning District, shared parking facilities shall be located within one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet of the main entrance of the principal use\nfor uses classified as Public/Institutional in Table 5.1-2, and eight hundred (800) feet from the main entrance of the principal use for all other uses in the Town Center unless remote parking shuttle bus service is\nprovided.\n(b) Where the principal use is located in any zoning district other than the Town Center District, shared parking facilities shall be located within five hundred (500) feet of the main entrance of the principal\nuse\nunless remote parking shuttle bus service is provided.

Any additional pedestrian\nconnections required under this section do not have to address handicap accessibility standards.\n7.10.2 Consistency with Other Documents\nThe design and evaluation of vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian circulation systems built in conjunction with new residential and non-residential development shall adhere to applicable provisions of the plans,\nordinances and manuals listed in Section 1.4, in addition to meeting the requirements of this section.\n7.10.3 Standards for Streets/On-Site Vehicular Circulation\nThe following standards shall be met for all development plans and for redevelopment of sites.\n(A) Street Connectivity\nAny residential development shall be required to achieve a connectivity index of 1.2 or greater. In the event that this requirement is modified pursuant to Section 7.10.3(D)(2), a six (6)-foot pedestrian trail\nshall be provided to link any cul-de-sacs within a residential development in which the required connectivity index has been modified. A connectivity index is a ratio of the number of street links (road sections\nbetween intersections and cul-de-sacs) divided by the number of street nodes (intersections and cul-de-sac heads). The following illustration provides an example of how to calculate the index. Street links on\nexisting adjacent streets that are not part of the proposed subdivision are not included in the connectivity index calculation.\n(2) For non-residential, multi-family, or mixed used developments of greater than five (5) acres, an organized and complete street network must be provided with an emphasis on connectivity throughout the\ndevelopment and for future adjacent development. Sites, five (5) acres or less, must provide street connections with adjacent properties (i.e., taking into account the future development/redevelopment of these\nproperties).\n(a) All access points from public thoroughfares and collectors shown on the Comprehensive Transportation Plan shall be connected with each other through a continuous network of public or private\nstreets. (Non-residential private streets are not required to meet public street standards.) Connections between thoroughfares and collectors shall be direct while maintaining a functional and organized street\nnetwork. Limited parking in front of buildings along these streets may be provided.\nPrimary circulation through a development shall meet the following standards:\n1. Vehicular access spacing on the street is limited to no less than one hundred fifty (150) feet;\n2. Intersections, driveway, or drive aisle connections with the streets shall be substantially perpendicular to the street;\n3.\nAccess points shall align with opposing access points on the street or shall be offset by at least one hundred fifty (150) feet; and\n4. Adjacent lots or outparcels must share access drives.\nStreet Connectivity\nNote: The measure of connectivity is the number of street links divided by the number of nodes. Nodes exist at street intersections as well as cul-de-sac heads. Links are the stretches of road that connect nodes. Stub outs shall also\nbe considered as links. In this example, there are five (5) links (circles) and four (4) nodes (stars); therefore, the connectivity index is 1.25.\n141 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "142", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be..\n(B) Street Arrangement\n(1) The proposed public or private street system shall be designed to provide vehicular and pedestrian interconnections to facilitate internal and external traffic movements in the area. In addition to the\nspecific connectivity requirements described above, roadway interconnections shall be provided during the initial phase of any development plan between the development site and its adjacent properties with one\n(1) roadway interconnection every one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) to one thousand five hundred (1,500) linear feet for each direction (north, south, east, west) in which the subject property abuts. If the\ncommon property boundary in any direction is less than one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) linear feet, the subject property will be required to provide an interconnection if it is determined by the Planning\nDirector that the interconnection in that direction can best be accomplished through the subject property due to physical site constraints, such as topography, presence of stream buffers or other natural features,\nor lot dimensions; or due to presence of existing development or infrastructure, on the subject property or other properties in the area. When the Planning Director deems a vehicular connection not practicable\ndue to topographical and/or environmental constraints, he/she may increase the length requirement and/or require pedestrian connections. The Planning Director may delay the interconnection if such\ninterconnection requires state approval. The intent of this standard is to improve access/egress for Town neighborhoods, provide faster response time for emergency vehicles, and improve the vehicular and\npedestrian connections between neighborhoods.\n(2) Any development of more than one hundred (100) residential units or additions to existing developments such that the total number of units exceeds one hundred (100) shall be required to provide for\nvehicular and pedestrian access to at least two (2) public streets unless such provision is modified pursuant to Section 3.19.1.\n(3) Where new development is adjacent to vacant land likely to be developed in the future, or adjacent to property that is likely to be redeveloped in the future, all streets, bicycle paths, sidewalks or\npedestrian pathways, and access ways in the new development's proposed street system shall continue through to the boundary lines of the new development and any area under the same ownership as the\nnew\ndevelopment, as determined by the Planning Director or the Director of Transportation and Facilities, to provide for the orderly development of such adjacent land and/or the transportation and access needs of the\ncommunity. In addition, all redevelopment and street improvement projects shall take advantage of opportunities for retrofitting existing streets to provide increased vehicular and pedestrian connectivity, such as\nsidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian signals.\n(4) In general, permanent cul-de-sacs are discouraged in the design of street systems, and should only be used when topography, the presence of natural features, and/or vehicular safety factors make a\nvehicular connection impractical. Where cul-de-sacs are unavoidable, development plans shall incorporate provisions for future vehicular and pedestrian connections to adjacent, undeveloped properties, and to\nexisting adjacent development where existing connections are poor.\n(5) Permanent cul-de-sacs shall comply with the length limits and design standards set forth in the Town's Standard Specifications and Details Manual, and shall be provided with a turnaround at the closed\nstreet end.\n(C) Cross Access\nAll non-residential development shall be designed to allow for both vehicular and pedestrian cross-access to adjacent properties to encourage shared parking and shared access points on public or private\nstreets. A minimum distance of one hundred (100) feet shall be required between a cross-access way and an intersection or driveway entrance. This requirement may be modified pursuant to Section 3.19.1\nprovided that appropriate bicycle and pedestrian connections are provided between adjacent developments or land uses. A cross access easement must be recorded prior to issuance of a Certificate of\nOccupancy for the development.\n(D) Exceptions\nNew developments adjacent to existing neighborhoods classified as Tier 2 or Tier 3 Neighborhoods are exempt from portions of Section 7.10.3(A) (C), as provided below:\n(1) Classification of Existing Neighborhood Adjacent to Proposed Development\n(a) Tier 1 Neighborhood\nA Tier 1 neighborhood is defined as any residential neighborhood not otherwise classified as Tier 2 or Tier 3.\n(b) Tier 2 Neighborhood\nA Tier 2 neighborhood is defined as a residential neighborhood that meets all of the following criteria:\n1. The neighborhood was developed pursuant to a development plan approved at any time by a jurisdiction other than the Town of Cary, or approved by the Town of Cary prior to January 14, 1999; and\n2. The neighborhood meets the following criteria:\na) A public street right-of-way in the existing neighborhood extends to the common property line, however the street itself does not extend to the common property line; or, no existing right-of-way or\nstreet extends to the common property line; and\nb) There are no factors present to indicate the intent, at the time of approval or construction of the Tier 2 neighborhood, that a street would be connected at a later time, such as recordation of\nconstruction easements; or physical constraints such as stream buffers or topographic issues are present that would have made extension of the street to the property line infeasible at the time of construction of\nthe neighborhood and\n3. Potential public safety issues such as inadequate fire and police protection, are present, or are likely to be created in the future, if a proposed new development does not connect to the adjacent\nexisting development. Potential safety issues may be indicated by factors including but not limited to, a single vehicular access point, and/or the major street serving the neighborhood exceeding one thousand\n(1,000) feet in length.\n(c) Tier 3 Neighborhood\nA Tier 3 neighborhood is defined as a residential neighborhood that meets all of the following criteria:\n1. The neighborhood was developed pursuant to a development plan approved at any time by a jurisdiction other than the Town of Cary, or approved by the Town of Cary prior to January 14, 1999; and\n2. The neighborhood meets the following criteria:\na) A public street right-of-way in the existing neighborhood extends to the common property line, however the street itself does not extend to the common property line; or, no existing right-of-way or\nstreet extends to the common property line; and\nb) There are no factors present to indicate the intent, at the time of approval or construction of the Tier 3 neighborhood, that a street would be connected at a later time, such as recordation of\nconstruction easements; or physical constraints such as stream buffers or topographic issues are present that would have made extension of the road to the property line infeasible at the time of construction\nof\nthe neighborhood, and\n3. There are no apparent public safety issues such as inadequate fire and police protection or response capability present, or likely to be created in the future, if a proposed new development does not\nconnect to the adjacent existing development.\n(d) Neighborhood Classification\nThe Director of the Transportation and Facilities Department shall determine the classification of existing neighborhoods.\n(2) Exceptions to Connectivity Requirements for New Development\n(a) Adjacent to a Tier 1 Neighborhood, all requirements of Section 7.10.3(A) (C) shall apply.\n(b) Adjacent to a Tier 2 Neighborhood, all requirements of Section 7.10.3(A) (C) shall apply, with the following exceptions or modifications:\n1. Construction of a road connection to the property line of the Tier 2 Neighborhood is allowed but not required. If no connection is made, a connectivity index less than 1.2 may be approved by the\nPlanning\nDirector if such reduction results from the lack of connection to the Tier 2 Neighborhood.\n2. If no road connection is made, an emergency access connection to the Tier 2 neighborhood must be provided. Such connection may include a paved street connection with removable obstructions to\nprevent non-emergency access, raised curb treatment, turf stone with grass, or other methods approved by the Director of Transportation and Facilities and the Fire Chief.\n3. Pedestrian and bicycle connections, and utility stubs and connections shall continue to be required.\n(c)\nAdjacent to a Tier 3 Neighborhood, all requirements of Section 7.10.3(A) (C) shall apply, with the following exceptions or modifications:\n1. Construction of a road connection to the property line of the Tier 3 Neighborhood is allowed but not required. If no connection is made, a connectivity index less than 1.2 may be approved by the\nPlanning Director if such reduction results from the lack of connection to the Tier 3 Neighborhood.\n7.10.4 Standards for Pedestrian Facilities\nAll sidewalks, greenways and street-side trails shall be designed to comply with the standards provided in plans, ordinances and manuals listed in Section 1.4. In addition to the general provisions of Section\n7.10.3 above, the following specific standards shall be met in designing and achieving a pedestrian circulation system:\n(A) Sidewalks\n(1) Sidewalks shall be installed on both sides of all thoroughfares and collector streets. In non-residential developments and property located within Mixed Use Overlay Districts, sidewalk shall also be\nprovided on both sides of all local and private streets as well as along one (1) side of all primary travelways. Shifting the sidewalk to an adjacent linear island is permitted if it creates better pedestrian connectivity.\nThe Planning Director may approve sidewalk on one (1) side of the street in cases where a street is single-loaded and the opposite side of the street is not expected to develop in the future. Sidewalk shall be\nrequired on one (1) side of all local and private streets in residential developments outside of a mixed-use center.\n(2) Site design techniques such as shortening crosswalk distances with curb extensions, reducing sidewalk curb radii, and eliminating free right-turn lanes shall be used to improve pedestrian safety at\npedestrian roadway crossings. Signals that allow longer crossing times in Mixed Use Overlay Districts, raised crosswalks, and pedestrian refuges in medians shall be provided as appropriate.\n142 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "143", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be..\n(3) Pedestrian access from the public right-of-way into a site shall be every nine hundred (900) feet along long block frontages.\n(4) Within a development, sidewalks and/or greenways shall form an on-site circulation system that provides pedestrian access to all public building entrances, on-site amenities, and adjacent parks and\ngreenways, minimizing conflict between pedestrians and vehicular traffic. Where building frontages exceed six hundred (600) feet in length, a building break or pedestrian pass-thru shall be provided to facilitate\npedestrian circulation between areas in front of and behind the building mass. Such a break shall not be required if there is no current, proposed, or future development, pedestrian destination, or point of interest\n(e.g., a parking lot, greenway, plaza, etc.) located to the rear of the building. Sidewalks and/or greenways shall connect building entrances to one another and from building entrances to public sidewalk\nconnections and existing or planned transit stops, street-side trails and/or greenways. Non-residential buildings located more than one hundred (100) feet from the public right-of-way shall provide for direct\npedestrian access to buildings located on adjacent lots.\n(5) Cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets shall be connected to the closest local or collector street and/or to cul-de-sacs in adjoining residential subdivisions, commercial development, or similar compatible\nland uses including schools, parks, recreation facilities, libraries, and greenways, via a sidewalk or street-side trail.\n(6) A linear parking lot island containing a sidewalk shall be provided to align directly with the principal entrance. Additional sidewalk shall be provided in linear islands as necessary to provide adequate and\nconvenient pedestrian access, but shall not be required in all such islands. Linear islands containing sidewalks shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) feet in width to allow adequate space for the sidewalk and\nplantings.\n(B) Greenways\nThe Town of Cary's greenway trail system consists of a series of interconnected pedestrian trails located off-road and tied together by on-road street-side trails and sidewalk connectors. The plan for the\ntownwide trail system is outlined, and trail types are defined, in the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Facilities Master Plan.\n(1) All public greenways shall be located based upon the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Facilities Master Plan with final alignments to be determined during the development plan review\nprocess.\n(2) Construction of all public greenway trails shall meet Town of Cary standards and specifications as provided by the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Department.\n(3) A Greenway Easement shall be dedicated to the Town of Cary in accordance with LDO Section 8.2.1(D)(3). The developer shall demonstrate that the easement to be conveyed is usable for trail\nconstruction to Town standards (in terms of topography, wetlands, buffers, etc. The width of easements may be reduced to twenty (20) feet where the developer is constructing the greenway trail.\n(4) Development plans shall provide private, paved trail connections to existing and planned public greenways located within or adjacent to the development. Such private trail connections shall be\nconstructed at least every nine hundred (900) feet along the adjacent greenway corridor with the details being determined by Town staff during the development plan review process. These connections shall meet\nthe Town of Cary standards and specification as provided by the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Department.\n(5) Public greenways and dedication of easements shall be credited towards park land dedication and payment-in-lieu requirements in accordance with LDO Section 8.2.1.\n(6) All trails shall be constructed as development occurs, and phasing must be approved by Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources staff.\n(7) Greenway trails located within required perimeter buffers shall meet the requirements of LDO Section 7.2.3(H)(3). Greenway easements may be required outside of the perimeter buffer in order to meet\nTown standards for both the buffer and greenway.\n(8) In those cases where the Comprehensive Plan requires the use of greenways instead of sidewalks, the greenways shall be constructed in accordance with Town of Cary standards and specifications as\nprovided by the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Department, and shall meet the following criteria:\n(a) these trail systems shall be designed to provide adequate pedestrian circulation internal to the development, as well as connections to existing or planned adjacent pedestrian systems and other\ndevelopments, and alignments shall be approved by Town staff;\n(b) these trails shall be privately maintained by the Homeowners' Association (HOA) and shall be open to the public, and this must be noted on the approved development plans, as well as recorded plats;\n(c) trails shall be eight (8) feet wide asphalt;\n(d)\na private pedestrian trail easement, minimum fourteen (14) feet in width, centered on the trail, shall be recorded on the subdivision plat.\n(c) Street-side Trails\nStreet-side trails are pedestrian trails located adjacent to roadways (on-road) and provide supporting linkage to the off-road greenway system.\n(1) Where the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Facilities Master Plan calls for a street-side trail, a street-side trail shall be constructed in lieu of sidewalk required in the same location. No park\nland dedication or payment-in-lieu credit will be granted for street-side trail construction or easements.\n(2) All street-side trails shall be designed and constructed according to Town of Cary standards and specifications as provided by the Transportation and Facilities Department.\n(3) A Town of Cary Greenway Easement, centered on the trail (easement width to be determined by Transportation and Facilities staff), shall be recorded. Street-side trail locations and the location of the\nrequired Town of Cary Greenway Easements relative to current road widths and rights-of-way, shall be determined by the Transportation and Facilities staff.\n(D) Community Gathering Spaces and Plazas\nProvide at least one (1) public gathering space such as a pedestrian plaza or park-like space for new development and redevelopment sites that are two (2) acres or greater in size. These spaces shall be\ncentrally located and/or located so to encourage its use by pedestrians and patrons of the development. Minimum sizes for the community gathering space are as follows:\n(1) 2 to 5 acre site 600 square feet\n(2) 5.1 to 10 acre site 1,200 square feet\n(3) 10.1 to 15 acre site 2,400 square feet\n(4) 15.1 to 20 acre site 4,000 square feet\n(5) Greater than 20.1 acre site 5,000 square feet\n(6) For developments fifteen (15) acres or greater, community gathering space shall include such things as a central plaza/green, outdoor dining areas, fountains/water features, and/or public art.\n7.10.5 Standards for Bicycle Facilities\n(A) Wide outside lanes shall be incorporated into the design of all new and/or improved arterial streets. Bicycle lanes and/or wide outside lanes shall be incorporated in the design of all minor collectors. On\nlocal streets low traffic speeds and volumes allow bicyclists and motorists to safely share the road. Sidewalks are not acceptable as substitutes for bike lanes. Bike lanes shall be a minimum of four (4) feet in width\n(excluding adjacent curb and gutter).\n(B) Consistent with the recommendations of the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan, development shall provide appropriate bicycle amenities to encourage cyclists. Signage indicating the presence\nand location of such amenities shall be scaled for easy reading by bicyclists and pedestrians as well as motorists. Bicycle parking shall be provided as part of all high density residential, commercial, retail, office,\nindustrial, and mixed use development where appropriate (see bicycle parking requirements sections 7.8.2(D)).\n7.10.6 Standards for Public Transit Access and Infrastructure\n(A) Applicability\nThe requirements of this Section 7.10.6 apply to all development plans and reuse/redevelopment plans for sites with frontage along corridors identified in the Comprehensive Transportation Plan, Cary\nCommunity Plan, or Wake Transit Plan for current or planned transit service. Previously developed sites are exempt from these requirements unless the proposed redevelopment of the site consists of alterations\nof existing transit access locations. Regardless of whether the LDO requires transit improvements, all development must comply with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements and other applicable\nfederal, state and local regulations.\n(B) Requirements\n(1) Transit Infrastructure\nAll sites subject to the requirements of this Section shall install at least one (1) transit access location. All transit access locations shall meet the requirements of the Town's Standard Specifications and\nDetails Manual. When the transit access location is located outside of the right-of-way, a permanent transit easement is required.\n(2) Exemption\nA new transit access location shall not be required if there is a nearby alternate transit stop or facility that serves the same function as a transit access location and that satisfies a transit stop spacing\npattern of approximately one thousand (1,000) feet along the same side of the street on the subject corridor. This exemption shall not apply to major transit trip generators.\n(Ord. No. 06-009, adopted 4-27-06; eff. 4-27-06; Ord. No. 2007-04, 3-22-07; Ord. No. 2007-21, 12-13-07; Ord.

This road project fee, or transportation development fee, shall be imposed on all new construction within the Town limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction. It is not the intent of this section to require the\ndeveloper to pay for all new road construction.\n7.11.2 Authority\nThis section is adopted pursuant to the powers conferred by the General Assembly of North Carolina and set forth in NC Session Law 1987-801 and incorporated in Section 7.4 of the Charter of the Town of\nCary.\n7.11.3 Findings\n(A) The Town continues to experience rapid population and employment growth, in part, because of its proximity to regional employment facilities such as the Research Triangle Park and Raleigh Durham\nInternational Airport.\n(B) The anticipated population and employment growth in the Town creates demand for additional capital improvement funds for roadway facilities, which include but are not limited to, streets, intersection\nimprovements, culverts and road-related drainage improvements, turn lanes, and signalization.\n(c) The Town is committed to the provision of such road-related improvements at a level of service necessary to support anticipated residential and employment growth.\n(D) The Town has adopted a Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP), which addresses long-term road improvements. The Planned Roadway Widths map of the CTP identifies additional road capital\nimprovements necessary to serve new construction.\n(E) The General Assembly of North Carolina has authorized the Town to impose a regulatory or development fee defined as a road project fee, and known within the Town as a transportation development\nfee, on new construction within the Town limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction.\n(F)\nThe transportation development fee herein established is roughly proportional to the need for new capacity-related road improvements generated by new construction and reasonably benefits the\nconstruction that pays the fee.\n7.11.4 Applicability\nThis section shall apply to all new construction within the Town's corporate limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction.\n7.11.5 Condition of Approval\nNo building permit shall be issued for construction within the Town's jurisdiction unless and until the required transportation development fee has been paid in full.\n7.11.6 Transportation Zones\nTwo Transportation Zones have been established for the purpose of assessing transportation development fees. The purposes of the transportation zones are to help ensure that adequate funding is available\nin different areas of the Town to pay for road improvements needed to maintain adequate levels of service appropriate to each area. The transportation fees paid by new development in each zone represent the\ncost of replacing the roadway capacity that traffic from the new development will consume on the major roadway system. Fees collected must be used for road improvements within Cary's town limits and\nextraterritorial jurisdiction.\nThe Central Zone encompasses all land within the innermost right-of-way boundary of Maynard Loop and excluding Maynard Road itself. This includes all of the downtown area. This zone's primary focus is\nto\nencourage redevelopment and infill. The Level of Service standard is \"F\" based upon a ninety (90)-minute average peak. The Base Zone contains the remainder of the Town's corporate limits and extraterritorial\njurisdiction not within the Central Zone. The Level of Service standard is \"D\" based upon the standard Institute for Transportation Engineers (ITE) average peak hour. Boundaries of the central zone are shown on\nthe following map.\nCENTRAL\nRANSPORTATION\nCentral Transportation Zone\n7.11.7 Fees\n(A) Every person seeking a building permit for construction for which a transportation development fee is due but has not been paid shall pay such transportation development fee prior to the issuance of the\nbuilding permit.\n(B) The transportation development fee shall be computed by proposed building use and based on the construction plans submitted for approval, according to the schedule set forth in the annual Town of\nCary operating budget (TDF Schedule), except for fees computed by an individual assessment in accordance with Section 7.11.8, Individual Assessments, below.\n(C) The transportation development fee for proposed new commercial or industrial construction that is speculative construction shall be computed in conjunction with the application for a building permit\nfor\nthe expected use. An additional transportation development fee may be due for the fit-up to be constructed within the shell; however, no refunds will be given. This additional fee will be calculated as the difference\nin fees between what was paid at the time of speculative construction and what the new use would pay under the TDF Schedule, and shall be paid prior to issuance of the building permit for the fit-up.\n(D) If the proposed new construction contains a mix of building uses, the transportation development fee shall be calculated separately for each use according to the TDF Schedule. If the building has a single\nprimary use, the transportation development fee shall be calculated for a single use, according to the TDF Schedule.\n(E) The transportation development fee shall be collected for additions to and remodeling of existing structures and shall be calculated based on that portion of the structure that represents an increase above\nthe number of dwelling units or the floor area of the building, as it exists prior to the addition or remodeling. If the addition or remodeling results in a use change that increases trip generation, the transportation\ndevelopment fee will be calculated as the difference in fees between what the existing and new use would pay under the TDF Schedule. If the addition or remodeling results in a use change that decreases trip\ngeneration, no transportation development fee will be charged. No refunds will be given.\n(F) The following shall be exempt from the terms of this Section 7.11.\n(1) Alteration or expansion of an existing building where no additional dwelling units are created, the use is not changed, and where no additional vehicle trips will be produced over and above that produced\nby the existing use.\n(2) The construction of accessory buildings or structures that will not produce additional vehicle trips over and above that produced by the principal building or use of the land.\n(3) The replacement of a destroyed or partially destroyed building or structure with a new building or structure of the same size and use, provided that no additional trips will be produced over and above\nthat produced by the original use of the land.\n(4) Private recreational facilities provided that such facilities are restricted for use by residents and their guests without charge and no additional vehicle trips will be produced over and above that produced\nby the principal residential use.\n7.11.8 Individual Assessments\n(A) If any person believes that his or her proposed construction is unique in the traffic impacts that it will generate, such person may request that the Town perform an individual assessment of the traffic\n144 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "145", "text": "Firefox\nhtps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be.\nimpacts of the proposed construction. Such person shall pay to the Town, in escrow, a sufficient fee to pay the cost of obtaining such assessment from a professional engineer selected and hired by the Town. The\nTown shall then obtain the services of the professional engineer to perform the assessment, paying the engineer from the escrow account and remitting the balance, if any, to the person requesting the\nassessment. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall, at a quasi-judicial public hearing, consider the request of the applicant to pay the transportation development fee based on the individual assessment. The\nTown shall assess the transportation development fee based on the individual assessment if the Board finds that:\n(1) The proposed construction is in fact so unique that the application of the TDF Schedule adopted by the Town would result in the collection of a fee that is not proportionate to the traffic impact of the\nproposed construction; and\n(2) There is a difference between the fees computed under the TDF Schedule and the fees computed in accordance with the individual assessment of at least five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or five (5)\npercent of the total fees, whichever amount is greater.\n(B) The professional engineer to perform each individual assessment shall be selected by the Transportation and Facilities Director from a list of qualified engineers maintained by the Town. The list shall\ncontain the names of at least three (3) engineers or engineering firms, and shall be updated regularly. The Zoning Board of Adjustment reserves the right to dispute the assumptions, methodology, or conclusions\nof individual assessments. An individual assessment may take into consideration such factors as internal capture of trips in mixed use projects and higher rates of pass by trips than indicated by ITE if supported\nby reliable local data.\n(C) Transportation development fees computed under this section shall be computed in dollars per dwelling unit (for residential uses) or typically dollars per one thousand (1,000) square feet of non-\nresidential floor area (for non-residential uses), using the following consumption based system formula(e):\nTRANSPORTATION DEVELOPMENT FEE FORMULA\n7.11.9 Reserved\n7.11.10 Fund Accounting\n(A) The Town shall establish an account into which the transportation development fees collected shall be credited. Interest at the actual rate of return on invested funds of the Town shall be credited in\naccordance with the accounting policies of the Town.\n7.11.11 Use of Funds\n(A) The revenues from transportation development fees and accrued interest on such revenues shall be spent on qualifying road improvements.\n(B) Qualifying road improvements include improvements to thoroughfares shown on the Planned Roadway Widths map of the Comprehensive Transportation Plan anywhere within the Town's corporate limits\nor extraterritorial jurisdiction.\n(c) Transportation development fees may be used to finance direct project costs of qualifying road improvements, including:\n(1) The acquisition cost of rights-of-way;\n(2) The construction cost of improvements, and drainage improvements (excluding pedestrian facilities);\n(3) Signalization and intersection improvements at major thoroughfare intersections; and\n(4) The principal sum and interest and other financing costs on bonds, notes, or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the Town to finance qualifying road improvements.\n(D) Transportation development fees shall not be used to pay for any of the following:\n(1) Construction, acquisition, or expansion of public facilities other than road improvements;\n(2) Repair, operation, or maintenance of existing or new road improvements.\n(E) Up to thirty (30) percent of all transportation development fees collected shall be reserved for payment of eligible cash reimbursement to developers for qualifying road improvements established through\nan approved TDF agreement entered into prior to November 17, 2022.\n7.11.12 Refunds\n(A) Any transportation development fee or portion thereof which has not been expended within ten (10) years from the last day of the fiscal year in which it was paid, shall be refunded to the record owner of\nthe property for which the transportation development fee was paid, upon written application by the record owner, with accrued interest at the rate of return on investments earned by the Town on such amount.\n(B)\nThe Town may charge a reasonable administrative fee, not to exceed five (5) percent of the refund due, for verifying and computing the refund.\n7.11.13 Updates and Revisions\nThe Town shall evaluate the TDF Schedule as part of the annual budget process. The frequency of any updates to the TDF Schedule may be influenced based upon growth in residential and non-\nresidential construction, road improvements actually constructed, changing levels of service, inflation, revised cost estimates for road improvements, changes in the availability of other funding sources, and such\nother factors as may be relevant.\n7.11.14 Offsets; TDF Agreements\nThe Town shall grant offsets to transportation development fees for eligible qualifying road improvements that exceed the requirements for a collector road in accordance with this section. There shall be no\nother offsets to transportation development fees.\n(A) Where a development includes an eligible qualifying road improvement, the Town and the developer, by mutual consent, may enter into a TDF Agreement regarding the terms of the participation of the\ndeveloper in the construction or financing of such improvement. Such agreement may provide for offsets to the developer for his or her participation in the financing and/or construction of the road. Offsets granted\nfor qualifying road improvements shall be eligible up to the maximum amount of TDF fees for the development or eligible construction costs, whichever is least. Offsets shall be granted for a development only\nafter a TDF agreement has been executed, and the offsets may not be transferred to another development project.\n(B) The TDF Agreement shall be on a form approved by the Town Council and shall include:\n(1) The estimated eligible excess costs of right-of-way acquisition and the estimated eligible excess construction costs;\n(2) An estimated offset amount and cash reimbursement amount, if any;\n(3) The land development project for which the offset may be used;\n(4) A requirement that the developer must solicit bids in accordance with Article 8 of Chapter 143 of the N.C.

Offsets may not\nbe used for payment of any other fees, taxes, or amounts due the Town, and shall not have any intrinsic value. The Town shall have no obligation to the holder of any offset who, for any reason, owes no\ndevelopment fees during the life of the offset and thus has no use for the offset.\n(C) Each offset shall be valid from the date of issuance until ten (10) years after the effective date of the TDF Agreement, unless an extension not to exceed ten (10) years is granted by the Town Council prior\nto the termination of the earlier of these periods.\n(D) An offset shall be credited in dollars against the applicable transportation development fees in effect on the date when such fees become due under this Section 7.11.\n(E) When the TDF Schedule is revised, holders of active offsets may apply to the Transportation and Facilities Director for recalculation within one (1) year from the effective date of fee changes. The amount\neligible for offset will be determined under the revised offset provisions in effect when the fees are modified. The applicant requesting recalculation shall be responsible for providing the information needed to\nrecalculate the offset.\n7.11.16 Reserved\n7.11.17 Other Financing Methods\nThe Town may finance road improvements through the issuance of bonds, through the formation of assessment districts, or through any other authorized mechanism, in such manner and subject to such\nlimitations as may be provided by law, in addition to the use of transportation development fees. Except as otherwise provided herein, the collection of a transportation development fee shall be additional\nand\nsupplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other tax, fee, charge, or assessment which is imposed on and due against the property under the authority granted by the State of North Carolina.\n7.11.18 Fee as Supplemental Regulation\nThe transportation development fee established by this chapter is additional and supplemental to, and not in substitution of, any other requirements imposed by the Town on the development of land or the\nissuance of building permits or certificates of occupancy.

The dedication of land shall consist of two (2) categories: parks and greenways.\n(1) Park Dedication\nA portion of land being subdivided for residential purposes shall be dedicated to serve the recreational needs of residents of the immediate neighborhood, except where payment of funds in lieu of land\ndedication is approved pursuant to Section 8.2.2 of this Ordinance. Developers of multi-family dwelling units not requiring subdivision plan approval shall provide funds whereby the town may acquire recreational\nland or areas to serve the development or more than one (1) multifamily development or residential subdivision, except where dedication of land is approved, pursuant to Section 8.2.2 of this Ordinance.\n(2) Greenway Dedication\nLands granted for public greenway development will be required for both residential and non-residential development for those locations recommended in the most recently approved Town of Cary's Parks,\nRecreation and Cultural Resources Facilities Master Plan for park and greenway development (or any proceeding plan addendums).\n(B) Amount of Park Land to be Dedicated\n(1) General Requirement\nAt\nleast\none-thirty-fifth (1/35) of an acre shall be dedicated for each single-unit dwelling unit planned or proposed on the Planned Development master plan, Mixed Use District preliminary development\nplan, or reflected on a subdivision plat, except that any land to be so dedicated that lies within the FEMA one hundred (100)-year floodplain, wetlands, regulated stream buffers, or that has slopes greater than\nfifteen (15) percent shall be dedicated at a rate of at least one-twentieth (1/20) of an acre per dwelling unit; such areas shall be reflected on the subdivision plat for the dedicated parcel.\n(2) Planned Developments\n(a) For planned developments, the lands dedicated under this section may be credited toward the park and recreation land requirements set forth in Section 8.2 of this Ordinance. The parkland dedication\nrequirement shall be capped at twenty (20) acres for Planned Developments.\n(b) Innovative combinations of land dedication and actual development of public recreation facilities for dedication may be proposed for consideration and are subject to the approval of the Town Council.\nThe Town must receive at least equal value in facilities and land as the value of the land required for dedication as specified above.\n(c) The Town will review the proposed dedication to assure compliance with the park type(s) recommended by the currently approved master plan for the geographic area of the planned development.\n(d) If existing Town of Cary park land exists adjacent to the development, the Town may determine that a smaller tract of land than that which meets the standards above may be dedicated adjacent to the\nexisting park land, in order to create a larger single Town park site. In situations where such adjacent dedications are made, the developer will be required to pay a fee in lieu or any remaining dedication\nrequirement in accordance with this section. The improvements must conform to Town standards, specifications and time of dedication as identified in the approved planned development master plan map and\napplication.\n(e) If additional residential development is proposed for a previously approved planned development, the following provisions shall apply:\n1. Planned Developments (PDs) approved prior to October 28, 1993: Any land added to the Planned Development shall be treated as a new PD for the purposes of calculating the land dedication\nrequirements.\n2. PDs approved on or after October 28, 1993, will not be required to dedicate any additional land.\n(c) Nature of Park Land to be Dedicated\nExcept as otherwise required or approved by the Town Council at the time of Planned Development master plan approval, development plan approval, or Mixed Use District preliminary development plan\napproval, all dedications of land shall meet the following criteria. These criteria should be considered general guidelines to ensure that the dedication of land is suitable for park development.\n(1) Unity\nThe dedicated park land shall form a single parcel of land, except where the Town Council determines that two (2) or more parcels would be in the best interest of the public, given the type and distribution\nof open spaces needed to adequately serve the proposed development. In such cases, the Town Council may require that such parcels be connected by a dedicated strip of land at least thirty (30) feet in width.\n(2) Usability\nAt least fifty (50) percent of the total park land dedicated, which is intended primarily for active recreational use, shall be located outside the Flood Hazard Area, alluvial soils, lakes, or other water bodies,\nand areas with slopes greater than fifteen (15) percent, and at least seventy-five (75) percent of the total land dedicated shall be located outside of wetlands subject to Federal or State regulatory jurisdiction.\nLakes, ponds, creeks, or other water bodies, and wetlands falling under the jurisdiction of state or federal agencies as indicated in Section 14.4, Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control, and Section 14.7, Flood\nDamage Prevention, of this Ordinance, may be dedicated only if sufficient abutting land is dedicated as a public recreation area or park or if such area constitutes a necessary part of the drainage control system.\nLand dedicated only for greenways need not follow the requirements of this subsection.\n(3) Shape\nThe shape of the portion of the dedicated park land that is deemed suitable for active recreation shall be sufficiently square or round to be usable for any or all recreational facilities and activities, such as\nathletic fields and tennis courts, when a sufficient amount of land is dedicated to accommodate such facilities. Land dedicated only for greenways need not follow the requirements of this subsection.\n(4) Location\nThe dedicated park land shall be located so as to reasonably serve the recreation and open space needs of residents of the subdivision or planned development, and to comply with the Town's Parks\nRecreation and Cultural Resources Facilities Master Plan, where applicable. The dedicated park land may be located outside of the residential development in order to comply with the currently approved Town's\nParks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Facilities Master Plan, to add property to existing park land, or to combine land dedication efforts with those of other developments.\n152 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "153", "text": "Firefox\nhtps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be..\n(5) Access\nPublic access to the dedicated park land shall be provided either by adjoining public street frontage or by a dedicated public easement, at least sixty (60) feet wide, which connects the dedicated land to a\npublic street or right-of-way. Gradients adjacent to existing and proposed streets shall allow for reasonable access to the dedicated land. Where the dedicated land is located adjacent to a street, the developer or\nsubdivider shall remain responsible for the installation of utilities, sidewalks, and other improvements required along that street segment. Public access to greenway dedications only shall be at least twenty (20)\nfeet wide.\n(6) Topography\nThe average slope of the portion of dedicated land deemed usable for active recreation shall not exceed the average slope of the entire subdivision or planned development to be developed. In no case\nshall a slope on the usable portion of dedicated land exceed fifteen (15) percent.\n(7) Dedication of Lakes\nThe subdivider or developer may propose to include an existing or proposed lake as part of a park dedication. The dedication of such lake shall meet the following criteria, and will be subject to the\napproval of the Town Council. Evidence that the lake meets the following criteria shall be provided to Town Council at the time of Council review and approval of acceptance of the lake:\n(a) It shall be a minimum of ten (10) acres in size. The average width of the lake should be not less than one-third (1/3) of its average length.\n(b) Dam construction shall comply with the latest versions of Dam Safety Rules by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and shall comply with the rules appropriate to\nthe class of the dam, except all dams shall meet the lowest threshold criteria. All lakes shall include a primary spillway, emergency spillway, and drain, and all materials shall meet Town specifications. Lake and\ndam construction shall also comply with the latest version of the Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, if lake will function as a\nstormwater best management practice.\n(c) The land surrounding and adjacent to the lake shall be dedicated to the Town, at a minimum width of one hundred (100) feet measured from top of bank.\n(d) The lake dam shall not be utilized to support a public or private street.\n(D) Dedication of Greenway Land\n(1) Easement dedication for greenway purposes is a separate requirement from parkland dedication, though the land dedicated for greenway purposes may be counted towards park land dedication\nrequirements, except for easements dedicated for street-side trails [as indicated in Section 7.10.4 (C)].\n(2) Locations of proposed greenways will be based on the currently approved Town's Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Facilities Master Plan.\n(3) If the Town of Cary's Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Facilities Master Plan indicates a future greenway through a proposed development, whether residential or non-residential, a strip of\ngreenway land through this area shall be dedicated to the Town, at a minimum of thirty (30) feet, but not to exceed fifty (50) feet in width; widths of easements may be reduced to twenty (20) feet in those cases\nwhere the developer is constructing the greenway trail. Widths of greenway easements for street-side trails [see Section 7.10.4 (C)] shall be determined by the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Director.\n(E) Procedure for Dedication of Park Land and Greenway Land\nThe dedication of such land shall be reviewed and approved at the time of Planned Development master plan approval, development plan approval, or Mixed Use District preliminary development plan\napproval as applicable. The applicant shall designate on the applicable plan, if any, the area or areas of land to be dedicated pursuant to this section. Where FEMA one hundred (100)-year floodplain, regulated\nstream buffers, slopes greater than fifteen percent (15%), or wetlands falling under the jurisdiction of State or Federal agencies have been certified to exist on the property, the applicable plan shall also identify the\nboundaries of such areas. Upon receipt of the applicable plan, the Planning Director shall submit a copy thereof to the Director of Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources for review by the Parks, Recreation and\nCultural Resources Advisory Board. If the development in consideration is to be approved administratively, the recommendation of the Director of Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources shall be submitted to\nthe Planning Department.\n(F) Submission of Deed and Survey\nUnless otherwise stipulated in a planned development master plan or Mixed Use District preliminary development plan, or required by law, an executed general warranty deed, free and clear of all liens,\nencumbrances and restrictive covenants, conveying the land to the Town of Cary, and a reproducible paper boundary survey indicating the location and area of all wetlands, alluvial soils, regulated riparian buffers,\nfloodplain, waterbodies, and slopes greater than fifteen percent (15%), shall be submitted no later than two (2) years after the approval of the development plan, Planned Development master plan, Mixed Use\nDistrict preliminary development plan, or prior to the issuance of fifty percent (50%) of the Certificates of Occupancy for the development (based on approved development plans and approved master plan),\nwhichever is earlier. The Town Council may grant an extension of time.\n8.2.2 Payments of Funds, or Funds in Lieu of Land Dedication, For Acquisition or Development of Recreation, Park or Open Space Sites\n(A) Funds for Dwelling Units Requiring Subdivision Plan Approval\nIf land to be dedicated does not meet the requirements of Section 8.2.1 of this Ordinance, or is not suitable for public recreation purposes, or if the recreational needs of the proposed development can be\nmet by other park, greenway, or recreational facilities planned or constructed by the Town within reasonable proximity to the development, or if existing park land is adequate to serve the development, a payment\nor partial payment of funds (\"subdivision recreation fund payment\") in lieu of a land dedication shall be made. Recommendations regarding payment of funds in lieu of a dedication of land will be made by the Town\nat the time of development plan approval, or master land use plan approval in the case of a Planned Development, or as part of the preliminary development plan for a Mixed Use District.\n(1) Amount of Payment\n(a) Where the payment of funds to the Town is to be made in lieu of dedication of land as permitted by this section, the amount of such subdivision recreation fund payment shall be based on the value of\nthe development or subdivision for property tax purposes pursuant to G.S. 160D-804(d). For the purpose of determining such value of the development or subdivision, the Town shall obtain a current written\nappraisal of the fair market value of the land to be developed or subdivided. For the purpose of this Section 8.2.2, \"fair market value\" means the value of the development or subdivision for property tax purposes.\n(b) Each appraisal shall be performed by a North Carolina licensed real estate appraiser.\n(c) The Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Director may waive the requirement of an appraisal where the subdivider/developer provides to the Town documentation evidencing the fair market\nvalue of the subject property, which in the opinion of the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Director, reasonably estimates the fair market value.\n(d) The appraisal or documentation of the land's fair market value, along with other evidence that, in the Town's opinion, aids in the determination of fair market value, may be used in the determination of\nthe amount of any payment in lieu of land dedication permitted by this section.\n(e) The Director of Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Resources shall make the final determination of the payment amount.\n(2) Procedure for Approval\nThe payment of subdivision recreation funds, in lieu of land dedication, shall be approved as part of, or prior to, approval of the development plan or, in the case of Planned Development, the master land\nuse plan or, in the case of a Mixed Use District, the preliminary development plan. Upon receipt of the application to make a subdivision recreation fund payment, the Planning Director shall submit a copy thereof\nto the Director of Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources for review by the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Advisory Board. In the event of a dispute between an applicant who wants to make a\nsubdivision recreation fund payment and a recommendation by the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources Advisory Board that land shall be dedicated, the Town Council shall make the final determination. A\ncombination of partial payment of funds and partial dedication of land (pursuant to Section 8.2.1(C) through (F), as applicable), may be required if the Town Council determines that this combination is in the best\ninterest of the citizens of the area to be served.\n(3) Time of Payment\nThe subdivision recreation fund payment shall be made prior to recording any lot(s) in the subdivision to which the fees relate. Payment may be phased in accordance with a phasing plan approved as part\nof the approved development plan.\n(4) Appeal of Payment Amount\nAppeal of the subdivision recreation fund payment amount shall be made to the Zoning Board of Adjustment in accordance with Section 3.21 of this Ordinance.\n(B) Funds for Multi-Family Dwelling Units Not Requiring Subdivision Plan Approval\nPursuant to N.C. Session Law 2007-321, developers of multi-family dwelling units not requiring subdivision plan approval shall provide funds (\"multi-family recreation fund payment\") whereby the town may\nacquire recreational land or areas to serve the development or more than one (1) multifamily development or residential subdivision, except where dedication of land is approved pursuant to this Section 8.2.2(B).\nSuch funds may be combined with funds received from residential subdivisions pursuant to Section 8.2.2(A) of this Ordinance and used for the acquisition or development of recreation, park or open space sites.\n(1) Amount of Payment\n(a) The developer shall pay a multi-family recreation fund payment for each dwelling unit. The multi-family recreation fund payment shall be equal to sixty-five percent (65%) of the five (5)-year rolling\naverage subdivision recreation fund payment per dwelling unit. The five (5)-year rolling average subdivision recreation fund payment per dwelling unit shall be calculated by (1) determining the subdivision\nrecreation fund payments assessed for the previous five (5) calendar years; (2) for each subdivision that was assessed a payment during that time period, determining the cost per dwelling unit of such payment;\nand (3) calculating the average of each such per dwelling unit payment.\n(b) A combination of partial payment of funds and partial dedication of land pursuant to Section 8.2.1 (C) through (F) of this Ordinance, as applicable, may be required if the Town Council determines that\nthis\ncombination is in the best interest of the citizens of the area to be served. Land to be dedicated to the Town in lieu of payment of funds shall be in an amount equal to one-fifty-fifth (1/55) of an acre for each\ndwelling unit for which dedication is to be made in lieu of fund payment, except that land that lies within a FEMA one hundred (100) year floodplain, wetlands, regulated stream buffers or that has slopes greater\nthan fifteen (15) percent shall be dedicated at a rate of at least one-fortieth (1/40) of an acre per dwelling unit.\n(2) Time of Payment\n153 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "154", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be...\nThe multi-family recreation fund payment shall be made in accordance with an approved phasing plan, or prior to the issuance of the first Building Permit if there is no approved phasing plan.\n(3) Appeal of Payment Amount\nAppeal of the multifamily recreation fund payment amount shall be made to the Zoning Board of Adjustment in accordance with Section 3.21 of this Ordinance.\n(Ord.

Such open space shall meet the\nstandards of this section:\n(1) Locational Criteria\nTo the maximum extent feasible, where significant natural and scenic resource assets exist on a property, the developer shall give priority to their preservation through public park or greenway dedication or\nas\nprivate open space. In reviewing the location of private open areas, the Planning Director shall use all applicable plans, maps, and reports to determine whether significant resources exist on a proposed site\nthat should be protected, with priority being given to the following areas (which are not listed in a particular order):\n(a) Wetlands;\n(b) Flood Hazard Area;\n(c) Lakes, rivers, and stream/UTB corridors;\n(d) Wildlife migration corridors; and\n(e) Steep slope areas.\n(2) The Following Shall Not Be Counted Towards Private Open Space Areas:\n(a) Private yards;\n(b) Public or private streets or rights-of-way;\n(c) Open parking areas and driveways for dwellings;\n(d) Land covered by structures; and\n(3) Use of Private Open Space\nPrivate open space shall not be disturbed, developed, or improved, with any structures or buildings, except for the limited purposes allowed below.\n(a) Facilities for active recreation (equipment for such uses shall be indicated on the development plan provided by the developer);\n(b) Private open space may include passive recreational and educational purposes approved by the Planning Director, including but not limited to walking, biking, picnicking, fishing, preservation of natural\nareas and scenic resources, parks, environmental education, and wildlife habitat protection.\n(c) Private open space shall be distributed throughout the development and located so as to be readily accessible and useable by residents. A portion of the open space should provide focal points for the\nneighborhood.\n(d) Clearing of underbrush and debris and the provision of walks, fountains, fences, and other similar features are allowed.\n(4) Design Criteria\nLand set aside for private open space shall meet the following design criteria, as relevant:\n(a) The lands shall be compact and contiguous unless the land shall be used as a continuation of an existing trail, or specific topographic features require a different configuration. An example of such\ntopographic features would be the provision of a trail or private open area along a riparian corridor.\n(b) Where private open areas, trails, parks, or other public spaces exist adjacent to the tract to be subdivided or developed, the private open space shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be located to\nadjoin, extend, and enlarge the presently existing trail, park, or other open area land.\n(5) Ownership\nAll private open space shall be owned jointly or in common by the owners of the development.\n(Ord.

No. 2022-LDO-02, 4-28-22)\n8.4 ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT OPTION: CLUSTER RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS\nAmerican Legal\nPublishing\nNew Ordinance Notice:\nPublisher's Note: Section 8.4 has been amended by Ord. 2023-LDO-04. approved 11/16/2023, effective 11/16/2023.\n8.4.1 Purpose\nThis Section provides an optional process and standards for cluster housing development. The Section is intended to encourage and allow for new concepts of traditional housing development so that variations\nof design may be allowed, provided that the net residential density shall be no greater than permitted in the district in which the development is proposed. This shall not be construed as granting variances to\nrelieve hardship.\nA conventional subdivision generally covers the entire developable portion of a site with residential lots. These lots are equal to or greater than a required minimum size designed to approximate the maximum\npermitted development density under the zoning regulations. A cluster subdivision allows for the reduction in the lot square footage minimum and setbacks provided that non-regulatory or bonus open space is\nprovided. This permits greater net densities on portions of the site while permanently preserving additional open space and other important environmental resources such as those identified in the Open Space\nand Historic Resources Plan.\nThis type of development is more sensitive to the natural environment by reducing the total amount of disturbance that may occur to the land in comparison to a conventional development while allowing the\ndeveloper to reduce site improvement costs. The use of clustered subdivisions is not intended to allow increased density for undevelopable or unusable land already protected by other provisions of this\nOrdinance. The remnant land not designated as building lots is required to be left undeveloped, and must serve the purpose of effective buffering, passive recreation, and protection of significant vegetation,\nhistoric resources or scenic qualities.\n8.4.2 Applicability\nThe cluster development option is available for property located within a zoning district that permits single-unit detached dwelling units (e.g., R-20, and R-40), with the exception of property located within the\nConservation Residential Overlay District. The development of the property must comply with all zoning conditions when using the cluster option. The size of the tract used under this option must be a minimum of\nten (10) acres.\n8.4.3 Approval of Cluster Site and/or Subdivision Plans\nAmerican Legal\nPublishing\nNew Ordinance Notice:\nPublisher's Note: Section 8.4.3 has been amended by Ord. 2023-LDO-04, approved 11/16/2023, effective 11/16/2023.\nThe approval authority, Staff or Town Council, may allow subdivision development on reduced lot sizes in return for the provision of bonus open space and other design requirements set forth within this Section.\nIn order to approve a development plan using this option, the Town must determine that the benefits of the cluster approach will prevent the loss of natural features without increasing the overall density or\nimpervious surface of the development. Cluster developments follow the same review and approval process that conventional developments follow as required by this Ordinance.\n8.4.4 Allowable Density, Lot Size and Open Space Requirements\n154 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "155", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be..\nAn increase in the number of lots above the number of lots permitted by the underlying zoning district (base number of lots) is allowed provided the development plan meets open space requirements and other\ndesign requirements set forth within Section 8.4. In no case shall the density of the development exceed the maximum permitted density of the site's designated zoning district.\n8.4.5 Calculating Base Number of Lots\nThe base number of lots is defined as the lot yield based on the implementation of the requirements of the underlying zoning district. The base number of lots is the starting point from which extra lots may be\npermitted if non-regulatory or bonus open space (see Chapter 12 for definition) is provided and other design requirements are met.\nThe applicant shall choose one (1) of the following methods for calculating the base number of lots:\n(A) The base number of lots may be determined by taking ninety (90) percent of the potential developable area of the site and multiplying by the maximum density (based on lot area requirements) for the\nunderlying zoning district. The purpose of reducing the potential developable acreage by ten (10) percent is to account for the approximate area that would be allocated to roadways within a conventional\nsubdivision. \"Potential developable area\" within this Section is defined as the total land area of the site excluding all regulatory floodplains, streetscapes and other required areas (see Chapter 7: Development and\nDesign Standards). For sites that contain and/or are adjacent to the American Tobacco Trail, a buffer of at least fifty (50) feet in width is required. This minimum buffer width is considered regulatory/required area,\nand shall not be included in the calculation of potential developable area.\nExample: Site A\nTotal Acres: One hundred (100)\nAcres in regulated/protected areas: Twenty (20)\nPotential Developable area including roadways: One hundred (100) Twenty (20) = Eighty (80)\nCalculated Developable area (Eighty (80) acres) X Ninety (90) percent = Seventy-two (72) acres\nSeventy-two (72) acres X 1.09 dwelling units per acre (density permitted in R-40) = Seventy-Eight (78) base number of lots\n(B) The base number of lots may be determined based on a yield plan for the site, whereby the applicant presents a rough or sketch conventional subdivision development plan that fully complies with the\ndevelopment requirements of the underlying zoning for the site.\n8.4.6 Maximum Density, Minimum Lot Size and Open Space Requirements\nAn increase in the number of lots (density bonus) is provided in exchange for the permanent preservation of bonus open space and meeting other design requirements. An increase in the number of lots is\nachieved by allowing a lower minimum lot size (see Table 8.4-1 below).\nExample (continued from 8.4.5 above)\n8.4.7 Basic Requirements for Cluster Development\n(A) Cluster developments shall meet all requirements for a development plan and all other applicable Town ordinances except for lot size, which is defined in this Section. Cluster subdivisions within the\nJordan Lake watershed may be constructed without the standard curb and gutter required in other areas of Town. Alternative street designs may also be considered if such designs further protect on-site\nresources.\n(B) R-12 dimensional requirements may be used for lots within cluster subdivisions. However, where lots in a cluster development abut other residential lots within an existing subdivision that is not developed\nas a cluster development, said lots shall have a side and rear yard setback not less than that of the abutting subdivision or the required side or rear yard setback required within the proposed development's zoning\ndistrict.\n(C) Cluster subdivisions shall be adequately buffered from adjacent conventional subdivisions in accordance with Chapter 7 based on lot size.\n(D) Once the development is approved and platted, there shall be no further subdivision of land to obtain additional lots. However, easements for public utilities may be permitted.\n8.4.8 Provision and Maintenance of Open Space and Facilities\n(A) Bonus Open Space Requirements\nAll bonus open space provided must meet the following standards:\n(1) Bonus open space shall be retained in a natural, undisturbed state, with the exception of those activities allowed by this Section. No more than five percent (5%) of the bonus open space areas may be\ndisturbed and allowed to be planted with grass or other pervious ground cover if the area provides common informal gardens and/or play/open areas for the development. The five percent (5%) does not include\ndisturbed areas due to the installation of required pedestrian systems (e.g., sidewalks, trails). Active recreation facilities (e.g., basketball and tennis courts) are not permitted in the open space used to obtain\nadditional lots.\n(2) The cluster subdivision must, at a minimum, provide an eighty (80) foot deep Type A opaque streetscape buffer along all of the subdivision's thoroughfare and collector road frontage. The amount of\nthe\neighty (80) foot deep streetscape buffer that is in excess of the amount of streetscape buffer required for a conventional subdivision under the requirements of Chapter 7 (See Section 7.2.4) qualifies as\ncontributing bonus open space.\n(3) Bonus open space used to obtain additional lots shall be no less than thirty (30) feet in width at any point.\n(4) Pedestrian access trails to the open space areas shall be provided.\n(5) No portion of the bonus open space shall be separated into non-contiguous segments smaller than thirty percent (30%) of the total bonus open space area. Open space divided by a roadway shall be\ndefined as contiguous.\n(6) The bonus open space shall be shown on the development plan, with a notation to indicate that the bonus open space shall not be used for future structures.\n(7) The developer shall establish and incorporate a Homeowner's Association (HOA), which shall have the responsibility for maintaining the bonus open space and associated facilities at its own expense.\nAs an alternative to an HOA, a private, non-profit organization, whose primary purpose is open space conservation or preservation can own and manage the open space within a cluster housing development.\n(8) A portion or all of the bonus open space may be conveyed to the Town for use as greenways and parkland, provided it meets Town standards for such facilities and is agreed to by the Town. Such\nconveyance would occur at no cost to the Town.\n(Ord. No. 2008-LDO-01, 9-25-08; Ord. No. 2009-LDO-02, 3-26-09; Ord. No. 2016-LDO-01, 7-25-16; Ord.

All provisions of this Ordinance shall apply to developments designed according to the traditional neighborhood model,\nexcept as specifically provided for in this section. When, in reviewing proposed traditional neighborhood developments, the standards of this section may differ or be less restrictive than other standards of the\nDevelopment Ordinance, the standards of this section shall apply.\n8.5.3 General Principles\nA TND has specific characteristics that contribute to a compact, mixed use, pedestrian-oriented development pattern. The following general principles and provisions shall be considered in the design and\ndevelopment of new residential and non-residential developments that follow the traditional neighborhood model.\n(A) Neighborhood Size\nTND neighborhoods should be limited in size to encourage pedestrian activity. Optimal size is generally measured in terms of the distance from the center to the edge of a neighborhood, which will result in a\nwalk of five (5) to ten (10) minutes to meet most daily needs {'{}an approximate distance between one-quarter (1/4) and one-half (1/2) mile{'}'}.\n(B) Interconnected Street Pattern\n(1) Streets in traditional neighborhood developments should be designed to accommodate the needs of all modes of transportation and to have a strong pedestrian orientation. Traditional neighborhoods\nusually consist of an interconnected street pattern with short blocks, which provides multiple routes and short walking distances. To contribute to a more dynamic street environment, streets in TNDs should be\nnarrower than those in conventional developments, with sidewalks at the curb, on-street parallel parking, and, where appropriate, rear lanes for access.\n(2) The design of thoroughfares and collectors shall be consistent with the Cary Comprehensive Transportation Plan.\n(C) Mix of Land Uses and Diversity of Housing Types\nTNDs should be structured to provide a balanced mix of uses, including residential, retail, employment, civic, and recreational uses, all within the same development. The integration of uses allows residents to\nmeet more of their daily needs through shorter trips. In addition, provision of a variety of housing types shall be encouraged to allow a greater diversity of residents within the neighborhood.\n(D) Mixed Use Center\nTNDs are generally organized around a core, where shopping, offices, and public facilities are located.\n(E) Civic Buildings and Uses\nPublic buildings and uses, including government offices, museums, schools, and libraries, serve as focal points and landmarks for the community within TNDs and should be located on prominent sites.\nCivic Buildings and Uses\n(F) Public Spaces\nThe design of TNDs should give priority to open space, which should be located throughout the development to compensate for the smaller lot sizes normally associated with traditional neighborhood\nmodels. Open space should be designed in a hierarchy of formal and informal spaces and used to enhance community activity, identity, and civic pride. The Village Center should include one (1) or more public\nspaces (e.g., plazas or village greens) as focal points.\nPrivate open space\nSetback alignment\nProperty Line\nSidewalk\nStreet\nLocation of Buildings and Relationship between Buildings\nLocation of Buildings and Relationship between Buildings\n(G) Location of Buildings and Relationship Between Buildings\nIn TNDs, private buildings should be used to define the street edge and the distinction between the public domain of the street and the private space of individual lots. To this end, buildings should have a fairly\nconsistent, narrow setback alignment along the street frontage, but in all cases, building separation distances shall meet the minimum requirements of the NC State Building Code.\n156 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCOMMUNITY PARK\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nPublic buildings\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (3, 4): \n"}, {"page": "157", "text": "Firefox\nhtps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be.\nRelationship Between Building Types\nRelationship between Building Types\n(H) Relationship Between Building Types\nBuildings in TNDs should be built on a human scale and designed with a common, harmonious architectural vocabulary and landscaping to lend an intimate and personal feel to the streetscape. The intent\nshould not be to create a uniform appearance, but rather a distinct sense of place.\n8.5.4 Development Standards\nIn addition to adhering to the previous general principles, projects submitted as TNDs shall comply with the following standards.\n(A) Minimum Development Size\nA TND shall comprise an area of not less than ten (10) contiguous acres. (For the purposes of this section, a property that is split by a public roadway shall be considered contiguous.) Larger TNDs may be\ndesigned to include several distinct neighborhoods in order to maintain a pedestrian orientation.\n(B) Permitted Types and Mix of Land Uses\n(1) TNDs, by design, provide opportunities for diversification and integration of land uses in a balanced mix. However, the extent of diversification and integration may be limited by the size of\nthe\ndevelopment, based on use-specific land or population-based needs.\n(2) Notwithstanding Section 8.5.4(B)(1) above, a minimum of fifteen (15) percent of the land area throughout a TND shall be devoted to non-residential uses, including, but not necessarily limited to open\nspace and civic uses. Such uses shall be located within walking distance of residential uses or areas.\n(3) Mixed residential and non-residential uses are encouraged within a single project or structure, particularly integrated or vertical mixed use projects, in which uses are located on different floors of a single\nstructure. Residential uses that are part of a vertical-mixed use project located within a TND shall be permitted as-of-right, provided that the project otherwise meets other applicable requirements.\n(4) To encourage a diversity of residents, while at the same time preventing visual monotony in neighborhoods, no single housing type may comprise more than twenty- five (25) percent of a TND, unless\nthe applicant can demonstrate that a less diverse mix is more appropriate.\n(C) Permitted Densities\nThe specific maximum density that would be appropriate in a given area will depend on the anticipated transportation, environmental, and infrastructure impacts of a specific development. Therefore, the\nmaximum permitted densities and total number of dwelling units shall be established during the development review process. Requests for density increases shall be submitted at the time of development\napplication.\n(D) Dimensional Standards\nIn order to promote flexibility and creativity of design, dimensional requirements are not explicitly defined for TNDs. Bearing in mind that one intent of the TND is to encourage a pedestrian scale and urban\nlevel of activity, the determination of appropriate setbacks, building heights, and maximum lot coverage for specific uses within a TND may be made through the Planned Development (PD) and/or site-specific\nreview process. However, the following should be considered as general guidelines in establishing dimensional requirements for development in specific TND projects:\n(1) Build-to/maximum setback lines that establish a strong street edge by bringing buildings to or close to the sidewalk line are encouraged.\n(2) Where setbacks are established they shall apply only to the enclosed portions of a building. Front porches and stoops, canopies, and colonnades shall be allowed to encroach into the setback, where a\nsetback may be required. Balconies may encroach up to five (5) feet beyond the lot line.\n(3) The maximum dwelling footprint shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the lot, except that attached dwelling structures may exceed this figure if at least thirty (30) percent of the lot area is developed as\nprivate, landscaped open space.\n(4) The maximum non-residential structure footprint shall not exceed sixty (60) percent of the lot, unless a minimum of fifteen (15) percent of the lot area is developed as private, landscaped open space.\n(5) In all cases, the building separation distances shall meet the minimum requirements of the NC State Building Code.\n(E) Additional Standards\n(1) Generally, similar uses (uses within the same land use category; i.e., residential, institutional, commercial,) shall face each other across streets, whereas dissimilar but adjacent uses shall abut at rear lot\nlines. Landscape buffers between dissimilar uses shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.2.3(B).\n(2) All developments over fifty (50) acres shall preserve/establish, to the maximum extent feasible, a greenbelt around the perimeter of the development, pursuant to Section 7.2.3(B). The perimeter\ngreenbelt provides both a buffer and a definable edge between the TND and adjacent developments. However, the requirement for greenbelts may be waived in infill areas in order to maintain the continuity of the\nurban fabric.\n(3) The development plan shall designate the general location of publicly or privately owned civic lots for civic buildings and uses, including public monuments or gateways into an ensuing space, as\nthe\nterminus of street vistas for all major internal streets. In addition, public buildings and uses shall be located fronting on or adjacent to a square, plaza, or village green whenever possible.\n(4) TND developments may utilize Section 9.6 of this Ordinance as it relates to signage.\n8.5.5 Design Standards\nThe design of buildings, streets and streetscapes, landscapes, and open spaces in TND projects shall be consistent with the standards contained in this Ordinance, and the Town's Site Design Standards,\nCommunity Appearance Manual, and Standard Specifications and Details Manual, as applicable.\n8.5.6 Approval Process\nTNDs shall be approved using the process for rezoning to PDD or MXD, set forth in Section 3.4.3 or 4.5.2.\n(Ord.

The sign regulations in this chapter are not\nintended to censor speech or to regulate viewpoints, but instead are intended to regulate the adverse secondary effects of signs. The sign regulations are especially intended to address the secondary effects that\nmay adversely impact aesthetics and traffic and pedestrian safety. The sign regulations are designed to serve substantial governmental interests and, in some cases, compelling governmental interests such as\ntraffic safety and warning signs of threats to bodily injury or death. This article is not intended to extend its regulatory regime to objects that are not traditionally considered signs for purpose of government\nregulation.\nIn order to preserve and promote the Town of Cary as a desirable community in which to live, vacation, and do business, a pleasing, visually attractive environment is of foremost importance. The regulation\nof signs within the Town is a highly contributive means by which to achieve this desired end. Further it continues to be the purpose of this Chapter 9 to promote optimum conditions for serving sign owners' needs\nand respecting their rights to identification while balancing the aesthetic interests of the community. The regulation of signs within the Town is necessary and in the public interest and these regulations have been\nprepared with the intent of enhancing the visual environment of the Town and promoting its continued well-being, and are intended more specifically to further the following interests:\n(1) Aesthetics\nTo maintain and enhance the beauty, unique character, aesthetic environment, and quality of the Town of Cary, that will attract commerce, businesses, economic development, residents, and visitors; to\npreserve, conserve, protect, and enhance the aesthetic quality and scenic beauty of all zoning districts of the Town; to regulate the appearance and design of signs in a manner that promotes and enhances\nthe\nbeautification of the Town and that complements the natural surroundings in recognition of the Town's reliance on its natural surroundings and beautification efforts in retaining economic advantage for its\ncommunity; and to assure that the benefits derived from the expenditure of public funds for the improvement and beautification of streets, sidewalks, public parks, public rights-of-way, and other public places and\nspaces, are protected by exercising reasonable controls over the physical characteristics and structural design of signs.\n(2) Traffic and Pedestrian Safety\nTo improve traffic and pedestrian safety through properly located signs; to regulate signs in a manner so as to not interfere with, obstruct the vision of, or distract motorists, bicyclists or pedestrians; to allow\nfor\ntraffic control devices consistent with national standards and whose purpose is to promote highway safety and efficiency by providing for the orderly movement of road users on streets and highways, and that\nnotify road users of regulations and provide warning and guidance necessary for the safe, uniform, and efficient operation of all elements of the traffic stream.\n(3) Economic Development\nTo promote economic development and the value of commercial and residential properties, through sensitivity to surrounding land uses and maintaining an attractive community appearance.\n(4) Effective Communication\nTo encourage signs which are clear and legible; to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication.\n(5) Historical Character\nTo emphasize the Town's historical character by promoting pedestrian oriented and appropriately scaled signage.\n(6) Identification of Goods and Services\nTo aid the public and private sectors in providing signage that could be used to identify the location of goods and services.\n(7) Compatibility with Surroundings\nTo allow signs that are compatible with their surroundings and aid orientation, while precluding the placement of signs that contribute to sign clutter or that conceal or obstruct adjacent land uses or signs; to\npreclude signs from conflicting with the principal permitted use of the site and adjoining sites; and to minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property.\n(8) Reduction of Visual Clutter\nTo reduce visual clutter that may otherwise be caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation, excessive height, and excessive size (area) of signs which compete for the attention\nof pedestrian and vehicular traffic.\n(9) Use Considerations\nTo encourage and allow signs that are appropriate to the use of the property on which they are located.\n(10) Scale, Integration and Design\nTo establish sign size in relationship to the scale of the lot and building on which the sign is to be placed or to which it pertains; to foster the integration of signage with architectural and landscape designs;\nto provide flexibility and encourage variety in signage, and create an incentive to relate signage to the basic principles of good design; and to promote the use of signs that positively contribute to the aesthetics of\nthe community, are appropriate in scale to the surrounding buildings and landscape, and advance the Town's goals of quality development.\n(11) Maintenance and Safety\nExcept to the extent expressly preempted by state or federal law, to ensure that signs are constructed, installed and maintained in a safe and satisfactory manner, and to protect the public from unsafe\nsigns.\n(12) Property Values\nTo protect property values by precluding, to the maximum extent possible, sign types that create a nuisance to the occupancy or use of other properties as a result of their physical characteristics such as\ntheir size (area), height, number, illumination, and movement; and to protect property values by ensuring that the number of signs are in harmony with buildings, neighborhoods, and conforming signs in the area.\n(13) Enforcement\nTo enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations; and to provide standards regarding the non-communicative aspects of signs, which are consistent with local, state, and federal law.\n(B) Relationship to Comprehensive Plan\nA major emphasis of the Town's Comprehensive Plan is on the design of the community. In particular, the Comprehensive Plan emphasizes preserving and maintaining Cary's attractive appearance, with\nattention to the appearance of, and views from, public spaces, while also encouraging high quality and attractive development.\n(C) Effect\nThe effect of this chapter, as more specifically set forth herein, is:\n(1) to establish a system to allow a variety of types of permanent signs, subject to the standards and the permit procedures of this chapter;\n(2) to allow certain permanent signs that are small, unobtrusive and incidental to the principal use of the respective lot or parcel on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this\nchapter, but without a requirement for permits;\n(3) to provide greater flexibility in special areas of interest and/or higher densities such as the Town Center, Mixed Use Overlay Districts, National Register Historic Districts or traditional neighborhood\ndevelopments;\n(4) to provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances; and\n(5) to provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.\n9.1.2 Rules of Interpretation\n(A) Meanings of Words and Phrases\n159 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "160", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be...\nWords and phrases not defined in this chapter but defined elsewhere in the LDO or Town Code shall be given the meanings set forth there.

However, such permits may not be extended or amended unless the sign that is the subject of such permit will conform to all of the\nrequirements of this chapter.\n(3) All violations of the sign regulations in effect prior to December 8, 2016 shall remain violations of the Ordinances of the Town and all penalties and enforcement remedies set forth hereunder shall be\navailable to the Town as though the violation were a violation of this chapter. However, if the effect of this chapter is to make a permanent sign that was formerly nonconforming become conforming, then\nenforcement action shall cease except to the extent of collecting penalties (other than the removal of the permanent sign) for violations that occurred prior to December 8, 2016.\n9.1.5 Calculation and Measurement\n(A) Sign Area Calculations\n(1) Area Computation of Individual Signs\nThe allowable sign area for permanent signs shall be calculated as provided below:\n(a) General Requirements\nThe area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one (1) face) shall be computed by encompassing the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem or\nother display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, into no more than\ntwo (2) abutting rectangles, one (1) of which shall encompass a minimum of seventy-five percent (75%) of the total sign area. The area of sign face of distinct individual signs shall be separately measured\nin\naccordance with the above methodology.\n(b) Exceptions to General Requirements\n(i) Suspended and projecting signs shall be calculated separately from other wall signs.\n(ii) The square footage of wall signs associated with theaters shall be counted against the total wall sign area allotment. However, each sign shall be measured separately rather than placed together\ninside a rectangle.\n(iii) Poster boxes shall be measured individually without regard for the spaces between the individual boxes.\n(2) Area Computation of Multi-Faced Signs\nWhere the sign faces of a double-faced sign are parallel or the interior angle formed by the faces is sixty (60) degrees or less, only one (1) display face shall be measured in computing sign area. The\nareas of all faces of a multi-faced sign shall be added together to compute the area of the sign. Sign area of multi-faced signs is calculated based on the principle that all sign elements that can be seen at one (1)\ntime or from one (1) vantage point should be considered in measuring that side of the sign. Double-faced signs that are displayed on gateway entry monuments within Town approved area plans, may be displayed\non walls with an interior angle of up to ninety (90) degrees.\n(B) Sign Height Computation\nThe height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the newly\nestablished grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases where the normal grade is below grade at street level, sign height\nshall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public or private street.\n(C) Building Frontage\nBuilding frontage shall mean the horizontal length of a building on the side with its principal entrance. If that side is a straight wall, then the building frontage shall be the length of the wall. If the side is not a\nstraight wall, the building frontage shall be the horizontal distance from the corner at one (1) end of the side of the building with the principal entrance to the other corner on the same side of the building; where\nthat side of the building is concave, then the measurement shall be made in a straight line from corner to corner; where the side of the building is convex or has one (1) or more sections that project in front of the\nfront corners, then the measurement shall be made as the shortest distance between two (2) lines projected from the two (2) front corners of the building, with such lines parallel to each other and as close as\npracticable to perpendicular to the front of the building.\n(D) Roofing Elements\nRoofing elements that are within thirty (30) degrees of vertical (sometimes loosely called a \"mansard roof\") will be considered part of the wall for purposes of sign placement. Signage shall not be located on\nportions of other architectural design features that extend above the predominate roofline of the building.\n9.1.6 Plans and Permits Required\nPermits are required for the following sign types: Awning, Vehicle-Oriented Directional, Wall-Mounted Directional, Drive-through Lane, Principal Ground, Entry Monument, New Construction Alternative,\nSuspended, Verandah, Projecting, Wall (except for signs on property containing a single-unit residence or duplex), Fa\u00e7ade Renovation Alternative, and New Business Alternative.

No sign permit shall be issued for the erection of a prohibited sign. Until a\nsign\npermit\nis\nobtained from and the appropriate fee paid to the town, no permanent sign shall be erected, altered, relocated, maintained or displayed. The sign permit is in addition to any building permit required to be obtained\npursuant to the provisions of the State building code.\nNo sign permit or permit fee shall be required for changing the copy of a sign, including any change of copy on a changeable copy sign, as long as no changes are made to the sign's height, size, location, or\nstructure. A sign lawfully erected may be repainted or have ordinary and customary repairs performed, including replacement of plastic or glass panels, without a sign permit; however, if such sign is to\nbe\nstructurally altered in any manner, a new sign permit shall be required and the altered sign must meet all requirements of this Chapter and the Land Development Ordinance.\n(B) Building Permits\nThe town has no authority to waive or provide variances to the State building code, therefore all signs shall comply with applicable provisions of the State building code.\n(C) Electrical Permits\nElectric signs that have internal wiring or lighting equipment, and external lighting equipment that directs light on signs, shall not be erected or installed until an electrical permit has been\nobtained\nfrom\nthe\nInspections and Permits Department. All such signs and equipment shall bear the seal of approval of an electrical testing laboratory that is nationally recognized as having the facilities for testing\nand\nrequires\nproper installation in accordance with the National Electrical Code. All wiring to electric signs, or to freestanding equipment that lights a sign, shall be installed underground.\n9.1.7 Consent of Legal Owner of Property\nNo sign may be displayed without the consent of the legal owner of the property on which the sign is mounted or displayed. For purposes of this Chapter, \"owner\" means the holder of the legal title to the\nproperty and any party and person holding a present right to possession, control, or use of the property.\n9.1.8 Sign Maintenance\nAll permanent signs shall be maintained in good structural condition, in compliance with all building and electrical codes, and in conformance with this chapter, and shall adhere to the following provisions:\n(A) A sign shall have no more than twenty (20) percent of its surface area covered with disfigured, cracked, ripped or peeling paint, poster paper or other material for a period of more than thirty (30) days.\n(B) A sign shall not stand with bent or broken sign facing, with broken supports, with loose appendages or struts, or more than fifteen (15) degrees from vertical for a period of more than ten (10) days.\n(C) A sign shall not have weeds, trees, vines, or other vegetation growing upon it, or obscuring the view of the sign from the public right-of-way from which it is to be viewed, for a period of more than thirty\n(30) days.\n(D) An internally illuminated sign shall be allowed to stand with only partial illumination for a period of no more than thirty (30) days.\n(E) Flags shall not be faded, tattered, or torn.\n9.1.9 Violations; Enforcement; Removal of Certain Signs\n(A) General\nViolations of this chapter and enforcement procedures are addressed in Chapter 11.\n(B) Removal of Signs Creating Traffic Hazard\nAny signs or light sources deemed to create a traffic hazard per Sections 9.1.4(C)(13) or 9.1.4(C)(14) shall be removed at the direction of the Planning Director. If not removed by owners or occupants of the\nproperty within ten (10) days of notice, the Director shall cause the signs to be otherwise removed, and the cost of removal shall become a lien against the property until satisfied.\n162 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "163", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be...\n(c) Removal of Unauthorized Signs in Public Right-of-Way\nAny sign placed in the public right-of-way in violation of this Chapter 9 shall be deemed a public nuisance and may be seized by the enforcement official or other representative of the Town, and the person\nowning or placing the sign may be charged both with a violation of this chapter and with the cost of removing and disposing of the sign.\n(D) Removal of Discontinued Signs\nWithin sixty (60) days after a sign on a permanent freestanding sign structure or a permanent wall sign becomes a discontinued sign, it shall be the responsibility of the property owner to remove the\ndiscontinued sign and any associated sign structure and to patch and conceal any and all damage to any property resulting from the removal of the discontinued sign and associated sign structure, if any.

Existing lawfully-placed signs associated with an approved Master Sign Plan shall be exempt from this provision. Owners of record for such signs shall be\nnotified of the nonconformity via mailed notice.\n10.5.3 Limitations on Nonconforming Signs\n(A) Discontinued Sign\nA discontinued sign related to a use or business that ceases to exist or operate for a continuous period of 90 days shall be considered nonconforming and shall not be reused for sign purposes unless and\nuntil it is in full conformity with the provisions of this chapter, subject to issuance of a new sign permit.\n(B) Routine Repairs and Maintenance\nRepairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs, such as repainting and electrical repairs, shall be permitted, provided that repainting shall not include a change of copy or color, and provided further that\nno repairs shall be permitted where the cost of the repairs exceeds $1,000.00 or 50 percent of the replacement cost of the sign.\n(c) Change of Copy\nNo change of copy shall be permitted without bringing the sign into full conformance with Chapter 9, whichever is applicable, and with the applicable Master Sign Plan or Uniform Sign Plan, except as\nprovided below:\n(1) Sign panels or sign blades in existing non-conforming cabinet signs may be replaced, and copy may be changed on non-conforming changeable copy signs, provided that:\n(a) the sign was constructed or installed in conformance with standards applicable at the time of construction or installation;\n(b) for illuminated cabinet signs, the background of the sign panel is opaque; and\n(c) colors used in the sign area comply with the applicable Section of Chapter 9 of this Ordinance.\n(D) Other Sign Permits on Premises\nFor single-occupant properties, the issuance of a sign permit for a new or replacement sign shall be subject to the condition that all nonconforming signs on that property shall be removed or brought into\nconformance as part of the work of installing the new or replacement sign.

For purposes of this Section 11.5.2(B), \"disturbed area\" shall be defined as land that has been subjected to:\n1. the removal of trees, shrubs, or vegetative cover;\n2. any action that results in injury or harm to required trees, shrubbery, or other vegetation;\n3. any action that reduces the size of a required buffer or degrades or reduces the required level of screening; and/or\n4. earthmoving activities, including the addition of fill or installation of impervious surface.\n(b) Replacement Planting Plan Required\nPrior to replacement of damaged or removed vegetation, a replacement planting plan shall be submitted for review and approval by the Planning Director. The site shall be revegetated in conformance\nwith the approved replacement planting plan.\n(c) Maintenance Plan Required\nWhere existing vegetation is in poor health or has died as a result of neglect or of poor maintenance practices, a landscape maintenance plan shall be submitted and approved in accordance with this\nSection 11.5.2(B)(1) in order to remedy the violation. In cases where there is an existing landscape maintenance plan, such plan shall be reviewed and modified as necessary to address specific issues that may\nhave created the violation. In addition, the responsible party shall provide such documentation as is available (e.g. invoices, contracts, etc.) to provide proof that the landscape maintenance plan will be\nimplemented as approved.\n(d) Baseline Replacement Standards\nWhere vegetation has been damaged or removed in violation of this Ordinance, replacement vegetation shall be installed in an amount that meets or exceeds the requirements of subsection 1) and/or 2)\nbelow. Where both individual trees and area of disturbance can be documented for all or part of the affected area, the calculation of required plant material may include a combination of the two (2) calculation\nmethods, provided that the combination used results in the maximum amount of required plan material.\n1) Individual Trees Documented\nWhere the caliper and quantity of damaged, removed or disturbed vegetation can be documented, an equal amount of new vegetation (\"inch for inch\") shall be installed to replace the damaged\nvegetation.\n2) Area of Disturbance Documented\nThe following plantings shall be installed for each two thousand (2,000) square feet of disturbed area:\nTABLE 11.5-2 BASELINE REPLANTING REQUIREMENTS PER 2,000 SQ. FT. OF DISTURBED AREA\nPlant Type\nNumber\nMinimum Caliper\nContainer Size\nMinimum Height\n(e) Adjustments to Baseline Replacement Standards\n1) Intent\nNatural forested areas, or certain planted areas that have reached maturity, form a balanced system where screening may be achieved through a variety of tree and shrub types and sizes. Trees and\nshrubs within such systems naturally compete for sunlight and nutrients. While individual plants do not typically achieve an ideal symmetrical canopy or form, the overall performance standard of the buffer is\nachieved as available gaps are filled in with plant material suitable for the specific site conditions.\nIn recognition of challenges encountered in recreating a buffer, streetscape, or other landscape area that has been totally or partially removed or damaged, the intent of this Section 11.5.2(B)(1)(d) is\nto\nallow modification, by the Planning Director, of baseline replacement standards and other related standards of this Ordinance where appropriate, taking into account site-specific conditions and other factors\naffecting plant growth and health, so as to achieve and maintain to the extent possible the greater of the required performance standard of the LDO or the actual performance standard of the buffer area prior to its\nunauthorized disturbance.\n2) Factors for Consideration\nThe following factors shall be taken into account in making adjustments to baseline replacement standards and related landscape planting requirements to maximize the potential for the re-vegetated\nbuffer, streetscape or other landscape area to achieve the required performance standard and meet the intent expressed in Section 11.5.2(B)(1)(d)(1) above:\n(a) type and conditions of significant vegetation remaining within the landscape area or buffer,\n(b) availability of sunlight;\n(c) dimension of required planting area;\n178 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nProperty is not exempt from Tree\nClearing Certificate requirements; but\nproperty owner obtains no Certificate,\nand removes some of the vegetation\nwithin a required buffer and/or tree\nprotection area\nCELL (1, 2): \nX\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nX\nCELL (2, 1): \nProperty is not exempt from Tree\nClearing Certificate requirements; but\nproperty owner obtains no Certificate,\nand removes all or substantially all** of\nthe vegetation within a required buffer\nand/or tree protection area\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (2, 5): \nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nTABLE 11.5-2 BASELINE REPLANTING REQUIREMENTS PER 2,000 SQ.

The enforcement official may also give such notice to the individual or company that placed such sign on the property, such as the\nsign contractor or the real estate agent. Such notice shall give the property owner or occupant at least seven (7) but not more than thirty (30) days to cure the violation before formal enforcement action begins; the\nlength of time shall be based on the enforcement official's best judgment regarding the physical difficulty of eliminating the violation.\n(4) If, at the expiration of the period given for cure, the property owner or permit holder has eliminated the violation, there shall be no formal enforcement action regarding that violation.\n180 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "181", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be..\n(5) If, at the expiration of the period given for cure, the property owner or permit holder has not eliminated the violation but has begun diligent and good faith efforts to do so, the enforcement official may, but\nshall not be required to, give one (1) additional period of not more than thirty (30) days to complete the elimination of the violation.\n(6) If, at the expiration of the last available period for cure, the violation has not been eliminated, the enforcement official shall begin formal enforcement proceedings.

A violation of this chapter shall be considered a violation of the Town code. The remedies of the Town shall include the following:\n(A) Issuing a stop work order for any and all work on any signs on the same site;\n(B) Seeking an injunction or other order of restraint or abatement that requires the removal of the sign or the correction of the nonconformity;\n(C) Imposing civil penalties in accordance with the following schedule:\n(1) $100 for each offense for the first day of violation; and\n(2) $250 for each offense for the second day of violation; and\n(3) $500 for each offense for each day thereafter that the violation continues.\n(D) Civil penalties may be enforced and appealed in accordance with the civil penalty provisions of the LDO or other sections of the Town code; on appeal, the appellate body may sustain, reverse or modify\npenalties imposed under this section;\n(E) Seeking in court the imposition of any penalties that can be imposed by such court under this chapter; and\n(F) In the case of a sign that poses an immediate danger to the public health or safety, taking such measures as are available to the Town under applicable provisions of the building and zoning portions of\nthis chapter for such circumstances.\n11.7.3 Revoke Sign Permit Approval\nAny sign permit required under this Ordinance may be revoked in accordance with 11.5.1(B).\n(Ord.

This Ordinance contains five types of use classifications: Residential, Public/Institutional, Commercial, Industrial, and Accessory uses in addition to Unlisted uses. Proposed developments within the\nPlanned Development District, Major designation shall only be required to list general use classifications to denote the types of proposed uses.\n(A) Purpose\nUse classifications organize land uses and activities into general \"use categories\" and specific \"use types\" based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of\nactivity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site conditions. The use classifications provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into\nappropriate zoning districts. Use classifications describe one or more uses having similar characteristics, but do not list every use or activity that may appropriately be within the classification.\n(B) Structure of This Section\n(1) Each subsection below first describes common characteristics of the use category. Principal uses are assigned to the category that most closely describes the nature of the principal use.

The requirements of this section are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance,\nrule, regulation, or other provision of law, and where any provision of this section imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever\nprovision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control.\n14.3.5 Severability\nThe provisions of this section 14.3 are hereby declared to be severable. If any provision, clause, sentence, or paragraph of this section or the application thereof to any person, establishment, or circumstances\nshall be held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the other provisions or application of this section.\n14.3.6 Ultimate Responsibility\nThe standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this section 14.3 are minimum standards; therefore, this section does not intend or imply that compliance by any person will ensure that there will\nbe no contamination, pollution, or unauthorized discharge of pollutants.\n14.3.7 Discharge Prohibitions\n(A) Prohibition of Illegal Discharges\nNo person shall throw, drain, or otherwise discharge, cause, or allow others under its control to throw, drain, or otherwise discharge into the MS4 any pollutants or waters containing any pollutants, other than\nstormwater. The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:\n(1) The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this ordinance: water line flushing, landscape irrigation, diverted stream flows, rising ground waters, uncontaminated\nground water infiltration, uncontaminated pumped ground water, discharges from potable water sources, foundation drains, air conditioning condensation, irrigation water, springs, water from crawl space pumps,\nfooting drains, lawn watering, individual residential car washing, flows from riparian habitats and wetlands, dechlorinated swimming pool discharges, and street wash water.\n(2) Discharges or flow from firefighting, and other discharges specified by the Town as being necessary to protect public health and safety.\n(3) Discharges associated with dye testing; however, this activity requires a verbal notification to the Town prior to the time of the test.\n(4) The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided\nthat written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system.\n(B) Prohibition of Illicit Connections\n(1)\nThe construction, use, maintenance, or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.\n(2) This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time\nof connection.\n(3) A person is considered to be in violation of this ordinance if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4 or allows such a connection to continue.\n(4) Improper connections in violation of this ordinance must be disconnected and redirected, if necessary, to an approved onsite wastewater management system or the sanitary sewer system upon\napproval of the Town.\n(5) Any drain or conveyance that has not been documented in plans, maps or equivalent, and which may be connected to the storm sewer system, shall be located by the owner or occupant of that property\nupon receipt of written notice of violation requiring that such locating be completed. Such notice will specify a reasonable time period within which the location of the drain or conveyance is to be determined, that\nthe drain or conveyance be identified as storm sewer, sanitary sewer or other, and that the outfall location or point of connection to the storm sewer system, sanitary sewer system or other discharge point be\nidentified. Results of these investigations are to be documented and provided to the Town.\n14.3.8 Watercourse Protection\nEvery person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation,\nand other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or\nadjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.\n14.3.9 Industrial or Construction Activity Discharges\n(A) Submission of Notice of Intent to Cary\n211 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "212", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be...\n(1) Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a\nform acceptable to the Town prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.\n(2) The operator of a facility, including construction sites, required to have an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity shall submit a copy of the Notice of Intent (NOI) to the\nTown at the same time the operator submits the original Notice of Intent to the EPA as applicable.\n(3) The copy of the Notice of Intent may be delivered to the Stormwater Manager in person or by mailing it to: Notice of Intent to Discharge Stormwater, Stormwater Manager, 316 N. Academy Street, Cary,\nNC 27513.\n(4) A person commits an offense if the person operates a facility that is discharging storm water associated with industrial activity without having submitted a copy of the Notice of Intent to do so to the Town.\n14.3.10 Compliance Monitoring\n(A) Right of Entry: Inspection and Sampling\nThe Stormwater Manager shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this ordinance as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this ordinance.\n(1) If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to\nrepresentatives of Cary.\n(2) Facility operators shall allow the Town ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an\nNPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.\n(3) The Town Manager or is/her designee shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the Town to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the\nfacility's stormwater discharge. The monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater shall be at the facility's expense.\n(4) Cary has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating\ncondition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.\n(5) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the Town and\nshall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.\n(6) Unreasonable delays in allowing Cary access to a permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this ordinance. A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit\nto discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies Cary reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required\nby this ordinance.\n(B) Search Warrants\nIf the Town has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, then the Town may seek issuance of a search warrant.\n14.3.11 Requirement to Prevent, Control, and Reduce Stormwater Pollutants by the Use of Best Management Practices\nCary will adopt requirements identifying Best Management Practices (BMPs) for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain\nsystem, or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of such activity, operation, or facility shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or\nother wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise that is, or may be, the\nsource of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with all\nterms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed in compliance with the provisions of this section.\nThese BMPs shall be part of a Stormwater Management Plan (SWMP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.\n14.3.12 Notification of Spills\nNotwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or\nsuspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the United States, said person shall take all\nnecessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of\nthe\noccurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the Stormwater Manager in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next\nbusiness day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the Stormwater Manager within two (2) business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of\nprohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken\nto\nprevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least five (5) years. Failure to provide notification of a release as provided above is a violation of this ordinance.\n14.3.13 Violations, Enforcement, and Penalties\n(A) Violations\nIt shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this section 14.3. Any person who has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this section,\nmay be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section or may be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law.\nIn the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, the Town is authorized to enter upon the subject private property, without giving prior notice, to take any and all\nmeasures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. Town Manager is authorized to seek costs of the abatement as outlined in section 14.3.16.\n(B) Warning Notice\nWhen the Town finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this section 14.3, or any order issued hereunder, the Town may serve upon that person a written Warning Notice,\nspecifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation\nand/or resolution of the matter in response to the Warning Notice in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Warning Notice. Nothing in this\nsubsection shall limit the authority of Cary to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Warning Notice.\n(C) Notice of Violation\nWhenever the Town finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this section 14.3, the Town may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person.\nThe Notice of Violation shall contain:\n(1) The name and address of the alleged violator;\n(2) The address when available or a description of the building, structure or land upon which the violation is occurring, or has occurred;\n(3) A statement specifying the nature of the violation;\n(4) A description of the remedial measures necessary to restore compliance with this ordinance and a time schedule for the completion of such remedial action;\n(5) A statement of the penalty or penalties that shall or may be assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed;\n(6) A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed by filing a written notice to the Stormwater Manager within five (5) days of service of notice of violation; and\n(7) A statement specifying that, should the violator fail to restore compliance within the established time schedule, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the\nexpense thereof shall be charged to the violator.\nSuch notice may require without limitation:\n(a) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;\n(b) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;\n(c) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist;\n(d) The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;\n(e) Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and\n(f) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.\n(D) Compensatory Action\nIn lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this ordinance, Cary may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory action, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at\ncompliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc.\n(E) Suspension of MS4 Access\n(1) Emergency Cease and Desist Orders\nWhen the Town finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this section 14.3, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and that\n212 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "213", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be..\nthe person's violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial\nendangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the Stormwater Manager may issue an order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing the\nviolator to:\n(a) Immediately comply with all ordinance requirements; and\n(b) Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.\nAny person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this Subsection shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger's failure to immediately\ncomply voluntarily with the emergency order, Cary may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons or to the\nenvironment, including immediate termination of a facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. Cary may allow the person to recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to\nthe\nsatisfaction of the Stormwater Manager that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the discharger. A person that is responsible, in whole or in part,\nfor any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the\nTown within thirty (30) days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator.\n(2) Suspension due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations\nThe Town Manager may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present\nimminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an\nemergency, the Town Manager may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.\n(3) Suspension due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge\nAny person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this ordinance may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The Town will notify a violator of the\nproposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the Town Manager for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated\npursuant to this Section, without the prior approval of the Town.\n(F) Civil Penalties\nIn the event the alleged violator fails to take the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations described therein within five (5) days, or such greater period as\nthe Stormwater Manager shall deem appropriate, after the Stormwater Manager has taken one or more of the actions described above, the Stormwater Manager may impose a penalty not to exceed one thousand\ndollars ($1,000) (depending on the severity of the violation) for each day the violation remains unremedied after receipt of the notice of violation.\n(G) Criminal Prosecution\nAny person that has violated or continues to violate this ordinance shall be liable to criminal prosecution to the fullest extent of the law and shall be subject to a criminal penalty of one thousand dollars\n($1,000) per violation per day and/or imprisonment for a period of time not to exceed thirty (30) days. Each act of violation and each day upon which any violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense.\n14.3.14 Appeal of Notice of Violation\nAny person receiving a Notice of Violation may appeal the determination. The notice of appeal must be received within five (5) days from the date of the Notice of Violation and must specify with particularity\nthe grounds for the appeal. Hearing on the appeal before the court of appropriate jurisdiction shall take place within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the municipal\nauthority or their designee shall be final.\n14.3.15 Enforcement Measures After Appeal\nIf the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Notice of Violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within thirty (30) days of the decision upholding the NOV, then\nrepresentatives of Cary shall enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any\nperson, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above.\n14.3.16 Cost of Abatement of the Violation\nWithin thirty (30) days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting\nto the amount of the assessment within thirty (30) days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the municipal authority or by the expiration of the time in which to file\nan appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. Any person violating any of the provisions of this\narticle shall become liable to Cary by reason of such violation. The liability shall be paid in not more than ten (10) equal payments. Interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum shall be assessed on\nthe\nbalance beginning on the first day following discovery of the violation.\n14.3.17 Violations Deemed a Public Nuisance\nIn addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this section 14.3 is a threat to public health, safety, and\nwelfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may\nbe taken.\n14.3.18 Remedies Not Exclusive\nThe remedies listed in this section 14.3 are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is within the discretion of the Stormwater Manager to seek\ncumulative remedies. Cary may recover all attorney's fees, court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement of this ordinance, including sampling and monitoring expenses.\n(Ord. No. 2022-LDO-03, 10-27-22)\n14.4 SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL\n14.4.1 Purposes\nThis section is adopted for the purpose of regulating land-disturbing activities in order to control accelerated erosion and sedimentation and accordingly to prevent water pollution from sedimentation, to prevent\naccelerated erosion and sedimentation of lakes and natural watercourses, and to prevent damage to public and private property by sedimentation during and after construction.\n14.4.2 Permit and Approval Requirements\nLand-disturbing activities shall be subject to the requirements and procedures set forth in Section 3.13 of this Ordinance for obtaining grading permits and the approval of erosion control plans and required\npermits by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or other federal or state agencies responsible for regulating development in wetlands. Any required state and/or federal permits must be obtained prior to the issuance\nof a grading permit.\n14.4.3 General Erosion and Sedimentation Control Standards\nAll persons conducting land-disturbing activities shall take all reasonable measures to protect all public and private property from damage by such activities. Any and all state and/or federal standards apply\nand must be met. In situations where state and/or federal rules conflict with the provisions of this section, the more restrictive shall apply. All land-disturbing activities, except for those exempted by Section 3.13.1\nof this Ordinance, shall meet the following standards:\n(A) Conveyance Channels\n(1) Stream banks and drainageway channels downstream from any disturbing activity shall be protected from increased degradation by accelerated erosion caused by increased velocity of runoff from\nthe land-disturbing activity. The land-disturbing activity shall be planned and conducted such that the velocity of stormwater runoff in the receiving watercourse at the point of discharge resulting from a ten (10)-\nyear storm after development shall not exceed the greater of:\n(a) The velocity as determined from Table 14.4-1 below; or\n(b) The velocity in the receiving watercourse determined for the ten (10)-year storm prior to development.\nTABLE 14.4-1: MAXIMUM PERMITTED VELOCITIES FOR STORMWATER DISCHARGES\nMaterial\nFeet per Second\nMeters per Second*\n213 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nTABLE 14.4-1: MAXIMUM PERMITTED VELOCITIES FOR STORMWATER DISCHARGES\nCELL (1, 2): \nTABLE 14.4-1: MAXIMUM PERMITTED VELOCITIES FOR STORMWATER DISCHARGES\nCELL (1, 3): \nTABLE 14.4-1: MAXIMUM PERMITTED VELOCITIES FOR STORMWATER DISCHARGES\nCELL (2, 1): \nMaterial\nCELL (2, 2): \nFeet per Second\nCELL (2, 3): \nMeters per Second*\nCELL (3, 1): \nFine sand (noncolloidal)\nCELL (3, 2): \n2.5\nCELL (3, 3): \n0.8\nCELL (4, 1): \nSandy loam (noncolloidal)\nCELL (4, 2): \n2.5\nCELL (4, 3): \n0.8\nCELL (5, 1): \nSilt loam (noncolloidal)\nCELL (5, 2): \n3.0\nCELL (5, 3): \n0.9\nCELL (6, 1): \nOrdinary firm loam\nCELL (6, 2): \n3.5\nCELL (6, 3): \n1.1\nCELL (7, 1): \nFine gravel\nCELL (7, 2): \n5.0\nCELL (7, 3): \n1.5\n"}, {"page": "214", "text": "Firefox\nhtps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be..\n* These values are for channels with straight alignment. For sinuous channels: multiply\nallowable velocity by 0.95 for slightly sinuous channels; by 0.9 for moderately sinuous channels;\nand by 0.8 for highly sinuous channels.\n(2) If the requirements of paragraph (1) above cannot be met, then the channel below the discharge point shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity. Any channel stabilization\nactivities involving stream bank stabilization may not be approved without the required state and/or federal permits.\n(3) Alternative and innovative measures to satisfy the intent of this paragraph (A), applied either alone or in combination, may be used if there are no objectionable secondary consequences and the\napplicant can demonstrate to the Stormwater Manager that such measures have the potential to keep stormwater discharge velocities from creating an erosion problem in the receiving watercourse. Some\nalternative measures include:\n(a) Avoiding increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including measures to promote infiltration to compensate for increased runoff from areas rendered impervious;\n(b) Avoiding increases in stormwater discharge velocities by using vegetated or roughened swales or waterways in lieu of closed drains and high-velocity paved sections;\n(c) Providing energy dissipators, which may range from simple rip-rapped sections to complex structures, at the outlets of storm drainage facilities to reduce flow velocities to the point of discharge; and/or\n(d) If the watercourse velocity is greater than 2.0 F.P.S., improving cross-sections and installing erosion-resistant linings.\n(B) Slopes Left Exposed\nSlopes left exposed shall be planted or otherwise provided with ground cover, devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion within fifteen (15) calendar days after completion of any phase of grading.\n(c) Design Requirements\nErosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices shall be planned, designed, and constructed to provide protection from the calculated maximum peak rate of runoff from the ten (10)-\nyear storm. Runoff rates shall be calculated in accordance with Cary's Standard Specifications and Details Manual. Calculations shall be submitted with the plans and shall be drafted and organized in a neat and\nreadable manner.\n(D) Protective Cover Required\nAll uncovered areas shall be provided with protective cover unless the Planning Director has granted an extension of time, for good cause shown, upon written request of the developer or landowner. This\ncover shall be installed within fifteen (15) working days (exclusive of days where seedbed preparation is not possible due to weather as determined by the Stormwater Manager) or ninety (90) calendar days\nfollowing completion of any phase of grading, whichever period is shorter. Ground cover is not required on cleared land forming the future basin of a planned reservoir.\n(E) Activity Near Watercourse\nAll land-disturbing activities near a lake or natural watercourse shall provide erosion and sedimentation control measures. An undisturbed buffer may be used as an erosion/ sedimentation control measure,\nprovided that the undisturbed zone shall be of sufficient width to confine visible siltation within the twenty-five percent (25%) of the undisturbed zone nearer to the land-disturbing activity. This requirement shall not\napply to land-disturbing activities for the construction of facilities to be located on, over, or under a lake or natural watercourse.\n(F) Protection During Construction\nDuring construction, soil erosion and sedimentation control practices and devices shall be employed that are sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of\nthe tract during construction upon and development of said tract in accordance with plans approved by Cary.\n(G) Limits on Single-Unit Residential Lot Grading\nGrading and Erosion Control Plans submitted as part of a development plan associated with residential development that has a gross density of three (3) units per acre or less are limited to clearing and\ndisturbing only the land area required to install the infrastructure to serve the development (e.g., sewer and water lines, roads, storm water devices, greenways, and similar infrastructure). Until a building permit is\nissued for a lot, each lot must remain undisturbed, with the exception of portions of a lot impacted by the installation of infrastructure. Exceptions to grade upon a lot prior to the issuance of a building permit may\nbe granted as a modification to the original plan approved by Cary, if there is sufficient justification (e.g., problematic drainage issues and/or severe topographic issues).\n(H) Limit on Grading Area for Medium Density Residential Developments\nDevelopment plans containing residential development with a gross density not exceeding eight (8) units per acre shall not grade more than twenty-five (25) acres per phase or section of development. Each\ntwenty-five (25) acre phase or section of development must be stabilized and seeded meeting the requirements of this ordinance prior to grading an additional phase or section of development. Exceptions to this\nrequirement may be granted as a modification to the original plan approved by Cary if compliance is not practicable due to physical site constraints, such as topography, presence of stream buffers or other natural\nfeatures, or lot dimensions; or due to presence of existing development or infrastructure.\n(I) Installation of Required Landscape After Grading\nSee Section 7.2.3, Requirements for Perimeter Buffers and Landscape Areas, for the specific requirements.\n(J) Compliance with Town Manual\nIn addition to the standards set forth in this section, all soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall conform to the applicable minimum standards set forth in Cary's Standard Specifications and\nDetails Manual.\n14.4.4 Basic Control Objectives for Erosion Control Plans\nIn addition to meeting the standards of this Section 14.4.3 above, all erosion control plans submitted for approval under Section 3.13 of this Ordinance shall be developed and implemented in accordance with\nthe following objectives:\n(A) Identify Especially Vulnerable Areas\nOn-site areas that are subject to severe erosion, and off-site areas that are especially vulnerable to damage from erosion and/or sedimentation, shall be identified and receive special attention.\n(B) Limit Time of Exposure\nAll land-disturbing activities shall be planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time.\n(C) Limit Exposed Area\nAll land-disturbing activities shall be planned and conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one (1) time.\n(D) Control Surface Water\nSurface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas should be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during the period of exposure.\n(E) Control Sedimentation\nAll land-disturbing activities shall be planned and conducted so as to prevent off-site sedimentation damage.\n(F) Manage Stormwater Runoff\nWhen the increase in the velocity of stormwater runoff resulting from a land-disturbing activity is sufficient to cause accelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse, erosion control plans shall include\nmeasures to control the velocity at the point of discharge so as to minimize accelerated erosion of the site and increased sedimentation of the stream.\n14.4.5 Borrow and Waste Areas\nWhen the person conducting the land-disturbing activity is also the person conducting the borrow or waste disposal activity, areas from which borrow is obtained and which are not regulated by the Mining Act\nof 1971 (G.S. 74-46 et seq., as amended), and waste areas for surplus materials other than landfills regulated by the N.

Some of the benefits of UTBs are minimizing danger to lives and properties from flooding, preserving the water carrying capacity of the waterbodies, preserving tree canopy,\nreducing temperatures, capturing carbon, improving air quality, providing open spaces, limiting intense uses adjacent to waterbodies and environmentally sensitive areas associated with waterbodies, and\nmaintaining the aesthetic qualities and appearance of Cary. As part of the Cary's Land Development Ordinance, UTBs implement many of Cary's responsibilities under State and Federal law and regulations\nregarding stormwater management and watershed preservation and are designed to work in conjunction with erosion and sedimentation control regulations. Cary's water utility system uses surface water to\nprovide drinking water to its citizens and the preservation of this resource is important to Cary and its citizens. General UTBs are uniform and comprehensive zoning buffers which accomplish these important\nbenefits and purposes as well as regulating and restricting the location of buildings, structures, and land, providing yards and open spaces, all for the promotion of health, safety and the general welfare\nof\nCary's\ncitizens. Specialized UTBs exist to address concerns which are not present in Cary's entire zoning jurisdiction.\n14.6.2 Establishing General Urban Transition Buffers\n(A) This Section 14.6 shall apply to activities conducted within, or outside of with hydrologic impacts in violation of the diffuse flow requirements set out in Section 14.6.2(C)(1)(c), the following basins/\nwatershed as designated on the most recent officially adopted version of maps maintained by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission:\n(1) Cape Fear Basin/Jordan Watershed\n(a) A one hundred (100) foot wide buffer directly adjacent to all surface waters (intermittent streams, perennial streams, lakes, reservoirs, and ponds) as approximately indicated on the most recent\nversion of the 1:24,000 scale {'{}seven and one-half (7.5) minute{'}'} quadrangle topographic maps prepared by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).\n(b) A fifty (50) foot wide buffer approximately adjacent to any surface waters (intermittent streams, perennial streams, lakes, reservoirs and ponds) shown on the most recent version of the Soil Survey of\nWake or Chatham or Durham County, North Carolina prepared by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture and not shown on a USGS quadrangle topographic\nmap, or shown on a map approved by the Geographic Information Coordinating Council and by the NC Environmental Management Commission pursuant to 15A NCAC.0267.\n(2) Neuse River Basin\n(a) A fifty foot (50') wide buffer beginning at the landward boundary of any Neuse River Riparian Buffer mandated by regulations adopted by the Environmental Management Commission of the State of\nNorth Carolina and established adjacent to surface waters (intermittent streams, perennial streams, lakes, reservoirs and ponds) as approximately indicated on the most recent version of the 1:24,000 scale {'{}\nseven and one-half (7.5) minute{'}'} quadrangle topographic maps prepared by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).\n(3) Wetlands adjacent to surface waters or within fifty (50) feet of surface waters shall be considered as part of the UTB but are regulated pursuant to Rules 15A NCAC 2B .0230 and .0231, Rules 15A\nNCAC H..0500, 15 NCAC 2H .1300, and Sections 401 and 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.\n(B) General UTBs are applied to specific properties as follows:\n(1) Where the specific origination point of a stream regulated under subsection (A)(1) is in question upon request of the NC Division of Water Resources (\"Division\") or another party, Cary shall make an on-\nsite determination. Cary representative who has the training required by 15A NCAC shall establish that point using the methods described by 15A NCAC .0267. Any disputes over said on-site\ndeterminations shall be referred to the Director of the Division of Water Resources c/o the 401 Oversight Express Permitting Unit or its successor in writing. The Director's determination is subject to review as\nprovided in Articles 3 and 4 of G.S. Chapter 150B.\n(2) When a landowner or other affected party including the Division believes that the maps referenced in subsection (A)(1) have inaccurately depicted surface waters, he or she shall consult Cary. Upon\nrequest the Cary representative who has the training required by 15A NCAC 02B.0267 shall make an on-site determination. Any disputes over said on-site determination shall be referred to the Director of the\nDivision of Water Resources c/o the 401 Oversight Express Permitting Unit or its successor, in writing. A determination of the Director as to the accuracy or application of the maps is subject to review as provided\nin\nArticles 3 and 4 of G.S. Chapter 150B. Surface waters that appear on maps shall not be subject to these requirements if a site evaluation reveals any of the following cases:\n(a) Man-made ponds and lakes that are not part of the natural drainage way that is classified in accordance with 15A NCAC 2B.0100 including ponds and lakes created for animal watering,\nirrigation,\nor\nother agricultural uses.

Failure to act within sixty (60) days shall be construed as a finding of \"no practical alternatives\" and an Authorization Certificate shall be issued\nto the applicant unless one of the following occurs:\n(1) The applicant agrees, in writing, to a longer period;\n(2) Cary determines that the applicant has failed to furnish requested information necessary to Cary's decision;\n(3) The final decision is to be made pursuant to a public hearing; or\n(4) The applicant refuses access to its records or premises for the purpose of gathering information necessary to Cary's decision.\n(5) Cary may attach conditions to the Authorization Certificate that support the purpose, spirit and intent of this Section 14.6.\n(6) Any appeals of determinations regarding Authorization Certificates for activities in Zones One and Two shall be referred to the Stormwater Manager of the Town Managers Office, or its successor. The\nStormwater Manager's decision is subject to review as provided in G.S. Chapter 150B, Articles 3 and 4. Any appeals of determinations regarding Authorization Certificates for activities taking place only in Zone\nThree shall be pursuant to Sections 3.21 and 11.2 of this Ordinance.\n14.6.10 Modification of Urban Transition Buffers as part of Approving Development Plans\nUTBs are part of Cary's overall zoning, land subdivision and land use regulations. Cary has collected these regulations together in Cary's Land Development Ordinance (LDO). UTBs are intended to assist\nCary in accomplishing the broad and important purposes of the LDO stated in 1.3 of the LDO as well as the specific purposes stated in Sections 1.3.1-1.3.12 and 14.6.1. In any specific development plan, Cary's\nreviews the entire proposed development and determines whether the proposed development in its entirety satisfies the LDO. Cary recognizes that UTBs will affect different property and projects differently and\nthat\nall circumstances or applications of UTBs cannot be foreseen. Therefore, Cary has established a process by which the width of Zone 3 of the UTB may be modified in certain limited circumstances based\nupon review and approval of an applicant's application for modification which shall include the overall development plan. Any modification granted shall be conditioned upon the implementation of the related\ndevelopment plan and shall be conditioned upon the applicant providing mitigation as set forth below.\n(A) Procedures for Requesting Modifications to Zone Three\nThe Zoning Board of Adjustment, after receiving comment from various Cary departments which review the proposed development plan pursuant to the LDO, may reduce the total area of Zone Three after\nestablishing the following at a quasi-judicial hearing:\n(1) The reduction will have a minimal impact upon the purposes of the General UTBs stated in Section 14.6.1 and is consistent with general purposes of the LDO stated in Section 1.3; and\n(2) The mitigation of impacts offered by the applicant as part of the proposed development plan significantly outweighs the impacts of the reduction to the General UTBs proposed by the applicant; and\n(3) The impact of the reduction in the General UTB is balanced by mitigation, as required below:\n(a) Mitigation on a 1:1 ratio for restoration of a degraded buffer or for protection of ephemeral streams contiguous to protected streams; or\n(b) Mitigation on a 3:1 ratio for preservation of an existing buffer; or\n(c) Mitigation on a 10:1 ratio for preservation of open space.\n(4) The requirements of Section 14.6.12(G)(3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) shall apply to any mitigation required by Section 14.6.10(A)(3) above. In addition, the applicant shall submit a restoration or enhancement\nplan meeting the requirements of Section 14.6.12(G)(5) together with its request for modification.\n(5) The preferred mitigation area is off-site. However, in some cases mitigation requirements may be met by protecting land on-site which would otherwise not be protected through another avenue such as\nbuffer, wetlands, floodplain, or open space requirements.\n(B)\nIn addition to the mitigation required and the considerations provided above, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may consider other factors such as the following:\n(1) Whether a substantial conflict exists between the General UTBs and other provisions and provisions of the LDO (e.g., the appropriate layout of streets in a proposed development conflicts with the\nlocation of the General UTBs);\n(2) Whether approvals of other governmental agencies impede the effectiveness of the General UTBs or otherwise impact the layout or development of the proposed development; or\n(3) Any other information which may be relevant to the Zoning Board of Adjustment determination that the development plan otherwise satisfies the purposes and goals of the LDO.\n(C) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the applicant provides written evidence that the State of North Carolina has granted the applicant a variance to the riparian buffer required by the State of North\nCarolina, or if Cary has granted a minor variance as described below in section 14.6.11, the Planning Director shall grant a modification to the UTBs applicable to such applicant sufficient to permit such applicant\nto utilize the State variance granted.\n14.6.11 Variances\n(A) Except where General UTBs are modified pursuant to Section 14.6.10 above, General UTBs shall not be modified or varied unless the applicant is granted a variance pursuant to this Section 14.6.11.\n(B) Requirements for Variances\nPersons who wish to undertake prohibited uses may pursue a variance. Cary may grant minor variances. For major variances, Cary shall prepare preliminary findings and submit them to the Stormwater\nDivision, or its successor for approval by the Environmental Management Commission. The variance request procedure shall be as follows:\n(1) For any variance request, Cary shall make a finding of fact as to whether there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships that prevent compliance with the UTB requirements. A finding of\npractical difficulties or unnecessary hardships shall require that the following conditions are met:\n(a) If the applicant complies with the provisions of this Ordinance, he/she can secure no reasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of, his/her property. Merely proving that the variance would\npermit a greater profit from the property shall not be considered adequate justification for a variance. Moreover, Cary shall consider whether the variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of this\nSection 14.6 that shall make reasonable use of the property possible;\n(b) The hardship results from application of this Section 14.6 to the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship;\n(c) The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such as its size, shape, or topography, such that compliance with provisions of this Section 14.6 would not allow reasonable use\nof the property;\n(d) The applicant did not cause the hardship by knowingly or unknowingly violating this Section 14.6;\n(e) The applicant did not purchase the property after July 14, 2011 (the effective date of this Ordinance), and then request a variance; and\n(f) The hardship is rare or unique to the applicant's property.\n(g) The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the State's riparian buffer protection requirements and this Ordinance and preserves its spirit; and\n(h) In granting the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured, water quality has been protected, and substantial justice has been done.\n(C) Minor Variances\nA minor variance request pertains to activities that will impact Zone Two of the UTB. Minor variance requests shall be reviewed and approved based on the criteria in Section 14.6.11(B). Cary may attach\nconditions to the variance approval that support the purpose, spirit, and intent of the UTB program. Request for appeals to decisions made by Cary shall be made in writing to the Director of Water Quality, 401\nOversight Express Permitting Unit, or its successor. The Directors decision is subject to review as provided in G.S. Chapter 150B, Articles 3 and 4.\n(D) Major Variances\nA major variance request pertains to activities that will impact any portion of Zone One or any portion of both Zones One and Two of UTB. If Cary has determined that a major variance request meets the\nrequirements in Section 14.6.11(B), then it shall prepare a preliminary finding and submit it to the NC Environmental Management Commission c/o the Division of Water Resources, 401 Oversight Express\nPermitting Unit, or its successor, for approval. Within ninety (90) days after receipt by Cary, the Commission shall review preliminary findings on major variance requests and take one (1) of the following actions:\napprove, approve with conditions and stipulations, or deny the request. Appeals from a Commission decision on a major variance request are made on judicial review to Superior Court.\n(E) Any use allowed by a variance which requires mitigation as a condition of variance approval shall not be undertaken until a Mitigation Approval is issued pursuant to Section 14.6.12.\n14.6.12 Mitigation\n(A) This item shall apply to persons who wish to impact a UTB when one (1) of the following applies:\n(1) A person has received an Authorization Certificate pursuant to Section 14.6.9 for a proposed use that is designated as \"allowable with mitigation\"; or\n224 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "225", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be...\n(2) A person has received a variance pursuant to Section 14.6.11 and is required to perform mitigation as a condition of a variance approval; or\n(3) A person has requested a modification pursuant to Section 14.6.10.\n(B) Issuance of the Mitigation Approval\nCary shall issue a mitigation approval upon determining that a proposal meets the requirements set out in this Ordinance. The approval shall identify at a minimum the option chosen, the required and\nproposed areas, and either the mitigation location or the offset payment amount as applicable.\n(C) Options for Meeting the Mitigation Requirement\nThe mitigation requirement may be met through one (1) of the following options:\n(1) Payment of a mitigation fee pursuant to 15A NCAC .0269 for impacts to Zone 1 and Zone 2 of the UTB only;\n(2) Donation of real property or of an interest in real property pursuant to Section 14.6.12(F); or\n(3) Restoration or enhancement of a non-forested riparian buffer pursuant to the requirements of Section 14.6.12(G).\n(4) Other alternative buffer mitigation options for impacts to the UTB as approved by the Town. Other alternative riparian buffer mitigation options not specified within this Section may be submitted to the\nTown for review. Any proposal submitted under this Section shall provide documentation or calculations to demonstrate that the proposed alternative mitigation option removes an equal or greater annual mass\nload of nutrients to surface waters as a riparian buffer.\n(D) The Area of Mitigation\nCary shall determine the required area of mitigation, which shall apply to all mitigation options identified in Section 14.6.11(C) and as further specified in the requirements for each option set out in this\nSection, according to the following:\n(1) The impacts in square feet to each zone of the UTB shall be determined by Cary by adding the following:\n(a) The area of the footprint of the use causing the impact to the UTB;\n(b) The area of the boundary of any clearing and grading activities within the UTB necessary to accommodate the use; and\n(c) The area of any ongoing maintenance corridors within the UTB associated with the use.\n(2) The required area of mitigation shall be determined by applying the following multipliers to the impacts determined in Section 14.6.11 (D) of this Ordinance to each zone of the UTB:\n(a) Impacts to Zone One of the UTB shall be multiplied by three (3);\n(b) Impacts to Zone Two of the UTB shall be multiplied by one and one-half (1.5); and\n(c) Impacts to wetlands within the UTB that are subject to mitigation under 15A NCAC 1.0506 shall comply with the mitigation ratios in 15A NCAC .0506.\n(E) The Location of Mitigation\nFor any option chosen for impacts in the Jordan watershed, the mitigation effort shall be located within the same subwatershed of the Jordan watershed, as defined in 15A NCAC 02B.0262, and the same\ndistance from the Jordan Reservoir as the proposed impact, or closer to the Reservoir than the impact, and as close to the location of the impact as feasible. Alternatively, the applicant may propose mitigation\nanywhere within the same subwatershed of the Jordan watershed, as defined in 15A NCAC 02B.0262, provided that the mitigation proposal accounts for differences in delivery of nutrients to the affected arm of\nJordan Reservoir resulting from differences between the locations of the impact and mitigation. Additional location requirements for the property donation option are enumerated in Section 14.6.12(F)(3)(a).\n(F) Donation of Property\nPersons who choose to satisfy their mitigation determination by donating real property or an interest in real property shall meet the following requirements:\n(1) The donation of real property interests may be used to either partially or fully satisfy the payment of a mitigation fee to the Riparian Buffer Restoration Fund pursuant to 15A NCAC 02B .0272 for impacts\nto Zone 1 and Zone 2. The value of the property interest shall be determined by an appraisal performed in accordance with Section 7.2.14(L)(6)(d)4. The donation shall satisfy the mitigation determination if\nthe\nappraised value of the donated property interest is equal to or greater than the required fee. If the appraised value of the donated property interest is less than the required fee calculated pursuant to 15A NCAC\n02B .0272, the applicant shall pay the remaining balance due.\n(2) The donation of conservation easements to satisfy mitigation requirements shall be accepted only if the conservation easement is granted in perpetuity.\n(3) Donation of real property interests to satisfy the mitigation determination shall be accepted only if such property meets all of the following requirements:\n(a) In addition to the location requirements of Section 14.6.12(E) for impacts in the Jordan watershed, the property shall be located within an area that is identified as a priority for restoration in, or\nis\notherwise consistent with the goals of, the Basinwide Wetlands and Riparian Restoration Plan for the Cape Fear River Basin developed by NC Division of Water Resources pursuant to G.S. 143-214.10;\n(b) The property shall contain riparian buffers not currently protected by the State's riparian buffer protection program that are in need of restoration as defined in Section 14.6.12 (G);\n(c) The restorable riparian buffer on the property shall have a minimum length of one thousand (1,000) linear feet along a surface water and a minimum width of fifty (50) feet as measured horizontally on\na line perpendicular to the surface water;\n(d)\nThe size of the restorable riparian buffer on the property to be donated shall equal or exceed the area of mitigation responsibility determined pursuant to Section 14.6.12 (D):\n(e) Restoration shall not require removal of man-made structures or infrastructure;\n(f) The property shall be suitable to be successfully restored, based on existing hydrology, soils, and vegetation;\n(g) The estimated cost of restoring and maintaining the property shall not exceed the value of the property minus site identification and transaction costs;\n(h) The property shall not contain any building, structure, object, site, or district that is listed in the National Register of Historic Places established pursuant to Public Law 89-665, 16 U.S.C. 470 as\namended;\n(i) The property shall not contain any hazardous substance or solid waste;\n(j) The property shall not contain structures or materials that present health or safety problems to the general public.

For the\npurpose of the State's riparian buffer protection program, the waterbody must be part of a natural drainage way (i.e., connected by surface flow to a stream).\n\"Referenced / reference reach\" means a stable stream that is in dynamic equilibrium with its valley and contributing watershed. A reference reach can be used to develop natural channel design criteria for\nstream restoration projects.\n\"Shoreline stabilization\" is the in-place stabilization of an eroding shoreline. Stabilization techniques which include \"soft\" methods or natural materials (such as root wads, or rock vanes) may be considered\nas part of a restoration design. However, stabilization techniques that consist of \"hard\" engineering, such as concrete lined channels, riprap, or gabions, while providing bank stabilization, shall not be considered\nstream restoration.\n\"Stream restoration\" is defined as the process of converting an unstable, altered or degraded stream corridor, including adjacent riparian zone and flood-prone areas to its natural or referenced, stable\nconditions considering recent and future watershed conditions. This process also includes restoring the geomorphic dimension, pattern, and profile as well as biological and chemical integrity, including transport of\nwater and sediment produced by the stream's watershed in order to achieve dynamic equilibrium.\n\"Stream\" means a body of concentrated flowing water in a natural low area or natural channel on the land surface.\n\"Stump diameter\" means the diameter of a tree measured at six (6) inches above the ground surface level.\n\"Surface Waters\" means all waters of the state as defined in G.S. 143-212 except underground waters.\n\"Tree\" means a woody plant with a DBH equal to or exceeding five (5) inches or a stump diameter exceeding six (6) inches.\n\"Temporary road\" means a road constructed temporarily for equipment access to build or replace hydraulic conveyance structures such as bridges, culverts, pipes or water dependent structures or to\nmaintain public traffic during construction.\n(Ord. No. 2022-LDO-03, 10-27-22)\n14.7 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION\n14.7.1 Purpose; Enforcement\n(A) The Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) is subject to periodic inundation that could result in loss of life and property, hazards to public health and safety, disruption of commerce and governmental\nservices, damage to and disruption of public utilities, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and\ngeneral welfare.\nThese losses and hazards are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains, which increase flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood-prone areas by uses that are\nvulnerable to floods, or hazardous to other properties, because they are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damages. Therefore, the regulations set forth in this section are\ndesigned to:\n(1) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion or increased flood heights or velocities;\n(2)\nRequire that uses that are vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;\n(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers that accommodate and restrain floodwaters;\n(4) Prevent or control filling, grading, dredging, and other development that may increase erosion or flood damage;\n(5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or that may increase flood hazards to other lands;\n(B) Objectives\nThe objectives of this ordinance are to:\n(1) Protect human life, safety, and health;\n(2) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\n(3) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;\n(4) Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;\n(5) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;\n(6) Minimize damage to private and public property due to flooding;\n(7) Make flood insurance available to the community through the National Flood Insurance Program;\n(8) Maintain the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains;\n(9) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas; and\n(10) Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area.\n(C) The degree of flood protection required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare\noccasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This section does not imply that land outside the Special Flood Hazard Area will be free from flooding or flood damages. Neither shall\nthis section create liability on the part of Cary or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this section, or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.\n(D) In the interpretation and application of this section, all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of Cary, and shall be deemed neither to limit nor repeal\nany other powers granted to Cary under state statutes.\n(E) This Section 14.7 shall be enforced by the Town Manager or designee.

Therefore, encroachments, including fill, in floodways or non-encroachment areas are permitted only in limited circumstances and only under the following\nrestrictions:\n(A) There shall be no encroachment, including fill, unless the applicant has received a Special Use Permit (see Section 3.8) or the use is permitted under Section 14.7.3(A). The applicant for a special use\ninvolving the floodway portion of a Special Flood Hazard Area or Future Conditions Flood Hazard Area shall provide certification by a professional registered engineer, architect, or landscape architect that the\nencroachment will not result in any increase in flood levels during the discharge of the base flood or provide a Conditional Letter or Map Revision (CLOMR) issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nA Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) must also be obtained within six (6) months of completion of the proposed encroachment.\n(B) Once paragraph (A) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction requirements of this section.\n14.7.5 Standards for Streams without Established Base Flood Elevations\nLocated within Special Flood Hazard Areas are small streams where no base flood data has been provided. The following provisions apply within such areas:\n(A) No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or new development, shall be permitted within a distance of the stream bank equal to five (5) times the width of the stream at\n230 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "231", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be.\nthe top of the bank or twenty (20) feet each side from the top of the bank, whichever is greater, unless a special use is approved or the use is permitted.\nBase Floodplain\nElevation\nMin. 2\"-0\"\nwhen Base Flood\nElevation is\navailable\nNew Construction near Streams\nNo\nencreachment\nencroachment\n5X\nStream\nor 20' min.\nor 20' min.\nwhichever is greater whichever is greater\nStandards for Streams without Established Base Flood Elevations\n(B) In cases where the streams lacking base flood data are USGS or County Soils Map streams, then the limitations upon encroachments shall apply to the entire area within the associated UTBs, or an area\nfive (5) times the width of the stream at the top of the bank, whichever is greater.\n(C) If paragraph (A) above is satisfied, and base flood elevation data is available from other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas shall comply with all applicable flood\nhazard ordinance provisions of this Section and shall be elevated or flood-proofed in accordance with elevations established under Section 14.7.2. When base flood elevation data is not available from a federal,\nstate, or other source, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation as defined in Chapter 12.\n14.7.6 Cross Drainage Area Standards and Restrictions\nFor any new proposed development subject to flooding which includes, but is not limited to, those lots along any significant watercourse, whether or not the stream or water course is enclosed with a pipe or\nculvert; the applicant shall make a determination of the crest elevation of the flood expected to be equaled or exceeded that has a one percent (1%) chance of annual occurrence in accordance with generally\naccepted engineering practice, which is to be submitted with the seal and signature of a Professional Engineer to Cary. Any new construction of, or substantial improvements (see Chapter 12, Definitions) to, any\nresidential or non-residential structure shall comply with Section 14.7.3(B).\n14.7.7 Special Requirements for Manufactured Homes\n(A) No manufactured home shall be placed in Special Flood Hazard Areas or Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas, except when located within an existing manufactured home park. In existing\nmanufactured home parks, all manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within the SFHA or Future Conditions Flood Hazard Area, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the\nlowest floor of the manufactured home is no lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation as defined in Chapter 12 and shall be securely anchored to an adequate foundation system in accordance with the\nmost current edition of the State of North Carolina Regulations for Manufactured Homes adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. 143-143.15.\n(B) Manufactured homes may not be placed in the floodway.\n(C) All manufactured homes within Special Flood Hazard Areas or Future Conditions Flood Hazard Areas shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement in accordance with the\nRegulations for Mobile Homes and Modular Housing adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to G.S. 143-15. Where the required elevation can be met by elevating the chassis no more than thirty-six\n(36) inches above grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or other foundation of equivalent strength. When the elevation of the chassis is above thirty-six (36) inches in height an\nengineering certification is required.\n14.7.8 Special Requirements for Development Proposals Requiring Development Plan Approval\nFor purposes of this section only, the boundaries of the Special Flood Hazard Area or Future Conditions Flood Hazard Area for a development or a discrete phase of a development are established if all of the\nfollowing conditions are met:\n(A) The development is approved for construction;\n(B) A substantial investment is made in constructing the development.\n(C) In addition to satisfying the other requirements of this Ordinance, all proposals for development plans shall:\n(1) Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;\n(2) Have public utilities and facilities, such as wastewater, gas, electrical, and water systems, located and constructed so as to minimize flood damage;\n(3) Have all proposed residential structures located outside the Special Flood Hazard Area or Future Conditions Flood Hazard Area, with the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least two (2) feet\nabove the base flood elevation;\n(4) Have all proposed non-residential structures located outside of the Special Flood Hazard Area or Future Conditions Flood Hazard Area, with the lowest floor, including basement, located at least two (2)\nfeet\nabove the base flood elevation. (Note that an approved special use may permit structures in a flood fringe see Section 3.12.3).\n(5) Have all drainage structures located within the Flood Hazard Area designed to accommodate the one percent (1%) annual chance flood without causing increased base flood elevations on properties\nother than that for which development approval is being requested;\n(6) Shall provide base flood elevation data along with the development plan, which is submitted to Cary for approval.\n14.7.9 Downstream Impact Analysis\n(A) A Downstream Impact Analysis shall be submitted at the time of development plan submission for all proposed development that requires development plan approval. Development plans that are not\nsubject to the stormwater management regulations of LDO Section 7.3 are exempt from this section 14.7.9.\n(B) The Downstream Impact Analysis shall calculate the pre- and post-development discharges for each discharge point from the area subject to the development plan.\n(1) If the calculated post-development discharge is less than the calculated pre-development discharge for the two (2), five (5), ten (10) and one hundred (100)-year peak discharges at each discharge\npoint, then no further analysis is needed.\n(2) If the calculated post-development discharge is greater than the calculated pre-development discharge for the two (2), five (5), ten (10) or one hundred (100)-year peak discharges at any discharge\npoint, then one of the options below shall be required.\n(a) Provide onsite detention to fully mitigate each storm event to calculated pre-development discharge; or\n231 of 232\n6/27/2024, 2:17 PM\n"}, {"page": "232", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/9ce41ef7-ac4d-4320-be.\n(b) Provide an engineering model demonstrating no adverse impacts from the development on downstream properties and infrastructure.\n14.7.10 Non-Compliance\nFailure to comply with the provisions of this section shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance and shall subject an offending party to a series of actions listed in Chapter 11 of this Ordinance.\n(Ord.
