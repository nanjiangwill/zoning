This document establishes the\ncollective vision of how the citizens of Salisbury would like to have their city look and\nfunction in the future.\nTo this end, this Ordinance embodies the principle of \"Sustainable Growth.\" Very simply, this\nmeans that the City seeks to accommodate and maintain population growth and economic\nexpansion using coordinated planning and design. This principle fosters the philosophy that\neach development decision represents an investment in the long-term viability of the City.\nThus, the commitment on the part of the City to improve, extend, and maintain public\ninfrastructure must be coupled with a similar commitment to quality investment in all building\nand development.\n1.3 Authority\nThese zoning provisions are enacted herein are under the authority of G.S. $160D, Articles 1-\n7, 9, 10, 13, and 14, which extends to cities the authority to enact regulations which promote\nthe health, safety, and the general welfare of the community. It further authorizes cities to\nregulate and restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use\nof\nbuildings, structures, or land. This section authorizes the establishment of overlay districts in\nwhich additional regulations may be imposed upon properties that lie within the boundary of\nthe district. The statutes also require that all such regulations shall be uniform for each use\nclass or type of building throughout each district, but that the regulations in one district may\ndiffer from those in other districts.\nThese subdivision provisions enacted herein are under the authority of G.S. $160D, Article\n82 which provide for the coordination of streets within proposed subdivisions with existing or\nplanned street and with other public facilities, the dedication or reservation or recreation areas\nserving residents of the immediate neighborhood within the subdivision, or alternatively, for\nthe provision of funds to be used to acquire recreation areas serving residents of more than\none neighborhood in the immediate area, and for the distribution of population and traffic in\na manner that will avoid congestion and overcrowding.\nSALISBURY, NC LAND DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n1-1\nADOPTED DECEMBER 18, 2007; EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008\nAMENDED 1/5/21; ORD.2021-02;2/21/23 ORD.2023-15\n"}, {"page": "2", "text": "CHAPTER 1:\nPURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY\n1.4 Applicability\nThese regulations apply to the development and use of all land and structures within the\ncorporate limits of the City of Salisbury, North Carolina and within the extraterritorial\njurisdiction exercised by Ordinance and denoted on the District Map as is on file at the\nSalisbury Land Management & Development Department.

The\nTransect is a method of classifying the\nnatural and built environments as a continuum of six conditions, ranging from rural to\nurban. The value of the Transect is that it serves to locate any given place within a context in\nwhich all of the parts fit together harmoniously.\nFor example, a rural street typically has no curbs or sidewalks and its buildings look like\nfarmhouses or barns. An urban street, depending on the intensity of urbanism, may have\ncurbs and gutters, regularly placed street trees, sidewalks, and building forms that include\ncommon walls, flat roofs, and cornices. Each Transect zoning category has detailed\nprovisions for each neighborhood, for density, height, street design, the design of parks, the\nmix of uses, building design, parking, and other aspects of the human environment.\nThe Transect begins with two zones that are entirely rural in character: Natural Zone (or T-\n1), which is made up of lands protected in perpetuity; and Rural Zone (T-2), which includes\nareas of high environmental or scenic quality that are not currently preserved, but perhaps\nshould be.\nThe transition zone between countryside and town is called the Suburban Zone (T-3), which\nencompasses the most rural part of the neighborhood, and the countryside just beyond. The\nT-3 area is primarily single family homes. Although the T-3 area is the most purely\nresidential zone, it can have some mixed-use, such as civic buildings; schools are particularly\nappropriate for the T-3 area. Next is the General Urban Zone (T-4), typically the largest\nzone. Urban Residential is primarily residential, but more urban in character, having\nsomewhat higher density with a mix of housing types and a slightly greater mix of uses\nallowed.\nAt the more urban end of the spectrum are two zones which are primarily mixed use: Urban\nCenter, or T-5. This can be a small neighborhood center or a larger town center, the latter\nserving more than one neighborhood. The Urban Core or Downtown (T-6) serves the\nregion, not only adjacent neighborhoods, and is typically understood as the central business\ndistrict. Additionally, the Special Districts make allowance for auto-dependent activities, such\nas big box retail, institutional campuses, and industrial zones.\nThe zoning districts for the City of Salisbury have thus been ordered along this Transect\nproviding an appropriate detailing of development at each end of the continuum (rather than\nhomogenous standardization) as well as a simplified tool for users of this Ordinance to use\nto facilitate appropriate development. The graphic on this page shows the defining features\nof various types of developments at either end of the Rural-Urban spectrum.\nSALISBURY, NC LAND DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n2-1\nADOPTED DECEMBER 18, 2007; EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008\nAMENDED 2/5/08, ORD.2008-03; 5/6/08, ORD.2008-17;9/2/08, ORD.2008-44; 1/18/11,\nORD.2011-03; 3/15/11, ORD.2011-13; 6/4/13, ORD.2013-25; ORD.2014-29;\n3/17/15, RD.2015-07; 8/18/15, ORD.2017-17; 10/2/18,\nORD.2018-48; 4/6/2019, ORD.2019-19;1/5/21;ORD.2021-02\nCELL (1, 1): \n2.1 Purpose\nCELL (1, 2): \n2.1 Purpose\nCELL (2, 1): \n2.2 Placement of District Provisions\nCELL (2, 2): \n2.2 Placement of District Provisions\nCELL (3, 1): \n2.3 Base Districts\nCELL (3, 2): \n2.3 Base Districts\nCELL (4, 1): \n2.4 Specific Base District Provisions\nCELL (4, 2): \n2.4 Specific Base District Provisions\nCELL (5, 1): \n2.5 Maximum Density by District\nCELL (5, 2): \n2.5 Maximum Density by District\nCELL (6, 1): \n2.6 Overlay Districts\nCELL (6, 2): \n2.6 Overlay Districts\nCELL (7, 1): \n2.7 Uses Permitted By District\nCELL (7, 2): \n2.7 Uses Permitted By District\n"}, {"page": "6", "text": "R\n3\na\nT1\nNATURAL\nT2\nRURAL\nZONE\nT3\nSUBURBAN\nT4\nGENERAL URBAN\nZONE\nZONE\nT5\nURBAN CENTER\nZONE\nT6\nURBAN CORE\nZONE\nZONE\nDA\nASSIGNED\nDISTRICT\nTable by Duany Plater-Zyberk and Company\n2-2\nSALISBURY, NC LAND DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nADOPTED DECEMBER 18, 2007; EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008 AMENDED 2/5/08,\nORD.2008 -03; 5/6/08, ORD.2008-17; 9/2/08, ORD.2008-44; 1/18/11, ORD.2011-03; 3/15/11,\nORD.2011-13; 6/4/13, ORD.2013-25; 9/2/14, ORD.2014-29; 3/17/15, ORD.2015-07; 8/18/15,\nORD.2015-27; 3/7/17, ORD.2017-17; 10/2/18, ORD.2018-48; 4/6/2019, ORD.2019-19; 1/5/21,\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nLess Density\nCELL (1, 3): \nMore Density\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nPrimarily Residential\nCELL (2, 3): \nPrimarily Mixed-Use\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nSmaller Buildings\nCELL (3, 3): \nLarger Buildings\nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \nMore Greenspace\nCELL (4, 3): \nMore Hardscape\nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nDetached Buildings\nCELL (5, 3): \nAttached Buildings\nCELL (6, 1): \nCELL (6, 2): \nRotated Frontages\nCELL (6, 3): \nAligned Frontages\nCELL (7, 1): \nCELL (7, 2): \nYards & Porches\nCELL (7, 3): \nStoops & Shopfronts\nCELL (8, 1): \nCELL (8, 2): \nDeep Setbacks\nCELL (8, 3): \nShallow Setbacks\nCELL (9, 1): \nCELL (9, 2): \nArticulated Massing\nCELL (9, 3): \nSimple Massing\nCELL (10, 1): \nCELL (10, 2): \nWooden Buildings\nCELL (10, 3): \nMasonry Buildings\nCELL (11, 1): \nCELL (11, 2): \nGenerally Pitched Roofs\nCELL (11, 3): \nGenerally Flat Roofs\nCELL (12, 1): \nCELL (12, 2): \nSmall Yard Signs\nCELL (12, 3): \nBuilding Mounted Signage\nCELL (13, 1): \nCELL (13, 2): \nLivestock\nCELL (13, 3): \nDomestic Animals\nCELL (14, 1): \nCELL (14, 2): \nRoads & Lanes\nCELL (14, 3): \nStreets & Alleys\nCELL (15, 1): \nCELL (15, 2): \nNarrow Paths\nCELL (15, 3): \nWide Sidewalks\nCELL (16, 1): \nCELL (16, 2): \nHigh L.O.S.

NMX: Neighborhood Mixed-Use\nThe Neighborhood Mixed-Use District is coded to provide pedestrian-scaled,\nhigher density residential and opportunities for limited scale commercial\nactivities along existing mixed-use corridors, in areas of transition, and at the\nfunctional center of new neighborhoods. Development in this district should\nencourage pedestrian activity through construction of mixed-use buildings and\nconnections to adjacent neighborhoods. Buildings in this district are typically\nsmall and detached.\n3.\nCMX: Corridor Mixed-Use\nThe Corridor Mixed-Use District is coded to facilitate convenient access,\nminimize traffic congestion, and reduce the visual impact of auto-oriented uses\nalong the City's older major thoroughfares. Developments in this district should\nbe traditionally detailed and encourage pedestrian use through connections to\nadjacent neighborhoods and the construction of vertically mixed-use buildings.\n4. DMX: Downtown Mixed-Use\nThe Downtown Mixed-Use District is coded for the traditional downtown area.\nIndividual buildings are encouraged to be multi-story with uses mixed vertically,\nstreet level commercial and upper level office and residential. Higher densities\nof residential development are encouraged. It is the purpose of these regulations\nto encourage vitality by excluding certain activities which have a negative effect\non the public realm through auto-dominated or non-pedestrian oriented design\nor uses.\nD.\nAssigned Districts\nThe assigned districts are \"specialized districts\" that are intended to accommodate\nspecialized uses and districts that do not fit into the prescribed Transect categories,\nsuch as airports, college campuses, industrial parks, and regional hospitals. In the\nCity of Salisbury case, this also includes the accommodation of a broad range of\nhigh-intensity, automotive-oriented retail and service uses that require high visibility\nand highly- accessible locations along arterial thoroughfares or boulevards and do\nnot cater directly to pedestrians while requiring sufficient off-street parking.\n2-6\nSALISBURY, NC LAND DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nADOPTED DECEMBER 18, 2007; EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008 AMENDED 2/5/08,\nORD.2008-03;5/6/08, ORD.2008-17;9/2/08.

The CD is not subject to all of the traditional\nOrdinance standards. Instead, design elements are determined for the specific\ndevelopment and are written into the rezoning Ordinance, which becomes law.\nFor City Council and the community, since the urban design elements are\nexpressly stated in the rezoning Ordinance and become law, there is a greater\ndegree of certainty as to the final product.
