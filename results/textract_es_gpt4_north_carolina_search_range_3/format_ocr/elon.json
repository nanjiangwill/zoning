These general statements are supplemented by more specific purpose and intent statements\nfor each conventional zoning district.\nA.\nBUSINESS DISTRICTS\nThe business zoning districts (DTC, DTP, GMX, HND, LND, and VMX) are intended to ensure a wide range\nof office, retail, service, industrial, and mixed uses necessary to meet resident and visitor needs, and more\nspecifically to:\n1. Provide appropriately located lands for the full range of business uses needed by the Town's residents,\nbusinesses, workers, and the University;\n2. Create appropriate amounts of flexibility to foster redevelopment, infill, and revitalization in the\ndowntown area;\n3. Increase the opportunities for urban development in areas already well-served by public\ninfrastructure;\n4. Avoid the establishment of low intensity development in peripheral areas in ways that interrupt the\nefficient utilization of land, endanger sensitive natural resources, interfere with the established rural\ncharacter, or that result inefficient allocation of Town resources;\n5.\nAccommodate various types of mixed-use development in ways that establish functioning\nneighborhoods where people can live, work, shop, and recreate without travelling extensive distances;\n6. Provide employment opportunities close to home for residents of the Town and surrounding areas;\nand\n7.\nEnsure new development promotes and protects the Town's desired community character.\nB.\nINSTITUTIONAL DISTRICTS\nThe institutional zoning districts (ONI and UNV) are intended to recognize those portions of the Town's\njurisdiction that are unique or that require special consideration in order to:\n1.\nCreate appropriate locations for office and institutional forms of development that provide\nemployment and important services to community members;\n2. Establish a zoning district capable of addressing the unique needs of the University in terms of its long-\nrange master plan, large size, and educational mission;\n3.\nProvide functional transitions between residential and non-residential land uses to mitigate potential\nnegative impacts of one land use type upon another; and\nC.\nRESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS\nThe residential zoning districts (NBR, RUR, SBR, and UBR) are proposed to provide a comfortable, healthy,\nsafe, and pleasant environment in which to live and recreate. More specifically, they are intended to:\n1.\nProvide appropriately located lands for residential development that are consistent with the goals,\nobjectives, and direction in the Town's adopted policy guidance;\n2. Ensure adequate light, air, privacy, and open space areas for each dwelling, and protect residents from\npotential negative effects of noise, excessive population density, traffic congestion, flooding, and\nother significant adverse environmental impacts;\n3. Protect residential areas from fires, explosions, toxic fumes and substances, and other public safety\nhazards;\n4. Provide for residential housing choice and diversity with varying housing densities, types, and designs\nso that people may reside within the Town regardless of their life stage;\n5.

Protect Elon's community character while accommodating new development and redevelopment in\nways that are consistent with the Town's goals and objectives.\n3.2.2 DOWNTOWN DISTRICT\nA. DISTRICT CHARACTER\nThe Downtown District is the cultural and commercial heart of Elon. It contains the oldest commercial structures\nin Town, is surrounded by compact and diverse residential neighborhoods, and is located adjacent to the\nUniversity's main entrance. The heart of downtown is a blend of low-rise commercial, multi-family, and\ninstitutional uses, most with surface parking lots. Downtown is surrounded by a series of single-family residential\nneighborhoods and institutional buildings on tree-lined streets at densities of around two units an acre. The entire\narea is well-served by public utilities, a fine-grained street grid, and a host of shopping and recreational options.\nAll development in the district shall be in accordance with the dimensional requirements in this section and the\nstandards in Chapter 4: Uses.\nB. DISTRICT INTENT\nThese Downtown district standards are intended to:\n1.\nDiversify the Town's tax base by encouraging new commercial and employment uses;\n2.\nLimit the establishment of single-use multi-family residential uses in favor of new mixed-use development that\nprovides a range of housing options for Town residents, employees, and retirees;\n3.\nAccommodate and incentivize the establishment of retail floor area that is small and scalable to accommodate\nnew business start-ups and allow existing commercial establishments to grow without leaving the district;\n4. Encourage a wide range of transportation options to reduce automobile dependence, foster community\nhealth, and promote a pedestrian-scaled downtown; and\n5. Ensure new development and significant redevelopment is in harmony with Elon's existing small-town\ncharacter.\nC. SUB-DISTRICTS DISTINGUISHED\nBased on its established character, the Downtown District is divided into two different subdistricts: the\nDowntown Core (DTC) and Downtown Periphery (DTP). Each sub-district has its own range of allowable uses (see\nTable 4.2.1: Principal Use Table) and development standards which are set out in this section. The boundaries of\nthe DTC and DTP Districts shall be delineated on the Official Zoning Map.\nD. SUBDISTRICT INTENT\nThe Downtown Core (DTC) sub-district is proposed to preserve and protect existing development within the\narea while at the same time promoting beneficial redevelopment and infill at higher densities and intensities\ncommensurate with an urban core. Mixed-use development is strongly preferred in the DTC area along with\nan overall increase in the number of residential dwelling units generally. Emphasis is placed on use types and\nbuilding configurations that promote and encourage pedestrian activity along the area's sidewalks and public\nspaces. Pedestrian activity is facilitated by the provision of outdoor dining, outdoor display of products,\nstorefront windows on ground floors of buildings, the provision of urban forms of recreational resources like\noutdoor gathering areas and seating, human-scaled building fa\u00e7ade design, and a reduced need for\nautomobile-oriented signage and off-street parking located in front of building entrances.\nThe Downtown Periphery (DTP) sub-district is proposed to allow the current range of land uses and densities\nto continue while at the same time creating opportunities for new development and redevelopment at higher\ndensities and intensities. Mixed-use development is permitted by right in the area. Civic or institutional uses\nare permitted but are expected to serve as community anchors through the provision of high-quality\narchitecture and generous public amenities such as gathering areas, public art, shaded seating, fountains, and\nfacilities for recreation.\n3-9 Page\n"}, {"page": "67", "text": "CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS\nF.

PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe General Mixed Use (GMX) district accommodates mixed-use, institutional, and commercial land uses on lands\nwell-served by public utilities. GMX areas are generally located within the core portions of the Town and along\nprimary transportation corridors. The district is intended to foster functional neighborhoods where Town residents\nand visitors can live, work, shop, and recreate without travelling large distances between differing uses. Buildings are\nbuilt close to the sidewalk and close to one another without suburban-style setbacks and heavy landscaping areas\nbetween them. Mixed and non-residential sites should incorporate public gathering areas that create places for\npeople to congregate and interact. Off-street parking and service areas are located to the sides and rears of buildings\nto help ensure a continuity of building facades along street edges and to avoid areas that are unsafe or undesirable\nfor pedestrians. Buildings may be up to 40 feet in height. The district encourages a fine-grained network of streets\nand pedestrian ways that allow a wide freedom of movement and choices in transportation mode. The district allows\nlive/work dwellings and upper-story residential units but does not permit single-family detached homes or other\nforms of residential unless the land is also located within the High-Density Overlay (HDO) district. The district\naccommodates a wide variety of institutional use types and commercial uses, as well as low-impact industrial uses\nlike flex space and research and development. Buildings should incorporate human-scale design and incorporate\narchitectural aspects along street-facing facades that provide visual interest for pedestrians. All development in the\ndistrict shall be in accordance with the dimensional requirements in this section and the applicable use standards in\nChapter 4: Uses.\nB.

PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Heavy Industrial (HND) district is established to provide industrial and similar high impact uses associated with\nmanufacturing, energy production, and utilities. HND areas are typically found on larger lots in areas proximate to\nmajor roadways and rail access and located away from residential and environmentally sensitive areas. The district is\nintended to provide employment opportunities to Town residents and to help the community maintain a diversified\ntax base. Buildings tend to be large, single-story structures with a utilitarian design and minimal architectural\nembellishment except for the ground-, wall-, and roof-based mechanical equipment and facilities associated with the\nindustrial purpose of the site. Heavy industrial buildings are often surrounded by accessory activity areas such as bulk\noutdoor storage, trailer and container staging areas, typically surrounded by security fencing. District standards are\nintended to prevent the establishment of any use types that would interrupt or interfere with industrial operations.\nThe district accommodates uses and activities with extensive movement of vehicles, materials, and goods, truck\ntraffic and greater potential for adverse environmental and visual impacts on neighboring lands. The district also\nallows limited forms of heavier commercial uses as well as public safety and similar institutional use types, but lighter\ncommercial and residential development are prohibited (except for caretaker quarters as an accessory use). Uses in\nthe industrial district should include adequate setbacks from less intense land uses and methods for mitigating the\nimpacts of noise, lighting, and dust such as extensive landscaping buffers or areas of undisturbed vegetation.

PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Light Industrial (LND) district accommodates a wide range of light industrial and commercial uses on lands well-\nserved by public infrastructure, including water, sewer, and good transportation access. The district provides\nemployment opportunities and contributes to the Town's non-residential tax base. Buildings tend to be one or two-\nstory structures that are smaller than the buildings occupied by heavy industrial uses. Uses allowed in the district do\nnot require large amounts of land or large building areas for operation nor large yard areas for isolation or protection\nfrom adjoining premises or activities. Buildings may be closer to streets and allow up to one row of off-street parking\nspaces between the primary building entrance(s) and the street it faces, though most parking is located to the side or\nrear of the principal building(s). Activities take place almost entirely indoors and result in minimal exterior movement\nof vehicles, materials, and goods in areas around the district. Buildings are situated so as to have minimal visual\nimpacts and are well-screened from adjacent lots in lower intensity zoning districts with perimeter landscaping\nbuffers. Compatibility with surrounding lower intensity uses and lots in lower intensity districts is addressed through\ncommunity character standards applied to commercial and industrial uses. The LND district is suitable for light\nmanufacturing and similar light industrial uses such as assembly, fabrication, processing, distribution, storage, and\nwholesales sale of finished or semi-finished products from previously prepared materials. The district also\naccommodates a wide variety of commercial use types as well as a limited array of institutional uses. Live/work uses\nare also permitted.

PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Neighborhood Residential (NBR) district is established to accommodate single-family detached residential\nneighborhoods within the Town's designated growth areas primarily to the north and west of the Town Center.\nDevelopments are typically served by public or centralized water and sanitary sewer service. Residential uses are\nconfigured at moderate densities of around seven units an acre on relatively small lots though densities may be\nincreased to eight units an acre without need for rezoning in cases where the developer complies with the voluntary\nresidential design guidelines. To foster increased connection, public safety, and ease of travel, residential\ndevelopments include streets, sidewalks, greenways (where identified in Town policy) and open space areas that\nconnect with similar facilities in adjacent neighborhoods. Mass grading is discouraged and there are incentives for\nretention of existing trees. While the district is intended primarily for single-family detached residential uses, it does\nallow a wider variety of residential use types like pocket neighborhoods, multi-family development, or manufactured\nhomes when the land is also located in the High-Density Overlay (HDO) district or the Manufactured Home Overlay\n(MHO) district.

PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Office Institutional (ONI) district is established to accommodate office uses, institutional facilities, educational\nuses, research and development facilities, and mixed uses in high quality single-building and multi-building\ndevelopments. Buildings have a wide range of sizes and heights, based on their function. Land uses typically\nassociated with the office and institutional zoning benefit from a proximate location to one another, and as such\nthis\nOrdinance encourages the establishment of concentrated areas of ONI zoning rather than a highly dispersed pattern.\nBuildings within the ONI district may be either stand-alone single structures on individual lots, or multi-building\ndevelopment established in campus settings. The district also accommodates the ancillary personal services and\ncommercial uses necessary to support the predominant office and institutional development but is not intended as a\nretail district. Retail, personal service, and other commercial uses permitted as accessory to an office or institutional\nuse should not occupy more than ten percent of the floor area and should be configured to minimize visibility from\noff-site areas. The ONI district often serves as a transition area between higher intensity commercial uses and nearby\nlower density single-family residential neighborhoods. Higher intensity institutional uses that support activity after\n5:00PM should be located on collector or arterial streets and should avoid the creation of traffic on residential\nneighborhood streets. Development in the district is subject to design standards to ensure it maintains compatibility\nwith its surroundings.

The district is intended to protect the quiet residential character of these areas in accordance\nwith the Town's adopted policy guidance. The vast majority of SBR lots are around 10,000 square feet in area and\ncontain a single-family detached dwelling located in the center of a landscaped yard. Off-street parking takes place\non a driveway in front of or to the side of the dwelling. Most homes are 20 to 35 feet tall and over 1,200 square feet in\nsize. While the district accommodates single-family detached homes at densities around four units an acre, it also\nallows a density bonus of up to five units an acre for new single-family detached developments that comply with the\nResidential Design Standards of this Ordinance (see Section 7.1.3) or where the landowner or developer agrees to\noffer, and Town Council agrees to accept, voluntary alternative design standards. Manufactured homes on individual\nlots are permitted when also located in the Manufactured Home Overlay (MHO) district.

PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Urban Residential (UBR) district is established to accommodate high-density forms of residential development\nand complimentary uses on lots served by public utilities in the urban portions of Town. The district is intended to\nprovide a wide range of housing choices to Town residents as well as to create sufficient residential densities to\nsupport the Town center and various mixed-use areas throughout the Town's planning jurisdiction. Residential uses\nin the UBR district are well-connected with surrounding areas via connected streets, sidewalks, greenways, and\ntrails. Off-street parking takes place on a driveway in front of or to the side of individual dwellings and in shared\nsurface lots for other residential uses. While the district accommodates residential densities around 14 units an acre,\nit also allows a density bonus of up to 15.5 units an acre for new single-family detached developments that comply\nwith the Residential Design Standards of this Ordinance (see Section 7.1.3) or where the landowner or developer\nagrees to offer, and Town Council agrees to accept, voluntary alternative design standards. Manufactured homes on\nindividual lots are permitted when also located in the Manufactured Home Overlay (MHO) district. A wide variety of\n\"small-lot\" residential developments such as bungalow courts and pocket neighborhoods comprised of single-family\ndetached dwellings are permitted by right. Multi-family and single-family attached development (townhouses) are\nalso permitted, subject to approval of a special use permit (see Section 5.2.21, Special Use Permit). The district\nallows a wide range of institutional uses and low intensity office uses, but most forms of commercial development\nand conservation subdivisions are not permitted.

PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe University (UNV) district is proposed to address the unique needs and conditions associated with large-scale\neducational institutions over fifty acres in area located within the Town's planning area. The district accommodates\ninstitutional, educational, and residential use types along with a wide variety of accessory uses necessary to protect\npublic safety and ensure that the educational and community mission of the district may be fulfilled. Lands designated\nUNV are located within the core of Elon around the Town center and are surrounded by low- and moderate-density\nresidential neighborhoods and downtown. The district is intended to provide locations where students and faculty\nmay\ncongregate in a campus setting. Classrooms, administrative buildings, residence halls, and other buildings share a\ncommon architectural vernacular and a high level of design quality that is consistent with the classic collegiate\ncharacter that has come to define Elon University. Structures are organized around common areas, squares, greens,\nand open spaces that allow a wide variety of pedestrian movements and gathering opportunities throughout the\ncampus area. Utility facilities and maintenance/operational aspects are separated from pedestrian areas and adjacent\nuses and configured to avoid negative impacts on lands outside the district. The district is served by a fine-grained\nstreet and pedestrian network that is well connected to public streets, sidewalks, and greenways in other parts of Town\nand areas beyond, allowing students and residents to move around the campus without the use of a personal\nautomobile. The district regulations are configured to allow for a wide degree of flexibility in building configuration and\nplacement while at the same time providing for an increased focus on land use compatibility along UNV district\nboundaries and UNV lands proximate to adjacent zoning districts. Allowable uses are listed as either Principal or\nAccessory Uses as listed in Table 4.2.1, Principal Use Table or Table 4.5.4, Table of Common Accessory Uses. Use types\nnot identified in either of these tables that were established prior to the establishment of the UNV district designation\nare permitted to remain in accordance with the standards in Chapter 6: Nonconformities. All new development and\nredevelopment in the district shall be consistent with the Town's adopted policy guidance, the dimensional\nrequirements and architectural standards in this section, and any applicable use standards from Chapter 4: Uses.

PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe Village Mixed Use (VMX) district is intended for low intensity, neighborhood-serving commercial and mixed-use\ndevelopment around significant roadway intersections located along the edges of neighborhoods. Non-residential\nbuildings are low-rise, small-scale, with small footprints, and with building heights typically between 20 and 35 feet.\nBuildings are close to the street edge and off-street parking is located to the side or rear of buildings. Development in\nthe district is human-scaled and designed to promote visual interest for pedestrians. Ground-level retail and personal\nservice uses that promote pedestrian activity along the street are highly encouraged. New development in the district\nis located close to the street, provides passers-by with clear views into the building's ground floor, and fosters\nsidewalk dining, outdoor seating, and interaction among pedestrians. The district provides employment, shopping,\npersonal service, and entertainment uses for the benefit of nearby residents in a compact, pedestrian-oriented, and\nwalkable context. The district allows offices, personal services, and small-scale retail and a variety of institutional\nuses. As a means of providing additional housing options, the district allows live/work dwellings and upper story\nresidential over ground-floor non-residential uses. Industrial uses, high density residential uses, and monolithic\nautomobile-oriented development is not permitted. District regulations discourage uses that are too intense or that\ndraw the majority of their patrons from outside the immediate area. All development in the district shall be in\naccordance with the dimensional requirements in this section and the applicable use standards in Chapter 4: Uses.\nB.

CHAPTER\n4.1.1 CHAPTER ORGANIZATION\nA.\nPRINCIPAL USES\n1.\nSection 4.2, Principal uses, sets out the principal use table, or the master listing of principal and\naccessory use types permitted within each district for any individual lot, and contained within each\ndistrict section. Each use listed will identify the use as to whether the is allowed as a use by right\n(indicated by the letter \"P\") or allowed only by approval of a special use permit (indicated by the letter\n\"S\"). Each principal use in the table is listed by use classification and is defined in Chapter 2,\nDefinitions.\n2. Supplemental Use Requirements are addressed in this in Section 4.3, where specific requirements\nhave been identified as integral to the regulation of certain uses that may be less compatible or\nincongruent with the Town's character without such regulations, but do not rise to the level of\nrequiring a special use permit Use standards are listed by alphabetical order, not by the type of use\nclassification.\nB.\nACCESSORY USES\nCertain Accessory Uses may be permitted when the use is clearly incidental to and customarily associated\nwith a specific Principal Use located on the same lot. Permitted Accessory Uses, if applicable, are included\nin the Table of Common Accessory Uses for each district.\nC.\nTEMPORARY USES\nSection 4.6, Temporary Uses, sets out the standards for temporary uses, including the districts where\nallowed, the maximum allowable duration for the temporary use, and any additional standards applicable\nto specific temporary uses or activities.\nD.\nPROHIBITED USES\n1.\nSection 4.4, Prohibited Uses, identifies principal and accessory use types that are prohibited\nthroughout the Town's planning jurisdiction.\n2. Some provisions in this Ordinance like those in Section 8.1.14, Standards for all Special Flood Hazard\nAreas, include prohibitions on certain principal or accessory uses in certain locations or under specific\nconditions. Information on these use prohibitions is located within the particular standards in this\nOrdinance, not this section.\nE.\nUNLISTED USES\nSection 4.7, Unlisted Uses, sets out use type classification details for use by the Planning Director in\ndetermining how to classify and process a proposed principal or accessory use type that is not listed in this\nOrdinance.\n4.1.2 LAND USES DISTINGUISHED\n4-5\nPage\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nChapter 4, Uses, contains all the standards related to the use of land in the Town's planning jurisdiction,\nand is organized by the three types of land uses: principal, accessory, and temporary.\nCELL (2, 1): \nA.\nCELL (2, 2): \nPrincipal uses are the primary, permanent use types proposed on a lot (like a single-family home).\nCELL (3, 1): \nB.\nCELL (3, 2): \nAccessory (or subordinate) uses are accessory uses found on the same lot as a principal use (such as an\naccessory dwelling use associated with a single-family home) and may be a structure or an activity.\nCELL (4, 1): \nC.\nCELL (4, 2): \nTemporary uses are structures or activities permitted for a limited duration of time on a lot (like a portable\nstorage container used for the purposes of storing or moving a household's belongings).\n"}, {"page": "130", "text": "CHAPTER 4: USES\n4.2 PRINCIPAL USES\n4.2.1 PRINCIPAL USE TABLE\nA.\nTABLE STRUCTURE\n1. GENERALLY\na. Individual principal uses in the district use table are organized into a range of use classifications,\nbased upon their characteristics: Residential; Institutional; Commercial; Industrial; and\nAgricultural.\nb.\nUse classifications are more generally described in Section 4.7, Unlisted Uses.\n2. TABLE 4.2.1, PRINCIPAL USE TABLE\nThe Principal Use Table lists use categories and principal use types and indicates whether the principal\nuse type is permitted by right (denoted by the letter \"P\"), permitted with a special use permit (denoted\nby the letter \"S\"), or prohibited within a zoning district (where no letter is provided). Where specific\nrequirements are associated with the use, the section where such requirements are listed is referenced\nin the table.\n3. USE CATEGORIES\na. Each of the five use classifications includes a series of use categories. Use categories are\ngroupings of similar use types that are grouped based on similar purposes or functional\ncharacteristics.\nb. Individual use types listed in the table of principal use types are listed in alphabetical order by use\ncategory.\nC. Use categories are more generally described in Section 4.7.2, Use Categories.\n4. USE STANDARDS\nThe right-most column of the table (Use Standards) includes a reference to the location within the\nLMO of any applicable use standards associated with a particular use type. Unless otherwise stated in\nthe standards, a use standard applies to a particular use regardless of the zoning district where it is\nlocated.\nB.\nUSES PERMITTED BY-RIGHT\n1.\nA \"P\" in a cell of the Principal Use Table indicates that the specific use type is permitted by right in the\ncorresponding zoning district, subject to compliance with any referenced use standards and any other\napplicable standards in this Ordinance.\n2. By right uses require issuance of a zoning compliance permit prior to establishment and may also\nrequire approval of a site plan (see Section 5.2.20, Site Plan).\nC.\nUSES PERMITTED BY SPECIAL USE PERMIT\n1.\nAn \"S\" in a cell of the Principal Use Table indicates that the specific use type is permitted in the\ncorresponding zoning district only upon approval of a special use permit in accordance with Section\n5.2.21, Special Use Permit. Special uses must also comply with any referenced use standards and any\nother applicable standards in this Ordinance.\n2.\nIf a by right use type is lawfully established prior to November 27, 2023, is identified in the principal\nuse table as a special use, the use shall be considered by the Town as a lawfully-established\nnonconforming use. Any revisions to this lawfully established non-conforming use shall require\napproval of a special use permit in accordance with Section 5.2.21, Special Use Permit.\nD.\nUSES ALLOWED IN A PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT\n1.\nAn \"A\" in a cell of the principal use table indicates that the specific use type is allowable in a planned\ndevelopment district, provided the specific use type is included in the list of potential use types in the\nmaster plan or terms and conditions document approved as part of the zoning map amendment\nestablishing the planned development district.\n4-6\nPage\n"}, {"page": "131", "text": "CHAPTER 4: USES\n2. Uses allowed in a PD district are subject to any referenced use standards identified in the principal use\ntable.\n3.\nIf a use type is listed as prohibited in a planned development district in the table, it shall not be included\nin a master plan or terms and conditions document.\nE.\nUSES ALLOWED IN A CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICT\n1.\nConditional Zoning in accordance with Section 5.2.5 allows an applicant to eliminate or restrict uses\nwhich would otherwise be allowed in the proposed zoning district.\n2.\nUses allowed in a Conditional Zoning district are subject to any referenced use standards identified in\nthe principal use table, except that uses normally requiring a Special Use Permit may be approved via\nthe same legislative action approving the proposed Conditional Zoning district.\nF.\nOVERLAY DISTRICT REQUIREMENTS\nEstablished overlay districts apply requirements and standards that may differ from the underlying district\nstandards, including but not limited to the principal uses. Allowable and prohibited uses are included in the\noverlay district sections of this ordinance. Where allowable uses in an overlay district conflict with the\nunderlying district, the overlay allowances shall rule.\nG.\nCOMBINATION OR MULTIPLE PRINCIPAL USES\nDevelopments with combination or multiple principal uses, such as shopping centers, shall:\n1. Incorporate only those use types allowed in the applicable zoning district;\n2.\nComply with all the use standards that apply to each use type in the development; and\n3. Comply with the required method of establishment for each use type identified in Table 4.2.1,\nPrincipal Use Table.\nH.\nCHANGE OF USE\n1.\nSeveral of the provisions in this Ordinance are applied at the time of a change in use. For the purposes\nof this Ordinance, each of the following shall constitute a \"change in use:\"\na. When an existing principal use is replaced by a new principal use that is of a different use\nclassification, use category, or use type designation (see Section 4.7, Unlisted Uses);\nb. Any change in an existing use or development site that triggers the application of a differing set\nof building code requirements, such as the switch from residential requirements to non-\nresidential or combined use requirements;\nC.\nWhen an existing principal use intensifies or expands (with or without a shift in the use type) in a\nmanner that increases the average daily trips associated with the use by 100 percent or more; and\nd.\nIf a combined or multiple principal use is changed in ways where the mixture of use types changes\nor where the relative proportion of floor area devoted to one of the existing use types is modified\nto the extent that the total minimum off-street parking standards for the entire development are\nchanged.\n2. Changes of use type within a Planned Development District do not constitute a change in use provided\nthe new use types are identified in the planned development terms and conditions document. The\naddition of new or unlisted use types within a planned development shall require an amendment to\nthe planned development district.\n3. Addition or conversion of accessory uses or the operation of a temporary use does not constitute a\nchange in principal use; however, such change may require review and appropriate permitting.\n4-7\nPage\n"}, {"page": "132", "text": "CHAPTER 4: USES\nTABLE 4.2.1: PRINCIPAL USE TABLE\n\"A\" = Allowed if included in a PDD master plan or terms and conditions statement\n\"P\" =

The development of\nthese uses cannot be predetermined or controlled by general district\nstandards. Therefore, in addition to the general use zoning districts\nestablished in Chapter 3 of this Ordinance, most districts have\ncorresponding conditional zoning districts which may be established in\naccordance with the provisions of this section. The conditional zoning\ndistrict option allows for the development and use of a particular property,\nsubject to specific standards and the rules, regulations, and conditions\nimposed as part of the legislative decision creating the district, and\nmutually agreed-upon by both the Town and the applicant(s).\nAccordingly, a Conditional Zoning District may be designated upon\napproval by the Town Council of a petition by all property owners or their\nagents to establish such district. All Zoning Districts listed in Chapter 3 of\nthis Ordinance have a parallel conditional version.\nAll descriptions and definitions which apply to a general use zoning district\nalso apply to the corresponding conditional zoning district, and\nmodification of specific general use zoning district provisions may be\npermitted through the legislative decisions of Town Council.\nProperty may be placed in a conditional zoning district only in response to\na petition by the owners or their agents of all of the property proposed to\nbe included in the conditional zoning district.\nConditional zoning districts are not intended to resolve situations which\nwould be more appropriately addressed through the variance process.\nB.\nAPPLICABILITY\nThere are circumstances in which a general zoning district designation\nallowing a particular use would not be appropriate for a particular property\neven though the use itself could, if properly planned, be appropriate for\nthe property consistent with the objectives of this Ordinance and adopted\nComprehensive Land Use Plan, Transportation Plans, Corridor Plans,\nSmall Area Plans, and other land use policy documents. The rezoning\nprocess established in this section provides for the accommodation of\nsuch uses by a reclassification of property into a conditional zoning\ndistrict, subject to additional conditions which ensure compatibility of the\nproposed use with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties. A\nconditional zoning district allows a particular use or uses to be established\nonly in accordance with specified standards and conditions tailored to\neach individual development project. This is a voluntary rezoning\nprocedure that is intended for firm development proposals. It is not\nintended or suited for securing early zoning for tentative proposals that\nmay not be undertaken for some time, but that can be applied to areas\nripe for development, not speculative in nature and reasonably ready to\nproceed.\n5-16\nPage\nCELL (1, 1): \nProcedure\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \nStep\nCELL (2, 2): \nAction\nCELL (3, 1): \n1\nCELL (3, 2): \nPre-Application\nConference\nSee Section 5.3.4, Pre-\nApplication Conference\nCELL (4, 1): \n2\nCELL (4, 2): \nNeighborhood\nInformation Meeting\nSee Section 5.3.5,\nNeighborhood Information\nMeeting\nCELL (5, 1): \n3\nCELL (5, 2): \nFile Application\nSee Section 5.3.6, Application\nFiling\nCELL (6, 1): \n4\nCELL (6, 2): \nCompleteness\nDetermination\nSee Section 5.3.6.G,\nDetermination of Application\nCompleteness\nCELL (7, 1): \n5\nCELL (7, 2): \nStaff Review\nSee Section 5.3.9, Staff\nReview and Action\nIncludes TRC review of\nconceptual site plan\nCELL (8, 1): \nCELL (8, 2): \nCELL (9, 1): \n6\nCELL (9, 2): \nPlanning Board\nReview and\nRecommendation\nSee Section 5.3.11, Public\nHearings and Meetings\nCELL (10, 1): \n7\nCELL (10, 2): \nPublic Hearing\nScheduled\nCELL (11, 1): \n8\nCELL (11, 2): \nPublic Notification\nSee Section 5.3.10, Public\nNotice\nCELL (12, 1): \nCELL (12, 2): \nCELL (13, 1): \n9\nCELL (13, 2): \nTown Council Review\nand Decision\nSee Section 5.3.11, Public\nHearings and Meetings\nCELL (14, 1): \n10\nCELL (14, 2): \nWritten Notice of\nDecision\nSee Section 5.3.13, Written\nNotice of Decision\n"}, {"page": "226", "text": "C.\nCONVERSION PROHIBITED\nApplications filed as a conditional rezoning application shall not be converted to a rezoning application to\nestablish a conventional zoning district during the review process, and shall instead be withdrawn and\nresubmitted as a conventional rezoning application (see Section 5.2.18, Rezoning).\nD.\nPROCEDURE\nThe review and approval process for conditional zoning petitions involves a legislative hearing and legislative\ndecision by the Town Council.

Whether and the extent to which the proposed conditional rezoning is appropriate for its\nproposed location, with particular consideration of the impacts reasonably expected to be generated\nby the development or use of the site;\n3.\nWhether and the extent to which the proposal is consistent with the purposes, goals,\nobjectives, and policies of the Town's ordinances and adopted policy guidance, including, but not\nlimited to, land development plans, comprehensive plans, strategic plans, district plans, small area\nplans, corridor plans, and other land development policy documents. In the event that the proposed\nconditional use district proposal does not agree in part or in total with a relevant plan, the Town\nCouncil may elect to amend that plan for consistency, or may find cause to deny the conditional\ndistrict petition based on a finding of inconsistency with the plan;\n4. Whether an approval of the conditional rezoning is reasonable and in the public interest;\n5.

Conditions imposed\nduring the legislative process for approval of the district may allow a specific use on the subject\nproperty while ruling out other uses that are objectionable to the neighbors in the immediate area or\ndetermined to not be reasonable and in the public interest. Consideration should be given to the\nrelationship of the proposed use to surrounding property, proposed support facilities such as parking\nareas and driveways, pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems, screening and buffer areas, the\ntiming of the development, lighting, noise, hours of operation, pedestrian access, street and right-\nof-way improvements, water and sewer improvements, stormwater drainage, the provision of open\nspace, and other matters that the Town Council may find appropriate. Such conditions for approval\nof the petition may include dedication to the Town or state, as appropriate, of any rights-of-way or\neasements for streets, water, sewer, or other public utilities necessary to serve the proposed\ndevelopment.

Examples of such techniques include avoiding excessive cut and\nfill on sites during construction, building into the slope (if topography permits), terracing the building and site\nimprovements to match topography as close as possible, and leaving natural drainageways and existing vegetation\nundisturbed in every possible instance to utilize these features as tools in managing stormwater and to allow\nnaturally existing buffers to remain in place.\n7.1.1 APPLICABILITY\nA.\nThe standards of this Section shall apply to the following situations:\n1.\nNew construction.\n2.

During the permitting phase of development, prior to any site disturbance, to verify baseline conditions\nof\nthe existing vegetation and ensure that the depiction of existing vegetation on plans submitted for\ndevelopment approval are accurate.\nb. Upon a request for a final plat approval or certificate of occupancy, a site visit shall be performed to verify\ncompliance with the Tree Preservation and Landscaping provisions of this Ordinance.\n7.3.4 REQUIREMENTS AND PROCESS FOR TREE PRESERVATION\nIt is the intent of this Section to create a development design process that informs the design through sensitive\nconsideration of the existing conditions of the site. Natural features unique to the site such as existing tree cover,\ntopography, streams, and other sensitive environments such as wetlands and floodplains should be the drivers of\nthe design concept and layout, as opposed to non-contextual approaches that seek to mold the site to fit a particular\ndesign. With this in mind, the requirements and process for determining the opportunities for tree preservation are\nas follows.\nA.\nExisting trees on sites greater than four (4) acres in size proposed for development, with the exception of\nthose development types and acreage described in Section 7.3.2.B, shall be inventoried on a tree survey certified\nby a registered land surveyor or professional engineer. Such survey shall include the items described in subsections\n1. through 5. below for the project area (defined as the rectangular area(s) encompassing the area being disturbed\nas part of the corresponding development request).\n1. The location of all trees measuring eight inches (8\") or more diameter at breast height (dbh), except\nthat this survey of individual trees may be waived for any areas clearly designated on the survey as\nbeing preserved in an undisturbed condition and adequately protected pursuant to this Section.\n2. The size and species of all trees meeting the standard of subsection A.1., above.\n3. All trees within fifty (50) feet of adjoining property boundaries and rights-of-way.\n4. All trees within a 100-year and/or 500-year floodplain on a site.\n5. Individual trees and stands of trees that the developer may wish to be considered for vegetation\ncredits in meeting landscaping requirements for the development.\nB. Removal of any tree eight inches or greater dbh shall require a zoning compliance permit. Such permit shall be\nrequired prior to any clearing, grading, and/or excavation of a site and is required without regard to other\npermits that may be required for the development proposal, including but not limited to a special use permit,\nfloodplain development permit, or building permit. Approval of a zoning compliance permit for property\nsubject to tree preservation pursuant to this Section shall be contingent upon the submittal of a Tree\nPreservation Plan and subsequent approval by the Technical Review Committee (TRC). The Tree Preservation\nPlan shall include, at a minimum, the following components, using the tree survey as a base layer:\n1. Clear indication of areas where trees will be retained. These areas shall be labeled as \"tree protection\narea - not to be disturbed\". The Plan shall show the proposed location and method for tree protection\nfencing and other such measures intended to prevent damage to the critical root zones of the\nprotected trees. The critical root zone is calculated at one foot of diameter protection from the trunk\nof the tree for every 0.75 inch of trunk diameter at breast height. Tree protection fencing shall be\ninstalled prior to any clearing, tree removal, or grading of a site and shall remain in place through the\ncompletion of all construction activities.\n2. Clear indication of individual trees that will be retained outside of the otherwise undisturbed areas\ndescribed above. The Plan shall show the proposed location and method for tree protection fencing\nand other measures for preventing damage to the critical root zone of the protected tree(s).\n7-28\nPage\n"}, {"page": "358", "text": "CHAPTER 7: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nTree preservation areas identified in accordance with subsections 1. and 2. above shall be required at a rate equal\nto fifteen (15) percent of the project area for single family detached residential development, and twelve (12)\npercent of the project area for all other development types.\na.

The applicant must show evidence\nthat the preserved vegetation meets the standards with regard to size (dbh and height) and species.\n4.\nClear indication of areas where trees identified on the survey pursuant to subsection A. above will be\nremoved. Protected trees may be removed only upon justification to the TRC that essential site\nimprovements cannot be accommodated elsewhere on the site, or that the required maximum tree\nsave percentage for the site has already been met by other trees designated on the survey. These\nareas shall be marked on the Tree Protection Plan, with the reasons why the removal cannot be\navoided, with the essential site improvement causing the removal of the tree(s) also shown on the\nPlan. Such factors such as cost or removal to accommodate nonessential site improvements shall not\nbe valid reasons for the removal of protected trees. Roadways, building sites, and site grading shall be\nplanned to minimize the removal of protected trees. Extensive grading to accommodate \"pad-ready\"\nbuilding sites shall not be considered an essential site improvement. Mitigation for the removal of\nprotected trees shall be in accordance with the following:\na. Mitigation for the removal of protected trees shall occur at a rate of 200 percent (200%). For every\none inch (1\") of trees removed, measured in diameter at breast height, two inches (2\") of\nmitigation trees, measured in caliper inches, shall be planted. Any tree planted for mitigation shall\nmeasure at least two inches (2\") caliper at the time of planting.\nC. The area within tree protection fencing shall remain free of all building materials, stockpiled soil, or other\ndebris. Construction traffic and storage of vehicles and materials shall not take place within the protected\nareas. Fencing shall be erected outside of the dripline of protected trees, but shall in no case be closer than a\ndistance of ten (10) feet from the base of any protected trees.\nD. Should any tree designated for preservation in the Tree Protection Plan die, the owner shall replace it within\n180 days, or as soon as weather permits, with landscaping equal to what would be required by this ordinance.\nE. Additional determinations by the TRC with regard to tree protection may include:\n1.\nThe TRC may recommend to the permit-issuing authority a prescribed modification to parking\nrequirements in order to preserve protected trees on a site.\n2. Where adequate justification is provided by the applicant that an individual tree eligible for protection\nis dead, dying, or greater than fifty percent (50%) damaged or diseased, the TRC may exempt the tree\nfrom protection. The TRC may, in consideration of this request, require a written assessment from a\ncertified arborist or other professional trained in the evaluation of trees.\n7.3.5 PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS\nA.\nLandscaping meeting the requirements of this Section shall be required of all new or expanded parking\nlots. Additionally, these requirements shall apply to existing parking lots in accordance with the following:\n1.\nFor parking lots being refurbished or expanded without building expansion or redevelopment, the\nstandards of this Section shall only apply to the expanded parking area.\n2. Where building expansion or redevelopment occurs, new parking lot landscaping meeting the\nrequirements of this Section shall be installed at the following rate:\na.
