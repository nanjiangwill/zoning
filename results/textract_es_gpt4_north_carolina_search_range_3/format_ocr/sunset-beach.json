PURPOSE\n1.\nDevelopment and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local\nwatersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil\nerosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and\nsediment transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge;\n2.\nThese changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of water-\nborne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to public health\nand safety as well as to the natural environment; and\n3.\nThese effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and\nwell-planned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites.\n4.\nTherefore, the Town of Sunset Beach establishes this set of water quality and\nquantity regulations to manage stormwater runoff and discharge.\nB. APPLICABILITY\n1.\nDevelopment activities including one (1) or more acres of land disturbance\nrequiring an erosion and sediment control plan or CAMA Major Permit shall be\ngoverned by the NC State Stormwater Regulations and the Brunswick County\nStormwater Quality Management and Discharge Control Ordinance and shall\nobtain a State and County stormwater permit.\n2.\nResidential development may not exceed 45% impervious surface of total lot\narea and the total amount of impervious surface must remain below the\nmaximum impervious surface coverage allowed by any other regulatory agency.\nFor the purposes of this section, residential development shall include single-\nfamily and duplex dwellings.\n3.\nIn accord with the requirements of Article 97 of the Town's General Code no\nperson shall cause water to flow from their property onto of over the streets of\nthe town.\nArticle 2: Administration and Procedures\nPage 2-15\n"}, {"page": "30", "text": "Town of Sunset Beach\nUnified Development Ordinance (UDO)\n4.\nWithin the CR-1, CR-2, and AF-1 zoning district, not more than 20% of the total\nlot area may be covered by impervious surfaces.\n5.\nIn addition to the requirements from subsection (1) above, all development and\nredevelopment of single-family or duplex residences greater than 200 square\nfeet must provide appropriate control systems that are any combination of\ninfiltration systems, bio-retention systems, constructed stormwater wetlands,\nsand filters, cisterns, rain gardens, or alternative low impact development\nstormwater management systems designed in accordance with the NC\nDepartment of Environmental Quality's Stormwater Design BMP Manual and any\ntown required design criteria to control and treat the runoff from all surfaces\ngenerated by one and one-half (1 1/2) inches of rainfall or less from all impervious\nsurfaces on site.\n6.\nAll development and redevelopment projects not exempt from the provisions of\nthis article must consider low impact development (LID) practices to analyze the\ninfiltration capacity and natural drainages of the site and develop a system of\ncontrols which mimic the existing natural hydrology.

ESTABLISHMENT OF OVERLAY DISTRICTS\nOverlay zoning is generally used when there is special public interest that does not coincide with\nthe base zoning districts in a particular geographic area. It is a mapped area that may either\nimpose additional restrictions or relax certain provisions of the underlying zoning district. For\nthe purposes of this ordinance, the Town of Sunset Beach, North Carolina has hereby\nestablished the following overlay zoning districts.\nB.

This article establishes standards for the division\nof land and creation of lots. These standards are necessary in order to:\n1.\nEnsure proper legal description, identification, monumentation and recordation\nof real estate boundaries;\n2.\nFurther the orderly layout and appropriate use of the land;\n3.\nProvide safe, convenient, and economic circulation of vehicular traffic;\n4.\nProvide suitable building sites which are readily accessible to emergency\nvehicles;\n5.\nEnsure the proper installation of streets and utilities;\n6.\nHelp conserve and protect the physical and economic resources of the town; and\n7.\nFacilitate adequate provisions for transportation, water, sewerage, and other\npublic requirements.\n4.2\nAPPROVAL\nApproval procedures for the division of land and creation of lots are provided in Article 2 of this\nordinance.\n4.3\nLOT STANDARDS\nA.\nThe following standards shall apply to the creation of all lots within the town's planning\njurisdiction:\n1.\nConformation to Zoning. All lots shall conform to the dimensional requirements\nof the zoning district in which the subdivision is located, including those\nestablished by a conditional zoning request. Lots to be utilized for open space,\nparks, or utilities may be created and reserved for such uses as indicated on the\nfinal plat without compliance with the minimum lot size.\n2.\nFlag lots.

A lot has indirect access if it connects to a public street by means of one or\nmore private roads that were constructed prior to the adoption of this ordinance. In\naddition, if lots are created that are no larger than the buildings located thereon and\naccess to such lots and buildings must be across land owned by a homeowners' or similar\nArticle 4: Subdivision Regulations\nPage 4-1\n"}, {"page": "151", "text": "Town of Sunset Beach\nUnified Development Ordinance (UDO)\nassociation, then this shall also constitute indirect access.

Land disturbing activities\nassociated with a subdivision shall not take place until applicable tree removal or\nstormwater permits have been approved.\nC.\nAs-Built Drawings Required. Whenever a subdivider installs or causes to be installed any\nwater, sewer, or stormwater system as required by this ordinance, the subdivider shall,\nas soon as practicable after installation is complete, and before approval of the\nassociated final plat, furnish the town with a copy of a drawing that shows the exact\nlocation of such infrastructure. Such drawings must be verified as accurate by the Public\nWorks Department or utility service provider.\n4.7\nREQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS\nA. INSTALLATION OF IMPROVEMENTS\n1.\nThe cost of all improvements shall be at the subdivider's expense. All required\nimprovements shall be completed by the subdivider or his or her agents.\nB.

It is the purpose of this Article is to promote public health, safety,\nand general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions\nwithin flood prone areas by provisions designed to:\n1.\nRestrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due\nto water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood\nheights, or velocities.\n2.\nRequire that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses,\nbe protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.\n3.\nControl the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural\nprotective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters.\n4.\nControl filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase\nerosion or flood damage.\n5.\nPrevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert\nflood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\nD.\nObjectives. The objectives of this Article are to:\n1.\nProtect human life and health;\n2.\nMinimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\n3.\nMinimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and\ngenerally undertaken at the expense of the general public;\n4.\nMinimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;\n5.\nMinimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas mains,\nelectric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located\nin flood prone areas;\n6.\nMinimize damage to private and public property due to flooding;\n7.\nMake flood insurance available to the community through the National Flood\nInsurance Program;\n8.\nMaintain the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains;\n9.\nHelp maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development\nof flood prone areas; and\n10.\nEnsure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a Special Flood Hazard\nArticle 5: Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance\nPage 5-1\n"}, {"page": "162", "text": "Town of Sunset Beach\nUnified Development Ordinance (UDO)\nArea.\n5.2\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 5: Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance\nPage 5-2\nCELL (1, 1): \nA.\nCELL (1, 2): \nLands to Which This Article Applies.
