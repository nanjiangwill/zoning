A Special Use Permit is not a personal right but\nis tied to the specific parcel of property for which it is issued.\n(B) The issuance of a Special Use Permit does not relieve the holder of the Special Use\nPermit of the responsibility of obtaining a Building Permit or any other permit or\napproval required by applicable federal, state, and local laws. No use or development\nauthorized by a Special Use Permit may be established until the Special Use Permit has\nbeen recorded and the Zoning Administrator has approved final plans for the\nauthorized development or any phase thereof as conforming to the plans, terms, and\nconditions of the Special Use Permit and all applicable requirements of this Ordinance.\n(C) The Zoning Administrator may approve final plans that reflect minor modifications of the\nSpecial Use Permit's approved site plan.

A non-conforming use is also any use, building,\nstructure or lot which was lawfully created, constructed, etc., under this Ordinance but which\nwas subsequently rendered non-conforming due to circumstances that were not self-created.\nThe basic policy of this Ordinance is to allow the continuation of any non-conforming use and\nthe normal maintenance and repair thereof, and to classify any expanding, altering, changing,\nrebuilding or resuming of a non-conforming use as a special use and to review it to determine\nwhether it will have substantial adverse impact upon adjoining properties, the neighborhood or\nthe community. If, at the discretion of the Board of Adjustment, a proposal to expand or\nimprove a current non-conforming use will have a substantial adverse impact, it will be denied.\nConditions and safeguards may be attached to a request to expand or improve a non-conforming\npermit to require that the non-conforming use be brought into compliance with the regulations\nof this Ordinance or that any potential hazards or problems be mitigated.\nSection 7-6-2 Continuation, Maintenance, and Repair of a Non-Conforming Use\nAllowed without Permit\nThe continuation of a non-conforming use and the normal maintenance and repair thereof is\nallowed without a general or special use approval.

For\nexample, if the owner of a building wants to change its use from one which is not allowed under\nthis Ordinance to one which is allowed pursuant to a Zoning Permit, he may secure a Zoning\nPermit and thus eliminate the non-conforming use. Likewise, approval may be secured under\nthis jurisdiction's Subdivision Regulations to recombine two (2) lots which do not comply with\nthe minimum area regulations for building lots into one (1) lot which does satisfy minimum area\nregulations.\nSection 7-6-4 Special Use Permit Required for Any Proposed Alteration, Expansion,\nChange, Rebuilding or Resumption of a Non-Conforming Use\n(A) The altering, expanding, changing or rebuilding of a non-conforming use is only allowed\npursuant to a Special Use Permit issued by the Board of Adjustment under this article.\nThe terms \"altering, expanding and changing\" shall be strictly construed.\n(B) \"Rebuilding\" means the rebuilding, reconstruction or restoration of any non-conforming\nbuilding or structure which was damaged or partially destroyed by an exercise of power\nof eminent domain or by fire, flood, wind, explosion or other calamity or act of God, if\nthe cost of the rebuilding, reconstruction or restoration will be fifty (50) percent or more\nof the replacement cost of such building or structure as stated in Onslow County tax\nrecords at the time such damage or destruction occurred. If the cost will be less than\nfifty\n(50) percent of the replacement cost, a Special Use Permit must nevertheless be\nobtained from the Board of Adjustment under the procedures of this article but the\nBoard of Adjustment is only required to find that the nature and degree of the non-\nconforming use will not be changed or increased from that which existed prior to the\ndamage or destruction.\n(C) \"Resuming\" means the reusing or reoccupying of a non-conforming building or structure\nwhich was unused or unoccupied for a continuous period of one hundred and eighty\n(180) days or more, or the resuming of a non-conforming use which was abandoned for a\ncontinuous period of one hundred and eighty (180) days or more. To determine if the\nproperty has been used within the 180-day requirement, the applicant shall supply to the\nZoning Administrator evidence of the use occupying the property within that timeframe.\nSuch evidence shall be clear proof that the legal nonconforming use was actively\nutilizing the property for its stated purpose.

The Board of\nAdjustment may consider any relevant factor, but no petition shall be granted unless it complies\nwith the requirements of the section entitled Special Use Permits. If it finds that a petition will\nnot have a substantial adverse impact, the Board of Adjustment may grant a Special Use Permit\nand may impose reasonable conditions and safeguards on the issuance of such permit. If the\nBoard of Adjustment finds that a petition will have a substantial adverse impact, it shall consider:\n(A) The possible detriment or benefit to the owner of the non-conforming use from refusing\nto issue the permit, issuing it but requiring, either wholly or partially, that the non-\nconforming use be brought into compliance, or issuing it as requested;\n(B) The possible detriment or benefit of the owners of adjacent or neighboring properties\nfrom refusing to issue the permit, issuing it but requiring, either wholly or partially, that\nthe non-conforming use be brought into compliance, or issuing it as requested, and;\n(C) The possible detriment or benefit to the public from refusing to issue the permit, issuing\nit but requiring, either wholly or partially, that the non-conforming use be brought into\ncompliance, or issuing it as requested and furthermore consideration of setting a\nprecedent for other areas of the town.\nThe Board of Adjustment may consider any other relevant factors. The Board of Adjustment\nshall not approve a petition which fails to comply with the criteria in this section, unless it finds\nthat the detriment to the owner from denying the permit will be SO great as to prohibit any\nreasonable opportunity to recoup his investment in the non-conforming use while the benefit to\nadjacent and neighboring owners and the public from denying the permit will be minimal. If the\nBoard of Adjustment grants a Special Use Permit, it may impose reasonable conditions and\nsafeguards to mitigate any potential hazards or problems or to bring the non-conforming use into\ncompliance to the extent necessary to protect the rights and interests of adjacent and neighboring\nowners and the public. Conditions and safeguards imposed under this subsection shall not\ninclude requirements for which the Town does not have authority under statute to regulate nor\nrequirements for which the courts have held to be unenforceable if imposed directly by the\nTown, including, without limitation, taxes, impact fees, building design elements within the\nscope of G.S. 160D-702(b), driveway-related improvements in excess of those allowed in G.S.\n136-18(29) and G.S. 160A-307, or other unauthorized limitations on the development or use of\nland.
