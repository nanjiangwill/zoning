The State of North Carolina General Statutes and federal case law upholds the right\nof municipalities to enact appearance standards as part of their Land Use and Development\nCodes. The legal basis for a successful appearance code rests with the establishment of\nstandards, determined by verifiable existing physical characteristics that together establish a\npredominant style or desired effect that defines the community character. To achieve this\nobjective, the Town of Ocean Isle Beach commissioned the town planning board to conduct a\n123 of 156\n3/16/24, 13:15\n"}, {"page": "124", "text": "Ocean Isle Beach, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nthorough comparative analysis of the existing development and determine standards that\nwould represent the prevailing character of the town. These standards were then used to\ndevelop a set of guidelines and growth management regulations that will ensure future\ndevelopment accomplishes the community goals of maintaining Ocean Isle Beach's unique\nfamily coastal community atmosphere. These regulations are intended to protect the public\nwelfare by sustaining and enhancing the market values of existing property while ensuring\nquality development occurs that is in keeping with the Ocean Isle Beach character.\nThe appearance standards require a basic level of site and structural design and are not meant to\nlimit creativity nor create a community where everything looks the same.

Property values for the town have continued to increase over the years. The town\nfeels it prudent to sustain this trend by implementing measures to protect, regulate and\nmaintain the appearance of structures and property in the town's jurisdiction. The purpose\nof this section is to establish landscaping standards that in conjunction with the\nappearance standards section will promote this goal. The use of properly landscaped and\nmaintained areas can reduce the potential incompatibility of adjacent land uses, conserve\nnatural resources and maintain open space, protect established residential\nneighborhoods, and promote and enhance community image and roadway beautification.\nIn order to minimize negative effects between adjacent uses and zoning districts, this\nsection requires that a landscaped buffer area be provided. The separation of land uses\nand the provision of landscaping along public and private rights-of-way through a required\nbuffer is designed to eliminate or minimize potential nuisances, and to enhance\ncommunity image and roadway beautification. Such nuisances may include dirt, litter,\nnoise, lights, signs, unsightly buildings and structures, off-street loading and refuse areas,\nor parking areas. In addition, buffers provide spacing and landscaping to reduce\npotentially adverse impacts of noise, odor or lighting. Landscaping shall be coordinated\nwith all site design elements including building layout, parking, access and signs.\n(2) Application. This section shall apply to landscaping of all new structures or existing\nstructures that undergo renovation or repairs. This shall apply to residential structures\nthat exceed 50 percent of the tax value of the structure and to commercial buildings that\nare enlarged in floor area or impervious area on the site by 25 percent or 2,000 square\nfeet, whichever is less.\n(3) Minimum landscaping requirements.\na. [Buffers.] The provisions of required buffers, as specified in these regulations, are\nminimum standards. The amount of land and type and amount of planting or other\nscreening specified for each buffer requirement are designed to mitigate nuisances or\nincompatibility between adjacent land uses or between a land use and a public road,\nand have been calculated to ensure that they do, in fact, function as \"buffers.\" In those\ninstances where these regulations specify different buffering requirements (e.g., a\n133 of 156\n3/16/24, 13:15\n"}, {"page": "134", "text": "Ocean Isle Beach, NC Code of Ordinances\ndifferent type of buffer), then the more restrictive specific provisions shall govern.\nb.

Design, installation and establishment standards. Location of plants and design of\nlandscaping, including maintenance, shall be according to sound landscape and\nhorticultural principles. The use of native vegetation and other lower maintenance\nlandscape materials is required to promote environmental protection, energy\nefficiency, and water conservation in a manner consistent with the Ocean Isle Beach\nLand-Use Plan.\nd. Site plan required. The developer of a commercial property shall submit a site plan to\nthe town planning department for review and approval.

Shrubs shall be of a species that under average conditions will reach a minimum\nheight of 24 inches within 12 months.\nm. Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA) exemptions.\n1. Area of environmental concern (AEC). Any lot or portion thereof that has been\ndesignated as a CAMA buffer or area of environmental concern (AEC) shall be\nexempt from the landscaping requirements in deferment to the CAMA regulations\nthat apply.\n2. Frontal dunes. Frontal dunes shall be exempt from the landscaping requirements;\nhowever, owners of properties with frontal dunes shall plant approved vegetation\non at least 25 percent of the frontal dune area. Approved vegetation includes, but\nis not limited to, American beach grass (fall/winter planting), sea oats\n(spring/summer planting), seashore elder (spring planting), bitter panicum\n(spring/summer planting), or spartina patens (spring planting)\n3. Point reductions on exempt lots. The required minimum point value shall be\nreduced by the corresponding percentage of the lot that is exempt from these\nrequirements. For example: If a 50-foot 100-foot lot is required to provide a 30-\nfoot buffer, the lot's usable area is reduced by 30 percent (30 X 50/5,000), therefore\nthe required minimum point value would be 25. (36 X 70 percent usable area).\n(4) Required buffers.\na. Buffer defined. A buffer is a specified land area, located parallel to and within the outer\nperimeter of a lot or parcel and extending to the lot or parcel boundary line, together\n136 of 156\n3/16/24, 13:15\n"}, {"page": "137", "text": "Ocean Isle Beach, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nwith the planting and landscaping required on the land. A buffer may also contain, or\nbe required to contain, a barrier such as a berm, fence or wall, or combination thereof,\nwhere such additional screening is necessary to achieve the desired level of buffering\nbetween various land use activities. A buffer is not intended to be commensurate with\nthe term \"yard\" or the term \"stormwater management area.\"\nb. Types of required buffers. There are three types of required buffers that may occur on\nany given development site, as follows:\n1. Street buffers;\n2. Parking lot buffers;\n3. Project boundary buffers.\n4. Indoor and outdoor storage facilities.\nC. Location. Buffers shall be located within the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, parallel\nto and extending to the lot or parcel boundary line. Buffers shall not be located on any\nportion of an existing, dedicated or reserved public or private street or right-of-way.\nd. Planting in easements.\n1. No trees shall be planted in wet retention ponds or drainage maintenance\neasements.\n2. Trees and shrubs shall be installed at least three feet away from the flow line of a\nswale.\n3. Existing trees may remain in dry retention ponds provided that the natural grade is\nundisturbed to the tree line, they are a species adapted to seasonal flooding and\nthe pond is adequately maintained.\n4. Trees may be planted in underground utility easements with town of approval,\nprovided the root structure of the proposed tree is not anticipated to extend more\nthan three feet below the ground. Shrubs may be planted, provided they are only\nwithin the outer three feet of the easement. Where such trees and shrubs are\nplanted, the property owner shall be responsible for replacement of such required\nvegetation if maintenance or other utility requirements required their temporary\nremoval.\n5. The majority of buffer plantings and all structures shall be located outside the\neasements.\n(5) Determination of buffer requirements. To determine the type of buffer required between\ntwo adjacent lots or parcels, or between a lot or parcel and a street, the following\nprocedure shall be followed:\n137 of 156\n3/16/24, 13:15\n"}, {"page": "138", "text": "Ocean Isle Beach, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\na.

Indoor storage facilities.\n1. Minimum width: Ten feet.\n2. Minimum height: Four feet.\n3. Performance standard. A buffer which is ten feet in width and contains screening\nmaterials which at maturity provide semi-opacity from the ground to a height of\nfour feet as well as intermittent visual obstruction from a height of four feet up to a\nheight of 30 feet. Vegetative screening materials within intermittent visual\nobstruction areas shall contain horizontal openings no greater than 20 feet in\nwidth upon the plants' maturity.\nC. Outdoor storage facilities.\n1. Minimum width: Ten feet.\n2. Minimum height: Six feet.\n3. Performance standard. A buffer which is ten feet in width and contains screening\nmaterials which at maturity provide semi-opacity from the ground to a height of six\nfeet, and intermittent visual obstruction from a height of six feet up to a height of\n30 feet. Vegetative screening materials within intermittent visual obstruction areas\nshall contain horizontal openings no greater than 20 feet in width; and vegetative\nscreening materials within semi-opaque areas shall contain horizontal openings no\ngreater than five feet in width upon the plants' maturity.\n(6) Constrained sites.\na. An alternate buffer may be used only where the standard project boundary or street\nbuffer width shown cannot be physically met on the site for one of the following\nreasons.\n1. Redevelopment of an existing site requires a buffer to be added, but the building,\npavement or stormwater facility already exists; or\n2. The site has lost area from an existing buffer due to adjacent road widening; or\n3. It can be shown that the narrowest standard project boundary buffer and street\nbuffer width would occupy more than ten percent of the site area.\nb.
