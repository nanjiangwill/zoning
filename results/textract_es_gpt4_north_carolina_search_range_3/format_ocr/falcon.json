GENERAL ZONING DISTRICT CLASSIFICATIONS\nSECTION 2.1. STATEMENT OF INTENT, PURPOSE AND ZONE\nCHARACTERISTIC\nFor the purpose of this ordinance the areas affected as described herein are\ndivided into the following general classes of districts.\n2.11. Residential Districts.\nResidential districts are composed of certain existing residential areas of the\nTown and certain areas where similar residential development appears likely to\noccur. The regulations for these districts are designed to stabilize and protect the\nessential characteristics of each district by promoting and encouraging a suitable\nenvironment for family life and prohibiting certain activities of a commercial\nor\nindustrial nature. To these ends, development is limited to dwellings which\nprovide homes for the residents plus certain additional uses as schools, parks,\nrecreation facilities and certain other public facilities. This system of classification\nis utilized to optimize orderly development by providing a variety of living\nenvironments based on different levels of permitted population density,\nfacilitating the adequate provision of transportation and other public facilities.\nR40A Residential District. A district designed primarily for single family\ndwelling units including the use of manufactured homes, class A on individual\nlots, with a lot area of forty thousand (40,000) square feet or above.\nR20 Residential District. A district designed primarily for single-family units with\na lot area of 20,000 square feet or above.\nR20A Residential District. A district for traditionally rural use with lots of twenty\nthousand (20,000) square feet or above. The principal use of the land is for low-\ndensity residential including manufacture homes, class A and agricultural\npurposes. These districts are intended to insure that residential development not\nhaving access to public water supplies and dependent upon septic tanks for\nsewage disposal will occur at a sufficiently low density to provide a healthful\nenvironment.\nR15 Residential District. A district designed primarily for single family dwelling\nunits with a lot area of fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet or above.\nR15A Residential District. A district designed primarily for single family\ndwelling units including the use of manufactured homes, class A on individual\nlots, with a lot area of fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet or above.\n3\nTown of Falcon Zoning Ordinance\nAdopted: March 4, 1991\nReprinted w/ Amendments through September 8, 2008\n"}, {"page": "12", "text": "R7.5 Residential District. A district designed primarily for single-family\ndwellings on lots with a lot area of 7,500 square feet of above.\nR6 Residential District. A district designed for a mix of single and multi-family\ndwellings with a typical lot area of 6,000 square feet or above.\n2.12. O&I Office and Institutional District. This district is designed primarily for\nagencies and offices rendering specialized services in the professions, finance,\nreal estate and brokerage as well as the traditional institutional functions both\npublic and private, public assembly, religious and certain cultural and recreational\nactivities and group housing. The uses in this district classification may be\ncharacterized as having no retail or wholesale trade, except as incidental use.\nThe district is normally small and often situated between business and residential\nareas. The regulations are designed for maintaining more compatibility with\nnearby residential districts than would exist with a commercial district.\n2.13. C-1 Local Business District. This district is designed to cater to the\nordinary shopping needs of the immediate neighborhood with emphasis on\nconvenience goods. This district is customarily located adjacent to an arterial\nstreet and generally surrounded by residential areas.\n2.14. C(P) Planned Commercial District. The intent of this district is to assure\nthe grouping of buildings on a parcel of lands as to constitute a harmonious,\nefficient and convenient retail shopping area. To promote the essential design\nfeatures within this district, plan approval is required. Any site plan shall assure\ntraffic safety and the harmonious and beneficial relations between the\ncommercial area and contiguous land.\n2.15. C-3 Heavy Commercial District. This district is designed primarily for a\nwide variety of retail and wholesale business, commercial and contract services,\ncommercial recreation and amusement, public assembly and office uses. Since\nthis district has such a wide selection of uses, it will not be expanded without\nconsideration as to its effects on surrounding lands and is limited to those areas\nof mixed commercial activity which lie adjacent [to] or at the intersection of\narterials and those areas which exhibit a highly mixed composition of\ncommercial land uses.\n2.16 H Industrial District. This district is designed primarily for basic\nmanufacturing and processing industries, all of which normally create a high\ndegree of nuisance and are not generally compatible with residential, or\ncommercial and service uses. The general intent is to encourage the continued\nuse of certain land in the town for heavy industrial purpose. The district is\ncustomarily located on larger tracts of land with good highway and rail access\nbuffered from residential districts by other more compatible uses. Commercial\nactivities are not permitted except those having only limited contact with the\ngeneral public and those not involving the sale of merchandise at retail except\n4\nTown of Falcon Zoning Ordinance\nAdopted: March 4, 1991\nReprinted Amendments through September 8, 2008\n"}, {"page": "13", "text": "for items produced on the premises or for the purpose of serving employees,\nguests and other persons who are within the district with an industrial activity.\n2.17. CD Conservancy District. This district is designed to preserve and\nprotect identifiable natural resources from encroachment. The general intent of\nthe district is to provide protection for such resource areas that will continue to\nprovide limited development potential while preserving existing conditions to the\nextent feasible. Areas to be zoned in this district shall be identifiable as any land\narea deemed desirable for protection from development and may include, but not\nlimited to: swamp, marsh, flood land, poor or very severe soils areas or\nmanaged and unmanaged woodland on USGS (Geological Survey) maps, soil\nmaps prepared by the USDA (Department of Agriculture) Soil Conservation\nService or other appropriate sources.\n2.18.
