The Board of Commissioners recognizes,\nhowever, that due to the particular nature of a tract of land, or the nature of the\nfacilities proposed for installation, or other factors, the underlying objectives of\nthis article may be achieved even though the standards are not adhered to with\nmathematical precision. Therefore, the permit issuing authority is authorized to\npermit minor deviations from these standards whenever it determines that:\n1. The objectives underlying these standards can be met without strict\nadherence to them; and\n2. Because of peculiarities in the applicant's tract of land or the facilities\nproposed it would be unreasonable to require strict adherence to these\nstandards.\nB. Whenever the Permit Issuing Authority approves a deviation from these open\nspace standards pursuant to paragraph (A), the official record of action taken\non the development application shall contain a statement of the reasons for\nallowing the deviation.\n4.07.5 OPEN SPACE LINKAGES\nWhere a trail, natural area or public park is dedicated to or acquired by the Town,\nsuch area may be credited toward the minimum amount of common open space\nrequired.\nTown of Lillington, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nIV-31\n"}, {"page": "84", "text": "4.07.6 NATURAL OPEN SPACE REQUIRED\nA.

A community is made up of both social and physical\nconnections. Connecting uses means making clear pedestrian and\nvehicular pathways between developments. It also means intermingling\ncompatible uses. A strong sense of community, the highly valued \"small\ntown atmosphere,\" depends on having such convenient and easy access\nTown of Lillington, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nIV-44\n"}, {"page": "97", "text": "to a variety of activities and uses. This connection of uses is very\nimportant to the function of a livable, pedestrian-oriented community such\nas the town desires. Because many policies of recent decades have\nresulted in or even required the separation of projects and uses, this all-\nimportant design principle perhaps will require the greatest adjustment in\nhow development occurs.\n2. Connectivity requirements.\na. Individual developments shall be joined together with roads and\ncontinuous sidewalks and paths versus a collection of separate\ndevelopment pods.

Buildings shall be oriented to roads and sidewalks with orientation to\nparking areas being secondary. Buildings and whole developments\nare not isolated from one another with extensive buffers.\nC. Pedestrian and vehicular links shall be linked to parks, schools and\nother public destinations whenever possible.\nd. Sidewalks shall be continuous along public streets. Sidewalks\nshall connect buildings to the public sidewalk and to each other.\nSafe and frequent crossings shall be provided for pedestrians.\nPedestrian connections shall be made to large office\ndevelopments from a nearby hotel. Design sidewalks appropriately\nfor the site and the expected amount of foot traffic. In commercial\nareas where foot traffic is expected, sidewalks should be a\nminimum of ten feet. Sidewalks in residential areas can be four\nfeet. All pathways including but not limited to sidewalks and\ncrosswalks shall meet the minimum American with Disabilities Act\n(ADA) requirements.\nO. Reducing parking impacts.\n1. Generally. A key principle of the town's design vision is to reduce the\nvisual impact of parking. This goal includes reducing the image of the\n\"sea of parking\" one finds along corridors at retail centers and the\n\"garage-scape\" in neighborhoods. Parking is necessary at work, at home,\nand at destinations throughout the town. However, there is no reason why\nit needs to dominate the view.\n2.

The quality of water in drinking water reservoirs and rivers\ncan be affected by human activities including farming, obstruction of highways and\nroads, subdivision development, industrial development and other land disturbing\nactivities. Types of water pollutants resulting from these activities include sediment,\nbacterial contamination, heavy metals, synthetic organic compounds and low-level\nradioactivity.\nTown of Lillington, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nVI-22\n"}, {"page": "154", "text": "A. The intent of the Watershed Protection Overlay Districts is to apply a set of regulations\ninvolving land use and, in some cases, structural best management practices (BMPs)\nthat protect the watersheds by reducing the pollution from future development that\nenters the drinking water supplies. Land use management practices involve minimum\nlot sizes, maximum allowed density and built-upon area restrictions, since built-upon\nareas such as roads, rooftops and driveways are a major source of pollution. Structural\nbest management practices allow for more intensive land uses by providing for\ntemporary detention of stormwater runoff so that pollutants may settle.\n6.03.4 ESTABLISHMENT OF AREA\n6.03.5 DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS\nA.
