It is recognized that certain types of general use zoning\ndistricts would be inappropriate at particular locations in the absence of special conditions.

Conditional Zoning District requests shall be handled as a\nlegislative decision.\n7.15.2 Requirements for Conditional Rezoning Conditions\nAll Conditional rezoning requests must include at least one of the following:\n1) conditions specifying the uses proposed;\n2) any relevant conditions related to how the property may be developed, such as building\nplacement or additional setbacks of buildings, parking or loading areas from property lines,\nadditional landscaping, buffering or berming beyond UDO requirements, more restrictive\nbuilding height limitations, limitations on where site ingress or egress may be located, or\noperational limitations designed to limit impacts on neighboring properties; and/or\n3) a major site plan or for single family residential development, a major subdivision plan.\nFor any rezoning request to the R-M (Mixed Residential) or PUD (Planned Unit Development) districts, as\nwell as any approval requests for Open Space Subdivisions in the R-S (Suburban Residential) district, such\nrequests must be submitted as a Conditional Rezoning request.

No new development is allowed in the buffer, except that water dependent\nstructures, or other structures such as flag poles, signs and security lights, which result in only\ndiminutive increase in impervious area and public works projects such as road crossings and greenways\nmay be allowed where no practicable alternative exists. These activities shall minimize built-upon\nsurface area, direct runoff away from the surface water, and maximize the utilization of BMPs.

Expansions to structures classified as existing development must meet the requirements of\nthese provisions, provided however, the built-upon area of the existing development is not required to\nbe included in the density calculations. In determining expansions to existing development, the\nmaximum permitted additional built-upon area is derived by multiplying the area of the portion of the\nproperty that is not built-upon by the appropriate percent built-upon limitation for the Overlay District\nin which the property is located.\n7-14\nTown of China Grove Unified Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "76", "text": "CHAPTER 7: ZONING DISTRICTS AND PERMITTED USE TABLE\nG.

A building permit issued by the Rowan County Building Inspector pursuant to NCGS 160D-403, 1110\nmay not be revoked because of the running of time on a piece of property for which a site-specific\ndevelopment plan has been approved and the vested right period has not otherwise expired.\nE. The establishment of a vested right on a piece of property for a site-specific plan shall not preclude the\nTown from establishing and enforcing on the property any additional regulations (adopted during the\ntime the vested right was in effect) which are general in nature and applicable to all property subject to\nthe regulations of this Ordinance.\nF. Revocation of any site-specific development plan designation eliminates the vested right established\nby approval of the site-specific development plan designation but does not itself terminate any\nunexpired development permit or approval associated with the plan.\n17-27\nTown of China Grove Unified Development Ordinance\n"}, {"page": "260", "text": "CHAPTER 18:\nDEVELOPMENT PLAN REQUIREMENTS\nSection\n18-1\nTown of China Grove Unified Development Ordinance\nCELL (1, 1): \n18.1\nCELL (1, 2): \nPurpose and Applicability\nCELL (1, 3): \n18-2\nCELL (2, 1): \n18.2\nCELL (2, 2): \nSketch Plans\nCELL (2, 3): \n18-2\nCELL (3, 1): \n18.3\nCELL (3, 2): \nMajor and Minor Subdivisions\nCELL (3, 3): \n18-2\nCELL (4, 1): \n18.4\nCELL (4, 2): \nSubdivision Engineering Drawings\nCELL (4, 3): \n18-3\nCELL (5, 1): \n18.5\nCELL (5, 2): \nFinal Plats\nCELL (5, 3): \n18-4\nCELL (6, 1): \n18.6\nCELL (6, 2): \nMajor, Minor, Conditional Zoning, and Vested Rights Site Plans\nCELL (6, 3): \n18-8\nCELL (7, 1): \n18.7\nCELL (7, 2): \nSite Plan Engineering Drawings\nCELL (7, 3): \n18-9\n"}, {"page": "261", "text": "CHAPTER 18: DEVELOPMENT PLAN REQUIREMENTS\nSection 18.1 Purpose and Applicability\nThe purpose of this chapter is to provide uniform standards for all development plans requiring approval\nby the Town of China Grove in accordance with Chapter 9.
