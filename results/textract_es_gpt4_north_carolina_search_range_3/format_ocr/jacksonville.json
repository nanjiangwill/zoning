The process has its roots in the consideration of a Growth\nManagement Plan and significant updates to zoning, subdivision and other\nordinances and the endorsement of the Clean & Green Jacksonville initiative.\nMany provisions in this Ordinance were adopted by the City Council ahead of the\nconsideration of this complete body because of the changing nature of the City's\ndevelopment, and the desire of the Council to be responsive to development\nchanges.\nThis specific gathered body of work began in 2007 with efforts that sought to\nbenefit from information from Citizens, the development community, real estate\ncommunity and others who regulate building and development. Together many\nhours were spent in debate about what a new Unified Development Ordinance\nshould contain. That also meant making a decision about what Jacksonville should\nlook like in the future.\nOver time, the City Council considered each element of this document after it was\nproposed by professionals, reviewed by the Citizen group and then by the\nJacksonville Planning Advisory Board.\nCity of Jacksonville Unified Development Ordinance\nAdopted April 22, 2014\nPage ii\n"}, {"page":

The City of Jacksonville recognizes the desire and/or\nneed for some citizens to use their residence for limited occupational purposes. The City\nbelieves that the need to protect the integrity of residential areas is of paramount concern and\ntherefore any use of a residential structure for occupational purposes must be found to be\ncompatible, incidental, and in harmony with the residential neighborhood. A \"home\noccupation\", should therefore protect the residential areas from any adverse impacts which\ncould result from the utilization of the residence for occupational purposes by the occupant of\nthe residence.

This section is also intended\nto\nprovide support in identifying instances where a new or unanticipated land use not identified\nin the use table is of such a nature, function, or duration that the impact of allowing it in a\nparticular zoning district is so similar to that of a use type already identified in the use table\nas allowed in the zoning district that allowing the new or unanticipated land use should be\ninterpreted as being consistent with the intent of the zoning district and the use regulations.\n2.\nStructure of this Section\n(a)\nGeneral\nThis section identifies each of the five use classifications in Table 4.1.1, Use Table, and\nincludes a section under each use classification identifying each use category. There\nare \"characteristics\" and \"examples\" subsections under each use category (individual\nuse types are defined in Section 9.4, Definitions).\n(b)\nUse Classifications\nThe use classifications identify broad general classifications of land use and include\nresidential uses, institutional uses, agricultural uses, commercial uses, and industrial\nuses. Use classifications are further broken down into a series of general \"use\ncategories\" and specific \"use types.\"\n(c)\nUse Categories\nThe use categories describe the major sub-groups of the respective use classifications,\nand are based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the\ntype and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services\nare sold or delivered, and site conditions. For example, the Residential Use\nClassification is divided into the Household Living and Group Living use categories. Use\ncategories are further broken down into a series of individual use types.\n(d)\nUse Types\nThe specific use types are included in the respective use category. They identify the\nspecific principal uses that are considered to fall within characteristics identified in the\nuse category. For example, live/work dwellings, single-family detached dwellings,\nduplex dwellings, townhouse, multi-family dwellings, and manufactured homes are use\ntypes in the Household Living Use Category.\n(e)\nPrincipal Use Characteristics and Accessory Uses\nThe \"characteristics\" subsection describes common characteristics of each use\ncategory. Principal uses are assigned to the use category that most closely describes\nthe nature of the principal use. Also listed are examples of common accessory uses\nthat, unless otherwise stated in this Ordinance, are allowed in conjunction with a\nprincipal use.\n(f) Examples\nThe \"examples\" subsection lists common examples of use types included in the\nrespective use category. The names of these sample uses are generic. They are based\non common meanings and not on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a\nuse that calls itself \"wholesale sales,\" but sells mostly to consumers, is included in the\n"}, {"page": "429", "text": "Retail Sales and Service Use Category rather than the Wholesale Sales Use Category.\nThis is because the activity on the site matches the characteristics of the Retail Sales\nand Service Use Category.\n3.\nDevelopments with Multiple Principal Uses\nWhen all principal uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire development\nis assigned to that use category. A development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore, and\nbakery, for example, would be classified in the Retail Sales and Service Use Category because\nall of the development's principal uses are in that use category.\nWhen the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories, each principal\nuse is classified in the applicable use category and each use is allowed subject to applicable\nregulations for that use category and the district where proposed.\nDevelopments with multiple principal uses shall incorporate only those use types allowed in\nthe applicable zoning district.\nDevelopments that contain multiple principal uses that change based on the time of day (e.g.,\na restaurant during the day, and a nightclub in the evening) are allowed, subject to compliance\nwith all standards in this UDO.\n4.\nInterpretation of Unlisted Uses\n(a)\nProcedure for Interpreting Unlisted Uses as Permitted\nThe City Manager or their designee may interpret a particular land use not expressly\nlisted in the use table as allowed in a particular zoning district, in accordance with the\nprocedure in Section 2.3.N, Interpretation, and based on the standards in Section\n9.3.A.4.b, Standards for Interpreting Unlisted Uses as Permitted.\n(b)\nStandards for Interpreting Unlisted Uses as Permitted\nThe City Manager or their designee shall interpret an unlisted land use as permitted in\na particular zoning district only after determining that the nature, function, and duration\nof the use and the impact of allowing it in the zoning district are so similar to those of\na use type or use category allowable in the zoning district that the unlisted land use\nshould be deemed allowable in the same manner as the similar use type or use\ncategory. In making such determination, the City Manager or their designee shall\nconsider the purpose and intent statements in this UDO concerning the zoning district,\nthe character of use types allowable in the district, and all relevant characteristics of\nthe unlisted use, including but not limited to the following:\n(1)\nThe volume and type of sales, retail, wholesale, etc.;\n(2)\nThe size and type of items sold and nature of inventory on the\npremises;\n(3)\nAny processing done on the premises, including assembly,\nmanufacturing, warehousing, shipping, distribution;\n(4)\nAny dangerous, hazardous, toxic, or explosive materials used in the\nprocessing;\n(5)\nThe nature and location of storage and outdoor display of\nmerchandise, whether enclosed, open, inside or outside the principal\nbuilding; predominant types of items stored (such as business\nvehicles, work-in-process, inventory, and merchandise, construction\n"}, {"page": "430", "text": "materials, scrap and junk, and raw materials including liquids and\npowders);\n(6)\nThe type, size, and nature of buildings and structures;\n(7)\nThe number and density of employees and customers per unit area of\nsite in relation to business hours and employment shifts;\n(8)\nTransportation requirements, including the modal split for people and\nfreight, by volume type and characteristic of traffic generation to and\nfrom the site;\n(9)\nTrip purposes and whether trip purposes can be shared by other use\ntypes on the site;\n(10) Parking requirements, turnover and generation, ratio of the number of\nspaces required per unit area or activity;\n(11) The amount and nature of any nuisances generated on the premises,\nincluding but not limited to noise, smoke, odor, glare, vibration,\nradiation, and fumes;\n(12) Any special public utility requirements for serving the proposed use\ntype, including but not limited to water supply, wastewater output,\npre-treatment of wastes and emissions required or recommended, and\nany significant power structures and communications towers or\nfacilities; and\n(13) The impact on adjacent lands created by the proposed use type,\nwhich should not be greater than that of other use types allowed in\nthe zoning district.\n(c)\nEffect of Approval of Unlisted Use\n(1)\nAfter interpreting an unlisted land use as permitted in a particular\nzoning district, the City Manager or their designee shall determine\nwhether the unlisted use is likely to be common or to recur frequently,\nor whether its omission from the use table is likely to lead to public\nuncertainty and confusion. On determining that the unlisted use is\nlikely to be common or would lead to confusion if unlisted, the City\nManager or their designee shall initiate an application for a text\namendment to this UDO to list the use in the use table. Until final\naction is taken on the text amendment application, the City Manager\nor their designee' interpretation shall be binding.\n(2)\nIf after interpreting an unlisted land use as permitted in a particular\nzoning district, the City Manager or their designee determines that the\nunlisted use is of an unusual or transitory nature, and unlikely to recur\nfrequently, the interpretation shall be binding in accordance with\nSection 2.3.N.6, Effect of Interpretation, without further action or\namendment of this UDO.\n(3)\nAppeals of the City Manager or their designee' decision shall be\nsubmitted in accordance with the standards in Section 2.3.0, Appeal.\nB.\nAgricultural Use Classification\n1.\nAgriculture\n(a)\nCharacteristics\nThe Agriculture Use Category is characterized by activities related to the production of\nfield crops, fruits, vegetables, ornamental and flowering plants, and the breeding,\nraising, or keeping of livestock, poultry, swine, and other animals for food or other\n"}, {"page": "431", "text": "marketable products.
