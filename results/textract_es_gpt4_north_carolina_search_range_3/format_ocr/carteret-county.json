NONCONFORMING USES\n1501. Purpose.\nThis ordinance places restrictions on the use and development of land by establishing minimum standards. In many instances, land and improvements were\ndeveloped or proposals for the use of land were initiated prior to the adoption of this ordinance. These uses may not meet the minimum standards contained in this\nordinance because they were developed under no specific standards or under standards which were less restrictive. The board of county commissioners recognizes\nthat the strict application of these standards to such uses may create certain hardships for the property owner. The board also recognizes that these uses may be\nallowed to continue in use in accordance with the spirit of this ordinance, even though not meeting the ordinance standards. Therefore, the uses or situations\ndescribed below are accorded a nonconforming status with all the specific privileges and limitations set forth to govern their existence.\n1502. Nonconforming vacant lots.\nA nonconforming vacant lot is a lot which does not conform to the use regulations of this ordinance for the district in which it is located, either at the effective date\nof this ordinance or as a result of subsequent amendments which may be incorporated in this ordinance. A nonconforming vacant lot may be used for any of the uses\npermitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is located if the use of the lot meets the following standards:\n1502.1. The minimum requirements for front, side and rear yards, height of structures, and unobstructed open space for the particular district must be met.\n1502.2. Duplexes and multifamily dwellings must meet the minimum lot standards for those uses in the particular district in addition to the dimensional\nrequirements listed in section 1502.1.\n1502.3. The lot in question does not abut a lot which could be combined with it to make it conforming.\n1503. Nonconforming occupied lots.\nA nonconforming occupied lot is a lot which contained a structure at the time this ordinance was adopted, but which does not meet the minimum requirements for\nwidth, area, front, side or rear yard, height and unobstructed open space for the district in which it is located. Any structures on this type of lot may be improved or\nexpanded in accordance with the following standards:\n1503.1. Any improvement or expansion of any building on this type of lot must comply with the minimum requirements of the ordinance for front, side and rear\nyard, height and unobstructed open space for the district in which the lot is located, provided any improvement or expansion does not increase the nonconformity.\n1504. Nonconforming open uses of land.\nA nonconforming open use of land is an open use on a lot when the only buildings are incidental and accessory to the principal open use which was in existence\nprior to the adoption of this ordinance and which would not be permitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is located. Uses such as storage yards, used car\nlots, auto wrecking, salvage yards, golf driving ranges, rifle ranges and miniature golf courses are examples of open uses. A legally established nonconforming open use\nof land may be continued but is subject to the following limitations:\n1504.1. A nonconforming open use of land may only be changed to a conforming use; however, it may not later be used for any nonconforming use.\n1504.2. A nonconforming use of land that is discontinued for more than six months may not be reestablished and all subsequent uses of the site must be in\nconformance with the particular district regulations. Any vacancy or nonuse of the land regardless of the intent of the owner or tenant will be considered a\ndiscontinuance for the purposes of this requirement.\n1504.3. A nonconforming open use of land may not be enlarged to cover more land than it occupied when it became nonconforming.\n1505. Nonconforming uses of structures.\nA nonconforming use of a structure is a use in a structure which existed prior to the adoption of this ordinance which would not be permitted by this ordinance in\nthe district in which it is located. This type of use may be continued subject to the following limitations:\n1505.1. A nonconforming use of a structure may be changed to another nonconforming use or to a conforming use. The change of a nonconforming use to another\nnonconforming use must not generate any more automobile or truck traffic, noise, vibration, smoke, dust or fumes than the original nonconforming use.\n1505.2. Once a nonconforming use of a structure has been changed to a conforming use, it will not be allowed to return to any nonconforming use.\n1505.3. Maintenance and repairs which are necessary to keep a structure which houses a nonconforming use in a safe and sound condition are permitted.\n1505.4. A nonconforming use of a structure may be enlarged or extended only into portions of the structure which existed at the time that the use became\nnonconforming and which were designed or arranged to accommodate the use. No structural alterations are allowed to any structure containing a nonconforming use\nexcept for those required by law or an order from the building inspector to ensure the safety of the structure. Existing nonconforming residential uses in a business or\n17 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\n"}, {"page": "18", "text": "Carteret County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nindustrial district may be enlarged or extended as long as no additional dwelling units result from the enlargement or extension and all improvements are completed in\naccordance with the North Carolina Building Codes.\n(Res. of 6-21-21)\n1505.5. A nonconforming use of a structure that is abandoned for more than six months may not be reestablished and all subsequent uses of the structure must be\nin conformance with the particular district regulations.\n1506. - Reconstruction of damaged structures.\nWhen a structure on a nonconforming lot or a structure containing a nonconforming use is damaged by fire, flood, wind, act of God, or condemnation proceedings\nthe structure may be repaired and restored to its original dimensions and conditions provided that not more than 50 percent of its structural value has been damaged.\n1507. Reserved.\n1508. Changes in zoning.\nAny nonconformance created by a change in a zoning classification or district boundary or by a change in the regulations in the ordinance will be regulated by the\nprovisions of this section.\n1600. SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS\n1601. Screening and buffering.\nScreening is used to reduce or hide the visual and noise impacts of non-residential uses on nearby residential and institutional land uses by using trees, shrubs, and\nother plant materials to materially hide the non-residential uses and to muffle the sounds that are generated by them. Buffering is used to reduce conflicts between\nand impacts on, adjoining land uses by separating them with a buffer yard or strip.\n1601.1. General screening requirements. In all cases where a residential use or district abuts any other use or zoning district, screening shall be provided in\naccordance with the requirements of section 1601 and other pertinent provisions of this ordinance when the non-residential property is developed.\nA. When a non-residential use is developed adjacent to a residential or institutional use or district, a vegetative planting area that is at least ten feet wide\nmust be provided to materially screen, as determined by the Planning Director or designee, the principal and accessory structures and uses within the\nsubject property from the view of abutting residential or institutional properties.\nB. When a non-residential use is developed across the street from a residential or institutional use or district, the vegetative planting area shall not be\nrequired in the front yard setback, except for a:\n(1) Parking area or lot with five or more parking spaces;\n(2) Side on corner setback of a corner lot (also known as the secondary front yard setback);\n(3) Outdoor storage;\n(4) Junkyard;\n(5) Mini-warehouse (storage units);\n(6) Boat storage area or facility; and\n(7) Salvage yard.\nFor those exceptions where screening is required in the front yard setback, all screening shall be as close as possible and practical to the non-residential\nuse and extend no more than halfway to the right-of-way, except for any parking area or lot with five or more parking spaces. Such parking area or lot\nscreening in the front yard setback shall use only species that generally do not grow to be taller than three feet.\nC. Lawns and other grassed areas shall not be included in calculating the width of the vegetative planting area. The vegetative planting area must be\ninstalled and be in compliance with the Zoning Ordinance before a Certificate of Occupancy can be granted.\nD. The vegetative planting area shall contain at least two groups of planted materials:\n(1) Group One: At least two off-set rows of evergreen shrubs shall be planted whose trunks are spaced not more than four feet apart at planting\n(measured side-to-side, as well as row-to-row), have a planted height of at least three feet, and are of such type that can be expected to be five feet\nor more in height after three growing seasons. The row that will be planted nearest to the land use being screened shall usually be planted between\nthree and five feet from the land use.\n(2) Group Two: In addition, the vegetative planting area shall contain at least a separate row of shrubs that are dense, low-lying, continuous, and planted\nso as to visually fill-in the low-lying gaps between the trunks of the evergreen shrubs.\nIn addition to the required Group One and Group Two plantings, the developer is encouraged to do more than the minimum and to utilize additional\ngroups and rows of shrubs and/or trees, as appropriate for the land use being screened and the surrounding residential and/or institutional uses.\nE. The intent of these screening requirements is that the Planning Director or designee shall have complete flexibility in approving the placement and\n18 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\n"}, {"page": "19", "text": "Carteret County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nlocation of the Group One and Two plantings so as to materially screen the ground floor of the land use or land uses. Such flexibility shall include\nplacement at the property line, near the use, and all points in-between the use and the property line.\nChain-link and other wire fences on non-residential property cannot be used to provide required screening, even when slat inserts are used.\nSuch screening is not required at access points to the property, such as entrances, exits, driveways, and sidewalks. Screening planted near driveways,\nentrances, and exits intersecting with a roadway shall be planted so that the outside edge of the plantings is no closer than 15 feet to the intersection\nand shall be kept trimmed so that the outside edge of the plantings is no closer than 10 feet to the intersection. If a DOT driveway permit requires a sight\ntriangle at a driveway, entrance, or exit, the portion of any required 15-foot vegetative planting area that would otherwise overlap the sight triangle shall\nbe omitted.\nF. Maintenance of screening. All screening required by this ordinance shall be maintained in a healthy state by the property owner(s) so as to continue its\neffectiveness. Periodic inspections may be made to determine continued effectiveness of the required screening. Any deficiencies, if not addressed to\nthe satisfaction of the Planning Director or designee, shall be treated as a violation of this ordinance.\nAny shrub that is required screening that needs to be replaced due to an unhealthy state or because it has not grown to be five feet tall after three\ngrowing seasons shall be replaced within 30 days of notification in writing by the Planning Director or designee. Any trees that are required screening\nthat need to be replaced due to an unhealthy state shall be replaced within 180 days of notification in writing by the Planning Director or designee. If the\nunhealthy state is caused by a natural disaster (such as a hurricane, extreme drought, forest fire, etc.), the replacement period for shrubs and trees shall\nbe doubled to 60 days and 360 days, respectively.\nThe replacement screening shall be of the same species or of similar effectiveness for screening, as determined by the Planning Director or designee,\nand shall be at least as tall as the two nearest plants or plantings in that group, tier, or row, as appropriate.\nG. When a vegetative planting area is deemed inappropriate by the Planning Director or designee due to site, neighborhood, or other conditions, the\nPlanning Director or designee may allow either a durable masonry wall or privacy fence or any combination of walls, fences, and vegetation that are\ndesigned to be compatible with the character of adjacent properties, as determined by the Planning Director or designee.\nH. Walls and fences. Within residential districts, walls and fences that are required by this ordinance must be at least five feet in height but shall not be\ngreater than eight feet in height, measured from the ground along the common lot line of adjoining properties. Along non-residential zoning district\nboundaries, walls and fences that are required by this ordinance must be at least five feet in height but shall not be greater than ten feet high. Walls and\nfences must be constructed and maintained in a safe and sound condition. Walls and fences near driveways and entrances and exits intersecting with a\nroadway shall be no closer than ten feet to the intersection.\nNo fence or wall taller than three feet (whether required or not) may be located in the front yard setback or the side yard on street right-of-way setback.\nWhen chain-link and other wire fences are installed on a non-residential property, they shall be screened by Group One plantings. Screening of other\ntypes of walls and fences on non-residential property is not required but plantings along them are encouraged, particularly along taller sections and\nlonger stretches.\nI. Screening outdoor storage. Outdoor storage of any material, stocks, or equipment (other than junkyards and salvage yards), whether the outdoor\nstorage is a principal use or an accessory use, on any lot within any district (other than a residential district or use) must be screened from any abutting\nresidential use or district, in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance.\nJ. Screening junkyards and salvage yards. Junkyards and salvage yards must be screened from public view from any public or private street and from any\nabutting lots in accordance with the requirements of section 1601.1 and other pertinent provisions of this ordinance.\nK. Waiver of screening requirements when screening is already provided. There may be cases where the unusual topography or elevation of a site, the size\nof the parcel involved, existing vegetation on the site, or the presence of screening on abutting property would make the strict adherence to the\nordinance serve no useful purpose. In those cases, the Planning Director or designee is empowered to waive the requirements for some or all of the\nscreening, as long as the spirit and intent of the ordinance and the general provisions of this ordinance pertaining to screening are adhered to.\nL. Vegetative requirements along shorelines of sounds, rivers, canals and other water bodies. Except when accessory structures are allowed in rear or side\nyards under other provisions of this ordinance, the minimum rear and side yards for the zoning district in which the lot is located shall remain vegetated\non waterfront lots. The vegetation shall consist of grass, trees, other planted ground cover, or remain in a natural state. Only the sides of the lot abutting\nthe sound, river, canal, or other water body shall comply with this requirement.\nM. Screening and trash receptacles. Dumpsters, trash compactors, and similar trash receptacles, whether located in a residential or non-residential\ndevelopment (other than a receptacle that serves just one single-family or two-family residence on the same premises), shall be enclosed on all four\nsides, except that one of the four sides may have a three-foot wide pass-through opening for persons to access the dumpster without having to open the\ndumpster gate. The trash receptacle shall be oriented so that the opening is visible to the fewest number of residences, whether the residences are on-\nsite or off-site. Three of the sides must be constructed of durable materials that match or complement the principal building. The fourth side shall be an\nopaque gate that latches securely to prevent it from inadvertently opening. The wall and gate shall have a minimum height of eight feet. A chain link\nfence shall not be permitted for the wall or the gate.\n1601.2. General buffering requirements. Buffering is used to reduce conflicts between and impacts on, adjoining land uses by separating them with a grassed buffer\nyard or strip. The developer may substitute a landscaped buffer for the grassed one.\nA. When a non-residential property is developed adjacent to a:\n19 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\n"}, {"page": "20", "text": "Carteret County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(1) Residential or institutional use or district, at least a five-foot wide buffer yard or strip must be provided along all side property lines and at least a 15-\nfoot wide buffer yard or strip must be provided along all rear property lines that abut that residential or institutional use or district.\nThe developer may elect to use a durable masonry wall or privacy fence that is at least eight feet tall and is designed to be compatible with the\ncharacter of adjacent properties. If the materials, height, and design are approved by the Planning Director or designee, the approved wall or fence\nmay be used to substitute for up to 8 feet of the required 15-foot buffer yard or strip.\n(2) Public or private street, at least a 20-foot wide grassed buffer yard or strip must be provided along all property lines that abut or are a part of a public\nor private street.\nB.\nNo fence or wall taller than three feet (whether required or not) may be located in the front yard setback or the side yard on street right-of-way setback.\nThe required buffer yard or strip must be installed and be in compliance with the Zoning Ordinance before a Certificate of Occupancy can be granted.\nC. Maintenance of buffering. Any buffer yard or strip that is required by this ordinance shall be maintained in a healthy state by the property owner(s) so as\nto continue its effectiveness. Periodic inspections may be made to determine continued effectiveness of the required buffering.

These regulations are\nintended to recognize this trend and allow home occupations that are located and conducted in such a manner that the existence of the home occupation is not\ndetectable outside of the dwelling unit or accessory building. The home occupation use shall be clearly subordinate and incidental to the residential use of the\nproperty.\nA. Classes of Home Occupation.\n1. Minor Home Occupations. Home occupations that have little or no impact on the surrounding residential area, such as:\na. Personal home business and professional offices; a service-oriented business use.\nb. Home craft businesses, including (but not limited to) artists, sculptors, and dressmakers.\nC. Instructional services including music, art, dance, voice, and tutoring.\nd.

No more than 600 square feet\nof either an attached garage or detached accessory building, but not both, may be used for the home occupation. Due to its nature, day-care may be\nconducted throughout the residence.\n2. No use shall require either internal or external alterations or involve construction features or use of electrical or mechanical equipment that would\nresult in a lower fire rating of the structure.\n3. Except for drop-off activities, the use may increase vehicular traffic flow and parking by no more than two additional vehicles at a time.\n4. In no way shall the appearance of the structure be altered or the occupation within the residence be conducted in a manner which would cause the\npremises to differ from its residential character either by the use of colors, materials, construction, lighting, signs, or by the emission of sounds,\nnoise, vibration, dust, smell, smoke, glare, electrical interference, or any other hazard or nuisance to any greater extent than experienced in an\naverage residential neighborhood.\n5. No exterior storage, display, use, or activity of any kind related to the home occupation.\n6. There shall be no commodities sold or services rendered that require receipt or delivery of merchandise, goods, or equipment other than by\npassenger motor vehicle, parcel delivery service, or U.S. mail service. No deliveries by tractor/trailer trucks are permitted.\n7.

No signage identifying the minor home occupation is permitted in a residential district.\n3. Retail sales on the premises shall be prohibited, except for products or goods produced or fabricated on the premises as part of the home\noccupation.\n4.

Formerly, Section 3200 had been titled \"Conditional Use Districts.\"\n3201. Purpose.\n3201.1. Conditional zoning district. This ordinance contains regulations which establish zoning districts and assign land uses to one or more of these districts. The\nordinance also provides standards for development which regulate lot size, yards, parking and open space. There are, however, certain circumstances which often arise\nwhen a general zoning district designation would not be appropriate for a certain property, but a specific use or uses permitted under the district would be consistent\nwith the objectives of this ordinance. In order to accommodate this situation, this section establishes the conditional zoning district process.\nThe conditional zoning district process is established to address those situations involving a rezoning when a particular use or uses may be acceptable but the\ngeneral classification which would allow that use would not be acceptable. It allows the board of county commissioners to approve a rezoning proposal for a specific\nuse with reasonable conditions to assure the compatibility of the use with surrounding properties. This is a voluntary procedure which is intended for firm\ndevelopment proposals. It is not intended or suited for securing early zoning for tentative proposals which may not be undertaken for some time.\n(Res. 6-21-21)\n3202. - Application and review process.\nThe following process applies to the conditional zoning district:\n3202.1. Application. Rezoning petitions to establish a conditional zoning district must be submitted to the Carteret County Planning Department and will be\nprocessed in accordance with the procedure for zoning amendments described in Chapter 1300, as well as the provisions of this section. A conditional zoning district\nclassification will be considered only if the application is made by the owner of the property or his/her authorized agent. All applications must include a schematic plan\ndrawn to scale and any supporting text for the ordinance amendment. The applicant should include at least the items listed below: (Amended 10-19-09)\n(Res. 6-21-21)\n.01 A boundary survey showing the total acreage, present zoning classification(s), date, and North arrow;\n66 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\n"}, {"page": "67", "text": "Carteret County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blar\n.02 The owners' names, addresses, and the tax parcel numbers of all abutting properties as shown on the tax records of Carteret County;\n.03 All existing easements, reservations, and rights-of-way and all yards required for the zoning district requested;\n.04 Proposed use of land and structures. For residential uses, this should include the number of units and an outline of the area where the structures will be\nlocated. For non-residential uses, this should include the approximate square footage of all structures and an outline of the area where the structures\nwill be located; and\n.05 Traffic, parking, and circulation plans, showing the proposed locations and arrangement of parking spaces and access points to adjacent streets.\n3202.2. Additional requirements. It may be necessary to request additional information in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding\narea. Therefore, the planning commission and/or board of county commissioners may request additional information as they deem necessary. This information may\ninclude, but is not limited to, the items listed below:\n.01 Proposed screening, including walls, fences, or planting areas as well as treatment of any existing natural features;\n.02 Delineation of areas within the regulatory flood zone, as shown on the official FEMA flood zone maps for Carteret County;\n.03 Existing and proposed topography at 2-foot contour intervals or less;\n.04 Generalized information on the number, height, size, and the location of structures;\n.05 Proposed number and location of signs;\n.06 Proposed phasing, if any, and approximate completion time of the project.\nThe application for [the establishment of] a conditional zoning district must contain information and/or site plans which indicate all of the principal and accessory\nuses which are proposed to be developed on the site. Subsequent to the approval of a conditional zoning district, only those principal and accessory uses indicated on\nthe approved plan may be constructed on the site. Any substantial modifications to an approved plan, including any changes in the permitted principal or accessory\nuses, must comply with the provisions of section 3202.5.\n(Res. 6-21-21)\n3202.3. Review and approval. In considering an application for the establishment of a conditional zoning district, the board of county commissioners may attach\nreasonable and appropriate conditions to the location, nature, and extent of the proposed use. Any conditions should relate to the relationship of the proposed use to\nsurrounding property, proposed support facilities such as parking, screening and buffer areas, the timing of development and other matters that the board may find\nappropriate or the petitioner may propose. The conditions may not include architectural review or controls. The petitioner will have a reasonable opportunity to\nconsider and respond to any such additional requirements prior to final action by the board of county commissioners. If any conditions are included as part of the\nrezoning, the petitioner shall agree in writing to all applicable conditions within 30 (thirty) days of the decision. The conditional zoning district approval will not become\neffective until such written agreement is recorded in the Carteret County Register of Deeds. If the petitioner does not agree to the conditions in writing within 30 (thirty)\ndays following the date of the decision, the conditional zoning district will be deemed null and void.\nIn evaluating an application for the establishment of a conditional zoning district, it is appropriate for the board of county commissioners to consider the following:\n.01 The policies and objectives of the Carteret County Land Use Plan, particularly in relation to the use, proposed site, and surrounding area;\n.02\nThe potential adverse impacts to the surrounding area, of, but not limited, to traffic, storm water drainage, land values, and compatibility of land use\nactivities.\nIn the review and approval of a conditional zoning district, emphasis will be given to evaluation of the characteristics of the specific use proposed in relationship to\nsurrounding properties.\n3202.4. Effect of approval. If an application is approved, the conditional zoning district that is established and all conditions which may have been attached to the\napproval are binding on the property. All subsequent development and use of the property must be in accordance with the approved plan and conditions.\nThe intent of this type of zoning is to provide an alternative procedure for specific development proposals. It is intended that all property be rezoned only in\naccordance with firm plans to develop.\n3202.5. Alterations to an approved conditional zoning district. Changes to approved plans and conditions of development will be treated the same as changes to the\nzoning map and will be processed as an amendment as provided for in section 1300. However, minor changes in the detail of the approved plan which will not alter the\nbasic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property, which will not alter the uses permitted or increase the density of development, and which will not\ndecrease the off-street parking ratio or reduce the yards provided at the boundary of the site may be approved by the planning director without going through the\namendment process. The planning director, at his (her) discretion, may elect not to allow any proposal as a minor change and will, in that event, forward the detailed\napplication for changes to the planning commission and/or board of county commissioners for their consideration.

Flexible planned unit development.\nCertain large parcels may require additional flexibility in design than is allowed under the conditional zoning PUD overlay district standards. This flexibility may be\nnecessary to maximize environmental protection, encourage open space dedication and to group complementary land uses. Parcels containing acceptable acreage\nmay request the flexible PUD. A mix of commercial, single-family and group housing shall be allowed within the flexible PUD tract but the following criteria must be\nmet: (Res. 6-21-21)\n.1 The overall density of single-family and multifamily units shall not exceed 2.9 units per acre for the project's net acreage. The net acreage shall mean the\nentire tract, minus ten percent for necessary infrastructure. Commercial land uses shall not be included within the tract net acreage;\n.2 The total number of units (single-family or multifamily) shall not exceed eight in number for any single designated acre within the project;\n.3 No residential units shall exceed 50' in height. All other structures shall not exceed 60' in height from its finished grade;\n.4 Planned amenities including marinas and drystack boat storage facilities (including repair and maintenance facilities) shall be utilized primarily by the\nresidents within the PUD and only incidentally by transients. None of these facilities shall be permitted adjacent to any surface waters under current\nnomination or designated as outstanding resource waters by the State of North Carolina. Any data which supports the use of these amenities or\nrecreational facilities solely by flexible PUD residents shall be made available to the zoning enforcement officer upon request;\n.5 A centralized water and sewer system shall be provided to serve all the residents or the buildings in the total acreage designated as a flexible PUD;\n.6 A master plan and schedule for future development shall be provided at the time of preliminary approval. Each section or phase of the master plan shall\nbe recorded in Carteret County Register of Deeds after final approval by Carteret County Planning Commission and Carteret County Board of\nCommissioners; and\n.7 Table of permitted and special uses appropriate to other districts shall not apply to the flexible PUD district.\n3206.1. Application for a flexible planned unit development. Application for a project as a flexible PUD shall be submitted and reviewed in accordance with the\nCarteret County Subdivision Regulations. The planning commission shall subsequently make advisory recommendations to the board of county commissioners, which,\nfollowing a public hearing held pursuant to proper notice, shall make the final decision as to whether the application and plat will be approved or disapproved.\nThe following shall be shown on the plat:\n(Amd. of 11-3-04)\n3207. - Conditional planned unit development overlay. (Res. of\n3207.1. The planned unit development district is established to foster the blending of various land uses including, but not limited to, residential, light commercial,\noffice and recreational structures, which would not otherwise be possible under general district requirements. The purpose of this district is to promote economical\nand efficient patterns of land use which are sensitive to natural features and site amenities and allow for the accumulation of large areas of open space with the\nflexibility in design not afforded in other residential zoning districts. The planned unit development district is intended to provide flexibility within the constraints of the\ncounty's land use plan in situations where the owners of the property present a development plan which is found to be in the public interest and which provides\nnecessary urban services and improvements required by this ordinance and the county's policies for growth and development.\nThe planned unit development may focus on resort amenities, such as golf, tennis, swimming, boating, with occasional club buildings and supporting commercial\nestablishments for the PUD residents and their guests. All structures must be similar in design and structure to allow for a blending among land uses. The dedication of\ncommon open space shall be utilized as a tool to create a resort atmosphere as well as enhance the visual character of the development.\n68 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\nCELL (1, 1): \n.1 Proposed primary traffic circulation pattern.\nCELL (1, 2): \n.1 Proposed primary traffic circulation pattern.\na) All 404 wetland areas on the tract.\nb) Proposed means of compliance with division of environmental management stormwater regulations.\nCELL (2, 1): \n.2 Proposed parks, tennis courts, swimming pools, beaches, golf course, boating docks, playgrounds, community buildings, common open space, etc.;\nCELL (2, 2): \n.2 Proposed parks, tennis courts, swimming pools, beaches, golf course, boating docks, playgrounds, community buildings, common open space, etc.;\nCELL (3, 1): \n.3 Proposed means of dedication of common open space areas and facilities, and the organizational arrangements for the ownership, maintenance, and\nCELL (3, 2): \n.3 Proposed means of dedication of common open space areas and facilities, and the organizational arrangements for the ownership, maintenance, and\npreservation of common open space, wetlands and stormwater management facilities;\nCELL (4, 1): \n.4 Delineation of the sections, units or phases to be constructed in progression or sequence in a master plan concept which will be the basis for approval\nCELL (4, 2): \n.4 Delineation of the sections, units or phases to be constructed in progression or sequence in a master plan concept which will be the basis for approval\nsubject to accepted and approved changes by the Carteret County Planning Commission and the Carteret County Board of Commissioners;\nCELL (5, 1): \n.5 When required by the planning department, planning commission, or the board of county commissioners, an environmental impact statement will be\nCELL (5, 2): \n.5 When required by the planning department, planning commission, or the board of county commissioners, an environmental impact statement will be\nsubmitted.

Purpose.\nThis ordinance provides for certain uses to be located by right in certain districts where the uses are compatible with the purpose of the district and with other uses\nto be located in certain districts only by complying with additional development standards to ensure that same compatibility. However, certain uses which are basically\nin keeping with the intent and purposes of the district may have substantial impacts on the surrounding area and should only be allowed after a review of the specific\nproposal.\nIn order to ensure that these uses would be compatible with surrounding development and be in keeping with the purposes of the district in which they are\nproposed to be placed, they are not allowed to be established as a matter of right. They may be established only after a review and approval of a special use permit as\nrequired by this section.\n(Ord. of 12-19-11(7); Res. of 6-21-21)\n3302. Structure.\nUses that require special use permits vary greatly in their size, characteristics, impact on surrounding properties, impact on public facilities, and relationship to the\noverall health, safety, and welfare of the community. Because of this variation, this section establishes two classes of special use permits (\"major\" and \"minor\") that\ngroup the uses together based on their relative size, characteristics, and community impact.\nA. Major special use permit uses are those uses that, by virtue of the size, impact, or relationship to the overall health, safety, and general welfare of the\ncommunity, will be reviewed and approved by the board of county commissioners after a public hearing and recommendation from the Carteret County\n73 of 100\n4/13/24, 12:30\n"}, {"page": "74", "text": "Carteret County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nPlanning Commission. Unless otherwise stated, all special use permit applications will be deemed to be minor special use permit applications.\nB.\nMinor special use permit uses are those uses that, by virtue of their more limited size, impact, or relationship to the overall health, safety, and general\nwelfare of the community, will be reviewed and approved by the planning commission.\n(Ord. of 12-19-11(7))\n3303. Application.\nA request for a major or minor special use permit will be considered only if requested by the owner of the property in question or an authorized agent of the\nproperty owner.

Changes to approved plans and conditions of development require planning commission approval.\nHowever, minor changes (as determined by the planning director) in the detail of the approved plan may be approved by the planning director without going\nthrough the plan amendment process, if the minor changes:\n1. Will not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property;\n2. Will not alter the uses permitted or increase the density of development; and\n3. Will not decrease the off-street parking ratio or reduce the yards provided at the site boundary\nIf the planning director, at his (her) discretion, determines that a proposal is not a minor change, the application for changes shall be forwarded to the planning\ncommission for its consideration.\n(Ord. of 7-19-10(5); Ord. of 12-19-11(7))\n3310. Revocation or termination.\nA. The special use permit shall be subject to revocation when a court has determined that a particular special use permit has been violated. After receipt of the\nfinal judgment and after the party responsible for the violation has had reasonable opportunity to correct the violation but has not, the board of county\ncommissioners or planning commission, whichever granted the original special use permit, will revoke the special use permit.\nSubsequent to the revocation of a special use permit, the special use must cease and the future use of the property must be in conformance with the standards of\nthis ordinance for the district where the property is located.
