No subdivisions of land are permitted for parcels or lots which do not\nmeet the minimum road access requirements in Ch. 151 of this code of ordinances.\n"}, {"page": "17", "text": "(C) Roads that do not meet the requirements of division (A) above, but were recorded prior to 9-11-1978, may be extended only\nto provide access to lots within a subdivision for heirs in accordance with \u00a7 151.23 of this code of ordinances.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 305)\n\u00a7 152.026 ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS AND BOUNDARIES.\n(A) Districts. For the purpose of this chapter, the town and its extraterritorial jurisdiction is hereby divided into the following\ndesignated districts:\n(1) R-1, Low-Density Residential District;\n(2) R-1-U, Single-Family Residential District;\n(3) R-2, General Residential District;\n(4) C-1, Central Business District;\n(5) C-1P, Central Business District with Parking;\n(6) HDO, Heritage District Overlay;\n(7) C-2, General Business District;\n(8) RC, Resort Commercial District;\n(9) G-O, Governmental-Office District;\n(10) M-E, Medical Educational District;\n(11) M-1, Industrial District;\n(12) M-U, Mixed Use District;\n(13) CUD, Conditional Use District; and\n(14) CZD, Civic Zoning District.\n(B) District boundaries. The boundaries of the district enumerated in $152.026 of this chapter are hereby established as shown\non the map entitled \"Official Zoning Map, Town of Banner Elk, North Carolina, and the Area Comprising Its Extraterritorial\nJurisdiction\" adopted by the Town Council and certified by the Town Clerk. Said map and all explanatory matter thereon\naccompanies and is hereby, made a part of this chapter as if fully written herein. Said map shall be retained in the office of the\nTown Clerk and also shall be recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds of the county.\n(C) Interpretation of district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts\nas shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply.\n(1) Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways, streams or rivers,\nstreet right-of-way lines or such lines extended, such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.\n(2) Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be\nsaid boundaries.\n(3) Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets or highways, or\nrights-of-ways of same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance there from as\nindicated on the zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on said\nzoning map.\n(4) Where a district boundary line divides a lot of single ownership, the district requirements for the least restricted portion of\nsuch lot shall be deemed to apply to the whole thereof; provided that, such extensions shall not include any part of such a lot more\nthan 35 feet beyond the district boundary line.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 306)\n\u00a7 152.027 INTENT.\n(A) General. It is the intent of this subchapter that if any use or class of use is not specifically permitted in a district as set forth in\nthe sections below, it shall be prohibited in that district unless similar uses are described in the ordinance. Should an applicant\npetition the town for approval of a use not covered specifically in this chapter, the application may be considered as a conditional\nuse. Factors to be considered to determine if the use is in harmony with the keeping of the public health, safety and welfare of the\ncitizens of the town are the impacts of anticipated amounts of traffic, noise, light, density, vibration, odor and the bearing these may\nhave on adjoining neighbors and the community. The Town Council specifically finds that industrial uses of property, such as\nmanufacturing and other heavy industry, are incompatible with the quiet and peaceful mountain resort and retirement community\nenjoyed by the citizens. The Town Council further finds that high impact uses of property, including, but not limited to, racetracks,\nshooting ranges and other noise emitting activities, are incompatible with the quiet and peaceful community expected and enjoyed\nby the citizens of the town.\n(B) R-1, Low-Density Residential District. The R-1 Low-Density Residential District is established as a district in which the\nprincipal use of land is for single-family dwellings on large parcels of land. It is the intention of these regulations to provide for\nlimited residential development in areas where police and fire protection, protection against flooding by storm water and dangers\nfrom excessive erosion are not possible without excessive costs to the community. It is also the intent to maintain and preserve a\n"}, {"page": "18", "text": "tranquil residential community with the flexibility to accommodate conditional uses compatible with residential use.\n(C) R-1-U, Single-Family Residential District. The R-1-U District is established for developments where the existing pattern of\ndevelopment has been established by a subdivision intended and used principally for single-family dwellings on traditional lots. The\nmore defined urban pattern offers limited use for optional non-residential development and provides justification for a more\nrestrictive residential zone.\n(D) R-2, General Residential District. The R-2 General Residential District is established as a district in which the principal use of\nland is for residential purposes.\n(E) C-1, Central Business District. In order to protect and improve the main shopping area in the town and to discourage uses\nwhich do not require a central location which are not compatible with the function of the area as the primary shopping and office\narea, a Central Business District is hereby established.\n(F) C-2, General Business District. The purpose of this district is to provide for general and commercial activity along major\nthoroughfares and at other convenient points in the area. Regulations are designed to preserve the traffic carrying capacity of the\nstreets and to provide for off-street parking. It is not the intent of this district to encourage extensive strip commercial development,\nrather to provide concentrations of general commercial activities.\n(G) M-E, Medical Educational District. The district is established to provide for the specific circumstances and needs of the\nmedical and educational institutions within the town's jurisdiction. The uses permitted within this district shall be limited to those of a\nmedical and educational nature, and closely related uses supportive of medical and educational institutions.\n(H) C-1P, Central Business District with Parking. The Central Business District with Parking is created to provide an expanded\ncentral commercial area that will maintain the character of the existing C-1 District, but will require that all uses in the district\nconform to the off-street parking requirements of this chapter.\n(I) RC, Resort Commercial District. The Resort Commercial District is established to provide specific areas within the town\njurisdiction where specific and limited resort activities can be developed in a more rural setting. The district will have conditions and\nstandards for uses in the district that will provide protection for any adjacent residential areas while providing a more rural, rustic\nsetting for resort commercial activities.\n(J) M-1, Industrial District. This district is established to provide areas for manufacturing, warehousing and similar uses.\n(K) G-O, Governmental-Office District. The Governmental-Office District includes property owned by governmental entities, such\nas, but not limited to, the town and county and their respective subdivisions. It includes the Town Maintenance Facility; the Tate-\nEvans Park; the Banner Elk Daycare Facility; the Wastewater Treatment Plant; Town Hall; the Police Department; the Banner Elk\nVolunteer Fire Department; professional offices; and any other such properties which may heretofore be designated for similar\nuses.\n(L) Heritage District Overlay. (Boundary descriptions established on 2-7-2005.) The purpose of the Heritage District Overlay is to\nprotect, preserve and encourage the architectural, cultural, village atmosphere and historical significance of the downtown core of\nthe town. Its boundaries shall be defined as established on the official zoning map of the town. As an overlay district, the permitted\nand special uses, as well as dimensional requirements, shall conform to those of the underlying, except where additional\nrequirements are noted herein.\n(M) Mixed Use District. This district is designed to encourage integration of mixed land uses (residential and commercial) to\npromote high density, low impact development of communities with alternatives modes of transportation, such as walking and\nbiking. The commercial and residential uses should compliment each other. The district is intended to promote nodal development\nas opposed to strip development and can be located away from main thoroughfares, if the Town Council agrees that the location is\nconsistent with the vision for the town.\n(N) CUD, Conditional Use District. This district is designed to allow a zoning district with no permitted uses at all; all\ndevelopment is subject to acquiring a special use permit. This can only be established at the property owner's request. The\nlegislative rezoning to apply the CUD is generally done concurrently with the quasi-judicial issuance of a SUP by the Board of\nAdjustment.\n(O) Civic Zoning District. The Civic Zoning District is established to enable property owned by governmental entities, including\nthe town, to operate in a way that is beneficial to the residents of the town and protects the historical integrity of the property while\nsupporting the maintenance of the property. This district is to focus on permissible uses that are compatible with the community\nwith some that are within the broad definition of \"civic use\". This district encourages the consolidation of civic and other public and\ninstitutional uses into a single centralized area convenient to town employees, residents and visitors. Educational, cultural, museum\nand fine arts and low impact business uses are predominate.\n(P) Wellhead Protection Overlay District.

The front setbacks, or any setback\nadjacent to a street or road right-of-way, must provide for sight visibility. (See illustration in \u00a7 152.072 of this chapter.) When natural\nfeatures, including topography and existing trees of significant value to the lot, create a problem for setting a structure, the Board of\nAdjustment shall have the authority, upon request, to grant relief to vary the setbacks in order to reduce land disturbance or\npreserve valuable natural resources.\n(A) Setbacks from roads. All setbacks from adjacent roads or right-of-way shall be measured from the edge of the traveled way\nif no right-of-way exists. However, in no case shall any structure be located closer than 20 feet from the edge of any traveled way,\nexcept as otherwise provided in \u00a7 152.028(B) of this chapter.\n(B) Setbacks from natural features. In order to protect and preserve the valuable natural features of the town's community, the\nBoard of Adjustment, upon request, may authorize a property owner a variance to reduce a required setback. A property owner\nmay make such a request if supporting evidence is provided that a reduced setback can and will preserve a natural feature which\nmay include natural vegetation, a watercourse or a topographic feature. Evidence shall include a site plan which depicts the\nexisting natural features of the site, the location and an elevation of the proposed structures, the setback variance requested and a\nplan which provides protection and safeguards for the natural features of the site. In considering and granting a variance, the Board\nof Adjustment must find that the impact of the reduced setback will enhance and not adversely affect the safety, health and\naesthetics of the adjacent properties and the community.\n(C) Setbacks from streams.\n(1) The following conservation setback requirements shall apply as set forth by the Division of Water Quality and the county:\n(a) Twenty-five feet from the top of bank of streams;\n(b) Thirty feet from the top of bank of any classified trout stream; and\n(c) Fifty feet from the top of bank of streams on commercial properties in C-1, C-1P and C-2 Districts.\n(2) Note: storm water and drainage facilities can encroach into these easements for up to 25% of the easement.\n(D) Transitional Setbacks from M-I Zoning District. In the event any part of a parcel zoned as M-I abuts any parcel zoned as R-1,\nR-1U, or R-2, the minimum setbacks for the side setback of the M-I parcel shall be not less than 35 feet, and the rear setback of\nthe M-I parcel shall be not less than 35 feet.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 5-14-2007; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 306; Res. passed - -2022)\n\u00a7 152.030 LAND DISTURBING ACTIVITIES INVOLVING STEEP SLOPES.\nThe intent of these regulations is to provide special measures for land development activities in areas requiring land disturbance\nof steep and very steep slopes, to facilitate the identification of land areas subject to possible slope failure and to require\ninvestigation and remediation of such conditions, if necessary, when such land is proposed to be developed.\n(A) (1) The following categories of steep slope are hereby established:\n(a) Very steep slopes are slopes steeper than 50%; and\nCELL (1, 1): \nM-E\nCELL (1, 2): \n60%\nCELL (1, 3): \n55%\nCELL (1, 4): \n50%\nCELL (1, 5): \n45%\nCELL (1, 6): \nGeotechnical\nengineer\nrequired\nCELL (2, 1): \nCZD\nCELL (2, 2): \n60% to *90%\nCELL (2, 3): \n55%\nCELL (2, 4): \n50%\nCELL (2, 5): \n45%\nCELL (2, 6): \nGeotechnical\nengineer\nrequired\nCELL (3, 1): \nM-U\nCELL (3, 2): \n70%\nCELL (3, 3): \n65%\nCELL (3, 4): \n60%\nCELL (3, 5): \n55%\nCELL (3, 6): \nGeotechnical\nengineer\nrequired\nCELL (4, 1): \nRC\nCELL (4, 2): \n50%\nCELL (4, 3): \n45%\nCELL (4, 4): \n40%\nCELL (4, 5): \n35%\nCELL (4, 6): \nGeotechnical\nengineer\nrequired\n"}, {"page": "27", "text": "(b) Steep slopes are slopes between 20% and 50%.\n(2) Percentage of average slope is determined by the following method:\nS = 0.0023 LA\nI = Contour intervals of the map in feet, with said intervals being 5 feet or less\nL = Total length of the contour lines within the parcel in feet\nA = Area of the parcel in acres\n0.0023 = The constant that converts square feet into acres\n(3) The above formula for calculating the percentage of average slope is used for $152.028(C) of this chapter; which\ndetermines the amount of impervious surface allowed for percentage of slope. Once the placement of the footprint of a structure\nhas been identified, the height of the building can be determined by the midpoint of each wall of the smallest rectangle that can be\nmade with the entire footprint, to determine a midpoint in the center of that rectangle to be used for a measuring point to determine\nthe height of the building.\n(B) Development requirements for both steep and very steep slopes shall be as follows:\n(1) All stream crossings, culverts and disturbance of riparian zones are to comply with appropriate state and federal\nregulations;\n(2) Should the Zoning Administrator believe that geological hazard indicators are present, at the direction of the Town\nManager, he or she may employ and/or contract with an independent geotechnical engineer to evaluate plans for development, as\nnecessary, with the cost for this technical review to be borne by the person(s) requesting development of the property.

Residential development engenders the need to ensure that areas are provided, either within the development itself\nor in conjunction with the town, where active recreational activities can take place. Active recreation area requirements (ARA) are\nestablished to ensure that town's citizens have adequate open space areas and walking trails to promote good health and a\npositive sense of community.\n(B)\nExemptions. The requirements shall apply to all planned residential developments and major subdivisions, except:\n(1) When a planned development or a subdivision had been approved or had a complete application filed prior to enactment of\nthese regulations; and\n(2) Subdivisions with lots greater than three acres.\n(C) Applicability.\n(1) Every person or organization that subdivides or develops land for residential use shall provide for a recreational facility\nin\naccordance with this section by one of the following methodologies: establish within the development areas suitable for active\nrecreation; provide cash-in-lieu-of payment; or to provide a combination of cash and facility development acceptable to the Town\nCouncil. Should payment in lieu of the provision of onsite ARA be determined to be the preferred method of compliance with this\nchapter, the amount will be determined in accord with division (D) below.\n(2) The amount of land required for ARA shall be based on the acreage of total area in a subdivision or planned residential\ndevelopment. The requirement shall be 15% of the gross square footage of the site.\n(3) Criteria for evaluating suitability of proposed recreation areas within the residential development shall include, but not be\nlimited to the following as determined by the town's Planning Board.\n(a) Unity. The dedicated land shall be a single parcel, except where it is determined that two or more parcels would be in the\npublic interest. The Planning Board may require that the parcels be connected and may also require a path of least 20 feet in width\nin addition to the land requirement. Trails cannot account for more than 25% of the required active recreation area.\n(b) Location. The dedicated land shall be located so as to serve the recreation needs of the residents which are a part of the\nproposed development.\n(c) Physical characteristics. The shape, topography and soils types of the land shall be such as to be usable for active\nrecreation. Ponds and other water features may not be included in computing dedicated land area unless acceptable to the\nPlanning Board. Average slope of ARA shall be under 15%.\n(d) Accessibility. Community access to the Active recreation area shall be provided either by an abutting street or community\ngreenway easement. Such community easement shall be at least 20 feet in width or should connection to town greenway system\nbe possible the easement shall be 30 feet.\n(D) Fees in lieu of providing land as required in division (B)(2) above.A developer may provide funds in the amount of 125% (to\naccount for the cost of recreational equipment) of assessed value, as determined by the county's Tax Assessor, of the land area\nprescribed in division (C)(2) above. The Town Council upon a recommendation from the Planning Board shall determine whether\nfees in lieu of providing ARA is an acceptable solution, or if it can be a combination of fees and land.\n(E) Use of fees. The funds collected from the cash-in-lieu-of-land payments shall be spent only on capital improvements to\ntown-owned recreational facilities or acquisition of new land and facilities, including greenway construction. The expenditure of\nrecreation funds paid by the developer to the town in lieu of providing active recreation area shall be determined by the Town\nCouncil.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 5-14-2007; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 310)\n\u00a7 152.033 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT.\n(A) Purpose. The storm water management regulations of this section shall protect, maintain and enhance the public health,\nsafety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of\nstorm water runoff associated with new development. Proper management of storm water runoff will protect property, control\nstream channel erosion, prevent increased flooding associated with new development, protect floodplains, wetlands, water\nresources, riparian and aquatic ecosystems and otherwise provide for environmentally sound use of the town's natural resources.\nThese regulations create standards for post development levels of run off in addition to construction run off regulation that are\ngoverned by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources as part of the soil erosion control permit. All storm water best\nmanagement practices planned, designed and implemented under the authority of this chapter shall conform to the standards\nadopted by NCDENR in the latest Storm Water Best Management Practices Manual.

Wellhead protection plans allow communities to take charge of\nprotecting the quality of their drinking water by identifying and carefully managing areas that supply groundwater to their public\nwells.\n(3) Regulations of the Division of Water Resources (DWR), under the Department of Environmental Quality require wellhead\nprotection measures for any public water supply wells to be used as a community or non-transient, non-community water system to\nmeet the following requirements:\n(a) The well shall be located on a lot so that the area within 100 feet of the well shall be owned or controlled by the person\nsupplying the water. The supplier of water shall be able to protect the well lot from potential sources of pollution and to construct\nlandscape features for drainage and diversion of pollution.\n"}, {"page": "31", "text": "(b) The minimum horizontal separation between the well and known potential sources of pollution shall be as follows:\n1. One hundred feet from any sanitary sewage disposal system, sewer, or a sewer pipe unless the sewer is constructed of\nwater main materials and joints, in which case the sewer pipe shall be at least 50 feet from the well;\n2. Two hundred feet from a subsurface sanitary sewage treatment and disposal system designed for 3,000 or more gallons\nof wastewater a day flows, unless it is determined that the well water source utilizes a confined aquifer;\n3. Five hundred feet from a septage disposal site;\n4. One hundred feet from buildings, mobile homes, permanent structures, animal houses or lots, or cultivated areas to\nwhich chemicals are applied;\n5. One hundred feet from surface water;\n6. One hundred feet from a chemical or petroleum fuel underground storage tank with secondary containment;\n7. Five hundred feet from a chemical or petroleum fuel underground storage tank without secondary containment;\n8. Five hundred feet from the boundary of a ground water contamination area;\n9. Five hundred feet from a sanitary landfill or non-permitted non-hazardous solid waste disposal site;\n10. One thousand feet from a hazardous waste disposal site or in any location which conflicts with the North Carolina\nHazardous Waste Management Rules cited as 15A NCAC 13A;\n11. Three hundred feet from a cemetery or burial ground; and\n12. One hundred feet from any other potential source of pollution.\n(c) The Department may require greater separation distances or impose other protective measures then necessary to\nprotect the well from pollution; the Department shall consider as follows:\n1. The hazard or health risk associated with the source of pollution;\n2. The proximity of the potential source to the well;\n3. The type of material, facility or circumstance that poses the source or potential source of pollution;\n4. The volume or size of the source or potential source of pollution;\n5. Hydrogeological features of the site which could affect the movement of contaminants to the source water;\n6. The effect which well operation might have on the movement of contamination; and\n7. The feasibility of providing additional separation distances or protective measures.\n(d) The lot shall be graded or sloped so that surface water is diverted away from the wellhead. The lot shall not be subject to\nflooding.\n(e) When the supplier of water is unable to locate water from any other approved source and when an existing well can no\nlonger provide water that meets the requirement of this section, a representative of the division may approve a smaller well lot and\nreduced separation distances for temporary use.\n(4) In addition, communities are encouraged to establish wellhead protection plans, which include the following:\n(a) The formation of a wellhead protection committee to establish and implement the wellhead protection program whose\nrole it is to conduct a potential contaminant source inventory, provide options for the management of the WHP area, seek public\ninput into the creation of the WHP plan, seek approval of the WHP program and to implement the WHP program;\n(b) Delineation of the contributing areas of the water sources;\n(c) Identification of potential contamination sources within the wellhead protection area;\n(d) Develop and implement wellhead protection area management actions to protect the water sources;\n(e) Develop an emergency contingency plan for alternative water supply sources in the event the groundwater supply\nbecomes contaminated and emergency response planning for incidents that may impact water quality;\n(f) Development of a public education program; and\n(g) Conduct new water source planning to insure the protection of new water source locations and to augment current\nsupplies.\n(5) Wellhead protection for public water supply wells is a voluntary program, but water systems across the state are\nencouraged to take the above steps in protecting all groundwater sources. The Public Water Supply Section (PWSS) provides the\nfinal approval for WHP programs. The North Carolina Wellhead Protection Program Coordinator is:\nM.

The town is located in the northwest quadrant of Avery County in the Appalachian Highlands 3,739 feet above\nsea level (Banner Elk Development Plan, 1967). High peaks and rugged ridges surround the town. The town is known for its\nproximity to major ski resort areas and is home to Lees-McRae College. The town has 1,146 customers via 621 connections with an\naverage daily usage of 233,000 gallons per day. The town currently gets its water from four wells and one ground storage tank with\na total storage capacity of 500,000 gallons. Water treatment consists of Sodium Hypochlorite for microbial disinfection,\nPolyphosphate for iron sequestration and Sodium Hydroxide for pH adjustment. The town currently contracts an independent\ncompany for well system operations.\n(C) Planning team. The following people have been designated or volunteered to serve as the Wellhead Protection Committee\n(WPC):\n(D) Responsibilities for the WHP plan.\n(1) The positions responsible for implementing the program are the Town Council. They have accepted the recommendations\nmade in the program by the WPC and the Council has granted the Town Manager, the authority to implement the plan and to\napprove any revisions that may be necessary to obtain approval from the Public Water Supply Section (PWSS).\n(2) The Town Council will begin implementation of the plan immediately following its approval by the PWSS of the North\nCarolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) and will complete implementation within 90 days.\n(E) Needs and goals.\n(1) Long-term goals and visions.\n(a) Provide safe drinking water for all town water customers;\n(b) Approval of the town's wellhead protection program by the Public Water Supply Section of the North Carolina\nDepartment of Environmental Quality; and\n(c) Provide for security of well houses and site property.\n(2) Problems and needs identified.\n(a) To provide protection of the town water resources at present and into the future;\n(b) Educate town water customers on groundwater and how to protect it; and\n(c) Develop an overlay zoning district to add protection and control growth and development within the wellhead protection\narea.\n(F) Delineation of the wellhead protection area.\n(1) Delineation of the wellhead protection areas involves making an inventory of all public water supply (PWS) wells included\nunder the plan and gathering basic information about each well. The most important part of this step is to identify the area that must\nbe managed to reduce the likelihood of contamination of your well, the wellhead protection area (WHPA).\n(2) The modified calculated fixed radius method was used to establish the wellhead protection area for the town. Circular\nwellhead zones were delineated around each of the pumping wells using the following equations:\nAcmax\nQmpw\n=\nW\nAcmax\n=\nThe maximum contributing area, in square miles\nThe maximum permitted daily withdrawal in gallons per minute (based on a\nQmpw\n=\n720-minute per day pumping cycle, although the cycle is typically less than 320\nminutes/day)\nEstimated average recharge rate to the surficial aquifer. In the town area, the\nW\n=\nvalue is estimated to be 600,000 gallons per day per square mile, (Heath and\nJohnson, 2001).\n(3) The radii of circular protection areas (r, in feet) are found by the formula:\nCELL (1, 1): \nName\nCELL (1, 2): \nPosition\nCELL (2, 1): \nRick Owen\nCELL (2, 2): \nTown Manager\nCELL (3, 1): \nEarl Turbyfill\nCELL (3, 2): \nPublic Works Director\nCELL (4, 1): \nHarold Shell\nCELL (4, 2): \nORC, Water Quality Labs\nCELL (5, 1): \nJustin Hodges\nCELL (5, 2): \nWater Resources\nCELL (6, 1): \nBrian Grogan\nCELL (6, 2): \nNC Rural Water Association\n"}, {"page": "33", "text": "r=VA(miles)/n x5,280ft/mile\n(4) Because transmissivity may be directional due to cracks or foliations in the bedrock, the area was doubled for all wells\nexcept well 3. It is assumed that well 3 will have infinite recharge due to the close proximity to the river. The resulting circular\nwellhead protection areas were then modified to account for the terrain and drainage patterns exhibited on a topographical map\nof\nthe area, thus resulting in larger and extended shape of the protection area. The final wellhead protection area consists of two\nseparate areas on each side of the river. Maps of the wellhead protection areas are located in this section.\nTable 1.

Information on\npump rates, depth and date drilled was taken from SDWIS database\n(G) Potential contaminant source inventory. A potential contaminant source (PCS) is any substance or activity that could\nadversely affect the quality of your drinking water supply. The PCS inventory is a complete listing, including mapped locations, of\npast and present land use activities within the wellhead protection area (WHPA) that threaten ground-water quality.\n(1) NC SWAP reports (source water assessment and protection). The source water assessment program (SWAP) information\nis compiled by the Public Water Supply (PWS) Section from available electronics PCS databases with state-wide coverage\nobtained from various state agencies. The SWAP information is an extremely valuable starting point for conducting a PCS\ninventory. However, it is not a comprehensive database of all PCSs. Because it includes only those databases with state-wide\ncoverage that are available to the PWS Section in an electronic format, PCS information specific to the area of interest may not be\nincluded. Databases (both hard copy and electronic) maintained by local, county, state, and federal agencies may contain\ninformation about known PCSs occurring within the WHPAs (such as, areas of pesticide or fertilizer application, pesticide storage\nareas, landfills or dumps, inactive hazardous waste sites, underground storage tanks, above ground storage tanks, areas with\nseptic systems, improperly constructed/abandoned wells, and the like). The NC SWAP report was reviewed by the WPC and the\nsusceptibility for all four wells was ranked by the NC PWS Section as moderate. It is important to understand that a susceptibility\nrating of moderate does not imply poor water quality. Susceptibility is an indication of a water supply's potential to become\ncontaminated by the identified PCSs within the assessment area. The town's SWAP report can be located at the following website:\nhttp://www.ncwater.org/files/swap/SWAP_Reports/0106015_7_2_2015_85_11.pdf\n(2) Pre-sanitary landfills. The landfills that appeared on the waste management pre-sanitary landfill data base were surveyed\nand it was determined by the WPC that no such facilities were within the WHPAs.\n(3) State solid waste facilities. According to the solid waste database, there were no solid waste facilities located in the town's\nWHPAs.\n(4) Underground injection control (UIC). According to the UIC database, there were no UIC facilities located in the town's\nWHPAs.\n(5) Animal operations (swine). It was determined by the WPC that the animal operations which appeared on the database\nwere not within the WHPAs.\n(6) State NPDES permit database. It was determined by the WPC that the state NPDES permits which appeared on the\ndatabase were not within the WHPAs.\n(7) Local database search. The County Emergency Management Director, David Charles Vance (828) 733-8213 was\ncontacted concerning SARA Title III Tier Il facilities that might occur within the WHPA. SARA stands for Superfund Amendments\nand Reauthorization Act of 1986 and is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. The purpose of this tier II\nreporting is to provide state and local officials and the public with specific information on hazardous chemicals present at a given\nfacility during a specific time period.\n(8) PIRF incidents. The PIRF database contains information regarding the release of pollutants into the environment that have\nor are likely to have, impact on the groundwater resources of the state. The initial information regarding these releases is usually\nobtained from concerned citizens or responsible parties, who report the release to the Department of Environmental Quality. After\nan incident is reported, regional office staff investigates the reported incident and enter the results of their investigation into a state-\nwide database. This database contains an inventory of reported incidents from a variety of sources, such as leaking storage tanks,\ntanker spills, animal feedlots, stockpiles, and the like. Substances released into the environment include gasoline and other related\nCELL (1, 1): \nTable 1. Well and Delineation Information\nCELL (1, 2): \nTable 1.

There are two main sources for this\ndata. The Division of Waste Management, underground storage tank section, provided information on the pollution incidents that\nresulted from a leaking underground storage tank. The Division of Water Resources, aquifer protection section provided information\non all other pollution incidents. Two PIRF incidents were identified within the WHPA. A summary of these events is located in this\nsection.\n(9) Septic tanks. The County Health Department is responsible for inspection of all septic tanks in the county. The town\noperates a sanitary sewer system with most homes and businesses located in the WHPA on this system. Any homes and\nbusinesses that are determined to be connected to septic tanks will be given a brochures covering proper maintenance of their\nseptic system and any other educational materials that the town may find to be beneficial.\n(10) Abandoned wells. The town has taken well 4 out of service due to surface water infiltration and properly abandoned in\naccordance with standard #15A NCAC 2C.0110. The town is also looking at ways to encourage property owners to abandon any\nwell no longer being used.\n(11) Windshield survey. Based upon the information found through the database searches, the WPC conducted a windshield\nsurvey of the entire WHPA to identify each potential contamination source (PCS) found and also any other facilities or activities that\nexist within the WHPA. On-site visits were made and additional information was obtained regarding quantity and types of\ncontaminants kept onsite. Table 2 shows the potential contaminant sources identified along with quantities and types of\ncontaminants found at the site. Each potential contaminant site was assigned a code that was used to locate it on the inventory\nmap. The inventory map shows the location of each of the potential contaminant sources within the WHPA. The code given each\nsite is based on the following list:\n(H) Potential contaminant sources.\n(1) For each WHPA, the PCSs were ranked according to the threat each presented to the water supply well or wells. The\nfollowing method was used to rank each PCS in each WHPA:\n(a) Each PCS was assigned to a risk category of higher, moderate, or lower based on information adapted from the EPA\n(1993), and from the Oregon wellhead protection program. Each PCS was assigned a numerical \"category\" score to correspond\nwith the risk category (such as, higher-3, moderate-2, lower-1). For sites with more than one source of potential contamination, the\nsum of the category scores for each potential contaminant was used. Each site of potential contamination was then assigned a\n\"proximity\" score calculated with the following equation:\nProximity score =1-(distance from the well/radius of the WHPA)\n(b) The final PCS ranking was obtained by multiplying the category score by the proximity score for each potential\ncontaminant site. This resulted in a relative ranking of each PCS within a given WHPA based on the threat posed to the water\nsupply well or wells. This risk analysis provided information that was used to determine which water supply wells are at greater risk\nof contamination and which PCSs should be considered first in regards to wellhead protection.

Proper disposal of household hazardous wastes and oils (for example, not disposed of through septic systems, pouring\non ground, or through regular garbage collection);\n2. Proper use and storage of fertilizers and pesticides; and\n3. Proper maintenance of home heating oil tanks and septic systems.\n(4) The town will provide information to each business located within the WHPA on waste handling practices, best\nmanagement practices, standard operating procedures, and waste oil disposal methods which could be employed to reduce the\npotential for ground water contamination. The town will also provide information regarding the North Carolina Division of\nEnvironmental Assistance and Customer Service (DEACS) to each business, industry, and farm located within the WHPA.\nOwners/operators of potential contamination sources will be encouraged to contact the DEACS. DEACS provides free technical\nand other non-regulatory assistance to reduce the amount of waste released into the air and water and on the land. The DEACS\nserves as a central repository for waste reduction and pollution prevention information. The DEACS emphasizes waste reduction\nthrough pollution prevention, encourages companies and government agencies to go beyond compliance, and provides information\nabout the environmental permitting process. This information is provided at no charge to state businesses, industries, government\nagencies, and the general public upon request. For additional information, the DEACS may be contacted at (877) 623-6748.\n(5) Personnel with the town will be educated on wellhead protection and steps they can take to reduce the potential for\ncontamination (such as, information about best management practices, standard operating procedures, waste handling practices,\nand the like). The town will also contact the State Division of Environmental Assistance and Customer Service (DEACS) to\ninvestigate steps that the town can take to reduce the amount of waste released into the air and water and on the land at town\nowned and/or managed facilities.\n(6) Owners of improperly constructed/abandoned wells identified within the WHPA will be provided information regarding the\nthreat posed to the water supply by these wells. Owners of improperly constructed/abandoned wells will be encouraged to have\nthese wells properly abandoned in accordance with the state's well construction standards found at 15A NCAC 2C.0100. If\ninformation exists that a well is improperly constructed or is contributing to the contamination of groundwater, the town will notify\nthe aquifer protection section, Division of Water Resources.\n(7) If an abandoned UST site is found, the town will contact the North Carolina Division of Waste Management, UST Section,\nto determine if a closure report was submitted demonstrating that no soil or groundwater contamination was identified during the\nremoval of UST's. If a closure report was not submitted, the town will notify the UST section of the location of the facility within the\nWHPA and its proximity to a public water supply well.\n(8) The County Solid Waste has a one-time per year hazardous household waste (HHW) program at this time and accepts all\nforms of HHW. Each year the county notifies the residents about the upcoming date for this event and the tow will work to get this\ninformation into all residents and business owners in the WHPA. The County Solid Waste Department phone number is (828) 737-\n5420.\n(9) All residents and businesses in the WHPA of each well with septic tanks and home heating oil tanks will be distributed a\ncopy of the wellhead protection brochure and any other information the town can obtain from county and/or state agencies on\nproper septic tank and heating oil tank maintenance.\n(10) Automotive repair businesses in the wellhead protection areas that produce auto wastes (oils, acids, anti-freeze, and the\nlike) will be provided information on waste handling practices, best management practices, standard operating procedures, and\nwaste oil disposal methods which could be employed to reduce the potential for ground water contamination. They will also be\nprovided with information regarding the North Carolina Division of Environmental Assistance and Customer Service (DEACS).\nOwners/operators of these facilities will be encouraged to contact the DEACS.\n(11) The town owns and maintains a storm water catch basin that will hold 150,000 gallons. The parking lots, roads and\nstreets within the downtown area of the town are tied to this basin.\n(12) For any soil or ground-water contamination incidents discovered within the WHPA, the town will contact the state\nagencies with oversight responsibilities for remediation to determine if remediation efforts are proceeding in a timely fashion and in\naccordance with any schedules established by these agencies. Through this process, the town will bring to the attention of the\nstate agencies with oversight responsibilities for remediation any failures by the responsible parties to comply with required\nmonitoring and corrective action. The town will also notify the state agencies with oversight responsibilities for remediation of the\nlocation of any such facilities within the WHPA and their proximity to public water supply well. The town will also contact the state\nagencies with oversight responsibilities for contamination incidents and notify them of the locations of any sites issued notices of\n\"no-further action\" occurring within the WHPA and will request a review of this assessment.\n(13) (a) The town will notify any individual, industry, business, or government agency installing or planning to install a\nregulated underground storage tank within the town's wellhead protection area of the following regulation: North Carolina\nunderground storage tank (UST) regulation 15A NCAC 2N.0301 stipulates specific siting and secondary containment requirements\n"}, {"page": "37", "text": "for UST systems installed after January 1,1991. The rule is summarized as follows:\n1.\nNo UST system may be installed within 100 feet of a public water supply well or within 50 feet of any other well used for\nhuman consumption.\n2. Secondary containment is required for UST systems within 500 feet of a well serving a public water supply or within 100\nfeet of any other well used for human consumption.\n(b) Violations of this regulation will be reported to the Division of Waste Management, underground storage tank section.\nThe UST Section will also be notified of the location of the facility within the WHPA and its proximity to a public water supply well or\nany other well used for human consumption.\n(c) A regulated UST system is any underground storage tank and associated piping that contains petroleum (including\ngasoline, diesel and used oil) or a hazardous substance as defined by the state rules (15A NCAC 2N). Tanks containing heating oil\nfor use on the premises where stored are not regulated.\n(14) Facilities with an underground buried storage capacity of more than 42,000 gallons of oil, or an aggregate above ground\nstorage capacity greater than 1,320 gallons of oil, or an above ground storage capacity of a single container in excess of 660\ngallons are subject to the oil pollution prevention regulations contained in federal regulations found at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 112. These\nfacilities must prepare and implement a spill prevention control and countermeasures (SPCC) plan. The town should verify the\nstatus of the SPCC plan for each subject facility located within the WHPA. The state statutes require registration of any facilities\nstoring more than 21,000 gallons of petroleum product. Subject facilities not in compliance with these regulations should be notified\nof their regulatory responsibility under this regulation. The team should also notify the Division of Water Quality, groundwater\nsection if such facilities do not promptly come into compliance.\n(J) Contingency plan.\n(1) The primary person responsible for implementing the emergency contingency plan is the Town Manager. The secondary\n(back-up) person responsible for implementation is the Public Works Director.\n(2) Should a major oil or chemical spill occur within the wellhead protection area, appropriate emergency agencies will be\nnotified. The first of these would include the Fire Department and the County Emergency Coordinator.\nFire Department 911\nAvery County Emergency Services\n(828) 733-8213\n(3) Short term; less than 48 hours:\n(a) The town operates one primary water storage tank with a total storage capacity of 500,000 gallons. Its average daily\nusage is approximately 233,000 gallons, so it has the capacity to store enough water for two day's use. If power is lost to the wells,\nthere is one stationary generator for emergency operation of well #3 and one portable generator for well #5. All water customers\nwould be contacted and asked to conserve water until the emergency is over.\n(b) If evidence exists which indicates that a well is contaminated, it will be immediately taken offline by turning off valves. An\nassessment will be made to determine if contamination was the results of an act of vandalism or terrorist and the appropriate\nauthorities would be contacted. Also the well would not be returned to service until it is determined that water quality from the\nimpacted well is in compliance with standards governing public water supplies.\n(4) Long term; greater than 48 hours: if one or more of the town wells were to become contaminated, they would be taken off-\nline by shutting off valves. If it were determined that contaminants had entered the distribution system, residents would be notified\nby radio, TV, newspaper, door-hangers, and the like not to drink the water until further notice.\n(5) Appropriate officials like emergency management the National Guard and any other pertinent personnel would be\ncontacted to aid in supplying water.\n(6) The regional office of the public water supply section would be notified immediately of the situation and asked for\nassistance. Sampling (for example, bacteriological, VOC's, SOC's, and the like) would begin to determine the contaminant involved\nand the extent of contamination. A systematic flushing of the distribution system would begin with follow-up sampling conducted as\nneeded until the system was determined to be free of contamination and in compliance with standards governing public water\nsupplies. After consultation with the Public Water Supply Section, residents would be notified that the town water was once again\nsafe for consumption.\nEmergency Contact Numbers and Additional Resources\nName\nResource\nCELL (1, 1): \nEmergency Contact Numbers and Additional Resources\nCELL (1, 2): \nEmergency Contact Numbers and Additional Resources\nCELL (2, 1): \nName\nCELL (2, 2): \nResource\nCELL (3, 1): \nPrimary person responsible for implementing\nemergency contingency plan\nRick Owen\nWork: 828-898-5398\nHome: 828-387-2466\nCell: 828-387-2466\nCELL (3, 2): \nPrimary person\nTown Manager\nCELL (4, 1): \nSecondary person and other pertinent\npersonnel\nCELL (4, 2): \nSecondary person\n"}, {"page": "38", "text": "Earl Turbyfill\nWork: 828-898-5398\nPublic Works Director\nHome: 828-733-0235\nCell: 828-387-1550\nJustin Hodges\nWork: 828-898-5398\nWater Resource Office\nHome: 828-733-5680\nCell: 828-387-1052\nBraswell Well Drillers\nWell driller\n828-733-2602\nDavid Bissit\nChemical Supplier\n704-577-7884\nGopher Utilities\nControl System\n704-963-9064\nQuality Electric\nElectrical Contractor\n828-898-6251\nCELL (1, 1): \nLocal Resources\nCELL (1, 2): \nEmergency Response\nCELL (2, 1): \nAvery County Health Department\n828-733-1550\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (3, 1): \nCannon Hospital\n828-737-7000\nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (4, 1): \nAvery County Sheriff\n911 or 828-733-5855\nCELL (4, 2): \nCELL (5, 1): \nAvery County Emergency Management\n828-733-8210\nCELL (5, 2): \nCELL (6, 1): \nAvery County Government Offices\n828-733-8201\nCELL (6, 2): \nCELL (1, 1): \nLocal newspaper and television\nCELL (1, 2): \nPublic notification\nCELL (2, 1): \nAvery Journal-Times\n828-733-2448\nCELL (2, 2): \nNewspaper\nCELL (3, 1): \nMountain Television Network\n828-262-0990\nCELL (3, 2): \nTelevision station\nCELL (4, 1): \nPublic Water Supply Section\n1634 Mail Service Center\nRaleigh, NC 27699-1634\n919-715-2853\nCELL (4, 2): \nTechnical assistance regulatory guidance\nCELL (5, 1): \nNC Department of Environmental Quality,\nAsheville Regional Office\n2090 US Hwy 70\nSwannahoa, NC 28778\n828-296-4900\nCELL (5, 2): \nRegional Water Quality Section, Public Water\nSupply Section, UST Section, Aquifer\nProtection Section, Hazardous Waste\nSection Spills, Regulatory information and\ntechnical assistance\nCELL (6, 1): \nDepartment of Transportation\nDistrict Traffic Engineer\nMr. Michael Poe\n1561 Mail Service Center\nRaleigh, North Carolina 27699-1561\nLocal Office: 828-265-5380\nCELL (6, 2): \nEmergency spill notification\nCELL (7, 1): \nNC Army National Guard\nBoone, NC 28560-2817\nCELL (7, 2): \nEmergencies, as available:\nGenerators, 400-gallon water trailers, bottled\nwater, transportation\nCELL (8, 1): \nNC Rural Water Association\nPost Office Box 590\nWelcome, NC 27374\n336-731-6963\nCELL (8, 2): \nTechnical assistance education\nCELL (9, 1): \nNorth Carolina Cooperative Extension Service\nCampus Box 7602\nNorth Carolina State University\nRaleigh, NC 27695-7602\n919-515-2811\nwww.bae.ncsu.edu\nLocal number: 828-264-3061\nCELL (9, 2): \nEducational brochures, publications\n"}, {"page": "39", "text": "(K) Public participation.

The architectural review standards shall hereby be incorporated as a reference to \u00a7\u00a7 152.085 through\n152.090 of this chapter, specifically with regard to illustrations.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 7-13-2015; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 500)\n\u00a7 152.086 SITE ASPECTS.\n(A) Relationship of a building to its site.\n(1) Building design shall be fitted to the natural contours of the site. Natural features of the site, such as rock outcroppings or\nnatural drainage ways shall be preserved.\n(2) On wooded sites, buildings shall be carefully situated to take advantage of the shade and energy conservation provided by\nthe trees.\n(3) The impression of buildings tucked into, rather than superimposed on, the natural landscape shall be created.\n(4) The view of the building from the street and surrounding areas shall be as important as the view available to the buildings\noccupants.\n(5) Buildings shall be located according to the natural characteristics of the site. In hilly terrain, clustering of buildings is\nencouraged as a strategy to avoid destroying sensitive natural areas.\n(6) Buildings shall be designed to harmonize with the existing topography, thereby minimizing land disruption.\n(7) Grading shall be held to a minimum and should complement natural land forms (such as smooth gradations or terracing).\n(8) Use of retaining walls over eight feet in height require design and certification by a state- registered engineer.\n(B) Relationships of the project to adjoining area.\n(1) Building projects shall not be designed as isolated units, but instead shall reflect the context of the adjoining properties.\n(2) Grading shall blend gently with contours of adjacent properties.\n(3) Buildings at the ends of streets, or at street corners, shall serve as visual \"terminals\". Serving to both unify and conclude\nthe architectural statement made on the street.\n(4) Proposed recreation areas or uses shall complement nearby existing uses. The extension of existing parks or recreation\nareas into a proposed development is a highly desirable design feature.\n(5) Buildings or projects located near or adjacent to a greenway shall provide safe and efficient pedestrian connection to that\ngreenway, and also to adjacent properties that might include pedestrian systems in the future.\n(6) Buffer zones shall separate and protect the greenway, while at the same time connect it to the building site.\n(7) Natural drainage patterns shall be preserved where possible. Changing the natural drainage areas will affect the drainage\nonto adjoining areas.\n(8) Innovative building and site design can capitalize on natural drainage ways and transform steep slopes into major site\namenities.\n(9) Design shall ensure that drainage occurs only in areas designed to serve a drainage function. Storm water should not flow\nover sidewalks, paths or streets.\nCELL (1, 1): \nRetail, service or trade business\nCELL (1, 2): \n1 space for each 5,000 sq. ft. of gross floor area\nCELL (2, 1): \nTruck terminals\nCELL (2, 2): \nSufficient space to accommodate the maximum number of\ntrucks to be stored or to be loaded or unloaded at the\nterminal at any one time\nCELL (3, 1): \nWholesale and industrial uses\nCELL (3, 2): \n1 space for each 10,000 sq. ft. of gross floor area\n"}, {"page": "60", "text": "(C) Streetscape.\n(1) Scale is a major factor in creating a sense of community and a sense of place.\n(2) The ratio between the width of the street corridor (as measured between opposing building facades) and the height of the\n\"walls\" of that corridor (the foundation-to-eaves dimension) plays an important role in creating a human scale in the streetscape.\nThe most satisfactory ratio is generally a width that is two or three times the height of the defining walls or edges. If the width\nexceeds the height more than four times the sense of enclosure is diminished.\n(3) The town shall be focused on people rather than on vehicles. Streets shall be connections not separations.\n(4) Reference \"zones\" of \u00a7 6.3.1 of the Architectural Review Guidelines for explanation of zones and transition areas that shall\nbe addressed in the design of new streets.\nSubdivision in zones to experience transitions\n(5) Especially in the downtown area, and Heritage District Overlay, building faces shall have adequate setback from the street\nedge to allow for sidewalks where people may walk leisurely around meeting places. Public spaces between buildings (including\nroom for planting and street furniture) provide places for the pedestrian to rest and relax.\n(6) Between sidewalk and street, there shall be enough room to accommodate the planting of trees and shrubs (see \u00a7\u00a7\n152.130 through 152.137 and 152.150 through 152.170 of this chapter). The street will be enclosed, pedestrians will be separated\nfrom the cars and the view will be framed.\n(7) Street furniture should complement the overall site and landscape design. It shall reflect the natural mountain character of\nthe town, such as the use of wood and stone for benches, trash receptacles and the like.\n(D) Streets.\n(1) Difficult topography shall be avoided when locating and designing roads. For instance, roads are best placed along the\ncontours of a site if the site is hilly or steep. This minimizes fuel consumption and noise in automobiles and provides a more\ncomfortable access for pedestrians and bicycle riders. Consideration shall also be given to fire protection and emergency vehicles\nin order to facilitate access to any structure in case of any emergency.\n(2) Roadways shall focus attention on interesting views and should not interfere with natural drainage patterns.\n(3) The town uses the state's Department of Transportation Subdivision Roads Minimum Construction Standards to suggest\nparameters for new streets. These standards may need to be adjusted, especially in areas of difficult topography with steep slopes.\n(4) The site plan should incorporate a hierarchy of roadways and walkways that provide for safe, smooth and pleasant\nmovement of people and vehicles. Special attention shall be paid to points at which pedestrian, bicycle and automobile movements\nare in conflict. Clearly marked crosswalks or routing of pedestrian paths away from main automobile traffic areas can reduce\nhazards in these areas.\n(5) Whenever there is a design choice between access from the development to a street of a higher classification and access\nto a street of a lower classification, access should be to the street of lower classification.\n(6) On large streets, landscaped median islands are encouraged and crosswalks shall be included.\n(7) Trees, shrubs and other plants shall be planted along the streets in accordance with $$152.130 through 152.137 and\n152.150 through 152.170 of this chapter.\n(E) Sidewalks.\n(1) Building sites shall accommodate pedestrians and shall be centered around pedestrian traffic rather than vehicular traffic.\n(2) Access must be safe and convenient within a site. Sidewalks must be clearly separated from driving areas and must\nconnect buildings to each other, to parking areas and to adjacent pedestrian paths.\n(3) Handicapped accessibility along walkways at street/driveway intersections shall be provided whenever possible, per State\nBuilding Code specifications.\n(4) Sidewalk construction standards (including curb and gutter) shall follow the state'sDepartment of Transportation\nSubdivision Roads Minimum Construction Standards.\n(5) Walkways or sidewalks shall be provided along all public streets for commercial developments. Where intersections occur,\n"}, {"page": "61", "text": "pedestrian walkways shall be clearly marked with paint or contrasting surface material.\n(6) Sidewalks shall be designed to match the Town of Banner Elk Pedestrian Plan. Should it prove impractical or infeasible to\nconstruct on the property in question, then an equitable fee in lieu shall be paid to the Town of Banner Elk to be used in other areas\nof the Town's Pedestrian Plan. The fee shall be calculated by the linear footage of road frontage where the sidewalk should have\nbeen placed and the current rate to construct that amount of sidewalk shall be determined adequate by the Board of Adjustment.\n(7) The separation of sidewalks from the roadway for pedestrians safety will be achieved by:\n(a) Curbside planting strips;\n(b) Depressing or raising the walkway in relation to street level; and\n(c) Providing parking adjacent to the walkway (on-street parking) as an additional barrier.\n(8) Especially around areas with interesting natural features, sidewalks shall be curved, bending into adjoining lands, following\nthe natural contours.\n(9) Major commercial developments shall include a system for internal pedestrian movement. These internal walkways shall\nalso be linked with town-wide systems, particularly to greenways and parks.\n(10) Covered sidewalks are especially encouraged, as well as the development of public spaces with a pedestrian system like\ncourts and gardens.\n(11) Surfaces shall be constructed of brick when located within the Heritage District Overlay; other materials such as concrete\nmay be permitted in the other zoning districts.\n(12) Semi-pervious or pervious material as opposed to asphalt or concrete is especially desirable on sidewalks, to the extent\nthey do not diminish the accessibility of the pathway. If concrete is used, it should be textured or patterned with sections that shall\ninclude a brick pattern that matches the Banner Elk Pedestrian Plan.\n(F) Bicycles.\n(1) Bike lanes or sufficient room on the streets for bicyclists are very desirable. However, bike lanes do not have to parallel the\nstreet. Like sidewalks or walkways they should follow natural patterns.\n(2) Businesses and organizations should recognize the needs of cyclists who may bicycle to work. These cyclists need\nconvenient use of a bicycle rack.\n(Ord. passed 3-14-2005; Ord. passed 10-10-2016; Ord. passed 3-14-2019, \u00a7 500)\n\u00a7 152.087 LIGHTING TRESPASS.\n(A) General.\n(1) Design and intensity of lighting shall be architecturally integrated with the building style, material and color. Lighting shall\nbe designed and located to ensure that excessive light spillage and glare, especially toward neighboring areas and motorists, are\navoided. All parking and street lighting provided shall be aimed downward and provide shield covers to direct light in such a\nmanner.\n(2) Down lighting shall be used to reinforce the circulation corridor. Pedestrian scale lights, such as ornamental poles, shall be\nused on sidewalks instead of street lights; street lights shall match existing town streetscape lights. Low light sources should be\nused on other walking paths and greenways.\n(B) Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or\nrequires a different meaning.\nFIXTURE.

Discomfort experienced by an observer with a direct line of sight which often results in annoyance, discomfort or loss\nof visual performance causing visual impairment.\nHORIZONTAL (OR VERTICAL) FOOTCANDLES. The amount of light striking a vertical or horizontal plane.\nIESNA. Illuminating Engineering Society of North America.\nLIGHT SOURCE. The bulb and lens, diffuser or reflective enclosure.\nLIGHT TRESPASS. Light projected onto a property from fixtures not located on that property.\nLUMEN. The unit used to quantify the amount of light energy produced by a lamp at the lamp. Lumen output of most lamps is\nlisted on the packaging. For example, a 60-watt incandescent lamp produces 950 lumens while a 55-watt low pressure sodium\nlamp produces 8,000 lumens.\nNEON SIGNS. Luminous tube sign that contains neon or other inert gasses at a low pressure.\nSPOTLIGHT. A luminaire or bulb which projects light in a specific direction in a narrow beam, typically 45 degrees or less.\n(C) Regulation.\n(1) It is unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to install, erect or maintain any floodlight, searchlight, security light or other\nform or type of light source within the limits of the town in such manner that the light rays from this lighting fail to conform with the\nterms and conditions of this section, and that the light thereof may distract the attention of any vehicle driver from the operation of a\nvehicle in a safe and prudent manner.\n(2) On all properties except those zoned R1 and R2, the installation or replacement of any outdoor lighting fixtures shall\nrequire approval. Approval may not be issued unless the proposed installation is found by the Zoning Administrator to conform to\nall applicable provisions of this section.\n(3) All properties within the town and the ETJ must comply with the terms of this section.\n(D) Light trespass. The maximum illumination at five feet inside an adjacent residential parcel or public right-of-way, or beyond,\nfrom light emitted from an artificial light source, is 0.05 horizontal footcandles and 0.05 vertical footcandles. This illumination\nlikewise measured inside an adjacent commercial or industrial parcel or on a public roadway, or beyond, shall not exceed 0.1\nhorizontal footcandles or 0.1 vertical footcandles. No line of sight to a glaring light source is permitted from five feet or more inside a\nresidential or public right-of-way property line by an observer viewing from a position that is level with or higher than the ground\nbelow the fixture. Compliance is achieved with fixing shielding, directional control designed into the fixture, fixture location, fixture\nheight, fixture aim or a combination of these factors.\n(E) General lighting design.\n(1) General.\n(a) The bulbs in outdoor light fixtures emitting from 600 to 1,200 lumens shall be frosted glass or covered by frosted glass or\nother similarly translucent cover. An outdoor light fixture emitting more than 1,200 lumens, except motion detector-activated lighting\nshall be full cutoff and fully shielded to an observer at the property line. This can be achieved with fixture location, mounting height,\nnatural artificial barriers on the fixture owner's property, fixing shielding and other fixture design features.\n(b) A spotlight of less than 1,800 lumens need not be full cutoff or covered by a translucent cover if its center beam is aimed\nat a point not beyond any property lines and no higher than 45 degrees below the horizontal, and is motion detector-activated and\ncycles off after five minutes.\n(c) Generally, luminaries should not be located closer to the property line than a distance equal to three times the fixture's\nmounting height above grade at the property line.\n(d) The use of search lights, laser lighting or lights that pulse, flash, rotate or stimulate motion for advertising or promotions\nis prohibited.\n(e) Emergency lighting and traffic control lighting is exempt.\n(f) Tower lighting shall not be permitted unless required by FAA.

When landscaping is to be illuminated, the Planning Board shall first approve a landscape lighting plan that\npresents the purpose and objective of the lighting, shows the location of all lighting fixtures and what landscaping each is to\nilluminate and demonstrates that the installation will not generate excessive light levels, cause glare or direct light beyond the\nlandscaping into the night sky.\n(4) Externally illuminated signs. (Also see \u00a7 152.110 of this chapter.)\n(a) The average level of illumination on the vertical surface of the sign shall not exceed three footcandles, and the ratio of\naverage to minimum illumination shall not exceed two to one (2:1).\n(b) Lighting fixtures illuminating signs shall be carefully located, aimed and shielded so that light is directed only onto the\nsign facade. Lighting fixtures shall not be aimed toward adjacent streets, roads or properties.\n(c) Light fixtures illuminating signs shall be of a type such that the light source is not directly visible from adjacent streets,\nroads or properties.\n(d) To the extent practicable, fixtures used to illuminate signs shall be top-mounted and directed below the horizontal.\n(5) Parking lot lighting. Parking lot lighting shall be designed to provide the minimum lighting necessary to ensure adequate\nvision and comfort in parking areas, and to not cause glare or direct illumination onto adjacent properties or streets.\n(a) All lighting fixtures serving parking lots shall be cut-off fixtures.\n(b) Mounting heights of lighting fixtures shall not exceed 20 feet.\n(c) The minimum overall illumination level shall be no less than 0.4 footcandles. The ratio of the average illumination to the\nminimum illumination shall be four to one (4:1).\n(d) The maximum overallaverage illumination level shall not exceed one and one-half footcandles.\n(6) Lighting levels on exterior display/sales areas.\n(a) Lighting levels on exterior display/sales areas shall be adequate to facilitate the activities taking place in these locations\nduring business hours. Lighting of these areas shall not be used to attract attention to the businesses, but rather the merchandise.\nSigns allowed under local ordinances are to be used for the purpose of advertising a business.\n(b) The applicant shall designate areas to be considered display/sales areas and areas to be used as parking or passive\nvehicle storage areas. This designation must be approved by the Planning Board.\n1. Areas designated as parking or passive vehicle storage areas shall be illuminated in accordance with the requirements\nfor parking areas suggested elsewhere in this section.\n2. Areas designated as exterior display/sales areas shall be illuminated so that the average horizontal illuminance at grade\nlevel is no more than five footcandles. The ration of average to minimum illuminance shall be no greater than four to one (4:1). The\naverage and minimum shall be computed for only that area designated as exterior display/sales area.\n3. Light fixtures shall be full cut-off fixtures and shall be located, mounted, aimed and shielded so that direct light is not\ncast onto adjacent streets or properties.\n4.

Where special lighting is to be provided for walkways, bikeways or parks, the\nfollowing requirements shall apply.\n(a) The walkway, pathway or ground area shall be illuminated to a level of no more than 0.5 footcandles.\n(b) The vertical illumination levels at a height of five feet above grade shall be no more than 0.5 footcandles.\n(c) Lighting fixtures shall be designed to direct light downward, and light sources shall have an initial output of no more than\n1,000 lumens.\n(8) Lighting of gasoline stations/convenience store aprons and canopies. Lighting levels on gasoline station/convenience store\naprons and under canopies shall be adequate to facilitate the activities taking place in those locations. Lighting of these areas shall\nnot be used to attract attention to the businesses. Signs allowed under local ordinance are to be used for that purpose.\n(a) Areas on the apron away from the gasoline pump islands used for parking or vehicle storage shall be illuminated in\naccordance with the requirements for parking areas set forth elsewhere in this section. If no gasoline pumps are provided, the\nentire apron shall be treated as a parking area.\n(b) Areas around the pump islands and under canopies shall be illuminated so that the minimum horizontal illuminance at\ngrade level is no more than 5.5 footcandles. The ratio of average to minimum illuminance shall be no greater than four to one (4:1).\nThis yields an average illumination level of no more than 22 footcandles.\n(c) Light fixtures mounted on canopies shall be recessed so that the lens cover is recessed or flush with the bottom surface\n"}, {"page": "64", "text": "of the canopy and/or shielded by the fixture or the edge of the canopy so that light is restrained to no more than 85 degrees beyond\nthe vertical plane.\n(d) As an alternative to recessed ceiling lights, indirect lighting may be used where light is beamed upward and then\nreflected down from the underside of the canopy. In this case, light fixtures must be shielded so that direct illumination is focused\nexclusively on the underside of the canopy.\n(e) Lights shall not be mounted on the top or sides of the canopy and the sides of the canopy shall not be illuminated.\n(9) Lighting of outdoor facilities. Outdoor nighttime facilities (concerts, athletic contests and the like) have unique lighting\nneeds. Illumination levels vary, depending on the nature of the activity. The regulations in this section are intended to allow\nadequate lighting for such events while minimizing sky glow, reducing glare and unwanted illumination of surrounding streets and\nproperties and reducing energy consumption. The design plan shall include a discussion of the lighting requirements of various\nareas and how those requirements will be met.\n(F) Site plans. (Also see \u00a7\u00a7 152.031 and 152.301 of this chapter.)\n(1) (a) Outdoor lighting installations involving the installation or replacement of two or fewer lighting fixtures may be approved\nby the Zoning Officer; provided that, no single lamp exceeds 150 watts, and that the total wattage of all bulbs in all fixtures does not\nexceed 300 watts. All other installations must be approved by the Planning Board.\n(b) The applicant shall submit to the town sufficient information, in the form of an overall exterior lighting plan, to enable the\ntown to determine that the applicable provisions will be satisfied.\n(2) The lighting plan shall include at least the following items:\n(a) A site plan, drawn to scale of 1 inch equals no more than 20 feet, showing buildings, landscaping, parking areas and all\nproposed exterior lighting fixtures;\n(b) Specifications for all proposed lighting fixtures including photometric data, designation as full cut-off fixtures and other\ndescriptive information on the fixtures;\n(c) Proposed mounting height of all exterior lighting fixtures;\n(d) Analyses and illuminance level diagrams showing that the proposed installation conforms to the lighting level standards\nin this section; and\n(e) Drawings of all relevant building elevations showing the fixtures, the portions of the wails to be illuminated, the\nilluminance levels of the walls and the aiming points for any remote light fixtures.\n(3) (a) Wherever practicable, lighting installations shall include timers, dimmers and/or sensors to reduce overall energy\nconsumption and eliminate unneeded lighting.\n(b) When an outdoor lighting installation is being modified, extended, expanded or added to, the entire outdoor lighting\ninstallation shall be subject to the requirements of this section.\n(c) Expansions, additions or replacements to outdoor lighting installations shall be designed to avoid harsh contrasts in color\nand/or lighting levels.\n(d) Electrical services to outdoor lighting fixtures shall be underground, unless the fixtures are mounted directly on utility\npoles.\n(e) Proposed lighting installations that are not covered by the special provisions in this section may be approved only if the\nPlanning Board finds that they are designed to minimize glare, do not direct light beyond the boundaries of the area being\nilluminated or onto adjacent properties or streets, and do not result in excessive lighting levels. In general IESNA standards shall\nbe used to determine the appropriate lighting design.\n(f) For the purpose of these regulations, the mounting height of a lighting fixture shall be defined as the vertical distance from\nthe grade elevation of the surface being illuminated to the bottom of the lighting fixture.\n(g) The Planning Board may modify the requirements of this section if it determines that, in so doing, it will not jeopardize\nachievement of the intent of these regulations.\n(G) Exemptions.\n(1) The temporary use of low wattage or low voltage lighting for public festivals, celebrations and the observance of holidays is\nexempt from this section, except where they create a hazard or nuisance from glare. However, consideration to light trespass\nrequirements shall be demonstrated prior to commencing the use of the temporary lighting.\n(2) All other lighting existing or installed on the date of this section which does not conform with this section shall be exempt\nunder the following conditions.\n(a) The exemption shall expire seven years after the adoption date of this section.\n(b) Lighting found by a governmental agency to create a public hazard can be ordered removed or altered at any time.\n(c) On the effective date of this section, any light installation which provides for re-aiming of the fixture shall be brought into\ncompliance with the terms of this section without delay.\n(d) Upon repair or replacement of any component of any luminaire, or relocation of any luminaire, that luminaire shall be\nbrought into compliance with the terms of this section at the completion of the repair or replacement.\n"}, {"page": "65", "text": "(e) Upon installation of any new luminaire, this section shall fully apply.
