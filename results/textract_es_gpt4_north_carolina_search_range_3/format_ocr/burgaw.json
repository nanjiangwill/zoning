What constitutes a site-specific vesting plan\nunder this section that would trigger a vested right shall be finally determined by the local government\npursuant to a development regulation, and the document that triggers the vesting shall be so identified\nat the time of its approval. A variance does not constitute a site-specific vesting plan, and approval of\na site-specific vesting plan with the condition that a variance be obtained does not confer a vested right\nunless and until the necessary variance is obtained. If a sketch plan or other document fails to describe\nwith reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property, it\nmay not constitute a site-specific vesting plan.\n(B) Establishment of Vested Right. - A vested right is established with respect to any property upon the\nvalid approval, or conditional approval, of a site-specific vesting plan as provided in this section. Such\na vested right confers upon the landowner the right to undertake and complete the development and\nuse of the property under the terms and conditions of the site-specific vesting plan, including any\namendments thereto.\n(C) Approval and Amendment of Plans. - If a site-specific vesting plan is based on an approval required\nby a local development regulation, the local government shall provide whatever notice and hearing is\nrequired for that underlying approval. A duration of the underlying approval that is less than two years\ndoes not affect the duration of the site-specific vesting plan established under this section.

A local government shall not require a landowner to waive the landowner's\nvested rights as a condition of developmental approval.

Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from\nconditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for\ngranting a variance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate to make a\nreasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a person with a disability.\n(3) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of\npurchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a\nvariance is not a self-created hardship.\n(4) The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the regulation, such that\npublic safety is secured and substantial justice is achieved.\nNo change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance.

These zoning districts provide for those situations where\na particular use, properly planned, may be appropriate for a particular site but where the general district\nhas insufficient standards to mitigate the site-specific impact on surrounding areas. Uses that may be\nconsidered for a parallel zoning district are restricted to those uses permitted in the corresponding\ngeneral zoning district. No uses shall be permitted except those authorized by the Conditional Zoning\nDistrict.

The PUD Planned Unit Development District is a mixed use\ndistrict that may only be developed in conformance with an approved Master Development Plan which\nis form based for a specific planned unit development. The purpose of a PUD district is to require the\norderly integration of residential development, open space land uses, and in some cases, commercial\nnon-residential development that conforms to the design requirements contained herein. It permits the\nplanning of a project and a calculation of densities over the entire development rather than on an\nindividual lot-by-lot basis. A PUD district shall not be used as a means of circumventing the town's\nadopted land development regulations for routine developments. This district may be served by public\nwater and sewer facilities. No PUD district shall be less than twenty-five (25) acres in area. (160D-\n703)\n(1) The intent of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) District is to provide a development alternative\nto a conventional development. The PUD zoning district allows projects of innovative design and\nlayout that would not otherwise be permitted under this ordinance because of the strict application\nof zoning district or general development standards. The PUD district encourages progressive land\nplanning and design concepts. Some of these techniques and concepts include but are not limited\nto:\n(a) To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater,\nfloodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands, and wildlife habitat.\n(b) To protect prime agricultural land and preserve farming as an economic activity.\n63\n"}, {"page": "73", "text": "(c) To permit clustering of houses and structures in a manner that will reduce the amount of\ninfrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential\ndevelopment.\n(d) To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of\nvegetation in residential development.\n(e) To promote interconnected greenways and wildlife corridors.\n(f) To create continuous greenspace within and adjoining the development site.\n(g) To preserve important historic and archaeological sites.\nFor development standards for this district refer to Chapter 9\nSECTION 8.8 CONDITIONAL ZONING (CZ) AMENDMENTS\n(A) Purpose. Conditional zoning districts are zoning districts in which the development and use of the\nproperty is subject to predetermined ordinance standards and the rules, regulations, and conditions\nimposed as part of the legislative decision creating the district and applying it to the particular property.\nA conditional zoning district allows particular uses to be established only in accordance with specific\nstandards and conditions pertaining to each individual development project. Some land uses are of such\na nature or scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediately surrounding area and on\nthe entire community, which cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district standards.\nThere are also circumstances in which a general district designation allowing such a use by right would\nnot be appropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could, if properly planned, be\nappropriate for the property consistent with the objectives of these regulations, the adopted land use\nplan, and adopted district and area plans. The review process established in this section provides for\nthe accommodation of such uses by a reclassification of property into a conditional zoning district,\nsubject to specific conditions, which ensure compatibility of the use with the use and enjoyment of\nneighboring properties.\nA conditional zoning district is not intended for securing early or speculative reclassification of property.\nApplication.\n(1) Property may be rezoned to a conditional zoning district only in response to, and consistent with,\nan application submitted by the owner(s) of all property to be included in the district.\n(2) A petition for conditional zoning must include a preliminary site plan and supporting information\nand text that specifies the actual use or uses intended for the property and any rules, regulations,\nand conditions that, in addition to all predetermined ordinance requirements, will govern the\ndevelopment and use of the property. The following information must be provided, if applicable:\n(a) A boundary survey and vicinity map showing the property's total acreage, its zoning\nclassification(s), the general location in relation to adjacent properties, major streets, railroads,\nand/or waterways, the date, and north arrow;\n(b) All existing easements, reservations, and rights-of-way;\n(c) Approximate location on the site of existing and proposed buildings, structures, and other\nimprovements;\n(d) Approximate dimensions, including height of proposed buildings, structures, and other\nimprovements;\n(e) Proposed use of all lands and structures, including the number and square footage of all units,\nresidential and nonresidential;\n(f) All yards, buffers, screening, and landscaping required by these regulations or proposed by the\npetitioner;\n(g) All existing and proposed points of access to public streets;\n(h) Delineation of areas within the regulatory floodplain as shown on the Official Flood Insurance\nRate Maps;\n64\n"}, {"page": "74", "text": "(i) Location of all wetlands (must be confirmed by the Army Corps of Engineers if shown to be a\nprobable wetland by the NC Division of Coastal Management);\n(j) Proposed phasing, if any;\n(k) The location of existing and proposed storm drainage patterns and facilities intended to serve\nthe proposed development;\n(1) Approximate location of all existing and proposed infrastructure on the site, including water,\nsewer, roads, pedestrian walkways, and open space;\n(m) Generalized traffic, parking, and circulation plans.

Before the Planning Board will review a petition for a conditional\nzoning district, the applicant must file with the Town Planner a written report of a minimum of two\ncommunity meetings held by the applicant. Notice of such a meeting shall be given to property owners\nand tenants adjacent to the proposed project and within 500 feet of the area to be considered. At least\none community meeting shall be after 6 pm in the evening. Notice of both meetings shall be given two\nweeks in advance.

Pedestrian and bicycle volumes at school crossings and as otherwise applicable shall\nbe reported.\n(G) Analysis of transportation impact. The total traffic demand that will result from construction of the\nproposed development shall be calculated. This demand shall consist of the combination of (1) existing\ntraffic; (2) ambient traffic growth and traffic from approved area development and (3) traffic generated\nby the proposed development.\n(1) Each traffic impact study at a minimum shall include analyses of the transportation network for the\nfollowing scenarios:\n(a) Existing traffic;\n(b) Background, which includes the sum of existing and 3% ambient growth and approved\ndevelopments\n(c) Build, which includes the sum of background and site generated trips.\n(d) Build improvements, which includes the sum of build and recommended capacity mitigation\nimprovements.\n(2) Notes.\n(a)\nThe background and build year analyses for all future scenarios shall be one year following the\ndevelopment's scheduled completion.\n(b) An ambient compound growth of 3% shall be used unless otherwise approved by the town or\ntown's Traffic Engineer.\n(3) If staging of the proposed development is anticipated, calculations for each stage of completion\nshall be made. This analysis shall be performed for average weekday traffic, the peak highway\nhour(s) and, if appropriate, peak development- generated hours (s) for all roadways and major\nintersections in the study area (as defined by the town or town's Traffic Engineer)\n(4) All proposed access points and pedestrian crossings shall be examined for adequate sight distance\nand if deemed necessary by the town or town's Traffic Engineer, with the support of NCDOT on\nstate routes the installation of a traffic signal. The traffic signal evaluation shall compare the\nprojected traffic and pedestrian volumes to the warrants for traffic signal installation found in the\nlatest edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). All traffic signal\nwarrants must be approved by the NCDOT Division Traffic Engineer.\n(H) Conclusions and recommended improvements\n(1) The traffic impact study shall report each analyzed condition as required in divisions (A) through\n(F) and include peak hour delay, levels of service, and ninety-fifth percentile queue lengths for\nall study area intersections (signalized) or intersection movements (unsignalized) as defined by\nthe latest edition of the Highway Capacity Manual. Should the projected build level of service\nfor any signalized intersection or unsignalized intersection movement in an urban area defined in\ndivision (G) fall below LOS \"D\" for a 60-minute peak hour, that intersection shall deemed\ndeficient. Should the projected build level of service for any signalized intersection or\nunsignalized intersection movement in a rural area as defined in division (G) fall below LOS \"C\"\nfor a 60-minute peak hour, that intersection shall be deemed deficient. Should the build delay at\nan intersection or intersection approach increase by 25% or more (above and beyond the\nbackground delay), that intersection approach shall be deemed deficient.\n(2) Should an intersection and/or intersection movement be deemed deficient (as outlined in division\n(F)(1)), the traffic impact study shall provide potential capacity mitigation recommendations to\nallow the intersection or intersection approach to operate at a LOS \"D\" (in urban areas) or LOS\n159\n"}, {"page": "169", "text": "\"C\" (in rural areas). Potential capacity mitigation recommendations include, but are not limited\nto: modifications to internal circulation design; modifications to site access location and/or\ndesign; external roadway widening; external intersection modification (turn lane construction and\nthe like); intersection signalization; and/or upgrades to network signal timings. All recommended\nimprovements shall be designed by a North Carolina Licensed Professional Engineer and\nprovided to the town for review, comment, and approval. All recommended improvements to\nstate-maintained facilities are subject to NCDOT approval. When connecting site driveways to\nstate-maintained facilities, the applicant must follow all NCDOT guidelines to acquire a driveway\npermit.\n(3) If it is determined by the town or the town's Traffic Engineer that the proposed development is\nonly partially responsible for a deficient intersection, intersection movement, or intersection\napproach, payment of a partial fee-in-lieu may be considered. In this instance, the development\nshall be responsible for their proportionate share of a required improvement. A proportionate\nshare is the percentage of a development's trips (as compared to the total volume of trips) at an\nintersection or intersection approach during the worst analyzed peak hour, all as determined by\nthe town or the town's Traffic Engineer. For example, if a development's trips represent 5% of\nthe total traffic at an intersection during the worst analyzed peak hour, that development will be\nresponsible for 5% of the total cost of the required improvement at that intersection. Any fee-in-\nlieu consideration will be at the sole discretion of the town or town's Traffic Engineer. The\nstandards established in Section 9.2 warranties, sureties, and improvement guarantees shall be\nfollowed.\n(4) Urban and rural intersections. For the purpose of traffic impact studies, an urban intersection\nshall be defined as the intersection of any facility within the Highway 117 and Highway 53\ncorridors in the town limits of Burgaw including downtown area. All other intersections shall be\nconsidered rural intersections.\nSection 9.3.5 Submission and Implementation\nThe one hard copy of the traffic impact study and one electronic copy including analysis files (typically\nSynchro) will be submitted to the Town Planner and an electronic copy including analysis files (typically\nSynchro) must be submitted to the District 1 office of the NC Department of Transportation to the district\nengineer responsible for NCDOT activities in the Town. One traffic study including analysis files (typically\nSynchro) will be sent to the Town's traffic engineer for review.\n[Amendment to this section approved 2023.09.12 Ordinance# 2023-26]\nSECTION 9.4 ADMINISTRATIVE DEVELOPMENT APPROVALS AND DETERMINATIONS.\n(A) Development Approvals. - To the extent consistent with the scope of regulatory authority granted by\nthis Chapter, no person shall commence or proceed with development without first securing any\nrequired development approval from the local government with jurisdiction over the site of the\ndevelopment.

The Utility Extension Policy is intended to define how extensions of the Town\nutility systems will be made. The Policy establishes procedures for installing new services and the\nfinancial obligations thereto.\n(1) Objectives. The Town's primary objective is to provide reliable and affordable utility service to its\nexisting customers. New customers to the system are therefore expected to share in a majority of\nthe expense for their new services. The specific objectives of this policy are to:\n(a) Define how requests for new service shall be submitted to the Town.\n(b) Define facilities necessary to provide new services.\n(c) Define the construction responsibilities for these new facilities.\n(d) Define the financial responsibilities for these new facilities.\n(e) Establish funding mechanisms for private contributions to publicly funded utility extensions.\n(2) Definitions.\n(a)\nMajor Facilities: Major water facilities generally consist of the treatment works, storage\nfacilities, pumping facilities, and water transmission lines 12 inches in diameter and larger.\n(b) Major wastewater facilities: generally, consists of the treatment works, pumping facilities\nwith capacity in excess of 700 gallons per minute and sewers 12 inches in diameter and larger.\n(c) Minor facilities: facilities to provide local service\n(d) Service Connection: lines and appurtenances connecting a new customer to the Town system\nat the point of sale\n(e) Tap Fee: a fee paid by all new customers to defray, in part, the cost of service connection and\nmeter.\n(f) System Development Charge: a fee paid by customers wishing to connect to the town water\nor sewer lines. Refer to Town Ordinance 2018-07 for more detailed information.\n(3) Applications and Petitions. Any interested party may request water and/or sewer service from the\nTown. If the service is to be provided within the corporate limits and adequate public water and\nsewer mains are available adjacent to the property, service will be provided upon payment of the\napplicable fees. If the service is to be provided outside the corporate limits or requires extension of\na service main, a formal petition for service shall be submitted to the Town Board for consideration.\nAll petitioners requesting water and sewer service shall, at the request of the Town, file a petition\nfor annexation to the Town. The Town will generally consider annexation and extension of utilities\nto areas within the ETJ. Failure to file a petition for voluntary annexation or satellite annexation on\nnotice from the Town may result in immediate termination of water service.\n(4) Town Response to Request. Upon receipt of a petition to extend a water and/or sewer main, the\nTown Board has the following options for response:\n(a) Install the extension at the Town's expense.\n(b) Approve and allow the petitioner to install the extension at his expense.\n(c) Install the extension at the petitioner's expense.\n245\n"}, {"page": "255", "text": "(d) Install and jointly finance the extension in cooperation with the petitioner.\n(e) Jointly finance and install the extension in cooperation with the County in accordance with the\nintergovernmental agreement.\n(f) Deny the request.\nThe criteria under which an option will be chosen are generally defined herein; however, the Town Board\nmay act according to any aforementioned option that it feels is in the best interest of the Town. The Town\nBoard may also extend water and/or sanitary sewer mains on their own volition without receipt of a petition\nand assess the cost or collect utility fees as described herein from those who connect to the main.\n(5) Construction and Service Connection. New service connections to existing mains will generally\nbe installed by the Town and paid for by the new customer. Where new service connections are to\nbe installed in conjunction with extension of water and sewer lines, the customer may, at the Town's\ndiscretion, install service connections. No new service shall be commissioned until construction\nand testing are completed, all applicable fees have been paid, and the Town has commissioned the\nfacilities for public use.\n(6) Minor Facilities. All extensions to Town utilities shall be made in accordance with Town standards\nand applicable State and Federal regulations. Where extension of utilities is funded entirely or\npartly by the Town, the Town shall design and construct the facilities. Extensions funded entirely\nby the petitioner may, at the Town's discretion, be designed and constructed by the petitioner in\naccordance with Town standards. Extensions utilizing Town funds shall generally be Town\nprojects. The petitioner shall make a non-refundable deposit of 20% of the estimated project cost\nprior to the Town undertaking design. Prior to construction, the petitioner shall pay the balance of\nthe project cost or the petitioner's share of the cost. Privately funded extension projects constructed\nby the petitioner shall be reviewed and approved by the Town prior to the petitioner submitting the\nplans to any other review agency. Upon approval of the plans, the Town will issue written\nnotification to the petitioner who shall then secure all additional approvals and construct the\nfacilities.

Failure to comply with\nthe approved plan or time schedule will automatically terminate the approval for services.\n(7) Major Facilities. Major facilities shall be funded, designed, and constructed by the Town. These\nfacilities, as established by the Water and Wastewater Plan, shall be constructed in order of priority\nas adopted in the Town's Capital Improvement Plans. Projects will only be undertaken as adequate\ncapital improvement funds are available. Projects to improve existing services will generally be\nfunded by Impact Fees and sales revenues. Projects to extend the major facilities will generally be\nfunded by System Development Charges and private contributions. Petitioners wishing to expedite\na major utility extension project may be asked by the Town Board to prepay System Development\nCharges, make a contribution to the project cost, or both such that accelerating the project does not\nadversely impact existing customers or the orderly expansion of the utility system.\n(8) Fees and Charges.\n(a) Tap Fees. Tap fees will be collected from each new customer prior to initiating service. The\nfees are established by the Town to reflect the average cost to the Town for installation of taps\nand meters. Where new service connections are installed as part of a new development, the fee\nreflects the cost of meter installations only. The schedule of required fees shall be periodically\nrevised to reflect changes in the Town's actual cost. Payment of the Tap Fees shall be made\nprior to installation of any meter or commission any new service connection.\n246\n"}, {"page": "256", "text": "(b) System Development Charge. a fee paid by customers wishing to connect to the town water\nor sewer lines.

Where a tract of land to be subdivided adjoins a principal arterial street, the\nsubdivider may be required to provide a marginal access street parallel to the arterial street or reverse\nfrontage on a minor street for the lots to be developed adjacent to the arterial street. Where reverse\nfrontage is established, private driveways shall be prevented from having direct access to the highway.\n(E) Subdivision Street Disclosure Statement. All streets shown on the final plat shall be designated in\naccordance with NC G.S. 136-102.6, and designation as public shall be conclusively presumed an offer\nof dedication to the public. Where streets are dedicated to the public but not accepted into a municipal\nor state system before lots are sold, a statement explaining the status of the street shall be included with\nthe final plat.\n(F) Half-Streets. The dedication of half-streets of less than 60 feet at the perimeter of a new subdivision\nshall be prohibited. If circumstances render this impractical, adequate provision for the concurrent\ndedication of the remaining half of the street shall be furnished by the subdivider. Where there exists\na\nhalf-street in an adjoining subdivision, the remaining half shall be provided by the proposed\nsubdivision. However, in circumstances where more than 60 feet of right-of-way is required, a partial\nwidth right-of-way, not less than 60 feet in width, may be dedicated when adjoining undeveloped\nproperty is owned or controlled by the subdivider, provided that the width of the partial dedication is\nsuch as to permit the installation of such facilities as may be necessary to serve abutting lots. When the\nadjoining property is subdivided, the remainder of the full required right-of-way shall be dedicated.\n247\n"}, {"page": "257", "text": "(G) Street Names.
