To vary the flood damage prevention standards in Chapter 5:\nDevelopment Standards, as a different Variance process is identified in\nthis UDO for these types of requests; or\nC.

If measurement on private\nproperty is not possible or practical, light level measurements may be made at\nthe boundary of the public street right-of-way that adjoins the land.\nMeasurements shall be made at finished grade (ground level), with the light-\nregistering portion of the meter held parallel to the ground.\nB.\nIllumination measurements shall be taken with a light meter that has been\ncalibrated within the previous two years.\n5.8.8. Prohibited Lighting\nThe following exterior lighting is prohibited:\n1. Light fixtures that imitate an official highway or traffic control light or sign;\n2. Light fixtures that have a flashing or intermittent pattern of illumination,\n3. Floodlights or spotlights, except when used by Federal, State or local\nauthorities, or where they are used to illuminate alleys, parking garages\nand working (maintenance) areas, SO long as they are shielded and aimed\nSO that they do not result in lighting on any adjacent lot or public right-of-\nway exceeding two footcandles; and\n4. Light types of limited spectral emission, such as low-pressure sodium or\nmercury vapor lights.\n5.8.9. Exemptions for Safety Reasons\nA. A landowner may submit a security plan, as part of the lighting plan, during the\nSite Plan or Commercial Upfit application process to the Planning Director\nproposing exterior lighting that deviates from the standards in this section. The\nPlanning Director shall approve or approve with conditions the security plan\nand its proposed deviation from the standards, upon finding that:\n1. The proposed deviation from the standards is necessary for the adequate\nprotection of the subject land, development, or the public;\n2. The condition, location, or use of the land, or the history of activity in the\narea, indicates the land or any materials stored or used on it are in\nsignificantly greater danger of theft or damage, or members of the public\nare at greater risk for harm than on surrounding land without the additional\nlighting; and\nMooresville, NC UDO | Amended November 7, 2022\n363\n"}, {"page": "376", "text": "5.9.

More specifically, the\npurposes of this section are to:\n1. Establish a minimum level of site and building design quality for multifamily\nand attached residential, commercial, mixed-use, and industrial\ndevelopment;\n2. Encourage a more pedestrian-friendly environment that provides a stronger\nsense of place through attention to human-scale building form and design,\nlimiting large, bulky buildings with few architectural details, and requiring\nbuilding configurations and orientations that support multiple modes of\ntravel;\n3. Promote greater compatibility between adjacent development;\n4. Maintain a high-quality appearance for buildings in the Town; and\n5. Provide landowners, developers, architects, builders, business owners, and\nothers with a clear and equitable set of parameters for developing land.\n5.9.2. Applicability\nA. GENERAL\n1. The form and design standards in this section include four sets of standards.\nThe applicability of the standards depends on the type and extent of\nproposed development. If there is a conflict between a more generally\napplicable standard and a more specific standard (e.g., general form and\ndesign standards versus small-scale apartment homes standards), the more\nspecific standard shall control.\n2. Structures located in the Historic Preservation Overlay district or are listed on\nor identified as contributing to a national or local historic district or local\nlandmark are exempt from the standards in this section, as long as building\ndesign follows Town-adopted architectural guidelines or standards or\nSecretary of Interior Standards for historic properties.
