In order to grant a special\nuse permit, the Board must make the following written findings:\n(1) The use will not materially endanger the public health or safety or constitute a public nuisance if\nlocated where proposed and developed according to the plans and information submitted and approved;\n(2) The use will not substantially injure the value of adjoining property; or, that the use is a public\nnecessity; and\n(3) The location and character of the use, if developed according to the plans and information approved,\nwill be in harmony with proximate land uses, consistent with the purposes of the district and in conformity\nwith the town's land use plan.\n(E)\nIf the Board makes the above required findings, a special use permit shall be granted and a special use\npermit shall be issued to permit the requested use. The special use permit shall be subject to conditions\nstipulated by the chapter or determined by the Board of Adjustment to be necessary to ensure that the use\nremains compatible with other uses permitted in the district and with adjoining properties. No special use\npermit shall grant variances from the requirements of this chapter. If any conditions required or imposed as\npart of a special use permit are not maintained or carried out or cease to exist, the Zoning Administrator shall\nrevoke the special use permit and the use shall become a chapter violation.\n"}, {"page": "80", "text": "(F)\nIf the Board cannot make all of the required findings, no special use permit shall be granted nor\nspecial use permit issued.

Testimony may be given by any person with relevant\ninformation, whether by agent, attorney or in person. It is the responsibility of the applicant to demonstrate\nthat required findings exist. Notice of evidentiary hearings are subject to $157.185 (A).\n(C) The Board of Adjustments shall render a decision, either at the hearing or within a reasonable\nperiod thereafter. In order to grant a variance, the Board must find:\n(1) Practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships would result from enforcing the strict letter of the\nchapter. A determination shall be made only if the Board finds that the applicant has demonstrated that:\n(a) Strict compliance with the chapter will deprive the applicant of any reasonable return from or use\nof his or her property;\n(b) The hardship results from the application of the chapter and not other factors;\n(c) The hardship is actually suffered by the land in question (not the general public or other\nproperties);\n(d) The hardship is not the result of the applicant's own actions or negligence; and\n(e) The hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property, the result of unusual size, shape or topographic\nconditions not shared or experienced by other land or structures in the district.\n(2) The proposed variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the chapter and\npreserves its spirit. Requests to extend non-conforming uses or permit uses not allowed in the district are\nnot consistent with this finding;\n(3) If the variance is granted, the public safety and welfare will remain secure;\n(4) If the variance is granted, substantial justice will be done. In making this determination, the Board\nshall examine whether literal administration of the chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly\nenjoyed by other property owners or occupants in the district and, on the other hand, whether granting the\nvariance would confer on the applicant any special privilege denied by the chapter to other property in the\ndistrict; and\n(5) If the Board grants a variance, its action shall be accompanied by its reasons for making the required\nfindings and by its certification that the variance is the minimum variance which will make possible the\nreasonable use of land, buildings or structures.\n"}, {"page": "81", "text": "\u00a7 157.151 ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS.\nIn exercising its powers, the Board may, in accordance with this chapter, reverse, affirm or modify in whole or\npart the order, requirement, decision, interpretation or determination appealed from and may issue the orders,\nrequirements, decisions, interpretations or determinations as may be necessary.

Proposed amendments to the chapter shall be considered significant potential changes in the\nchapter's ability to assist the implementation of the community's land use plan and comprehensive plan.\nProposed amendments should be considered with significant attention to the issues of whether they promote\nhealth, safety and the general welfare, encourage the most appropriate use of land and carry out the\ncommunity's comprehensive plan.\n(B) Because the zoning chapter is based on a comprehensive plan, amendments (particularly proposed\nmap changes) should be carefully examined to determine if they are justified by an error in the original\nprovision or classification or whether circumstances have changed sufficiently to make the existing\nprovision or district inappropriate. Absent the justifications, an amendment may be unneeded. In applying\ndistrict classifications in particular, the community's need for various types and amounts of uses, as well as\nthe suitability of the land for the uses, should be principal determining factors.\n\u00a7 157.181 LIMITATIONS.\nZoning classifications shall not be established, nor the official zoning map amended, in the following manners.\n(A) Conditional zoning. Zoning classifications shall not be based on conditions of time and/or\ndevelopment which will result in an automatic classification change at a future date.\n(B) Contract zoning. Zoning classifications shall not be based on assurances by an applicant, or\nconditions imposed by the Board of Commissioners that rezoned property will be developed in a particular,\nlimited fashion.\n(C) \"Spot\" zoning. Zoning classifications shall not be adopted in a manner which confers special benefit\nor places special restriction upon a particular parcel of land nor adopted in a manner which classifies a\nrelatively small area differently from surrounding property of similar nature and logical use, without sound\nbasis in the purposes of zoning as set forth in this chapter and state law.\n(D) Down-zoning. No amendment to zoning regulations or a zoning map that down-zones property shall\nbe initiated nor is it enforceable without the written consent of all property owners whose property is the\n"}, {"page": "84", "text": "subject of the down-zoning amendment, unless the down-zoning amendment is initiated by the Town of\nFarmville. For purposes of this section, \"down-zoning\" means a zoning ordinance that affects an area of\nland in one of the following ways:\nBy decreasing the development density of the land to be less dense than was allowed under its\nprevious usage.\nBy reducing the permitted used of the land that are specified in a zoning ordinance or land\ndevelopment regulation to fewer uses than were allowed under its previous usage.\n\u00a7 157.182 AMENDMENT PROCEDURES.\n(A) Standing. A petition for a zoning chapter amendment may be initiated by the Board of\nCommissioners, Planning Board, any department or official of the town, or any citizen residing or owning\nproperty within the zoning jurisdiction of the town.\n(B) Application. Applications to amend this chapter shall be filed with the Secretary to the Planning\nBoard at least ten days prior to the Planning Board meeting at which it is to be considered. The application\nshall be submitted in the number of copies specified by the town and shall include information necessary to\nreview the application, including the applicant's full name, address and interest in any affected property, a\ndescription of the property (if applicable), and the nature of the amendment requested, and a statement of\nwhat changed conditions make the amendment necessary to the purposes of zoning and the implementation\nof the town's comprehensive plan. If the requested change is a zoning map amendment, an accurate map or\ndiagram of the property proposed for re-classification should be submitted, including property lines with\ndimensions, north arrow, adjoining streets and their widths, the location of all structures, the existing uses\nof\nland at the site, and the current zoning classification of the property and adjoining properties. A reasonable\napplication fee set by the Town Manager, subject to Board of Commissioners review, may be charged to\noffset advertising and administrative expenses in processing the application.\n(C) Staff review. Copies of the application shall be immediately forwarded to the Town Manager,\nZoning Administrator and the chief municipal planner for review and comment.\n(D) Planning Board review. The application and any staff comments shall be considered by the Planning\nBoard at its first regular meeting at least ten days following submission of the complete application. The\nPlanning Board shall submit its recommendations and/or comments to the Board of Commissioners in writing\nwithin 30 days following its initial consideration. If the Planning Board fails to submit a written report within\n30 days, it shall be considered to have no objection or substantive comment to offer and the Board of\nCommissioners may proceed to consideration of the petition. The Planning Board may, if it wishes, conduct a\npreliminary public hearing on the proposed change and/or may sit concurrently with a public hearing conducted\nby the Board of Commissioners. In making its recommendation on any zoning district change, the Planning\nBoard shall consider the factors affecting the use of land as its natural features, community facilities, economic\nneeds, environmental quality, official plans, transportation, legal factors and public services impact. When\nconducting a review of proposed zoning text or map amendments the Planning Board shall advise and comment\non whether the proposed action is consistent with any comprehensive plan that has been adopted and any other\nofficially adopted plan that is applicable. The Planning Board shall provide a written recommendation to the\ngoverning board that addresses plan consistency and other matters as deemed appropriate by the planning\nboard, but a comment by the planning board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive\nplan shall not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the Board of Commissioners.\n"}, {"page": "85", "text": "(E) Board of Board of Commissioners review.\n(1) Following receipt of the Planning Board's recommendation or expiration of the 30 days, the Board\nof Commissioners may proceed to consideration of the proposed amendment.

The Board of Commissioners may also\nelect not to conduct a hearing if it feels that an application lacks sufficient merit to receive further\nconsideration.\n(2) In review of the application, the Board of Commissioners shall consider staff and Planning Board\nrecommendations, the relationship of the proposed amendment to the land use plan and other elements of\nthe comprehensive plan, information given by the applicant and the public, and principals of good land use\nplanning. When adopting or rejecting any zoning text or map amendment, the Board of Commissioners\nshall approve a brief statement describing whether its action is consistent or inconsistent with an adopted\ncomprehensive plan. If the amendment is adopted and the action was deemed inconsistent with the adopted\nplan, the zoning amendment shall have the same effect of also amending any future land use map in the\napproved plan, and no additional request or application for a plan amendment shall be required. When\nadopting or rejecting any petition for a zoning text or map amendment, a brief statement explaining the\nreasonableness of the proposed zoning shall be approved by the Board of Commissioners. The statement of\nreasonableness may consider among other factors (d) the size, physical conditions, and other attributes of\nany area proposed to be rezoned; (ii) the benefits and detriments to the landowners, the neighbors, and the\nsurrounding community; (iii) the relationship between the current actual and permissible development and\nthe development permissible under the proposed amendment; (iv) why the action taken is in the public\ninterest; and (v) any changed conditions warranting the amendment.\n(F) Petition withdrawal. Any petition for amendment of this chapter may be withdrawn at any time prior\nto an actual amendment by the person(s) initiating the request, upon written notice to the Secretary of the\nBoard considering the petition at that time. Withdrawal of a petition by an applicant shall not prohibit further\nconsideration of possible amendments by the appropriate officials and public bodies if they determine that\nthe petition raised significant questions of need for review of the chapter.\n(G) Reconsideration. When the Board of Commissioners has denied or tabled an application for a zoning\nclassification change, no application for the same change affecting the same property or a portion thereof\nshall be accepted for at least one year from the Board's action.
