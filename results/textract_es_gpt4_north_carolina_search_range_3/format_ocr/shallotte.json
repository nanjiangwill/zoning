This\ninformation is needed before plans for development are SO far advanced that it is\nunreasonable and impractical to modify the plans to protect the trees identified on the tree\nsurvey. Tree survey requirements do not obligate a property owner or developer to save trees\nby modifying a plan for development. However, knowing the location and size of all trees\nhelps the Town evaluate possible modifications to the proposed plans to preserve trees and\nimprove the appearance of proposed development.\n(A)\nA heritage tree survey shall be required for any development proposal subject to site\nplan approval (Section 12-2), all new construction non-residential development, non-\nresidential redevelopment whereby the existing footprint of a structure is expanded by\nmore than 50%, major subdivisions, planned residential developments, or planned unit\ndevelopments, and shall be submitted with any applicable site plan, preliminary plat,\nor master development plan. The heritage tree survey shall show the general location,\nspecies and size of any heritage tree.\n(B)\nFor purposes of this Ordinance, a heritage tree shall be defined as follows:\n(1)\nAn American holly with a trunk caliper measurement of 8\" or greater measured\nat 4.5 feet above ground;\n(2)\nA flowering dogwood with a trunk caliper measurement of 4\" or greater\nmeasured at 4.5 feet above ground;\n(3)\nA redbud with a trunk caliper measurement of 4\" or greater measured at 4.5 feet\nabove ground;\n(4)\nA live oak with a trunk caliper measurement of 4\" or greater measured at 4.5\nfeet above ground; and\n(5)\nAny tree species included in Section 17-6(D) with a trunk caliper measurement\nof 18\" or greater measured at 4.5 feet above ground.\n(C)\nFor development plans where specific building locations are not shown, the\nAdministrator may allow a more generalized survey of vegetation be provided in lieu\nof a heritage tree survey. This survey shall describe existing forest stands, indicating\nthe average species and size of trees on the tract.\n(D)\nFor development plans where the preservation of large areas of undisturbed vegetation\nis proposed and in other circumstances where unique site conditions or a proposed\ndevelopment arrangement indicate that the required heritage tree survey would produce\nlittle useful information, the Administrator shall have the authority to waive the\nrequirements for a heritage tree survey for all or a portion of the tract, provided that\nsuch areas are designated on submitted plans. Such unique site conditions shall include\nland in floodways (unless filled or developed in accordance), preserved wetlands and\nwetland buffers, steep slope areas, and stream buffers.\n(Ord. 20-05, 7/7/20)\nSection 17-5: Existing Vegetation\n(A)\nRetention of Existing Vegetation\nAugust 2021\n17-2\n"}, {"page": "183", "text": "The retention of existing vegetation shall be maximized within all proposed\nlandscaping, parking and buffer areas.

There are two types of required buffers that may occur on\nany given development site: street buffers and project boundary buffers. A street buffer is\ngenerally located along the street(s) that border a development and requires a modest amount\nof landscaping to enhance the \"public\" environment. A project boundary buffer is generally\nlocated where non-residential and multi-family uses are adjacent to single-family residences.\nA buffer may also contain, or be required to contain, a barrier such as a berm, fence or wall,\nor combination thereof, where such additional screening is necessary to achieve the desired\nlevel of buffering between land use activities. A buffer is not the same as the term \"yard\" or\nthe term \"stormwater management area.\"\nSection 17-9: Location\n(A)\nBuffers shall be located within the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, parallel to and\nextending to the lot or parcel boundary line.

The ability of a\nstreet to move traffic freely, safely, and efficiently with a minimum delay is controlled\nprimarily by the spacing of major devices utilized. Thus, the ability of a street to move traffic\ncan be increased by restricting parking and turning movements, using proper sign and signal\ndevices, and by the application of other traffic engineering strategies.\nCapacity is the maximum number of vehicles which has a \"reasonable expectation\" of passing\nover a given section of roadway, during a given time period under prevailing roadway\nand traffic conditions. The relationship of traffic volumes to the capacity of the roadway will\ndetermine the level of service (LOS) being provided. Six levels of service have been selected\nfor analysis purposes. They are given letter designations from A to F with LOS A\nrepresenting the best operating conditions and LOS F the worst\n(A)\nLOS A. Describes primarily free flow conditions. The motorist experiences a high\nlevel of physical and psychological comfort. The effects of minor incidents of\nbreakdown are easily absorbed. Even at the maximum density, the average spacing\nbetween vehicles is about five hundred twenty eight (528 feet or twenty six (26) car\nlengths.\n(B)\nLOS B. Represents reasonably free flow conditions. The ability to maneuver within\nthe traffic stream is only slightly restricted. The lowest average spacing between\nvehicles is about three hundred thirty (330) feet or eighteen (18) car lengths.\n(C)\nLOS C. Provides for stable operations, but flows approach the range in which small\nincreases will cause substantial deterioration in service. Freedom to maneuver is\nnoticeably restricted. Minor incidents may still be absorbed, but the local decline in\nservice will be great. Queues may be expected to form behind any significant\nblockage. Minimum average spacings are in the range of two hundred twenty (220)\nfeet or eleven (11) car lengths.\n(D)\nLOS D. Borders on unstable flow. Density begins to deteriorate somewhat more\nquickly with increasing flow. Small increases in flow can cause substantial\ndeterioration in service. Freedom to maneuver is severely limited, and the driver\nexperiences drastically reduced comfort levels. Minor incidents can be expected to\ncreate substantial queuing. At the limit, vehicles are spaced at about one hundred sixty\nfive (165) feet or nine (9) car lengths.\n(E)\nLOS E. Describes operation at capacity. Operations at this level are extremely\nunstable, because there are virtually no usable gaps in the traffic system. Any\ndisruption to the traffic stream, such as a vehicle entering from a ramp, or changing\nlanes, requires the following vehicles to give way to admit the vehicle. This can\nestablish a disruption wave that propagates through the upstream traffic flow. At\ncapacity, the traffic stream has no ability to dissipate any disruption.

Town of Shallotte residents desire to maintain the\ncharacter of their communities and sustain and improve the excellent quality of life that the\narea provides. Residents and Town officials favor growth and development that is\nenvironmentally-responsible, well-designed and located, and respectful of the character of\nthe Town. Future development is expected to involve a mix of residential development with\nvarying densities and building styles, as well as new business, industrial, and institutional\nland uses. It is the purpose of the Town of Shallotte Storm Water Program to meet the current\nand anticipated needs for storm water services and to protect public and private properties,\nrivers, estuaries, and other water bodies from unnecessary damage due to storm water\nreleases and non-point source pollution. The provision of those services will be based upon\ncompatibility with the Town's development plans, the Town's taxpayers and developers\nfinancial capacities, and upon compliance with applicable Federal and State laws and\nregulations.\n1.2 Summary of Goals and Elements of the Town of Shallotte Storm Water Program\nThe goals of the Program are to:\nMinimize the public's risk of injury and death and limit damages to private and public\nproperty caused by storm water runoff within the Town's jurisdiction.\nMaintain and increase the riparian buffers along the streams and waterways within the\nTown's jurisdiction.\nProvide for the public's health, safety, and welfare by protecting the water quality of the\nTown's rivers, estuaries, and other water bodies and wetlands.\nEnsure Town compliance with all applicable Federal and State regulations.\nIn order to meet these goals, the Town will require anyone proposing new non-residential\ndevelopment or residential development that will ultimately result in disturbance of one acre\nor more of land or anyone proposing new developments within 30 feet of intermittent and\nperennial streams or other water bodies, to obtain a Town of Shallotte Storm Water Permit.\nObtaining a Town of Shallotte Storm Water Permit requires property owners and developers\nto address five topics:\n1.2.1 Protecting and Enhancing Riparian Areas\nThe Town of Shallotte Storm Water Quality Management and Discharge Control Ordinance\n(Town of Shallotte Storm Water Ordinance) requires that the Town protect riparian buffers\non new developments. The Program will ensure that a 30-foot riparian buffer will be\nmaintained on all sides of intermittent and perennial streams and other water bodies within\nthe Town's jurisdiction during future development. The Program will also seek restoration\nand enhancement of impaired buffers within the Town's jurisdiction.

The Program encourages and, in some cases requires, the use of BMPs\nfrom the conceptual design of a new development project through the project's construction\nand operation. Chapter 7 of this Manual describes some of the project design BMPs that can\nbe used to minimize the negative impacts of development. Chapter 8 describes some of the\nstructural BMPs that may be used to reduce the remaining impacts.\n1.2.4 Maintaining BMPs\nIn order to be effective, BMPs for storm water control must be appropriately maintained. The\nProgram includes an annual inspection program under which Town staff, or others working\nin their behalf, will inspect BMPs and their maintenance records. The Program may provide\nprocedures under which the Town will accept the responsibility by maintaining BMPs\nservicing residential properties and establishing the requirement that BMPs servicing non-\nresidential properties be maintained by their owners. The Town will have the authority and\ncapability to perform necessary maintenance of all BMPs and will charge delinquent owners\nfor maintenance services that the Town performs.\n1.3 Stormwater Quality Management and Discharge Control Ordinance\nThis Town of Shallotte Board of Aldermen adopted the Stormwater Quality Management and\nDischarge Control Ordinance on September 16, 2002. A copy of that Ordinance is contained\nin the Town's Unified Development Ordinance (Article 25). The purpose of this Manual is to\npresent materials that help to explain the Ordinance and to illustrate the technical\nrequirements and practices that may be used to ensure compliance with it. Any disagreements\nbetween statements in the Ordinance and in this Manual are to be resolved in favor of the\nOrdinance.\n1.4 Disclaimer\nThis Manual is established to provide the Town's Storm Water Administrator, property\nowners, developers, engineers, surveyors, and builders a better understanding of acceptable\nmethods to meet the intent of the Town's Storm Water Quality Management and Discharge\nControl Ordinance.

For purposes of pollutant\nexport control the Town requires that pollutant exports be controlled to the Maximum Extent\nPracticable on all new commercial, industrial, and other non-residential development and on\nresidential developments where the new development will ultimately disturb one or more\nacres. New development does not include agriculture, mining, or forestry activities. Land\ndisturbance is defined to include grubbing, stump removal, and/or grading.\n6.2 Calculating Total Pollutant Exports\nThe Town program requires computation of the pollutant export of four indicator\nconstituents, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total suspended solids (TSS), and\nfecal coliforms (FC). Table 6.1 presents average export rates of each of those constituents for\nkey combinations of land cover and management practices.

These forms document the\nexpected annual export of each of the four indicator constituents for the predevelopment\n(SW-004) and post development (SW-005) conditions. In order to prepare form SW-004 it is\nnecessary to determine the area within the development parcel that is currently in each of the\nland cover and management classifications shown in Table 6.1. The classifications in the\ntable are general and the table may not present an exact description of the current land cover\nand management present on a given site. In those cases, the best match in the table for the\ncurrent land use and management should be used. For each land cover classification the area\nis multiplied by the appropriate constituent export coefficient to produce the expected annual\nexport of each of the four indicator constituents.\nForm SW-005 must be completed in a similar manner with the land cover and management\nselections appropriately representing the ultimate built-out conditions of the parcel. If the\ndevelopment is to occur in multiple stages and a new storm water permit will be obtained for\neach stage, then form SW-005 should reflect ultimate buildout conditions for the current\ndevelopment phase. Updated forms will then need to be submitted for each phase of\ndevelopment.\nExamples of the use of forms SW-004 and SW-005 follow:\nExample 1: Single Residential Lot\nGiven:\nSingle Residential Lot that is currently 75% forested and 25% meadow or fallow.\n1.5 acres total, 2,000 sf footprint of the new house plus a 600 sf outbuilding and a 15'x\n40' concrete driveway.\nRoof drains onto pervious lawn.\n25% of the lot will remain forested, the remainder will be graded and replaced with\nresidential lawn.\nDeveloped as single family residence with an on-site septic system.\nForms SW-004 and SW-005 completed for the above described development are shown on\nthe following page. Comparing the two forms it can be noted that total nitrogen exports are\nexpected to increase from 0.9 to 13.6 lbs/year; total phosphorus exports will increase from\n0.06 to 1.07 lbs/year; total suspended solids are expected to increase from 93 to 124 lbs/year;\nand fecal coliforms exports are expected to increase from 8.2 to 10.5 (109 colony units /\nyear).\nAugust 2021\n44\n"}, {"page": "423", "text": "Brunswick County, North Carolina\nPollutant Export Calculations\nPre-Development Conditions Form (SW-004)\nStep 1: Determine appropriate codes for each type of land use and management from Table 6.1 and enter in Column 1.\nADAL\nStep 2: Determine the area for each type of land use and management and enter in Column 2.\nCAROLINA\nStep 3: Enter the pollutant export coefficients from Table 6.1 for each land use type in columns 3, 5, 7, and 9.\nStep 4.

LID can be described as the effort to create a\nhydrologically functional landscape in a developed area that mimics the natural hydrologic\nregime. This objective is accomplished by:\nMinimizing storm water impacts to the extent practicable. Techniques to accomplish this\ninclude reducing imperviousness, conserving natural resource and ecosystems,\nmaintaining natural drainage courses, reducing use of pipes, and minimizing clearing and\ngrading.\nProviding runoff storage measures dispersed uniformly throughout a site's landscape with\nthe use of a variety of detention, retention, and runoff practices.\nMaintaining predevelopment time of concentration by strategically routing flows to\nmaintain travel time and control the discharge.\nImplementing effective public education programs to encourage property owners to use\npollution prevention measures and properly maintain the on-lot hydrological function\nlandscape management practices.\n7.1.1 LID Strategies\nThe Town is reviewing its ordinances, operations and practices in order to better manage\nstorm water from its properties and the Town expects developers and property owners\napplying for Storm Water Permits to use LID strategies in their site designs and storm water\nmanagement plans. Some of the strategies that can provide for improved storm water\nmanagement and for the reduction of the total pollutant exports include:\nReducing Road and Driveway Widths\nReducing road and driveways widths reduces the amount of impervious area of a site.\nRoads are often designed at widths that are excessive, and sometimes even\ncounterproductive, for vehicular safety. Overly wide roads inadvertently increase\nimpervious area that, in turn, increases storm runoff and the transport of nutrients and\nother pollutants. Applicants for Storm Water Permits should show that they have\nconsidered road and driveway widths and have appropriately reduced them while\nmaintaining a minimum consistent with health, safety requirements, and the\nrequirements of the Town's Land Use Ordinance.\nReducing Parking Areas\nSimilar to road and driveway widths, parking areas (both the number and size of\nspaces) often are designed with no consideration of the storm water and water quality\nimpacts of those facilities. Some methods that may be used to reduce the impervious\narea created by parking facilities are use of angled parking and smaller parking spaces\nand the use of pervious parking materials.\nAugust 2021\n51\n"}, {"page": "430", "text": "Parking facilities do not have to be visually unappealing and, fortunately, many of the\nmethods used to reduce the unpleasant visual impacts of parking facilities can be\nincorporated into its water quality mitigation plans. Depressed, rather than raised,\nparking lot islands and median strips not only enhance the aesthetic value of the area,\nbut can also serve a functional purpose for water quality enhancement. These\ninterruptions in the impervious parking lots can have vegetative filter strips to receive\npavement runoff or contain bioretention areas or other engineered BMPs.\nPorous pavements can be used in parking lots to reduce the amount of runoff and\ndecrease the required size of associated BMP structures.\nMinimizing Use of Curb and Gutter\nCurb and gutter are often used in areas where they are not required for storm water\ncontrol and where alternative designs such as grass swales are feasible. In the\napplication for a Storm Water Permit, the applicant should present information about\nthe development's street design procedures and should show that alternatives to curb\nand gutter have been considered. Useful alternative approaches include designs that\nallow sidewalk, driveway, and parking lot flows to drain into grass swales or\nbioretention areas, away from street gutter and pipe systems. These systems should\nuse flush surface curbstones that allow sheet flow off of the impervious surface while\nproviding lateral support for the pavement. Where both curb and gutter are necessary,\nthe use of frequent curb cuts, which divert a designed portion of the runoff onto\nvegetated areas, should be considered.\nCluster and Open-Space Developments and \"Traditional\" Neighborhood\nDevelopments.\nAmong the strategies for improved storm water management are the use of innovative\ncommunity and subdivision designs that can significantly reduce the impact of new\ndevelopment on water quality and on required municipal services. The Town will\nencourage these innovations by review of its current Land Use Ordinance and require\nstorm water management BMP design review as part of the site review process. The\nNorth Carolina State Model Program for the Neuse River system defines \"traditional\"\nneighborhoods as rectangular block development with mixed residential and\ncommercial land use. Such neighborhoods can have the advantage of reducing\nautomobile travel and promoting increased usage of alternative transportation modes,\nincluding mass transit and pedestrian. The use of these LID design concepts is\nencouraged in Town of Shallotte.\nMaintaining Green Space\nHow a development and its residents manage green space has an important impact on\nwater quality. In dense urban settings, rain gardens can be used to reduce runoff from\nbuildings and create a pleasant environment. Rain garden systems consist of piping\nroof storm water into a cistern that bleeds the water into a nearby, vegetated area.\nFiltration through the vegetation and the soil removes pollutants from the water and\nreduces the impacts of the impervious roof area.

This BMP can be\nimplemented in many ways, including:\nLeaving a 2 or 3 feet wide pervious strip between the edge of a street and the beginning of\ndriveways.\nUsing pervious pavement stones along strips of a parking lot and in sections of sidewalks.\nEnsuring that rooftop drain water passes over a pervious strip before running onto a paved lot\nor into a Storm Water collection system.\nThese simple techniques are valuable methods for reducing both the quantity of storm\nwater leaving a project and improving the quality of that storm water.\nOther\nOther areas in which Town land use ordinances can have significant impacts on water\nquality are property setback requirements and lot size zoning. Excessive setback and\nlot size requirements have the impact of decreasing the compactness of development,\nwhich can increase the overall impervious area, decrease the applicability of some\nBMPs, and increase the use of automobile transportation. While large-lot zoning may\nbe desirable for water quality impacts in some sensitive areas and for other reasons, it\ncan negatively impact water quality when applied as a uniform standard.\nReferences:\nLow-Impact Development Design Strategies, An Integrated Design Approach, Prince\nGeorge's County, Maryland Department of Environmental Resources, January 2000.\nBetter Site Design, An Assessment of the Better Site Design Principles for Communities\nImplementing Virginia's Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act, Center for Watershed Protection,\nInc, Ellicot County, Maryland 21043.\nAugust 2021\n53\n"}, {"page": "432", "text": "Principles of Low-Impact Design\nConservation of Natural Areas\n1.

The above-described site planning BMPs are useful in controlling\nthe generation of storm runoff and reducing the concentrations of pollutants in the runoff.\nConstructed BMPs may then be used to collect, direct, filter, and biologically treat the runoff.\nAppendix I of this manual contains Storm Water Technology Fact Sheets on many of the\nstructural BMPs that may be used to control storm water runoff and quality. Storm Water\nPermit applicants should use the design criteria given in those fact sheets, in the latest version\nof the North Carolina Storm Water Management Guidance Manual (North Carolina\nCooperative Extension Service and NC DENR), in the Maryland Storm Water Design\nManual (Maryland Department of the Environment), and the information given below in\ntheir design of structural BMPs.\n8.2 Allowable BMPs and Pollutant Reduction Factors\nThe following items are among the constructed BMPs that may be used to further reduce and\ncontrol runoff and pollutant export and that may be incorporated into a applicant's Storm\nWater Management Plan.\n8.2.1 Wet Detention Ponds (WDP)\nThese are ponds designed to have a permanent water pool with a 3-foot minimum average\ndepth and a temporary pool that retains the volume of runoff produced by at least the first 1\"\nof rainfall for a period of 2 to 5 days. When WDPs are incorporated into a project's Storm\nWater Management Plan there are several health, safety, and aesthetic issues that must be\naddressed by the plan, including:\nSince a WDP maintains a minimum depth of 3 feet or more, there is the safety concern\nassociated with drowning. In some cases, fencing may be required to exclude children from\nthe pond. Because of the requirements for a low-sloped shelf at the edges of a WDP, the\nsafety concerns can often be limited to the pond forebay and outlet.\nInsect breeding within the WDP may create health and nuisance concerns. The Town of\nShallotte Health Department recommends stocking certain fish species to reduce the number\nof nuisance insects. Other useful techniques include installation of spray aerators and other\nmeans of regularly disturbing the pond's surface.\nWDPs often attract wildlife. In many situations that is a positive impact, but it also may\nbecome a nuisance. This is particularly a problem with respect to waterfowl and the\naccumulation of large amounts of fecal matter. In some areas there may be concerns about\nthe attraction of dangerous wildlife.\nWater and wind move debris and trash into the WDP and cause unsightly conditions. Routine\nmaintenance should include a regular cleaning schedule and cleaning after significant storm\nevents.\nAugust 2021\n59\n"}, {"page": "438", "text": "For a WDP to continue operating, it is necessary to remove accumulated sediments every two\nto five years.

All of the health, safety, and aesthetic\nconcerns for WDPs are relevant to Storm Water Wetlands. Despite their similarities, Storm\nWater Wetlands are generally more costly to design and construct than are Wet Detention\nPonds. Much of the additional cost is related to the fact that much care is taken in developing\na diverse, healthy, and ecologically stable wetland.\nThe health and safety issues listed in the above discussion of WDPs must also be addressed\nfor Storm Water wetlands.\nFor purposes of computing the total pollutant export reductions due to the installation of a\nStorm Water Wetland designed to retain the runoff from at least the first 1\" of rainfall, under\nnormal antecedent moisture conditions, for a period of not less than 72 hours, the following\npollutant export reduction factors may be assumed:\n8.2.3 Extended Dry Detention Ponds\nDry Detention Ponds (DDPs) are a common storm water management facility.

Runoff is conveyed as sheet flow to the BA, where it\npasses through a sand bed and into a vegetated shallow ponding area that exfiltrates the flow.\nExcess runoff is diverted away from the BA. BAs can take many forms and can be designed\nto fit a variety of site layouts. BAs are particularly suitable BMPs for median strips, parking\nlot islands, and swales where grading or excavation will already be occurring and there will\nbe no additional environmental damage.\nThe aesthetic value of the BA is substantial, because several varieties of groundcover, bush,\nand tree species are suitable for different sections of the BA. The BA can provide shade and\nwind breaks, absorb noise, and improve the area's landscape. Strategic placement of BAs can\nsignificantly reduce costs by eliminating the need for extensive storm drainage pipe systems.\nLimitations for site selection include avoiding areas with high water tables (< ft below\nground surface), unsuitable soils, or large slopes (> 20 percent). Some maintenance is\nrecommended including periodic inspection of the overall condition and the health of\nvegetation, pruning, application of an alkaline product to counteract soil pH reduction by\nacidic storm water, and aesthetic maintenance such as weeding and replacing mulch.\nRain gardens are one particularly appropriate BA design for smaller scale areas such as\ncommercial buildings or residential homes. Rain gardens consist of piping roof storm water\ndrainage into a cistern that bleeds the water into a nearby vegetated area. Filtration through\nthe vegetation and the soil removes pollutants from the water and reduces the impacts of the\nimpervious roof area.\nFor purposes of computing the total pollutant export reductions due to the installation of a\nBA designed to fully retain the runoff from at least the first 1\" of rainfall, under normal\nAugust 2021\n61\nCELL (1, 1): \nPollutant\nCELL (1, 2): \nBMP export reduction factor\nCELL (2, 1): \nTotal Nitrogen\nCELL (2, 2): \n10%\nCELL (3, 1): \nTotal Phosphorus\nCELL (3, 2): \n20%\nCELL (4, 1): \nTotal Suspended Solids\nCELL (4, 2): \n50%\nCELL (5, 1): \nFecal Coliforms\nCELL (5, 2): \n40%\n"}, {"page": "440", "text": "antecedent moisture conditions, the following pollutant export reduction factors may be\nassumed.\n8.2.5 Riparian Buffers\nA Riparian Buffer established and managed consistent with the Neuse Riparian Buffer Rules\n(15A NCAC 2B. 0233) can be used as a pollutant export reducing BMP.

They may be above or below ground structures with their design parameters\nbeing determined primarily from design runoff volumes, available space, and soil and\ngroundwater conditions. Use is limited in areas with soils of low permeability and where the\ngroundwater table is close to the ground surface.
