But if a nonconforming use is\nmaintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall\nterminate the right to maintain it thereafter. And so, if a mobile home is used as a nonconforming use on a residential lot\nwhere a conforming residential structure also is located, removal of that mobile home for 180 days terminates the right to\nreplace it.\n(E) The provisions relating to the 180-day period of discontinuance of use shall not apply to rental property normally\n"}, {"page": "36", "text": "rented on a seasonal basis.\n('85 Code, \u00a7 15-4.5) (Ord. 33, passed 10-5-81; Am.
