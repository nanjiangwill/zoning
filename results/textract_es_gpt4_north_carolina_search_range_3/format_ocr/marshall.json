Conditional Zoning districts, herein established,\nare intended to accommodate such situations. This voluntary procedure is\nintended for firm development proposals, and is neither intended nor suited for\nsecuring early zoning for tentative uses which may not be undertaken for a long\nperiod of time.\n(C) Just as there are eight (8) base zoning districts, there are eight (8) corresponding\nConditional Zoning Districts.\nTOWN OF MARSHALL UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n3-12\nCELL (1, 1): \n(1) CZ OSR - Conditional Zoning Open Space and Recreational\nCELL (1, 2): \n(1) CZ OSR - Conditional Zoning Open Space and Recreational\nCELL (1, 3): \n(1) CZ OSR - Conditional Zoning Open Space and Recreational\nCELL (2, 1): \n(2) CZ R-1 - Conditional Zoning Low Density Residential\nCELL (2, 2): \n(2) CZ R-1 - Conditional Zoning Low Density Residential\nCELL (2, 3): \n(2) CZ R-1 - Conditional Zoning Low Density Residential\nCELL (3, 1): \n(3) CZ R-2 - Conditional Zoning Medium Density Residential\nCELL (3, 2): \n(3) CZ R-2 - Conditional Zoning Medium Density Residential\nCELL (3, 3): \n(3) CZ R-2 - Conditional Zoning Medium Density Residential\nCELL (4, 1): \n(4) CZ R-3 - Conditional Zoning High Density Residential\nCELL (4, 2): \n(4) CZ R-3 - Conditional Zoning High Density Residential\nCELL (4, 3): \n(4) CZ R-3 - Conditional Zoning High Density Residential\nCELL (5, 1): \n(5) CZ MU - Conditional Zoning Mixed Use\nCELL (5, 2): \n(5) CZ MU - Conditional Zoning Mixed Use\nCELL (5, 3): \n(5) CZ MU - Conditional Zoning Mixed Use\nCELL (6, 1): \n(6) CZ CB - Conditional Zoning Central Business\nCELL (6, 2): \n(6) CZ CB - Conditional Zoning Central Business\nCELL (6, 3): \n(6) CZ CB - Conditional Zoning Central Business\nCELL (7, 1): \n(7) CZ HB - Conditional Zoning Highway Business\nCELL (7, 2): \n(7) CZ HB - Conditional Zoning Highway Business\nCELL (7, 3): \n(7) CZ HB - Conditional Zoning Highway Business\nCELL (8, 1): \n(8) CZ I - Conditional Zoning Industrial\nCELL (8, 2): \n(8) CZ I - Conditional Zoning Industrial\nCELL (8, 3): \n(8) CZ I - Conditional Zoning Industrial\n"}, {"page": "33", "text": "CHAPTER 3 - ZONING DISTRICTS\n3.5.2 Applicability\n3.6\nOverlay Districts\n3.6.1 Gateway Overlay (G-O)\n(A)\nThe intent of the Gateway Overlay is to create town entrances that are integral\nto an outsider's perception of the Town.

In order to protect life and property, the following\ntable recommends defensible space distances for different types of vegetation based on slope.\nWithin this defensible space, vegetation should be extensively pruned or cleared in order to\nminimize loss in the event of wildfire.\nRECOMMENDED DEFENSIBLE SPACE DISTANCES\nSource: Minimizing Wildfire Risk: A Forest Landowner's Guide.
