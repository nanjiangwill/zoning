The watershed protection\nstandards adopted by the Town of Hillsborough utilize a combination of these two\napproaches.\n4.5.3.11.a Non-Structural Stormwater Control\n(a) The first inch of stormwater run-off shall be controlled to the extent\npossible through on-site filtration and through the use of methods which\nrely on natural soil properties for absorption and treatment.\n(b) In order to promote infiltration of stormwater runoff into the soil and\nminimize direct and immediate runoff into streams and water supply\nimpoundments, the maximum percentage of the total lot area that may be\ncovered with an impervious surface shall be specified. This limit is referred\nto as the \"impervious surface ratio\".\n(c) Impervious surface calculations for an individual development shall be\ncumulative for original construction and any subsequent additional. One-\nhalf of the width of any existing or proposed road adjacent to an\nindividual lot shall be included as impervious surface for that lot, except in\nthe case where an existing road was contained within a dedicated public\nright-of-way on October 1, 1993. Infiltration techniques not only remove\nboth suspended and dissolved pollutants, but they require less\nmaintenance, reduce flooding, promote groundwater recharge, and help\nmaintain stream flow during dry periods.\n(d) Where on-site infiltration methods are utilized, areas for such purposes\nshall be designated on the plat and shall remain undisturbed both during\nand after construction.\n(e) Undisturbed areas for infiltration of run-off shall also be located down\nslope from impervious surfaces and shall not include areas characterized\nby floodplains, highly erodible or impervious soils, steep slopes or\npreviously disturbed areas. Areas designated as suitable for septic\nnitrification fields may not be used for stormwater infiltration purposes.\n(f) Run-off from roads, parking lots, and/or sidewalks shall be directed to\nundisturbed areas through use of berms, grassed diversion ditches or\nswales, or other acceptable means to reduce run-off velocity and filter out\npollutants.\nSection 4: Zoning Districts 4-16\n"}, {"page": "82", "text": "Hillsborough Unified Development Ordinance\n4.5.3.11.b Structural Measures\n(a) Non-structural methods may not adequately control the first inch of\nstormwater runoff due to the amount of impervious surface proposed to\nbe developed, and other factors such as soil type, slope, presence of\nfloodplains and erodible soils, and/or lack of vegetative cover. In such\ncases, structural detention ponds, which capture stormwater for slow\nrelease through an outlet, are required.\n(b) All stormwater control structures shall be designed by either a North\nCarolina registered professional engineer or landscape architect, to the\nextent that the General Statutes, Chapter 89A, allow.

This Ordinance may establish other\nstandards for specific circumstances or situations, which specific standards supersede these general\nrules.\n9.1.2 DISTANCE MEASUREMENTS, GENERALLY\nUnless otherwise expressly stated, distances between points specified in this Ordinance are to be\nmeasured as the length of an imaginary straight line joining those points. Unless otherwise expressly\nstated, measurements determining the spacing between uses are to be taken from property line to\nnearest property line as a straight-line measurement.\n9.1.3 LOT MEASUREMENTS\n9.1.3.1\nLot Area\nThe area of a lot includes the total horizontal surface area within the lot's boundaries\nexclusive of rights of way or easement for streets (public or private) or access to other\nproperty. Utility and similar encumbrances are included in the lot area.\n9.1.3.2\nLot Width\nLot width is the distance between the side lot lines measured along the front building\nsetback line. In cases where a structure is \"condominiumized,\" or the interior floor area of a\nstructure is owned by different owners, the zoning district lot width requirements shall apply\nonly to the parent tract or development site, not the individual ownership units.\nThe permit issuing authority may allow the creation of new residential lots that do not meet\nthe minimum lot width requirement at the front setback line if the sole reason for not\nmeeting the minimum width is due to the reduced lot frontage on the public or private road\ncreated by the end of a cul de sac, provided the required lot width is met\nwithin 75' measured from the edge of the right of way.

For example, if a development tract contains 4.5 acres that\ntranslates to 196,020 SF. If that development tract is zoned R-10, 19.6 dwelling units would\nbe the yield on that tract. Nineteen lots could be created from this parcel, assuming they all\nmet the other dimensional requirements in the ordinance.\n9.1.4.2\nFor sites being developed as attached dwellings, in cases where a site's acreage allows a\ngross density that exceeds a whole number by 0.51 or more, the total density may be\nrounded up to the next whole number, thus allowing an additional dwelling unit to be\nlocated on a site.\n9.1.5 SETBACKS\nSetbacks are defined for each zoning district in Section 6.3, Dimensional Requirements.
