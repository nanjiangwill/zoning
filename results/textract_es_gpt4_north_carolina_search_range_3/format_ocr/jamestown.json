Town Manager\nAnna Hawryluk\nTown Planner\nPREFACE\nThis Land Development Code (LDC) constitutes a republication of the general and permanent land development ordinances of the Town of Jamestown, North Carolina.\nSource materials used in the preparation of the republication is the Land Development Ordinance as adopted July 21, 2009, and amended through February 16, 2022. The source of each new section and amendments to existing sections is included in\na\nhistory note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is part of the Code as adopted through February, 2022. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this republication, the reader\ncan locate any section of the LDC, as updated.\nThe LDC is arranged into articles and sections. The various sections within each article have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included.\nArticle and Section Numbering System\nEach section number consists of two parts separated by a period. The figure before the period refers to the article number, and the figure after the period refers to the position of the section within the article. Thus, the second section of Article 1 is\nnumbered 1.2, and the first section of Article 7 is 7.1. Under this system, each section is identified with its article. New sections may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject and the next successive number shall be assigned to the new\nsection. In this LDC, subsections at the highest heirarchy level (aligned with the left margin) are also identified with the article and section number. These consists of two parts separated by a dash, e.g., 1.2-1. The figure before the dash refers to the article and\nsection number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the subsection within the section.\nPage Numbering System\nThe page numbering system used in this LDC is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the LDC, e.g., LD4:15. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in\nthat portion. In the case of an article of the republication, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the article. In the case of an appendix to the LDC, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the number of the appendix. The\nfollowing are typical parts of land development codes, which may or may not appear in this republication at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:\nIndex\nThe index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local\ngovernment officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.\nLooseleaf Supplements\nA special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected\npage or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.\nKeeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached\ninstructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.\nAcknowledgments\nThis republication was under the direct supervision of Patience R. Gaia, Editor, of Municode, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.\nThe publisher is most grateful to Anna Hawryluk, Town Planner, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this republication.

Prior to the legislative hearing on an amendment proposed to the text of this ordinance or to the Official Zoning Map, public notice shall be given in a manner consistent with the requirements of G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 160D-601 and 160D-602\nas\napplicable. All proposed amendments shall require publication of a notice of the hearing in a newspaper in general circulation in Jamestown. Such notice shall be published at least once per week for two successive calendar weeks, with the first\npublication being at least ten, but not more than 25, days prior to the date of the hearing. Where an amendment to the zoning map is proposed, additional notice shall be given by first class mail to all owners of property subject to the\namendment and to the owners of all parcels abutting the parcel(s) subject to the amendment, and a notice of the hearing shall be prominently posted on a public street or highway right-of-way adjacent to the parcel(s) subject to the\namendment.

Conditional zoning is established to provide for flexibility in the development of property while ensuring that the development is compatible with neighboring uses. Conditional zoning affords a degree of certainty in land use decisions not\npossible when rezoning to a general use district. Additional standards and regulations may be attached to a proposed development to ensure compatibility with the surrounding uses and with applicable adopted plans in accordance with the\nrequirements of this section.\n5.4-2. Conditional zoning districts. Conditional zoning is available for any of the general zoning classifications enumerated in this ordinance, except for those that require a site-specific development plan as part of the application (e.g., Traditional\nNeighborhood Development District, Campus Overlay District). The conditional zoning designation shall be indicated on all zoning maps and other official documents with the prefix, \"(CZ)\" (e.g., CZ-SFR; CZ-C. etc.).\n5.4-3. General requirements. The following provision shall apply in the administration of conditional zoning.\n(A) A conditional zoning application shall be considered only upon request of the owner of the affected property or duly authorized representative of the property owner.\n(B) Prior to submittal of the application, it is strongly recommended that the applicant meet with representatives of the surrounding property owners and of the surrounding neighborhood(s) to discuss the proposed development and include a\nreport of any such meetings in its application.\n(C) No uses shall be permitted except those enumerated in the ordinance adopting the conditional zoning, including any special uses that may be included as a permitted use in the application.\n(D) The conditions agreed upon pursuant to the conditional zoning approval shall be stated in the adopting ordinance and may limit the uses which are permitted on the property. By way of illustration and not limitation, conditions may specify\nlocation on the property of the proposed structure(s), the number of dwelling units, the location and extent of supporting facilities such as parking lots, driveways, and access streets, the location and extent of buffer areas and other special\npurpose areas, the timing of development, the height of structures, the location and extent of rights-of-way and other areas to be dedicated for public purposes, and other such matters as may be identified as appropriate for the proposed\ndevelopment.\n(E) Minor modifications to the approved conditional zoning ordinance may be approved by the technical review committee. The minor modifications authorized herein are intended to provide relief where conditions established by the conditional\nzoning ordinance create a hardship based upon a unique physical attribute of the property itself or some other factor unique to the property which was not known at the time of ordinance adoption and which has subsequently rendered the\nproperty difficult or impossible to use due to the condition(s) imposed by the zoning. The permit holder shall bear the burden of proof to secure the modification(s). Such modifications shall be limited to the following:\n1. A deviation of up to ten percent or 24 inches, whichever is greater, from the approved setback, provided that the conditions for approving a deviation from the required setback established by Article 14 (Flexible Development Standards) of\nthis ordinance are met.\n2. A reduction of up to 25 percent in the number of parking spaces required for the use provided that the proposed development is located within one-half mile of the Main Street District and on-street parking is available.\n3.\nOther minor modifications (as determined by the planning director) may be considered by the technical review committee. If, in the planning director's opinion, the requested modification exceeds the definition of \"minor\", then\nthe\napplicant must make a request of the town council:\n4. \"Minor\" modifications are defined as:\na. Conditions which decreases the intensity of the land uses proposed on the site greater than ten percent (e.g., number of housing units or gross floor area).\nb. Increase proposed setbacks by ten percent or greater by locating the proposed buildings closer to internal property lines without increasing the setbacks of proposed buildings from public streets.\nC. Significantly increase the visually obscuring buffers along the perimeter of the site (no including toward streets) that includes preserved vegetation, added landscaping, walls and fences, or the use of topography;\nd. Decrease in the traffic impact due to a significant decrease or shift in the number, location, or configuration of access points to or additional road improvements for the development; or\ne. Provide a greater than ten percent increase in the amount of useable or passive open space, tree preservation, greenways or trails provided on the site.\n5. \"Major\" modifications must be approved by the town council as an amendment to the conditional zoning ordinance, and shall be referred to the planning board for their recommendation.\n6. The technical review committee reserves the right in every case to have the discretion to decline to exercise the power to approve or deny modifications as provided for herein and may require the applicant to seek an amendment to the\nconditional zoning ordinance through the normal zoning amendment procedures.\n7. Major modifications are deemed as such when:\na. The condition decreases the number or extent of mixed-use features, including combinations of different land uses, integrate site design, strong pedestrian and vehicle connectivity, and strong orientation of buildings to streets\n(sidewalks);\nb. Decreases the use of compatible design features, including architectural styles and materials, signage and lighting, and site layout, among both internal development and with appropriate adjacent external development;\nC.\nDecreases pedestrian features, including added sidewalks, crosswalks, bus stops, pedestrian amenities, small block site layout or internal and external pedestrian connections;\nor\nd. Changes the use category permitted within any portion of the development.\n(F) Any violation of a provision of a conditional zoning ordinance shall be treated the same as any other violation of this ordinance and shall be subject to the same remedies and penalties as any other such violation.\n(G) If for any reason any provision of a conditional zoning ordinance is found to be illegal or invalid, or if the applicant should fail to accept any condition, the entire ordinance shall be null and void, and the property shall revert to its previous\nzoning classification without further action by the town council.\n(H) If no action has been taken to begin development of the property in accordance with the conditional zoning ordinance within 24 months of its approval by town council, or no vested right has been obtained, then the property shall revert to its\nprevious zoning classification, or the planning director may initiate appropriate action to rezone the affected property to any other classification.\n(I) If the use or uses commenced pursuant to a conditional zoning ordinance adopted pursuant to this section are abandoned or discontinued or no vested right has been obtained then the property shall revert to its previous zoning classification,\nor the planning director may initiate appropriate action to rezone the affected property to any other classification.\n(J)\nNo variances or special use permits may be issued for developments on property that is subject to a conditional zoning ordinance.\n5.4-4. Application Procedure. When applying for conditional zoning, the owner shall specify the nature of the proposed development and shall propose conditions to ensure compatibility with the surrounding uses and consistency with adopted plans.\n20 of 150\n10/24/2023, 12:54 PM\n"}, {"page": "21", "text": "Jamestown, NC Land Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nApplications for conditional zoning shall be processed, considered, and voted upon using the same procedures and subject to the same requirements as those established in this Code for zoning map and zoning text amendments, except as\nprovided below:\n(A) The application should include site plans, landscape plans, building elevations, floor plans, and such other information required to provide the approving bodies with a complete and accurate description of the proposed development.\n(B) The planning board shall hold a public hearing on applications for conditional zoning. Notice of the public hearing shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of the requirements of this ordinance for map amendments. After holding\nthe public hearing, the Jamestown Planning Board may recommend approval of the application, including recommending conditions for the zoning; recommend denial of the application; or continue the consideration of the application in order\nto receive further information regarding the application. In those cases where, upon hearing the application, the planning board feels that more information is needed, questions have arisen, or other circumstances occur in which additional\ntime is needed to enable the board to make a decision, consideration of the application may be continued. The planning board may, by majority vote of members present, continue the consideration of the application until the next scheduled\nplanning board meeting. The board shall direct the appropriate person(s) to obtain the needed information, provide answers to questions, etc. During this time to enable the board to make a decision at the next scheduled meeting.\n(C) Upon receipt of the recommendation and statement of consistency from the planning board, the town council shall hold a legislative hearing on the application for conditional zoning. Notice of the hearing shall be provided in accordance with\nthe provisions for hearings for map amendments as set forth in Section 5.3-3 of this ordinance and the North Carolina General Statutes.\n(D) The town council's consideration of an application for conditional zoning is legislative in nature, and the council may consider any relevant information in its deliberations. Consideration shall be given to the comprehensive plan, small area\nplans, corridor plans, and other land use policy documents, and to surrounding land uses. The council may adopt or deny a conditional zoning ordinance or may continue its consideration of the application as necessary or appropriate. During\nthe adoption of a conditional zoning ordinance, specific conditions may be proposed by the petitioner, town council, planning board, or town staff, but only those conditions mutually agreed to by the town council and the petitioner may be\nincorporated into the zoning regulations and permit requirements. Conditions and site-specific standards imposed in a conditional zoning district shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the development and use of the site to\nTown ordinances, an officially adopted comprehensive or other plan and those that address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site.\n(E)\nA statement of consistency and a statement analyzing the reasonableness of the proposed rezoning and whether such rezoning is in the public interest shall be adopted for each conditional zoning district in the same manner that such are\nadopted for a general zoning map amendment.\n(F) Upon adoption of a conditional zoning ordinance, the Official Zoning Map of the Town of Jamestown shall be amended to add the conditional zoning district. The planning director shall maintain a file for conditional zoning ordinances, and each\nconditional zoning ordinance shall be filed therein. Failure to comply with this provision shall not render the ordinance invalid.\n(G) The conditional zoning ordinance adopted as provided herein shall be perpetually binding upon the affected property unless subsequently changed or amended as provided for in this ordinance.\n(H) Specific conditions may be proposed by the petitioner or the local government or its agencies, but only those conditions approved by the local government and consented to by the petitioner in writing may be incorporated into the zoning\nregulations. Unless consented to by the petitioner in writing, in the exercise of the authority granted by this section, a local government may not require, enforce, or incorporate into the zoning regulations any condition or requirement not\nauthorized by otherwise applicable law, including, without limitation, taxes, impact fees, building design elements within the scope of G.S. \u00a7 160D-702(b), driveway-related improvements in excess of those allowed in G.S. \u00a7 136-18(29) and G.S.\n160A-307, or other unauthorized limitations on the development or use of land. Conditions and site-specific standards imposed in a conditional district shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the development and use of the\nsite to local government ordinances, plans adopted pursuant to G.S. 160D-501, or the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site. (G.S. 160D-703(b)).\n(I) Conditional zoning ordinances are legislative in nature, and judicial review of conditional zoning ordinances shall be as provided by law for zoning ordinances.\nSec. 5.5 Development Agreements.\n5.5-1. Purpose.\nDevelopment agreements may be used to define the rights and obligations of the town, developers, and property owners in large-scale, multi-phased projects where mitigation of impacts, quality of design, and integration with town resources are better\nsecured through a document that enables all parties to work out details through deliberate discussions prior to review by the town council.\n5.5-2. Approval.\nDevelopment agreements shall be approved as provided in G.S. 160D-1001 et. seq. A copy of the development agreement in final form shall be posted on the town's website for public inspection for the length of time required by statute. The posting of a\ndevelopment agreement in final form does not prevent the town from making changes in response to public input or council deliberation.\n5.5-3. Authority and limitations.\nConsistent with the purposes of PUD zoning, development agreements that accompany a PUD zoning district application may be used to create alternative development and technical standards provided that the result is a development of greater or\nhigher quality as described in LDO Section 8.4-5.1(B). Any development standard in the LDO may be supplanted by other requirements in a development agreement to achieve the intended purposes of the PUD zoning district if approved by the town council.\nDevelopment agreements may not be used to alter the public review and approval processes established in the LDO or required by statute.\n( Ord. No. 2023-01 Pt. 3, 1-17-2023)\nARTICLE 6 VARIANCES AND ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS\nSec. 6.1. Variances.\n6.1-1. Purpose. The variance process administered by the board of adjustment is intended to provide limited relief from the requirements of this ordinance in those cases where strict application of a particular requirement will create a practical difficulty\nor unnecessary hardship prohibiting the use of land in a manner otherwise allowed under this ordinance. It is not intended that variances be granted merely to remove inconveniences or financial burdens that the requirements of this ordinance\nmay impose on property owners in general or to increase the profitability of a proposed development. Rather, it is intended to provide relief where the requirements of this Code render the land difficult or impossible to use because of some\nunique physical attribute of the property itself or some other factor unique to the property for which the variance is requested.\n6.1-2. Provisions That May Not Be Varied By the Board of Adjustment.

Zoning Districts Created\nThe following districts are created; this listing is in order of intensity of development permitted within the district, from least intense to most intense:\nAgriculture (AG)\nParks and Recreation (PNR)\nSingle Family Residential (SFR)\nMulti-Family Residential (MFR)\nResidential/Main Street Transitional (R/MST)\nCommercial/Main Street Transitional (C/MST)\nMain Street Periphery (MSP)\nMain Street (MS)\nCivic (CIV)\nCommercial (C)\n30 of 150\n10/24/2023, 12:54 PM\n"}, {"page": "31", "text": "Jamestown, NC Land Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nBypass (BD)\nIndustrial (IND)\nPlanned Unit Development (PUD)\nIn\naddition to the standard zoning districts, the following overlay districts are created to provide for more creativity in the development of land and/or to protect unique features of the Town:\nTraditional Neighborhood Development Overlay (TND)\nCluster Development Overlay (CDO)\nScenic Corridor Overlay (SCO)\nCampus Overlay (CO)\nSec. 8.3 Description of Zoning Districts.\nThe zoning districts created by this ordinance are described as follows:\n(A) The Agriculture District (AG) is established to protect lands used for agricultural production and related activities. Farmland is a defining element of Jamestown's identity and the protection of these lands aids in preserving the character of the\nTown. Permitted uses are limited, with an emphasis on uses that are agricultural in nature. Development density is very low to encourage preservation of agricultural lands while discouraging large lot residential development. The Agriculture\nDistrict can also be used to protect open spaces.\n(B)\nThe Parks and Recreation District (PNR) is intended primarily for town-owned properties utilized, or planned for, public parks and recreation facilities. Allowed building/lot types in this district are urban workplace and civic. Properties in this\ndistrict are primarily for use and enjoyment by the public as open space and/or recreation facilities and may include golf courses, public parks, trails, and other similar open spaces.\n(C) The Single-Family Residential District (SFR) provides for the completion of existing residential neighborhoods and the development of new residential neighborhoods in a pattern that encourages the wise use of land. Allowed building/lot types\nin the Single-Family District are detached house and civic building. Permitted uses are restricted to single family homes and their accessory uses, a limited number of related uses that serve the residential neighborhoods, and civic uses.\nNeighborhoods in this district are the dominant land use in Jamestown and are a major element in defining the character of the community.\nStandards for the Single-Family Residential District ensure that new development maintains the character of the community. The Single-Family Residential District permits the completion and conformity of conventional residential subdivisions\nalready existing or approved in sketch plan form by the Town of Jamestown prior to the effective date of these regulations. For new subdivisions, the Town encourages the clustering of development and protection of open space though the\nuse of the Cluster Development Overlay District.\n(D) The Multi-Family Residential District (MFR) ensures the conformity of existing multifamily residential neighborhoods and provides for the development of new multi-family residential neighborhoods in a pattern that encourages the wise use\nof\nland. Allowed building/lot types in the Multi-Family District are attached house and multifamily. Neighborhoods in this district consist primarily of currently existing multi-family developments. Standards for the Multi-Family Residential District\nensure that new development maintains the character of the community. The Multi-Family Residential District permits the completion and conformity of existing multi-family residential subdivisions already existing or approved in preliminary\nplat or sketch plan form by the Town of Jamestown prior to the effective date of these regulations. For new subdivisions or multi-family developments, the Town encourages the clustering of development and protection of open space though\nthe use of the Cluster Development Overlay District.\n(E) The Residential/Main Street Transitional District (R/MST) provides for primarily infill residential development in the existing residential area(s) surrounding the Main Street Periphery District and its logical extensions The intent of this district is\nto allow for a gradual transformation of existing low-density single-family development to high quality medium-density residential development, as a higher density residential development is needed to support the growing town center.\nHigher\ndensity residential development allows a greater number of households to walk or bike to the town center, thus reducing the parking demand in the downtown and providing environmental and health benefits. Allowed building/lot types in\nthis\ndistrict are the detached house, attached house, and civic building. Streets in the Residential/Main Street Transitional District should be interconnected, with streets and sidewalks providing a connection from Jamestown's downtown to the\nSingle-Family Residential Districts. A range of housing types is encouraged.\n(F) The Commercial/Main Street Transitional District (C/MST) is established to accommodate existing and proposed uses located along that portion of West Main Street located to the west of the downtown between Dillon Road and Scientific\nStreet. Development in this district accommodates a range of uses in a single-family home style development pattern, transitioning from the Main Street Districts to residential districts and commercial districts. Allowed building/lot types are\nsingle family detached and civic building. Standards in the Commercial/Main Street Transitional District are established to encourage new development, revitalization, reuse, and infill development in a manner that accommodates a range\nof\nuses while preserving historic development patterns and being sensitive to the adjacent districts. A range of uses, including retail, office, and residential, is permitted.\n(G) The Main Street Periphery District (MSP) provides for the development and maintenance of a range of uses in areas adjacent to Jamestown's downtown. Allowed building/lot types in this district are shopfront, multi-family cluster, detached\nhouse, attached house and civic building. In this district, the development pattern integrates retail, office, civic, educational, religious, and residential uses in an environment that is pedestrian friendly while acknowledging the role of the\nautomobile as a means of transportation. Street and sidewalk networks providing multi-modal transportation options connect the Main Street Periphery District to the downtown and to surrounding neighborhoods. The Main Street Periphery\nDistrict provides an area for the expansion of the Main Street District.\n(H) The Main Street District (MS) provides for new development, revitalization, reuse, and infill development in Jamestown's traditional downtown. A broad array of uses is permitted to enable the needs of residents and visitors to be met. Allowed\nbuilding/lot types in this district are urban workplace, shopfront, attached house, detached house and civic building. The development pattern seeks to integrate shops, restaurants, services, workplaces, civic, educational, and religious facilities,\nand higher density housing in a compact, pedestrian-oriented environment. The Main Street District serves as the hub of the surrounding neighborhoods and of the broader community. The Main Street District may be expanded over time to\nmeet the needs of the growing community for downtown facilities and services.\n(I) The Civic District (CIV) provides a location for large educational, medical, and public uses in a campus like environment. Large developments in the Civic District are encouraged to provide a master plan to the Town and request approval of the\nCampus Overlay District designation. Institutional uses in the Civic District are required to provide pedestrian connections on their campuses and, to the extent possible, develop an internal street system with structures fronting on the streets.\nParking should not be the dominant visible element of the campuses developed for institutional uses.\n(J) The Commercial District (C) is established to provide for uses in areas where the dominant mode of transportation is the automobile. The auto-oriented street, lot, and building designs can create uncomfortable pedestrian environments\nAllowed building/lot types are Highway Commercial and Civic Building. Dominant uses in this district are retail and office. The Commercial District is expected to serve Jamestown residents as well as persons who travel from surrounding\ncommunities. The development pattern in this district acknowledges the role of the automobile, with parking and access provided to ensure safety for the motoring public. Development standards in the Commercial District ensure the creation\nof a pleasant auto-oriented environment while enabling a compatible transition to uses in adjacent districts.\n(K)\nThe Bypass District (B) is established to provide opportunities for compatible and sustainable development along the future Jamestown Bypass. Access to buildings in this district is provided through a secondary street network. The secondary\nstreet network is both auto-oriented and pedestrian oriented. Development standards in the Bypass District acknowledge that the automobile is the primary mode of transportation. Development and design standards encourage pedestrian\nscale development along the secondary street network. Goals of the Bypass District include providing a pleasant environment for motorists, a safe environment for pedestrians along the secondary streets; ensuring the safety of motorists and\npedestrians; and preserving the capacity of the bypass to accommodate high traffic volumes at high speeds. Uses in this district include services, employment, residential and industrial. Allowed building/lot types include urban workplace,\nshopfront commercial, multi-family cluster, attached house and civic building.\n(L)\nThe Industrial District (IND) is established to provide locations for industrial uses that, due to the scale of the buildings and/or the nature of the use, cannot be integrated into the community. Uses within the Industrial District are buffered from\nadjacent uses. The dominant uses in this district are manufacturing and warehouse storage. Small scale manufacturing and storage that is compatible with less intensive uses can and should be located in other districts. The Industrial District is\nreserved for uses which require very large buildings and/or large parking and loading facilities. Allowed building and lot types are highway commercial and civic building.\n(M) The Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay District (TND) provides for the development of new neighborhoods and the revitalization or extension of existing neighborhoods. These neighborhoods are structured upon a fine network of\ninterconnecting pedestrian-oriented streets and other public spaces. Traditional Neighborhood Developments (TNDs) provide a mixture of housing types and prices, prominently sited civic or community building(s), stores/offices/workplaces,\nand churches to provide a balanced mix of activities. A Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) has a recognizable center and clearly defined edges; optimum size is a quarter mile from center to edge. A TND is urban in form, is typically\nan extension of the existing developed area of the town and has an overall residential density of four to 12 dwelling units per acre. TND districts should have a significant portion of land dedicated to open spaces.\n(N) The Cluster Development Overlay District (CDO) permits buildings to be clustered or grouped on site, parcel, or property in order to optimize the use of land and resources. By clustering development, projects developed in accordance with\nthese standards can obtain density bonuses while preserving unique natural features, efficiently providing infrastructure such as water, sewer, and streets, and organizing buildings on a site in manner that promotes efficient multi-modal\ntransportation. The Cluster Development Overlay District mandates the dedication of open space with density bonuses provided as an incentive for adhering to the standards. It is the intent of this district to be used for new development in\nundeveloped areas of the town and in already developed areas with low building value to land value ratios. Allowed building/lot types are multi-family, detached house, attached house, and civic building.\n(O) The Scenic Corridor Overlay District (SCO) is established to protect the pastoral scenes and open spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and visitors traveling the major entrance roads and gateways to the town. The pastoral scenes\nand undeveloped property along the entrance roads and gateways contribute significantly to Jamestown's community character and sense of place. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District provides development options for the owners of the\nproperty abutting the entrance roads and gateways. The goal of this district is to protect the scenic value of the corridors through a mix of incentives and development standards. These standards will preserve the rural character of the town by\nmaintaining the sense of a rural corridor in an urban environment; provide an aesthetically appealing experience for those traveling the corridor; provide multi-modal transportation options for travel; and ensure a safe transportation corridor\nfor motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. The detached house lot/building type is allowed in this district.\n(P) The Campus Overlay District (CO) is established to enable large institutional uses such as colleges, secondary schools, and medical facilities to develop their campuses in accordance with a master plan. Basic standards are established for the\ncampus master plan, which, upon approval by the town of Jamestown, shall become the regulating plan for the development of the campus. Pedestrian access and interconnected streets within the campus are guiding principles within\nthe\nCampus Overlay District. The civic building and urban workplace are the allowed lot/building types in this overlay district. To the extent possible, buildings should front on the internal street system.\n(Q) The Planned Unit Development (PUD) district recognizes that some projects on large tracts require much greater flexibility to enable applicants to create higher quality projects than are otherwise possible under the strict applications of the\nLDO and to promote a compatible mix of uses to instigate an integrated and sustainable development consistent with the town's unique character. This district shall also encourage and make possible design flexibility; multi-modal connectivity\nbetween uses; sensitivity to natural resources and environmental features; and facilitate the efficient provisions of infrastructure, utilities and adequate public facilities. The PUD district is not intended for use with subdivisions or developments\nwhich can be developed under the strict application of the minimum standards of the LDO, thereby resulting in a unique, high quality overall development. The specific procedures for review and approval of a PUD are found in section 8.4-5.1\nPlanned Unit Development. Above all, every PUD established, shall demonstrate consistency with the goals and policies established in the Town of Jamestown Land Development Plan and be designed to achieve greater protections\nof\nenvironmentally sensitive areas, architectural controls not normally associated with rezoning conditions, and other higher-quality standards. Most commonly, the PUD district would serve as a base zoning for larger-scale commercial,\nresidential and mixed-use developments which may include overlay districts such as the Traditional Neighborhood (TND) Overlay District. A PUD shall enable an applicant the flexibility to create its own development standards and not to be\nrestricted by existing LDO provisions if the result is a project that is found by the town council to be a higher quality project.\n31 of 150\n10/24/2023, 12:54 PM\n"}, {"page": "32", "text": "Jamestown, NC Land Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nOrd.

Rental and leasing of any commodity shall be permitted under the same classification and in the same districts as are sales of that commodity, unless rental or leasing of that commodity is listed separately in the Permitted Use Schedule.\n4. If facility involves two (or more) activities with different SIC codes on the same zone lot, the facility shall be permitted only in those zoning districts where the more restricted activity is permitted.\nSec. 8.4. Zoning District Development Standards.\nThe following development standards are established for each of the zoning districts to ensure the orderly development of the Town of Jamestown.\n8.4-1. Agriculture District (AG),\n(A)\nIntent. The Agriculture District (AG) is established to protect lands used for agricultural production and related activities. Farmland is a defining element of Jamestown's identity and the protection of these lands aids in preserving the character\nof the Town.

Allowed\nbuilding/lot types in the Multi-Family District are attached house and multifamily. Neighborhoods in this district consist primarily of currently existing multi-family developments. Standards for the Multi-Family Residential District ensure that\nnew development maintains the character of the community. The Multi-Family Residential District permits the completion and conformity of existing multi-family residential subdivisions already existing or approved in preliminary plat or sketch\nplan form by the Town of Jamestown prior to the effective date of these regulations.

The Residential/Main Street Transitional District provides for primarily infill residential development in the existing residential area(s) surrounding the Main Street Periphery District and its logical extensions. The intent of this district is to\nallow for a gradual transformation of existing low-density single-family development to high quality medium-density residential development, as a higher density residential development is needed to support the Jamestown's growing\ndowntown. Higher density residential development allows a greater number of households to walk or bike to the town center, thus reducing the parking demand in the downtown and providing environmental and health benefits. Allowed\nbuilding/lot types in this district are the detached house, attached house, multifamily, and civic building. Streets in the Residential/Main Street Transitional District should be interconnected, with streets and sidewalks providing a connection\nfrom Jamestown's downtown to the Single-Family Residential Districts.

The Traditional Neighborhood Development Overlay District provides for the development of new neighborhoods and the revitalization or extension of existing neighborhoods. These neighborhoods are structured upon a fine network\nof interconnecting pedestrian-oriented streets and other public spaces. Traditional Neighborhood Developments (TNDs) provide a mixture of housing types and prices, prominently sited civic or community building(s), stores, offices,\nworkplaces, and churches to provide a balanced mix of activities. A Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) has a recognizable center and clearly defined edges; optimum size is a quarter mile from center to edge. A TND is urban in form,\nis\ntypically an extension of the existing developed area of the town and has a residential density of four to 12 dwelling units per acre.\n(B) Permitted uses.\n1. Uses permitted by right:\nSee Table of Uses (Table 8.1).\n2. Uses permitted with additional standards:\nSee Table of Uses (Table. 8.1).\n3.

Building placement, parking placement, building type, urban form, access, and lot arrangement shall be controlled by the lot and building type standards (Article 9) for the lot and building types permitted in the Traditional\nNeighborhood Development District and by the standards set forth in Section 8.5-11.F(5) below.\n2. Along existing streets, new buildings shall respect the general spacing of structures, building mass and scale, and street frontage relationships of existing buildings.\nNew buildings which adhere to the scale, massing, volume, spacing, and setback of existing buildings along fronting streets exhibit demonstrable compatibility.\nNew buildings which exceed the scale and volume of existing buildings may demonstrate compatibility by varying the massing of buildings to reduce perceived scale and volume.\n3. On new streets, allowable building and lot types will establish the development pattern.\n4. A master plan in compliance with traditional neighborhood development standards shall be provided with the zoning permit submittal for a general district TND or with the application for reclassification to a conditional TND zoning\ndistrict. The master plan shall include a topographic survey and shall show the location and hierarchy of streets and public open spaces, location of residential, commercial, and civic building lots, street sections and/or plans, a master\nsign program, an outline of any additional regulatory intentions, phasing, and any other information, including building elevations, which may be required to evaluate the interior pedestrian environment and conditions at project edges.\n5. Maximum development size: 200 acres\n6. Tracts larger than 200 acres shall be developed as multiple traditional neighborhood developments, each individually subject to all provisions.\n7. Maximum permitted densities: There shall be no maximum density in the TND.\n8. In addition to the requirements established by the lot type standards and building type standards, the following standards shall apply for properties wishing to be developed in accordance with the standards for the Traditional\nNeighborhood Development District:\n(G) TND design provisions.\n1. Neighborhood form.\nThe descriptions of traditional neighborhood building and lot types in Article 9 will determine the general arrangement and distribution of elements in a TND.\nThe area of the TND shall be divided into blocks, streets, lots, and open space.\nSimilar land uses shall generally front across each street. Dissimilar categories shall generally abut at rear lot lines. Corner lots which front on streets of dissimilar use shall generally observe the setback established on each fronting\nstreet.\n2. Streets.\nPublic streets shall provide access to all tracts and lots.\nStreets and alleys shall, wherever practicable, terminate at other streets within the neighborhood and connect to existing and projected streets outside the development. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 250 feet in length, must be accessed\nfrom a street providing internal or external connectivity, shall be permanently terminated by a vehicular turnaround, and are permitted only where topography makes a street connection impracticable. In most instances, a \"close\"\nor\n\"eyebrow\" is preferred to a cul-de-sac. Vehicular turnarounds of various configurations are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately provided. Pedestrian connections shall be provided as extensions of terminating streets\nor as public access easements where not precluded by topography or other physical constraints.\n39 of 150\n10/24/2023, 12:54 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nMinimum\nLot Size\nCELL (1, 2): \nMinimum\nLot Width\nCELL (1, 3): \nMinimum\nFront Yard\nCELL (1, 4): \nMinimum\nRear Yard\nCELL (1, 5): \nMinimum\nSide Yards\nCELL (1, 6): \nMinimum\nCorner Lot\nSide Yard\nCELL (2, 1): \n10,000 SF\nCELL (2, 2): \n100'\nCELL (2, 3): \n10'\nCELL (2, 4): \n10' or as required by Building/Lot\ntype\nCELL (2, 5): \n5' or as required by Building/Lot\ntype\nCELL (2, 6): \n10' or as required by Building/Lot\ntype\nCELL (1, 1): \nMinimum\nLot Size\nCELL (1, 2): \nMinimum\nLot Width\nCELL (1, 3): \nMinimum\nFront Yard\nCELL (1, 4): \nMinimum\nRear Yard\nCELL (1, 5): \nMinimum\nSide Yards\nCELL (1, 6): \nMinimum\nCorner Lot\nSide Yard\nCELL (2, 1): \n45,000 SF\nCELL (2, 2): \n100'\nCELL (2, 3): \n5'\nCELL (2, 4): \n5'\nCELL (2, 5): \n0'\nCELL (2, 6): \n5'\n"}, {"page": "40", "text": "Jamestown, NC Land Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nThe average perimeter of all blocks within the TND should not exceed 1,350 feet. No block face should have a length greater than 500 feet without a dedicated alley or pathway providing through access.\nA continuous network of rear alleys is recommended for all lots in a TND; rear alleys shall provide vehicular access to lots 60 feet or less in width.\nUtilities may run along alleys.\nTND streets shall be organized according to a hierarchy based on function, size, capacity, and design speed; streets and rights-of-way are therefore expected to differ in dimension. The proposed hierarchy of streets shall be indicated\non\nthe submitted site plan. Each street type in a TND shall be separately detailed. Street types as described in the Town of Jamestown Standards and Specifications Manual identify the street types permitted in TND. An array of elements\nthat are combined to meet the purposes of TND neighborhood streets: building placement line, optional utility allocation, sidewalk, planting strip, curb and gutter, optional parallel parking, and travel lane(s). Alternative methods of\nassembling the required street elements will be considered to allow neighborhood street designs that are most appropriate to setting and use.\nTo prevent the buildup of vehicular speed, disperse traffic flow, and create a sense of visual enclosure, long uninterrupted segments of straight streets should be avoided. Methods to achieve this interruption include: (1) street can\nbe\ninterrupted by intersections designed to calm the speed and disperse the flow of traffic (see Town of Jamestown Standards and Specifications Manual) and terminate vistas with a significant feature (building, park, natural feature); (2) a\nstreet can be terminated with a public monument, specifically designed building facade, or a gateway to the ensuing space; (3) perceived street length can be reduced by a noticeable street curve where the outside edge of the curve is\nbounded by building or other vertical elements that hug the curve and deflect the view; (4) other traffic calming configurations are acceptable so long as emergency access is adequately provided.\n3. Buildings and lots.\nAll lots shall share a frontage line with a street or square; lots fronting a square shall be provided rear alley access.\nConsistent build-to lines shall be established along all streets and public space frontages; build-to lines determine the width and ratio of enclosure for each public street or space. A minimum percentage build-out at the build-to line\nshall be established on the plan along all streets and public square frontages.\nBuilding and lot types shall comply with the descriptions provided in Article 9.\nLarge-scale, single use facilities (conference spaces, theaters, athletic facilities, etc.) shall generally occur behind or above smaller scale uses of pedestrian orientation. Such facilities may exceed maximum first floor area standards if\nso\nsited.\n4. Open space. Open space is defined as any area which is not divided into private or civic building lots, streets, rights-of-way, parking, or easements for purposes other than open space conservation. The provision and design of open\nspace shall comply with the requirements set forth in Article 21.\n5. Parking, landscaping and buffers. Parking shall comply with the requirements set forth in Article 12. Landscaping, including required buffers, shall comply with the requirements set forth in Article 11.\n8.5-2. Cluster Development Overlay ( (CDO),\n(A) Intent. The Cluster Development Overlay District permits buildings to be clustered or grouped on a site, parcel, or property in order to optimize the use of land and resources. By clustering development, projects developed in accordance with\nthese standards can obtain density bonuses while preserving unique natural features, efficiently providing infrastructure such as water, sewer, and streets, and organizing buildings on site in a manner that promotes efficient multi-modal\ntransportation. The Cluster Development Overlay District mandates the dedication of open space with density bonuses provided as an incentive for adhering to the standards. It is the intent of this district to be used for new development in\nundeveloped areas of the Town and in already developed areas with low building value to land value ratios. Allowed building/lot types are multi-family, detached house, attached house, and civic building. Within cluster development overlay\ndistricts, development may comply with the standards set forth in this section or with the standards of the underlying zoning district.\n(B) Applicability. The cluster development provisions set forth below may be applied, upon designation of the property as a Cluster Development Overlay District, to properties with a minimum lot size of two acres in all residential and agricultural\nzoning districts. The provisions of this section shall not be applicable in platted and recorded residential subdivisions where 75 percent or more of the homes within the subdivision have improvements that equal or exceed the land value\n(based on Guilford County Tax Department assessed values).\n(C) Permitted uses.\n1.

The following development standards shall apply to cluster developments approved in accordance with the provisions of this section:\n1. Maximum density shall be 150 percent of that permitted in the underlying zoning district.\n2. There shall be a minimum separation of 12 feet between all enclosed structures.\n3. Parking shall comply with the requirements set forth in Article 12, and shall not be located within 25 feet of an adjoining street right-of-way or property line except that parking may be closer than 25 feet from an adjoining street right-of-\nway if the parking is located beneath a building, with the parked vehicle entirely hidden from view from any right-of-way or property line.\n4. Building placement, parking placement, building type, urban form, access, and lot arrangement shall be controlled by the lot and building type standards (Article for the lot and building types permitted in the Cluster Development\nOverlay District.\n5. In addition to the requirements established by the lot type standards and building type standards, the following shall apply in the Cluster Development Overlay District:\n(G) Landscaping and buffers. Landscaping, including required buffers, shall comply with the requirements set forth in Article 11.\n(H) Open space. Not less than 40 percent of the site shall be conveyed as common open space. Open space is defined as any area which is not divided into private or civic building lots, streets, rights-of-way, parking, or easements for purposes\nother than open space conservation. In addition to the requirements listed below, the provision and design of open space shall comply with the requirements set forth in Article 21.\n1. Common open space provided by a cluster development shall be conveyed as follows:\na. To the Town of Jamestown and accepted by it for park, open space, agricultural, or other specified use or uses, provided that the conveyance is approved by the town council; or\nb. To a nonprofit organization whose principal purpose is the conservation of open space, to a corporation or trust owned or to be owned by the owners of lots or dwelling units within the cluster development, or to owners of shares\nwithin a cooperative development. If such a corporation or trust is used, ownership shall pass with the conveyances of the lots or dwelling units. Such corporation or trust shall maintain the property as open space.\n2. Where the common open space in a residential cluster development is conveyed pursuant to subparagraph 1.b above, a deed restriction enforceable by the Town of Jamestown shall be recorded that provides that the common open space\nshall:\na.

Scenic Corridor Overlay (SCO).\n(A) Intent. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District is established to protect the pastoral scenes and open spaces that provide a sense of arrival for residents and visitors traveling the major entrance roads and gateways to the Town. The pastoral\nscenes and undeveloped property along the entrance roads and gateways contribute significantly to Jamestown's community character and sense of place. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District is meant to protect Jamestown's community\ncharacter and heritage by preserving the historic development patterns along the Town's entrance roads and gateways while providing development options for the owners of the property abutting the entrance roads and gateways. The goal of\nthis district is to protect the scenic value of the corridors through mix of incentives and development standards. These standards will preserve the rural character of the Town by maintaining the sense of a rural corridor in an urban\nenvironment; provide an aesthetically appealing experience for those traveling the corridor; provide multi-modal options for travel: and ensure a safe transportation corridor for motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians.\n(B) Types. Three types of scenic corridors are hereby created:\n1. Rural scenic corridor. A corridor along which development is limited, consisting largely of fields, pastures, and scattered residential uses. The rural scenic corridor evokes a sense of traveling through an undeveloped area, with pastoral\nscenes and a sense of being removed from the urban environment.\n2. Gateway scenic corridor. A corridor that serves as an entrance way to place that is unique and different from other communities in the area. The gateway corridor provides a sense of arrival to a place that is special and different from the\ntypical places. The gateway scenic corridor may be more developed than the rural scenic corridor, but the character of the development is such that those using the corridor are aware they are in a special place.\n3. Bypass scenic corridor. A corridor providing for buffering of the bypass to protect the traffic carrying capacity of the road and to provide for a pleasant experience for motorists using the bypass. The bypass scenic corridor requires an\nundeveloped setback from the bypass, ensuring that the bypass through Jamestown is unique and portrays the character of the community while enhancing the safety of motorists using the road.\n(C) Permitted uses.\n1. Uses permitted by right.\nSee Table of Uses (Table_ 8.1).\n2. Uses permitted with additional standards.\nSee Table of Uses (Table 8.1).\n3. Uses permitted with conditions.\nSee Table of Uses (Table_\n(D) Permitted building and lot types.\nDetached house\nCivic building\n(E) Permitted accessory uses.\nAccessory structures (upon approval by town council as a special use)\nFences\n(F) Permitted residential density.\nFour units/acre. (Residential buildings shall not be located within the scenic corridor easement.)\n(G) General requirements.\n1. Development pattern. Building placement, parking placement, building type, urban form, access, and lot arrangement shall be controlled by the lot and building type standards (Article_9 for the lot and building types permitted in the Scenic\nCorridor Overlay District.\n2. Activities permitted in the scenic corridor. In order to preserve the aesthetic quality of the scenic corridors, uses and activities within the designated scenic corridors shall be limited to the following:\na. The scenic corridor easement may be used for passive recreation, agricultural uses, and equestrian uses. No other use shall be permitted within the scenic corridor easement.\nb. No building construction, parking, land disturbing activity, signs, tree removal, lighting (other than street lighting provided by the Town of Jamestown and driveway or private road lighting provided that said lighting is provided by full\ncutoff fixtures), or other development activity shall occur within the scenic corridor easement except as follows:\nA bikeway, greenway, and/or other pedestrian/bicycle facility may be located within the scenic corridor easement.\nUnderground utilities and easements for underground utilities may be located within the scenic easement, provided that no above ground transmission or other equipment is located within the scenic easement.\nBuildings used primarily for agricultural and/or equestrian related activities may be built in the scenic corridor easement upon approval by the town council as a special use. Parking shall be located behind the building, shall not\nbe\nlocated within the scenic easement, and shall be buffered from the scenic corridor. The town council shall consider the following items in making the decision to allow aforesaid buildings in the scenic easement:\nThe building's visual impact on the scenic corridor;\nThe building's size;\nThe compatibility of the building's architecture with community character and the purposes of the scenic corridor overlay district.\n3. Scenic corridor dimensions. The designated scenic corridors shall meet the following dimensional standards:\nThe width of the scenic easement within the rural scenic corridor shall be ten percent of the lot depth but no more than 100 feet from the edge of the public right-of-way. The planning director may require an additional scenic depth of up\nto 50 feet in order to preserve structures and/or vegetation deemed to be significant.\na. The width of the scenic easement within the gateway scenic corridor shall be ten percent of the lot depth but no more than 50 feet from the edge of the highway right-of-way. The planning director may require an additional depth of up\nto 25 feet in order to preserve structures and/or vegetation deemed to be significant.\nb. The width of the scenic easement within the bypass scenic corridor shall be ten percent of the lot depth but no more than 75 feet from the edge of the public right-of-way. The planning director may require an additional depth of up to\n25 feet in order to preserve structures and/or vegetation deemed to be significant.\n4. Scenic corridor provisions. The following provisions shall govern development within a designated scenic corridor:\na. The area within the scenic easement may be dedicated to the Town as a conservation easement, provided it meets the standards for such an easement as established by applicable state and federal standards.\nb. Development density shall be calculated for the entire property, including the area within the scenic easement, with the exception that development density bonuses of up to 50 percent are given for the portion of the property within\nthe scenic easement. In the event that the property owner provides a scenic easement wider than required by this ordinance, the density bonus may be increased up to 75 percent for the area located within the scenic easement. For\nexample, Joe Jones owns a ten-acre property zoned single family residential (SFR). Two acres of his property are within the Scenic Corridor Overlay. His density is calculated as follows:\nBase density @ 4 units/acre x 10 acres 40 units 50% density bonus for 2 acres in scenic corridor easement\n50% (2 acres x 4 units/acre) 4-unit bonus\nTotal Density 44 units\nIf Mr. Jones provides an easement wider than required, then he would receive a 75% density bonus for the area within the easement:\nBase density @ 4 units/acre x 10 acres 40 units 75% density bonus for 2 acres with wider easement\n75% (2 acres x 4 units/acre) = 6-unit bonus Total Density 46 units\nC.\nDevelopment may be clustered on the portion of the property located outside the scenic easement. When cluster development is used, it shall follow the Cluster Development Overlay District regulations as outlined in Section 8.4 of\nthis\nordinance.\n5. Curb cuts. There shall be a minimum separation of 500 feet between curb cuts in the rural scenic corridors. This separation requirement may be waived by the planning director if the width of the property frontage would preclude a second\ncurb cut meeting this spacing requirement\n6. Lot requirements. The lot type standards and building type standard permitted in the underlying district, as set forth in Section and further described in Article 9, shall apply in the Scenic Corridor Overlay District.\n(H) Open space. Open space is defined as any area which is not divided into private or civic building lots, streets, rights-of-way, parking, or easements for purposes other than open space conservation. The provision and design of open space shall\ncomply with the requirements set forth in Article 21. Land within the scenic easement may count for up to 100 percent of the open space required by Article 21 of this ordinance.\n(I) Parking and landscaping. Parking shall comply with the requirements set forth in Article 12. Landscaping shall comply with the requirements set forth in Article 11.\n8.5-4. Campus Overlay (CC\n(A)\nIntent. The Campus Overlay District provides for the development of campuses for large institutional uses (secondary schools, colleges, and medical facilities) over time in accordance with an approved master plan. Basic standards\nare\nestablished in this section for campus developments and for the campus master plan, which, upon approval by the Town of Jamestown, shall become the regulating plan for the development of the campus. Pedestrian access and\ninterconnected streets within the campus, with an internal street system, are guiding principles within the Campus Overlay District. The civic building and urban workplace are the allowed lot/building types in this overlay district. To the extent\npossible, buildings should front on the internal street system. The standards set forth in this section ensure that the campuses of large institutional uses fit seamlessly into the community, with the campus becoming an extension of the Town\nrather than an isolated island within the Town.\n41 of 150\n10/24/2023. 12:54 PM\n"}, {"page": "42", "text": "Jamestown, NC Land Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\n(B) Applicability.

The standards set forth below are established to ensure that new development and construction is\ncompatible with the character of the Town of Jamestown, that it accomplished the purposes of this ordinance, and that it achieves the goals identified in the Town's comprehensive plan and other plans.\nSec. 9.2. Detached House Lot and Building Type.\n9.2-1. Description. The detached house is the most prevalent building type in Jamestown. The detached house building type is generally found in residential neighborhoods, although it may coexist with other, similarly scaled buildings in commercial or\nmixed-use areas. Where possible, structures shall be designed to maintain a harmonious image of the neighborhood when viewed from a distance. Where appropriate and possible, structures shall be designed to terminate vistas. Within the limits\ndescribed below, these regulations shall apply to all houses built on public streets. For detached homes on large lots accessed by a private drive-in rural areas, building placement and site planning shall be dictated by landscape features and\nlandscape preservation.\nThe photograph below is an example for illustration purposes only and is not intended to regulate lot/building styles, patterns, or forms.\n9.2-2.

The Southside neighborhood in Greensboro provides a good contemporary example.\nGenerally, building plans will have narrow frontages with the plan depth being greater than its width. Groups of attached house buildings that are not integrated into a pedestrian oriented mixed-use urban pattern shall not be permitted within\nJamestown.\nAttached house structures should complement the neighborhood through their design, location on the site, and building materials.\n43 of 150\n10/24/2023, 12:54 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \n3. Along existing streets and in the Single-Family Residential District, the minimum lot width and front, side, and\nrear setbacks of new buildings shall be equal to the average setbacks of existing buildings on the same side of\nthe street within 400'. However, if there are 2 or less buildings within 400' on the same side of the street from\nthe subject parcel, the standards for new streets apply.\n4. In the Residential/Main Street Transitional District, where the average setback of existing buildings within\n400' exceeds 35', the setback of any new building may be up to 20' closer to street ROW from the setback of an\nadjacent building, existing or proposed, in order to negotiate a gradual transition to a more urban development\npattern.\n5. Building placement may be further defined by zoning districts.\n6. Accessory structures shall be located at least 5' behind the primary structure and shall have a minimum 6'\nside and rear setback.\n7. Only in the most exceptional circumstances having to do with extreme topography or very special design\ncomposition may the rules of residential building placement be varied.\nCELL (1, 2): \n4.

The planting islands or medians shall be a\nminimum size of 200 square feet with no dimension smaller than five feet and an average width of ten feet.\nMIN.200\n15QFT.\nCEBE\nMIN\n(F)\nMultiple parking bays. When there are more than four bays of parking, an interior island with an average width of 20 feet and a length equivalent to the parking bay shall be constructed. It shall include a pedestrian walkway five feet or more\nwide and a planted strip on one or both sides. The median should be located in such a way as to enhance pedestrian circulation within the development, leading to the entrance or to an adjacent sidewalk.\n(G) Perimeter parking. All continuous runs of 15 or more parking spaces shall be interrupted by a tree island.\n(H) Grouping. Shrubs and trees may be grouped or clustered in the required planting yards, except for the perimeter landscaping adjacent to parking lots, outside storage, access drives, and loading and unloading areas. The remainder of the\nmaterials shall be distributed throughout the planting yard. There shall be at least one row of evergreen shrubs or evergreen understory trees in all Type A planting yards.\n(I) Distance from trees to parking spaces. All parking spaces shall be no greater than 40 feet from a tree unless a continuous eight-foot minimum width landscape island runs the length of the parking lot. If such an island is constructed, then no\nspace shall be greater than 60 feet from a tree.\n(J) Plant protection. Whenever planting areas are adjacent to parking lots or drives, such areas shall be protected from damage by vehicles, lubricants, or fuels. Curbing or some other structural barrier is required to be placed around trees within\nfive feet of a car bumper. Allowances may be made if rain gardens are incorporated into the planting area. Trees and shrubs in islands should be set back at least three feet from the curb to allow for the operation of car doors.\n(K) Industrial parking lots. Parking lots in IND zoning districts may appeal to TRC under \"equal or better\" performance standards to allow flexibility for interior plantings, due to the nature and size of vehicles using these lots.\nTele\nSec. 11.7. Reforestation of Slopes Steeper than 3:1.\n11.7-1. Tree Cover Required Areas having slopes steeper than 3:1 must be reforested to provide tree cover over the entire area. The following standards apply:\n-\n62 of 150\n10/24/2023, 12:54 PM\n"}, {"page": "63", "text": "Jamestown, NC Land Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\n(A) Reforestation shall include a minimum of one tree per 200 square feet of surface area and shall be made up of a mixture of deciduous hardwood and evergreen trees that are a minimum of 12 inches high at planting and approved by the\nplanning director.\n(B) The trunk of any required tree shall be no closer than ten feet from any other existing tree.\nSec. 11.8. Tree Conservation and Protection.\n11.8-1.\nPurpose of Tree Conservation Area. The purpose of the TCA (tree conservation area) is to encourage the preservation of healthy trees that are four inches or greater in diameter at breast height (DBH).\n11.8-2. Tree Conservation Area Determination. The TCA shall be provided in accordance with the chart below. If trees of four inches or greater DBH exist within or partially within these areas, such trees must be saved to the extent possible. The area will\nbe designated a TCA and shall not be disturbed except as allowed herein.\n11.8-3. Tree Conservation Area Selection.\n(A)\nIn selecting which existing tree stands are to be designated as TCA, the landowner shall give due consideration to building, parking lot, driveway, street, and utility location as they relate to the practicality of preservation and shall use the\nfollowing tree preservation priority list:\n(1) Existing stands of mature hardwoods as highest priority, then\n(2) Existing stands of younger hardwoods, then\n(3) Existing specimen trees (as determined by the planning director), then\n(4) Existing stands of hardwoods and pine mix, and lastly\n(5) Existing stands of Pine trees. Preservation of a single pine tree is not typically encouraged.\n(6) TCA must be principally free of invasive species (i.e., do not save \"kudzu\" infested areas).\n(7) TCA must be a minimum of 50 feet in width and separated by a minimum buffer of 20 feet from any disturbed area. This area may be cleared, but a minimum 10-inch base of wood chips topped with a heavy, non-skid plywood or chain link\nfence panels must be placed over this area to prevent soil compaction.\npreserved\nstand of trees\n(B) If is necessary to pick among two or more stands of trees within a category listed above, the following priority list shall be used:\n(1) Type A buffer yards, as a first priority, then\n(2) Type B buffer yards, then\n(3) Type C buffer yards, then\n(4) Type D buffer yards, then\n(5) Street tree yards, and lastly\n(6) Vehicular use areas.\n(C)\nSmaller Trees: Trees less than four inches DBH within the TCA may be preserved at the landowner's option and counted toward buffer yard, street tree, or vehicular use are requirements.\n11.8-4. Tree Conservation Flexibility Standards. Flexibility can be granted in the following circumstances:\n(A) Trees in sensitive areas. If there are trees that meet the TCA requirements on other areas of the site (riparian buffers, stream corridors, floodplains, etc.), the landowner may request that the required TCA be designated around such trees\ninstead of the usual locations.\n(B)\nStream buffer credits. Properties falling under the stormwater management control requirements, which are required to maintain an undisturbed stream buffer, may use some of or the entire buffer to satisfy the required TCA, provided that\nthe undisturbed stream buffer contains trees that are a minimum of four inches in DBH.\n(C) Land dedication. Land dedicated to the Town that is contiguous to the property being developed may be used towards the tree preservation requirement, if the dedicated land contains trees that are a minimum of four inches in DBH.\n(D) Reforestation credits. In situations where TCA requirements cannot be met based on-site conditions and when approved by the planning director, reforestation efforts on the property can be used to satisfy up to 50 percent of the required TCA.\n(E) Reduction in the amount of TCA required for specimen tree preservation within the lot. To allow developers the flexibility to manipulate the location of required tree conservation areas, and to encourage the preservation of certain specimen\ntrees or tree stands within developed lots rather than just at the periphery, the planning director may, at his or her discretion, allow the developer the right to reduce the total amount of required TCA using the following table:\n(F) Waivers. The tree board shall have the authority to allow reduced buffer yards or to waive the buffer yard requirements to allow for a greater TCA in another area or make other exceptions, which meet the cause and intent of this section.\nAdditionally, if the tree board concludes that due to existing unusual or unique site characteristics, preserving some or all required trees in the TCA(s) would create an undue or unreasonable hardship, the protection of some or all of required\ntrees in the TCA(s) may be waived.\nApplicants for such a waiver shall submit their request in writing, along with any necessary site plans to demonstrate the hardship. The application shall be submitted at least 12 days prior to the next regularly scheduled tree board meeting, in\norder for the board to hear the request at that meeting. The findings of the tree board shall be final and binding to all parties. Appeals of the tree board's decisions may be made to the board of adjustment, following the procedure outlined in\narticle 6 of this ordinance.\nCELL (1, 1): \nTable 11.3\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \nSize of Parcel\nCELL (2, 2): \nTCA Required to Include\nCELL (3, 1): \n0-55,000 sq. ft.\nCELL (3, 2): \nOne percent of lot area and located within the required planting yard\nCELL (4, 1): \n55,000 sq. ft. 5 acres\nCELL (4, 2): \nOne and one-half percent of lot area.

Buffer Yards. All trees of appropriate size and type preserved in the TCA that are within the buffer yard shall be credited toward meeting all or part of the buffer yard requirements. The protection of tree stands, rather than individual trees, is\nstrongly encouraged.\n11.9-2. Street Trees. Existing preserved trees may count toward 100 percent of the street tree requirement, providing there is no more than 65 feet between trees.\n11.9-3. Parking Lots. For new, expanded, or rebuilt parking lots where trees are being preserved adjacent to the parking lot in order to meet the parking lot planting requirements, trees preserved in a TCA and within 15 feet of the parking lot may be used\nto satisfy up to 50 percent of the required number of parking lot trees. Non-TCA trees located within the parking area may count towards 100 percent of the requirement. Trees in the TCA counted toward planting yard requirements may not count\nfor required parking lot trees.\n11.9-4. Tree Health. No credit will be allowed for any dead tree, any tree in poor health, or any tree subjected to grade alterations. Trees should have a life expectancy of greater than ten years and have a relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive\ndecay, major insect, or pathological problems.\n11.9-5. Tree Replacement. Except for storm damage, the death of any tree used for preservation credit within five years of site development shall require the landowner to plant new trees equal to the number of credited trees. After five years any trees\nthat were used for preservation credit that die shall be replaced.\n11.9-6. Calculation of Credit. Credits are to be given in accordance with the chart below.\n11.9-7. Protection of Existing Trees. To receive credit, trees must be protected from direct and indirect root damage and trunk and crown disturbance. The following standards shall apply:\n(A) Critical root zone. To preserve existing trees within the designated TCA, the Critical Root Zone (CRZ) of the trees shall be preserved. The CRZ will include a radius around the tree equal to or at least one foot for every one inch of DBH. It is\nrecommended to preserve the entire CRZ of each preserved tree.\n1. If the entire CRZ cannot be preserved, tree roots must be cut prior to the grading of the site and no closer than ten feet from the tree trunk.\n2. Disturbance within the CRZ will be allowed only on one side of the tree(s) to be saved and only with prior approval by the planning director.\n3. Construction site activities such as parking, material storage, dirt stockpiling, concrete washout, and other similar activities shall not be permitted within the TCA.\n4. The same land uses can encroach in the TCA as established in the buffer yards, Section 11.6, provided there is no disturbance to the CRZ of the preserved trees.\n5. Changes that significantly raise the grade of soil adjacent to the TCA shall be avoided.\n6.\nUtility line trenches and similar uses shall avoid the TCA. Due to certain site conditions, where disturbance within the TCA is unavoidable, underground tunneling or directional boring of utilities is preferred and allowed on one side only.\nTrenching shall be used only as the last alternative and root-pruning equipment specifically designed for that purpose shall be used. The planning director shall be notified prior to this type of activity and an on-site meeting shall be\nperformed to ensure compliance. See the Town of Jamestown Standards and Specifications Manual for trenching detail.\n7. Protective fencing shall be installed around the TCA prior to any tree disturbing activities. Such fences shall be at least four feet high and shall consist of orange polyethylene safety fencing. Fencing shall remain in place until construction is\ncomplete and other landscaping has been installed, and the planning director has approved its removal. See the Town of Jamestown Standards and Specifications Manual for fencing detail.\n8. The TCA should be designated as such with \"Tree Conservation Area\" signs (in both English and Spanish) posted visibly on the outside of the fenced-in area. Signs may not be posted on the trees.\n(B) Tree removal inside the TCA. Trees less than four inches DBH not being preserved, undergrowth and plant material in poor condition may be removed from the TCA. No roots shall be removed from the TCA. Stumps may be removed only\nby\ngrinding. All requests for tree removal within the TCA must have prior approval by the planning director pursuant to the provisions of this article. Any tree within the TCA, including the CRZ, which the landowner chooses to remove or that must\nbe removed due to poor health or impractical means of preservation shall be removed in a manner that is in accordance with standard arboricultural practice (see ANSI Standards) so as to cause as little disturbance or harm to those trees\nintended to be saved as practical. However, in an emergency situation due to storm damage; to alleviate an immediate hazard to the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens; or to repair property damage, prior approval for tree removal in\npreviously approved designated areas is not required.\n(C) Tree conservation plan procedures. Approval of tree protection plan is required for all projects, except those listed in exemptions, and shall be submitted along with all other necessary drawings to the technical review committee. Tree\nprotection items shall be included on all grading plans, erosion control plans, and tree disturbance permit plans. Upon approval of the plan, a tree disturbance permit will be issued prior to any tree-disturbing activities.\nSec. 11.10 Activities Requiring a Tree Disturbance Permit.\n11.10-1. Purpose. Except as otherwise exempted herein, it shall be unlawful to:\n(A) Remove, prune, apply chemicals that are harmful to, or disturb any tree or the soil within the CRZ of any tree; or\n(B) Clear vegetation from a site; or\n(C) Begin any excavation, remove soil, or place fill on a site within Jamestown and its extraterritorial jurisdiction until the planning director has issued a permit certifying that such activity complies with the applicable provisions of this ordinance.\n11.10-2. Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to any development except:\n(A) Routine maintenance of existing vegetation outside the public rights-of-way, such as pruning, watering and fertilizing.\n(B) The removal of dead trees and shrubs or trees and shrubs that have been diagnosed and determined to be diseased beyond treatment, with the burden of proof being placed on the remover.\n(C) Removal of soil or vegetation from undeveloped land to allow for non-commercial open space no greater than one-quarter acre, providing this activity does not take place within the CRZ of any rare or specimen tree.\n(D) Land disturbing activity normally associated with the occupancy of an existing single family or two-family dwelling.\n(E) Any new construction or expansion of a single family or two-family dwelling requiring a building permit and involving land disturbance less than 5,000 square feet, unless the land disturbance is cumulatively over 5,000 square feet.\n11.10-3. Tree Protection Plan Requirements. A tree protection plan for all development projects to which these standards apply, along with all other necessary drawings, shall be submitted to the technical review committee. Tree protection items shall be\nincluded on all grading plans, erosion control plans, and tree disturbance permit plans. Drawings shall identify the following items:\nBoundaries of the required TCA.\nRequired planting yards.\nProtected trees within the TCA including tree size and species.\nCRZ of each proposed protected tree or group of trees.\nLimits of clearing.\nGrading.\nTrenching.\nRequired tree protection measures including protective fencing and signage.\nOverhead and underground utilities, rights-of-way, and easements.\nAreas of reforestation, if any.\nStream buffers, if any.\nA complete survey of all trees on the site (outside the labeled TCA) that exceed 18 inches DBH, including tree size and species.\n11.10-4.

The planning director will conduct follow-up site inspections for enforcement of the tree protection requirements.\n11.10-8. Permit Display, All permits issued hereunder shall be so displayed as to be clearly visible from a public right-of-way. Annual permits shall be kept in all vehicles at the work\nsite.\n11.10-9. Emergency Waiver. The provisions of this section are waived if compliance would hamper the rescue of life or property from immediate danger or the repair of utilities in the event of emergencies such as windstorms, ice storms, or other disasters.\nAny emergency work shall follow the Town's landscape standards and specifications as closely as possible.\nSec. 11.11 Rare and Specimen Trees.\n11.11-1. Rare and Specimen Trees on Developing Land.\n(A) Rare and specimen trees shall be shown on all preliminary landscape protection plans if such trees are within 100 feet of areas where soil disturbance or construction activity is proposed. In addition, these trees shall be identified and located\nby survey on the approved landscape protection plan if such trees are located on the development site or adjacent public property. The planning director may visit the site to determine the accuracy of identification.\n(B) Proposed development shall be designed to preserve rare and specimen trees. Where rare and specimen trees exist, flexible approaches such as adjustments to lot layout, placement of buildings and paved surfaces, and location of utilities\nshall be pursued in order to save them.\n(C) No soil disturbance from construction, trenching, grading, paving, or storage of equipment or materials shall take place within the critical root zone of any rare or specimen tree to be preserved unless the planning director determines there is\nno reasonable way the property can be developed without such disturbance or unless the proposed work will be carried out in accordance with the specifications for such work in the Jamestown Standards and Specifications Manual.\n(D)\nNo rare tree shall be removed from land being developed unless the planning director determines there is no reasonable way the property can be otherwise developed, improved or properly maintained and the tree saved.\n11.11-2. Voluntary Protection of Rare and Specimen Trees on Private Land.\n(A) Rare and specimen trees that are located on individual lots with single and two-family homes shall be protected if voluntarily registered by the property owner.\n(B) Registration of such trees shall survive transfer of ownership if language is contained in the document transferring ownership and shall extend the coverage hereof.\n(C) The owner shall be entitled to consultation with the planning director concerning proper care of the tree.\n(D) Once so registered, trees may be removed from the register at a later date at the request of the property owner.\nSec. 11.12. Land Being Developed (Outside the TCA).\n11.12-1. Protective Fencing,\n(A) Vegetation located outside the TCA that is to be protected on land being developed, as indicated on a landscape protection plan, shall be protected by fences or other equally effective measures during construction activity. Such fencing shall be\nlocated and erected according to town standards and be located as shown on the landscape protection and site grading plans. All land disturbing activity, storage of equipment, building material, soil, and other debris shall be kept within the\narea of development activity and outside of the protective fencing.\n(B) Vegetation that is to be retained during rights-of-way clearing of single family or two-family residential subdivisions, as indicated on a landscape protection plan, shall be delineated by high visibility flagging during construction activity. Such\nflagging shall be located and installed according to town standards and be located as shown on the landscape protection and site grading plans. The use of flagging shall be limited to those specific applications where no rare or specimen trees\nwill be affected by development activity and the planning director determines it to be as effective as protective fencing.\n(C) Landscaping activities taking place after the removal of protective fencing shall be accomplished with light machinery or hand labor and in accordance with the Town's Standards and Specifications Manual.\n11.12-2. Treatment of Trees During Construction. No nails, ropes, cables, signs or fencing shall be attached to any part of any tree that is to be preserved.\n(A) Trees that are damaged during construction shall be treated so as to promote their continued health.\n11.12-3. Removal of Regulated Trees. No regulated tree shall be removed without first acquiring a permit from the planning director. Failure to do so shall constitute a violation of this article and shall be subject to the penalty provisions in Section 11.18,\nEnforcement, of this ordinance.\n(A) Enforcement. Upon a determination that work does not conform with provisions of this section, the planning director shall issue a stop work order which shall remain in effect until all corrections are made in conformance with this ordinance.\n(B) Pre-construction conference. Prior to the commencement of any activities requiring a permit, a pre-construction conference with the planning director shall take place to review procedures for protection and management of all protected\nlandscape elements identified on the landscape protection plan and to designate one or more persons as landscape protection supervisor(s).\nSec. 11.13 Public Trees-Maintenance and Protection.\nThe following standards are hereby established for the maintenance and protection of public trees:\n11.13-1. Approved Personnel. No person except an employee of public utility or other approved public personnel shall cut, prune, or remove any living tree on or in a public highway, right-of-way, public park, sidewalk, or other public property; or cut or\ndisturb or interfere in any way with the roots of any tree on public property, unless directed to do so by the Town.\n11.13-2. Owner Responsibility. Every owner of any tree overhanging any street or right-of-way within the Town shall prune the branches so that such branches shall not significantly obstruct the view of any street intersection and so that there shall be\na\nclear space of 13 feet above the street surface or eight feet above the sidewalk surface. Said owners shall remove all dead, diseased or unsafe trees, or broken or decayed limbs that constitute a nuisance to the safety of the public. The Town shall\nhave the right to prune any tree or shrub on private or public property when it constitutes a public safety hazard, interferes with pedestrian traffic or the visibility of any traffic control device, sign, or sight\ntriangle.\n11.13-3. Placement of Materials around Plants. No person shall pile building or other material around any tree or shrub in public right-of-way in any manner that will injure such tree or shrub.\n11.13-4. Paving Adjacent to Trees. No person shall pave or place gravel, soil, or other such material within 12 feet of any tree on public property, unless approved by the planning director.\n11.13-5. Dumping of Deleterious Matter. No person shall dump, pour or spill any oil, pesticide, or other deleterious matter upon any tree or tree space in any public rights-of-way or keep or maintain upon any public rights-of-way, any receptacle from\nwhich any oil, pesticide, or other deleterious matter leaks or drips onto any soil, parking area, or concrete gutter so as to injure any tree on any public property.\n11.13-6. Disposal of Materials on Public Places. No person shall use parks, sidewalks, utility easements, or other public places to dump grass clippings, tree trimmings, rocks or other organic refuse. This shall not apply to properly placed yard waste that\nis\nintended for pickup by Town of Jamestown public services or solid waste crews.\n11.13-7. Decoration of Trees. No person shall decorate a tree or shrub in any public right-of-way, neutral ground, park, triangle or sidewalk, either with or without lights, or place advertising material, posters, political placards, rope, or wire on trees in\npublic properties.\n11.13-8. Planting of Street Trees. No part of this section is intended to prohibit the planting of street trees by adjacent property owners providing that the selection and location of said trees is in accordance with planting specifications set forth in this\nsection and that any such planting conducted under utility lines shall be limited to planting material taken from the list of recommended small-maturing trees in this ordinance.\nSec. 11.14 Hazard Trees.\nThe following standards are hereby established for trees and shrubs determined to be hazardous.\n11.14-1. Removal of Trees. The planning director may order the removal of any tree, shrub, or part thereof on private or public property, which is unsafe or injurious to sewers or other public improvements, structures, or to the general public.\n11.14-2. Right to Enter upon Property. The public services director or his/her designee may enter upon public or private property in the Town to spray or otherwise treat any tree infected or infested by any parasite, insect, or disease to prevent the\nbreeding or scattering of any parasite or animal pest and to prevent danger to persons or property or to trees planted on town property.\n11.14-3. Owner Notification and Opportunity to Correct. Prior to exercising the authority conferred by this section, the planning director shall give the owner notice and an opportunity to correct the condition by requesting that corrective action be taken.\nThe request shall be in writing and sent via certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner of the property in question and shall be acted upon within 12 days (or a lesser period of time if an imminent threat to life or property exists) from the\ndate of the receipt of the request. If, after 12 days, the owner has not corrected the condition or undertaken action that would lead to a timely correction of the condition, the planning director may enter upon the property, perform the work\nnecessary to correct the condition, and bill the owner for the actual costs incurred. If the property owner fails to pay the bill for such work within 30 days of such notice, the amount of the bill and any collection costs incurred shall become a lien\nagainst the subject property and shall be collected in the same manner provided for the collection of delinquent taxes. In situations involving an immediate threat to public health, safety, or welfare, the Town may act without prior notification to\nthe property owner.\nSec. 11.15 Species Selection and Planting Techniques.\nIn\norder to ensure that landscaping required by this article is suitable and is planted in the correct manner, the following selection and planting techniques are hereby established.\n11.15-1. Plant Species. Species used in required planting yards and parking lots shall be of a locally adapted nature. Refer to the recommended plant species list, which includes water wise species, in the appendix. Other species may be approved by the\nplanning director.\n11.15-2. Plant Size.

No camper, tent, or RV shall be permitted to be hooked to a utility for the purposes of making such a space habitable for a period exceeding one week. The intention of the\nordinance is to permit owners to ready such equipment for use elsewhere, but NOT to permit the use as an extension of the principal dwelling unit.\nTemporary emergency use of a camper/tent/recreational vehicle is allowed for a period of six months in the event of a fire, flood or other natural disaster which has made the principal dwelling uninhabitable. The temporary use must be located on\nthe same lot and a zoning permit is required. The zoning permit may be renewed for one additional six-month period.\nSec. 12.10 Off-Street Parking.\nOff-street parking should be provided to meet the needs of the employees, clients, and/or customers of the principal use. Due to the potential for parking areas to use a large percentage of development site, efforts should be made to accurately\nestimate the parking needs of the principal use. Strategies such as shared parking and remote parking should be used to maximize the use of existing parking available in the area in which a use is to be located. Parking areas should be designed\nto\nminimize breaks in the pedestrian environment along the public street and create safe and comfortable passage for pedestrians. The following standards shall therefore be met.\n12.10-1. Location of Parking Lots. Parking lots shall be placed behind buildings where practical; persons who wish to vary from this standard will have to appeal to the technical review committee. Side of the building parking will be permitted only\nas\nindicated by building type and shall be measured along the build-to line. Off-street parking is not permitted in front of the primary building facade, except where specified in an adopted street section, detailed as a public plaza, or as approved by\nthe technical review committee as part of site plan review and approval.\n12.10-2. Limitation on Uninterrupted Areas of Parking. Uninterrupted areas of parking lot shall be limited in size. Large parking lots shall be broken by buildings and/or landscape features.\nFigure 12.10-1: Example of parking lot broken up by landscaping.\n12.10-3. Enclosure of Parking Lots. Parking lots shall be enclosed by tree planting and/or building walls(s). For small lots (36 spaces or less), landscaping shall be required at the perimeter; for large lots (more than 36 spaces), landscaping shall be at the\nperimeter and placed to break the lot into parking areas of no more than 36 spaces.\n12.10-4. Pedestrian Corridors. Parking lots shall be designed to allow pedestrians to safely move from their vehicles to the building. On small lots, this may be achieved by providing a sidewalk at the perimeter of the lot. On larger lots, corridors within the\nparking area should channel pedestrians from the car to the perimeter of the lot or to the building(s). These corridors should be delineated by paving material which differs from that of vehicular areas and planted to provide shade and an edge.\nSmall posts or bollards may be used to define/protect the pedestrian corridors. The minimum width of the sidewalk or pedestrian corridor shall be five feet, with vehicle encroachment is calculated as two feet beyond curb or wheel stop.\n12.10-5.\nDriveway Width. To maintain pedestrian comfort and calm the speed of entering traffic, driveways to parking areas should be no wider than 24 feet. Driveways connecting to state roads shall meet the requirements of the N.C. Department\nof\nTransportation.\n12.10-6. Interconnection of Parking Lots. To the extent practicable, adjoining parking lots serving non-residential buildings shall be interconnected. When vehicular connections are not practical, pedestrian walkways shall be provided to enable pedestrian\nconnections between parking lots.\n12.10-7. Paving of Parking Lots. All commercial driveway and parking areas shall be paved with asphalt, concrete, pervious pavement, or brick pavers except for areas used for overflow, special events, and peak parking Any non-paved surface used for\noverflow, special events, and peak parking that cannot be maintained with healthy, living turf grass or similar ground cover shall be paved with asphalt, concrete, pervious pavement, or brick pavers. Paving shall not be required for:\n(A) Parking facilities used on an irregular basis for churches, private clubs, or other similar nonprofit organizations.\n(B) Parking areas for agricultural uses in the Agricultural (AG) District.\n(C) Parking areas for manufacturing and industrial uses in the Industrial (IND) District provided they are constructed with an all-weather surface.\n(D) Parking areas for tracked heavy construction equipment, skid-mounted equipment and similar equipment, provided they are constructed with an all-weather surface.\nFor paved parking areas, curb and gutter or an equivalent drainage system shall be provided along the periphery of the parking lot, except where it is determined by the planning director that such system is not practical for storm drainage and/or\nwater quality purposes. Access drives shall be paved and maintained from the curbline to a point at least ten feet beyond the public right-of-way line for all parking and loading facilities, whether paved or unpaved.\n12.10-8. Minimize Dust and Erosion. All parking areas shall be graded, properly drained, stabilized, and maintained to minimize dust and erosion.\n12.10-9. Marking of Parking Spaces. All parking spaces and stacking lanes shall be clearly identified with paint lines, bumper guards, curbs, or similar treatment.\n12.10-10 Wheel Guards or Curbs Required. All parking spaces shall be provided with wheel guards or curbs located so that no part of the parking vehicle will extend beyond the property line or encroach into a required planting area.\n12.10-11 Reduction in Number of Spaces. Unless there is a change in use requiring a lesser number of spaces, the number of spaces shall not be reduced below the minimum requirements of this article except as provided for in Section 12.5\n(Requirements for Change in Use).\n12.10-12 Parking Space Dimension. The minimum size for parking spaces shall be nine feet by 18 feet.\nSec. 12.11. Off-Street Parking Requirements.\nWhile on-street parking can contribute substantially to every day parking needs, sufficient off-street parking must also be provided to serve the particular needs of the building(s). The following minimum and maximum requirements for off-street\nparking are set forth to ensure the provision of adequate off-street parking while preventing the development of parking areas that are under used.\n68 of 150\n10/24/2023. 12:54 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nTABLE 12-1\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (2, 1): \nType of Land Use\nCELL (2, 2): \nOne Parking Space Required for Each:\nCELL (2,

Off-Street Parking Exceptions.\nThe following exceptions to the off-street parking requirements of Section 12.11 shall be permitted.\n12.12-1.\nExisting Buildings and Infill Housing in the MS District. In the Main Street (MS) District, existing buildings that were legally constructed without the provision of on-site parking, and infill housing on existing lots of record may meet requirements with\non-street parking, if available, and will be construed conforming as to parking. Such buildings are eligible for change of use permits, and for building upfits. Any expansion of the building and/or use shall provide off-street parking as required by\nthis article.\n12.12-2. Parking Reduction in MS District. In the Main Street (MS) District, the off-street parking requirements of this article shall be reduced 30 percent for all uses.\n12.12-3. Fee in Lieu in MS District. In the Main Street (MS) District, uses may provide a fee in lieu of providing any or all of the off-street parking required by this article. This fee shall be in the amount determined by the Town of Jamestown and based on the\ncost of providing parking (including land costs, development costs, and maintenance costs) in the Main Street District. Such fee(s) shall be used by the Town for the provision and maintenance of parking in the Main Street District. Any fee collected\nin\nlieu of providing the required parking for a particular business or use shall be used to provide or maintain parking that can be used by clients, customers, employees, and others frequenting that business or use. Such parking shall be located\nwithin a reasonable distance (not more than 1,350 feet as measured along pedestrian ways) of the business or use providing the fee in lieu.\n12.12-4.\nOn-Street Parking for Residential Buildings. Residential buildings may meet or contribute to meeting parking requirements with on-street parking, where available and approved by TRC, if individual driveways are minimized and the fronting street\nis specifically designed to meet the parking needs of the residential buildings.\n12.12-5. Parking on Streets.\n(A) In residential districts. Parking shall be allowed along all streets in residential districts except along alleys, designated bike lanes, and areas specifically signed for no parking. Vehicles shall park so as not to block access to properties.\n(B) In all other districts. Parking shall be allowed in designated areas (paved and striped) along the street in all other districts. Where the Town of Jamestown has indicated that \"No Parking\" is allowed, violations shall be enforced by the Guilford\nCounty Sherriff's Department. Violations may include, but not be limited to, warnings, citations, towing, or any other means as necessary to remedy the situation.\n12.12-6. No Parking in Right-of-Way, Off-street parking shall not extend into the public right-of-way, or into an easement for a public sidewalk on private property.\n12.12-7. Storage of Vehicles on Street. Vehicles shall not be parked on the street for extended periods such that they appear to be stored on the street. The planning director, at his/her discretion, may require removal of vehicles that appear to be stored\non the street in the interest of protecting the public safety and welfare.\n12.12-8. Shared and Remote Parking.\n(A)\nShared parking. The planning director shall approve the joint use of up to 100 percent of the required parking spaces for two or more uses located on the same parcel or adjacent parcels; provided that the developer can demonstrate that the\nuses will not overlap in hours of operation or in demand for the shared spaces. Any sharing of required parking spaces by uses located on different parcels shall be guaranteed by a written agreement between the owner of the parking area\nand the owner of any use located on a different parcel and served by the parking area. Should the uses change such that the new uses overlap in hours of operation or in demand for the shared spaces, the shared parking approval shall\nbecome void. Parking meeting the requirements of this article shall then be provided for each use. Parking agreements shall be for a minimum of five years, shall run with the property, and shall be recorded in the office of the Register of\nDeeds for Guilford County. A sidewalk or other pedestrian way shall connect the shared parking area to the uses for which parking is being provided.\n(B) Remote parking. If the required number of parking spaces for any land use cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal use is located, such parking space may be provided, for up to a maximum of 50 percent of the\nrequired parking, on any land within 750 feet walking distance of the property on which the principal use is located, provided that the zoning use regulations for the district in which the remote parking space is located permit the principal\nuse\nwhich the parking spaces serve and, provided further, that no crossing of major thoroughfare is required to travel from the use to the remote parking spaces, unless the pedestrian may access the remote parking by crossing said\nthoroughfare at a signalized crosswalk. Uses that cannot provide the remaining 50 percent of the required parking on-site must pay a fee-in-lieu or otherwise comply with the off-street parking requirements. Any remote parking spaces located\non a different parcel than the use for which the remote parking spaces serve shall be guaranteed by written agreement between the owner of the remote parking area and the owner of the use located on a different parcel and served by the\nremote parking area. Change of ownership of either parcel shall require a renewal of the agreement. Parking agreements shall be for a minimum of five years, shall run with the property, and shall be recorded in the office of the Register of\nDeeds for Guilford County.\n12.12-9. Parks and Recreation Districts.\n(A) The planning director may approve the joint use of up to 100 percent of the required parking spaces for properties zoned Parks & Recreation (PNR), provided that public parking is available within 750 feet walking distance of the property on\nwhich the principal use is located, and provided that if a major thoroughfare crossing is required, that there is a painted pedestrian crossing which permits safe access across said thoroughfare.\nSec. 12.13 Loading Areas.\nOff-street loading areas shall be provided to allow for delivery, loading, and similar activities to occur in a safe, designated area that will not impede the flow of traffic or block pedestrian or vehicular access.\n12.13-1.

General.\nStreets should be designed to suit their functions. Many streets, especially local ones, have purposes other than vehicular traffic. As an alternative to current N.C. Department of Transportation road standards, the following street standards are\nprovided for non-state-maintained streets within the Town of Jamestown and for streets within the extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction that will be maintained by the Town upon annexation. Streets built to the standards identified in this section are\neligible for town maintenance.\nStreets in Jamestown should be inviting public space and integral components of community design. A hierarchical street network should accommodate a variety of uses, including bicycle, pedestrian, and transit routes. All streets should connect to\nhelp create a comprehensive network that enables the free movement of automobiles, bicyclists, and pedestrians. In order for this street network to be safe for motorists and pedestrians, design elements must consistently be applied to calm\nautomobile traffic.\nWhere discrepancies occur between the text of this ordinance and the Town of Jamestown Technical Standards and Specifications Manual, the Technical Standards and Specifications Manual shall prevail.\nSec. 13.2. Street Standards.\nStreets in the Town of Jamestown shall:\n13.2-1. Interconnect. Interconnect within a development and with adjoining development to the maximum extent possible. Cul-de-sacs shall be allowed only where topographical and/or lot line configurations offer no practical alternatives for connections\nor through traffic. Street stubs shall be provided within development adjacent to open land to provide for future connections.\n13.2-2. Pedestrian Scaled. Be designed as the most prevalent public space of the Town and, thus, scaled to the pedestrian.\n13.2-3. Bordered by Sidewalks. Be bordered by sidewalks with a minimum width of five feet on both sides, with the exception of rural roads, lanes, alleys, and the undeveloped edge of neighborhood parkways. Sidewalks on one side of the road may be\npermitted in the Agricultural District to protect water quality. Sidewalks may be located in the street right-of-way, on private or public property, or in common areas. All sidewalks not located within the public right-of-way shall have a public access\neasement permitting public use of the sidewalk.\n13.2-4. Street Trees. Be lined with street trees located on both sides, with the exception of rural roads, lanes, alleys, and the undeveloped edge of neighborhood parkways. Street trees along streets in all non-urban areas shall be located in a planting strip\nas per the standards set forth in the Town of Jamestown Technical Standards and Specifications Manual.\n13.2-5.\nPublic Streets. Streets shall be public. Private streets are permitted on a limited basis only in accordance with standards set forth in section Article 2 of this ordinance and when constructed in accordance with the standards set forth in the\nJamestown Standards and Specifications Manual. Alleys will be classified as public or private depending on function, according to the street acceptance policy.\n13.2-6. Focus for Buildings. All principal buildings should front on public streets as dictated by the lot and building type standards of Article 9.\nSec. 13.3. Intersections.\nSegments of straight streets should be interrupted by intersections designed to:\n13.3-1. Reduce Speed. Disperse traffic flow and reduce speeds, thereby eliminating the creation of de facto collector streets with high speed, high volume traffic; and\n13.3-2. Terminate Vistas. Terminate vistas with a landmark such as a significant natural feature, a building, a small park, or other public space.\n71 of 150\n10/24/2023, 12:54 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nGross Floor Area (Sq.

Blocks.\nStreet blocks defined by public streets are the fundamental design elements of traditional neighborhoods. In urban conditions, any dimension of a block may range from 250 to 500 linear feet between cross streets. In major subdivisions the\ndimension of blocks may not exceed 800 linear feet between cross streets. Within large-lot subdivisions the blocks may be up to 1,500 feet. The block pattern should continue to establish the development pattern at the project edge. Where a longer\nblock will reduce the number of railroad grade crossings, major stream crossings, or where longer blocks will result in an arrangement of street connections, lots and public space more consistent with this article and Article 11 of this ordinance, the\ntechnical review committee may authorize greater block lengths at the time of subdivision preliminary plat review and approval.\nSec. 13.5 Street Plan.\nThe layout of streets should provide structure to the neighborhoods. The formality of the street plan will vary depending upon site conditions and topography. Unique site conditions should be used to create special neighborhood qualities. The\nstreet plan for new developments should reflect the character of the Town of Jamestown and comply with the standards set forth in Section 13.2 above.\nSec. 13.6 Street Design.\nDesigns should permit comfortable use of the street by motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Pavement widths, design speeds, and the number of motor travel lanes should be minimized to enhance safety for motorists and non-motorists alike. The\nspecific design of any given street must consider the building types which have frontage and the relationship of the street to the overall town street network. The following specifications apply to street design:\n13.6-1. Street Trees and Sidewalks. Street trees and sidewalks are required on both sides of public streets except rural roads, lanes, alleys, and the undeveloped edge of neighborhood parkways except that sidewalks may be permitted on only one side of\nthe street to accommodate low impact design in the Agricultural District. The street tree planting strip should be a minimum of five feet in width and sidewalks shall be a minimum of five feet in width unless otherwise provided. On commercial\nstreets, sidewalks should be a minimum of seven feet in width. A ten feet minimum width sidewalk with tree grates or cut-outs is required and 12 feet is encouraged on commercial streets, on properties and streets adjacent to schools,\nand\nespecially in the Main Street District. Generally, canopy trees shall be planted at a spacing not to exceed 40 feet on center. Where overhead utility lines preclude the use of canopy trees, small maturing trees may be substituted, planted 30 feet on\ncenter.\n13.6-2. On-streetparking_On-street parking is recommended where building type and use will generate regular parking use. Occasional on-street parking can be accommodated without additional pavement width. For streets that serve workplace and\nstorefront buildings, on-street parking lane(s) are required and should be marked as such. An on-street parking lane on at least one side of the street is recommended on streets serving attached houses and detached houses with lots 60 feet or\nless in width. On-street parking must also be provided on one side of any street adjacent to a square, park or other urban open space. Parallel on-street parking width is seven feet to eight feet. On-street parking should be parallel; angled parking\nis only permitted as an intentional design element along the main street(s) of the retail center in a Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) District.\n13.6-3. Design Speeds. Design speeds should not exceed 30 miles per hour on any neighborhood street. Only arterials and town boulevards may exceed this design speed.\n13.6-4. Traffic Control Plans. Traffic control plans showing signage and pavement markings shall be prepared in accordance with the guidance of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. The developer is responsible for the initial installation of the\ndevices or markings and the maintenance thereof until the public accepts the street for maintenance.\nDesign standards and specifications for town streets are set forth in the Town of Jamestown Standards and Specifications Manual. The street specifications in this manual may only be varied in accordance with the design principles set forth above\nand as approved by the technical review committee during the site plan or subdivision plat review process.\n13.6-5. Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs shall have a minimum five feet pedestrian access easement, and shall have paved pedestrian connections, where practicable to encourage pedestrian access connectivity. See Additional cul-de-sac standards in Article\n16.2-7, Street Design.\nARTICLE 14 FLEXIBLE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nSec. 14.1. Purpose.\nThe purpose of this section is to provide the technical review committee with the authority to allow deviations from the minimum development standards for setbacks, lot area, and lot dimension as otherwise set forth in this land development\nordinance provided that certain conditions exist. The intent of this section is to promote the orderly and efficient development and redevelopment of property within the Town of Jamestown.\nSec. 14.2. Approval of Flexible Development Standards.\nDetermination of the applicability of flexible development standards shall be made by the technical review committee (TRC) and, in applying these standards, the TRC may establish conditions to ensure that the circumstances which warranted the\napplication of the flexible development standards are maintained. Decisions by the TRC shall be in writing and may be appealed to the board of adjustment by following the procedures for zoning appeals as provided in Article 6.\nSec. 14.3. Flexible Development Standards Permitted.\nThe cumulative total of any flexible development standard applied to a property by category or location shall not exceed the allowances set forth in this section. The TRC shall maintain appropriate records to ensure compliance with this provision.\nThe following flexible development standards may be approved by the TRC:\n14.3-1. Setbacks. The TRC is authorized to approve requests that deviate from required setbacks set forth in Article 8 (Zoning) and Article 9 (Building and Lot Type) of this ordinance by up to ten percent of the required setbacks or 24 inches, whichever is\ngreater, upon determination that one or more of the following conditions exists:\n(A) There are site or structural conditions that preclude strict adherence to the setback requirements, such as, but not limited to: the lot does not meet the dimensional standards established for the zoning district in which it is located; the lot has\ntopographic limitations that require placement of the structure into the required setback area; or the structure is physically in line with an existing, legally-established wall or walls of a principal structure already within the minimum setback\narea.\n(B) The part of the proposed structure that encroaches into the minimum setback area is necessitated by a life-safety code, flood hazard reduction, Americans with Disabilities Act standard, or other public safety code requirement(s).\n(C) The reduction of the front and/or corner side setback allows the structure to meet the average front and/or corner side setback of other existing structures in the applicable block face.\n(D) The placement of the proposed structure will allow for the preservation of significant existing vegetation.\n14.3-2.\nLot Area and Lot Dimension. The TRC is authorized to approve requests to permit a reduction of up to ten percent in the minimum lot area or lot dimensional standards set forth in Article 8 (Zoning) and Article 9 (Building and Lot Type), upon\nfinding that the reduced lot area and/or lot dimensions will not inhibit the reasonable use of the lot and that the reduced lot area and/or lot dimensions are in keeping with the historic pattern of development in the area.\n14.3-3. Building Coverage and Frontage. The TRC is authorized to approve requests to permit a reduction of up to ten percent in the building coverage and frontage standards set forth in Article 8 (Zoning) and Article 9 (Building and Lot Type) of this\nordinance, upon finding that the reduced building coverage and/or frontage will not adversely impact the development pattern of the street which is the location of the property for which the adjustment is requested.\n14.3-4.\nFlexibility for Parking Standards. The presumptive standards set forth in the parking requirements table cannot cover every possible use or situation, nor can the table be considered exact. Therefore, the technical review committee (TRC) is given\nflexibility to administer this section as follows:\n(A) Parking space requirements for a use NOT identified in the table shall be based on a similar, listed use.\n(B) Deviations from the number of spaces required, up to ten percent, are permitted when the TRC can determine that the requirements for a particular situation are unreasonable. The applicant shall request a deviation in writing from the\nTRC\nand the reasons for allowing or denying the deviation from the requirements shall be noted in writing by the TRC and provided to the applicant. The TRC may require \"equal or better performance\" standards or other conditions as a part of the\nagreement to allow a deviation from the Ordinance requirements.\n(C) The TRC shall provide the planning board a copy of any ruling whereby Section 14.3-4, Flexibility standards, may apply at the planning board's next regularly scheduled meeting. The purpose of which is to keep planning board members abreast\nof any request for flexibility and, subsequently, the TRC's ruling on such requests.\nSec. 14.4 Variances.\nNo variances shall be allowed with regard to deviations from development standards that have been approved pursuant to this section of this ordinance nor shall any deviations from these development standards make void or otherwise modify\n72 of 150\n10/24/2023, 12:54 PM\n"}, {"page": "73", "text": "Jamestown, NC Land Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nany variance decision by the board of adjustment.\nARTICLE 15 SPECIAL EVENTS AND TEMPORARY STRUCTURES\nSec. 15.1 General Standards and Limitations.\nIt is the purpose of this section to provide specific guidelines and standards for special events and temporary structures. A special event or temporary structure allowed in a particular zoning district shall be treated as a use with additional standards\nand shall comply with all listed requirements for such event or structure as set forth in Sections 15.2 and 15.3 below. These standards are not intended to regulate events sponsored by the Town of Jamestown.\nSec. 15.2 Requirements for Special Event and Temporary Structure Permits.\nThe planning director shall issue a permit only upon finding that the proposed special event and/or temporary structure(s) satisfies the following requirements:\nThe special event and/or temporary structure is permitted under Section 15.3 below.\nThe property contains sufficient space to support the special event and/or temporary structure.\nParking is deemed adequate to accommodate the proposed special event and/or temporary structure in addition to required parking for any permanent use or uses also located at the site.\nThe special event and/or temporary structure will not create hazardous vehicular or pedestrian traffic conditions and adequate space is provided for access and maneuvering.\nAdequate sanitary facilities, utility, drainage, refuse management and similar necessary facilities and services will be available to serve employees, patrons and/or participants.\nPlans for security and safety are provided.\nAll inspections and permits required by applicable construction codes have been made and approved by the agency charged with enforcing such regulations.\nSpecial events are allowed to encroach within required building setbacks, but cannot be located within required buffers, street tree planting strips, or other required landscaped areas.

Applicants\nfor special events may be held to the standards set forth in both ordinances concurrently.\nARTICLE 16 SUBDIVISIONS\nSec. 16.1. Subdivision Regulations.\n16.1-1. Purpose. The regulations for the subdivision of land set forth below are established to promote orderly growth and development; provide for suitable residential and nonresidential subdivisions with adequate streets and utilities and appropriate\nbuilding sites, provide for the coordination of streets within subdivisions with existing or planned streets and with other public facilities; provide for the dedication or reservation of rights-of-way or easements for streets and utility purposes; and\nprovide proper land records for the convenience of the public and for better identification and permanent location of real property boundaries.\n16.1-2. Exempt land divisions.\n(A) Divisions of land exempt. In accordance with G.S. \u00a7 160D-802(a), the following divisions of land are not included within the definition of \"subdivision,\" and are not subject to the city's subdivision regulations:\n1. The combination or recombination of portions of previously subdivided and recorded lots where the total number of lots is not increased and the resultant lots are equal to or exceed the standards of the Town of Jamestown as shown in\nthe Town's subdivision regulations;\n2. The division of land into parcels greater than ten acres where no street right-of-way dedication is involved;\n3. The public acquisition by purchase of strips of land for the widening or opening of streets or for public transportation system corridors;\n4. The division of a tract in single ownership whose entire area is no greater than two acres into not more than three lots, where no street right-of-way dedication is involved and where the resultant lots are equal to or exceed the standards of\nthe Town as shown in the Town's subdivision regulations;\n5. The division of tract into parcels in accordance with the terms of a probated will or in accordance with intestate succession under G.S. ch. 29.\n(B)\nLimits on exempt divisions of land. With respect to any single tract or parcel of land existing as a matter of record in the register of deeds as of the effective date of this ordinance, no more than one division exempted pursuant to subsection\n(A)(4), above, shall be allowed within any five-year period. The purpose of this limitation is to prevent the unregulated subdivision of a tract of land through a series of exempt divisions; nothing herein shall prohibit the subdivision of land where\nthe resultant lots conform with the Town's subdivision regulations.\n(C) Determination and certification of exemption. The determination of whether a division of land is exempt from the definition of subdivision shall be made by the planning director, upon application of the property owner or agent, with\nsupporting documentation (maps, plats, etc.), as needed. Upon a determination by the planning director that the proposed subdivision is exempt, a certificate of exemption shall be issued, and the subdivision shall not be subject to the Town's\nsubdivision regulations.\n(D) Effect of certification of exemption. Divisions of land found to be exempt from the definition of subdivision are not required to meet the Town's subdivision regulations. However, a building or zoning permit may only be issued with respect to\na\nlot that has been created by an exempt division if said lot meets the standards for development set forth elsewhere in this ordinance.

Modifications from the standards for subdivisions set forth in this ordinance may be granted in cases of physical hardship. Cases of physical hardship shall be defined as those cases where because of the topography\nof the tract to be subdivided, the condition or nature of adjoining areas, or the existence of other unusual physical characteristics, strict compliance with the provisions of this ordinance would cause unusual and unnecessary hardship on the\nsubdivision of the property-by-property owner or developer. In granting the modification, the technical review committee shall make the findings required below, taking into account the nature of the proposed subdivision, the existing use of\nland in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision and the probable effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. No modification shall be granted unless the technical review\ncommittee finds:\n1. That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the property such that the strict application of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land; and\n2. That the modification is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the petitioner; and\n3. That the circumstances giving rise to the need for the modification are peculiar to the parcel and are not generally characteristic of other parcels in the Town; and\n4. That granting the modification will not be a detriment to public health, safety and welfare or injure other property in the area in which the property is located.\n5.\nThat the alternative proposed by the applicant will result in equal or better performance than that provided by the standard for which the modification is requested.\nAny modification thus granted by the technical review committee shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting at which the modification is granted along with the reasons for the modification.\n(C)\nConditions.

Introduction.\n18.1-1.\nPurpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:\n(A) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;\n(B) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;\n(C) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;\n(D) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and\n(E) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\n18.1-2. Objectives. The objectives of this article are:\n(A) Protect human life and health;\n(B) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\n(C) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;\n(D) To minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;\n(E) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets and bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;\n(F) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone area; and\n(G) To ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area.\n18.1-3. Definitions. Definitions may be found in Article 3, Definitions.\nSec. 18.2. Flood Damage Prevention.\n18.2-1. StatutoryAuthorization.\n(A) The Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part Article of Chapter 143; Article 9 Chapter 160D; and Article 8 of Chapter 160, of the North Carolina General Statutes, delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt\nregulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.\nTherefore, the town council of the Town of Jamestown, North Carolina, has adopted this Article 18, Flood Damage Prevention, as part of the Town's Land Development Ordinance.\n18.2-2. Legal Status Provisions.\n(A) Effect on rights and liabilities under the existing flood damage prevention ordinance. This ordinance in part comes forward by re-enactment of some of the provisions of the flood damage prevention ordinance enacted on March 4, 1980, as\namended, and it is not the intention to repeal but rather to re-enact and continue to enforce without interruption of such existing provisions, so that all rights and liabilities that have accrued thereunder are reserved and may be enforced. The\nenactment of this ordinance shall not affect any action, suit or proceeding instituted or pending. All provisions of the flood damage prevention ordinance of the Town of Jamestown enacted on March 4, 1980, as amended, which are not\nreenacted herein are repealed. The date of the initial flood damage prevention ordinance for Guilford County is as follows: June 4th, 1980.\n(B) Effect upon outstanding floodplain development permits. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans, construction, size, or designated use of any development or any part thereof for which a floodplain development permit\nhas been granted by the floodplain administrator or his or her authorized agents before the time of passage of this ordinance; provided, however, that when construction is not begun under such outstanding permit within a period of\nsix\nmonths subsequent to the date of issuance of the outstanding permit, construction or use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.\n18.2-3. Findings of Fact.\n(A) The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of Town of Jamestown are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public\nexpenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.\n(B) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.\n18.2-4. General Provisions.\n(A) Lands to which this ordinance applies. This ordinance shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard areas within the Town of Jamestown, including extra-territorial jurisdiction (ETJs). Bona fide farms shall be subject to such flood damage\nprevention regulations as set forth in Section 9.3 of the Guilford County Unified Development Ordinance.\n(B)\nBasis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The special flood hazard areas are those identified under the Cooperating Technical State (CTS) agreement between the State of North Carolina and FEMA in its Flood Insurance Study and\nits accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), for Guilford County, date June 18, 2007 which are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance.\n18.2-5.

Findings.\nIt is hereby determined that:\nDevelopment and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and sediment transport\nand deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge;\nThese changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment; and\nThese effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and well-planned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites.\nFurther, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (\"Clean Water Act\") and federal Phase II Stormwater Rules promulgated under it, as well as rules of the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission promulgated in response to\nfederal Phase II requirements, compel certain urbanized areas, including this jurisdiction, to adopt minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this ordinance.\nTherefore, the Town of Jamestown Town Council establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge.\nSec. 19.4. Specific.\nThis ordinance seeks to meet its general purpose through the following specific objectives and means:\n1. Establishing decision-making processes for development that protect the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources;\n2. Requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding, streambank erosion,\nnonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;\n3.\nEstablishing minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;\n4. Establishing design and review criteria for the construction, function, and use of structural stormwater BMPs that may be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards;\n5.\nEncouraging the use of better management and site design practices, such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of greenspace, riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum extent\npracticable;\n6. Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater BMPs to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained appropriately, and pose no threat to public\nsafety;\n7. Establishing administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, for the inspection of approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term maintenance.\n8. Coordinating site design plans that include open space and natural areas with the Town of Jamestown Land Development Ordinance and the 2020 Comprehensive Land Development Plan, and any other plans as adopted by the Town of\nJamestown.\n9. Controlling illicit discharges into the municipal separate stormwater system.\n10. Controlling erosion and sedimentation from construction activities.\n11. Assigning responsibility and processes for approving the creation and maintenance of adequate drainage and flood damage prevention measures.\nSec. 19.5.

They are the Watershed Critical Area Overlay District and the General Watershed Area Overlay District.\n19.6-1. General Watershed Area Overlay District. The General Watershed Area (GWA) is an overlay district that includes all land draining into designated water supply reservoirs within the Town's jurisdiction, but outside any Watershed Critical Area Overlay\nDistrict. Reservoirs designated for purposes of the Article are, City Lake, Oakdale Reservoir (Jamestown), and Randleman Lake.\n19.6-2. Watershed Critical Area Overlay District. The Town of Jamestown Watershed Map shows the Watershed Critical Area District boundaries. The Watershed Critical Area District is an overlay district covering the portion of the watershed adjacent to\na\ndesignated water supply intake or reservoir where risk associated with pollution is greater than from the remaining portions of the watershed. The Watershed Critical Area Overlay District boundary extends either a minimum of 2,750 feet from the\nnormal pool elevation of the reservoir in which the intake is located or to the ridgeline of designated water supply reservoir basins whichever comes first. The identifiable major feature may be a street, railroad, easement or other means of travel,\nwhich can be used by emergency personnel to respond to spills. The WCA consists of four tier divisions as follows:\n(A) Tier 1: Tier 1 consists of those lands within 200 feet measured horizontally from the pool elevation of the designated reservoirs, which is 756 feet above mean sea level for City Lake, 716 feet above mean sea level for Oakdale Reservoir, and 682\nfeet above mean sea level for Randleman Lake.\n(B) Tier 2: Tier 2 consists of those lands lying within an area bounded by Tier and a line parallel to and 750 feet in distance from the normal pool elevation.\n(C) Tier 3: Tier 3 consists of those lands lying within an area bounded by Tier 2 and a line parallel to and 2,750 feet, measured horizontally from the normal pool elevation, or to the boundary of the WCA, whichever comes first, for all WCAs except\nthe\nRandleman Lake WCA. Randleman Lake's WCA consists of those lands lying within an area bounded by Tier 2 and a line parallel to and 3,000 feet measured horizontally from the normal pool elevation, or to the boundary of the WCA,\nwhichever comes first, except that Tier 3 along Richland Creek consists of those lands lying within an area bounded by Tier 2 and a line parallel to and 2,640 feet (one-half mile) measured horizontally from the normal pool elevation or to the\nboundary of the WCA, whichever comes first.\n(D) Tier 4: Tier 4 consists of those lands lying in the area between the outer boundary of Tier 3 and the WCA boundary.\nSec. 19.7.

Density shifting is utilized in developments having lot sizes in accordance with the minimum area permitted by the underlying zoning district or in approved cluster\ndevelopments. Through density shifting, developments may increase the maximum permitted residential densities otherwise established in this article if the development rights attached to acreage located within a tier are transferred within the\nsame property to an adjacent tier located farther from the water supply reservoir. Such transfer shall permit an additional number of dwelling units in the receiving tier. This addition is calculated by adding the density or dwelling units transferred\nfrom the adjacent tier to the density or dwelling units permitted in the receiving tier. The dwelling units permitted by acreage transfer from an adjacent tier shall be in addition to the number of dwelling units otherwise permitted in the receiving\ntier, but in no case shall the density allowed by the underlying zoning district be exceeded, unless cluster development options allow for increased densities.\n19.20-5.

Reserved.\n3. Proximity to floodway is determined by measuring or scaling the distance from the floodway to the closest boundary of the tract.\n4. Self explanatory.\n5. Protected drainageway means drainage is channeled by pervious devices such as sod waterways, berms, channels or swales which have been constructed to resist soil erosion by either vegetating, netting, riprapping, or a combination of those,\nand which allows infiltration of water into the soil.\nDispersed drainage means spread out, as opposed to collecting the runoff in channels, so as to effect increased sheet flow and overland flow.\nImproved drainageway means channeled by impervious surfaces such as curb and gutter or concrete (gunnite, bituminous, etc.) channels.\nEnhanced drainageway means carried by existing natural drainage ways which have been enhanced to resist soil erosion, including stream bank degradation.\n6. Average slope shall mean the maximum inclination of the land surface from the horizontal as measured in percentage slope. The average slope shall be determined for the entire lot, tract, or subdivision before development.\n7. If all or part of an existing lot containing natural or stabilizing vegetation is dedicated to the public for park or drainageway and open space purposes, such land will count in computing score.\nStabilizing vegetation means any vegetation that protects the soil against erosion.\n8. Maximum runoff control means approximately 100 percent of built-upon area runoff must pass through permanent wet detention pond(s). Moderate runoff control means at least 75 percent of built-upon area runoff must pass through\npermanent wet detention pond(s). Runoff control in excess of minimum requirements of erosion control ordinance means at least 50 percent of built-upon area runoff must pass through permanent wet detention pond(s). Runoff control equal\nto minimum requirements means velocity control of runoff. Detention pond means a pond which collects stormwater runoff, filters the water, and releases it slowly over a period of hours or days. It does not have a permanent pool and is\nsometimes referred to as a dry pond. Wet detention pond means a pond that has a permanent pool and also collects stormwater runoff, filters the water, and releases it slowly over a period of days.

Watershed Modifications.\n99 of 150\n10/24/2023, 12:54 PM\n"}, {"page": "100", "text": "Jamestown, NC Land Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\n(A) Purpose. Recognizing that it is sometimes possible to provide equal or better performance in furtherance of the purposes of this ordinance through use of means other than those specified herein, the town council finds it to be reasonably\nnecessary and expedient that provisions be made for flexibility in administration of specified standards in this ordinance.\n(B) Application. Proposed modifications of certain standards as applied to particular developments are properly evaluated only in conjunction with technical review of site plan, subdivision plat, or watershed control plan. The modifications being\napplied for shall be portrayed on such plans and shall be approved, approved with conditions, or denied along with the approval or denial of such plans. To obtain approval of modification, the burden shall be upon the developer or property\nowner to demonstrate that the alternate standards portrayed on the plan will yield equal or better performance in furtherance of the purposes of this ordinance.\n(C) Approval body. Recognizing that the evaluation of proposed alternate means intended to offer equal or better performance normally requires technical expertise and is best accomplished in conjunction with review of development plans, the\ntown council hereby designates the technical review committee to be the appropriate planning agency to approve modifications, except as otherwise provided in this section.\n(D) Watershed modifications. Where the technical review committee is authorized to grant modifications to Article 19. Watershed Protection, to accept an alternate means of accomplishing the purposes of this ordinance, then such modifications\nshall only apply to provisions of this ordinance that are more stringent than the state minimum watershed requirements. Where such requirements are State minimum requirements, then a departure from the requirements of this ordinance\nshall only be considered per the requirements of Section 19.19, Watershed Variances and Modifications\n(E)\nGrounds for modification. In considering modifications, the technical review committee shall determine that the modification request meets one or more of the following findings:\n1. Equal or better performance. A finding by the technical review committee that equal or better performance in furtherance of the purposes of this ordinance will result from the alternate standards portrayed on the plan constitutes grounds\nfor approval of a modification. The evaluation of performance shall be made with regard to one purpose if only one purpose is affected. If performance with regard to more than one purpose is affected, the evaluation shall be made with\nregard to overall performance in furtherance of the purposes of this ordinance. If an alternate standard as portrayed on the plan reduces performance with regard to one or more ordinance purposes but produces a concomitant and\ncounterbalancing superiority of performance with regard to one or more other purposes, a modification may be approved.\n2. Physical constraints. A finding by the technical review committee that the size, topography, or existing development of the property or of adjoining areas prevents conformance with a standard constitutes grounds for approval of a\nmodification.\n3.\nOther constraints. A finding by the technical review committee that a federal, state or local law or regulation prevents conformance with a standard constitutes grounds for approval of a modification.\n(F) Conditions. In approving a modification, the technical review committee may prescribe such reasonable and appropriate conditions and safeguards as will assure that the use of the property will be compatible with surrounding properties and\nwill not alter the essential character of the neighborhood and will support the purposes of this ordinance being maintained. Violations of conditions and safeguards that are part of the terms of modification approval shall be deemed a violation\nof this ordinance.\n(G) Appeals. Appeals may be made pursuant to Section 19.18, Appeals.\n(H) Duration. An approved modification or watershed variance is part of an approved plan and shall have the same duration as the plan approval.\nSec. 19.23. Reserved.\nSECTION 4. MAINTENANCE\nSec. 19.24 General Standards For Maintenance.\n(A) Function of BMPs as intended. The owner of each structural BMP installed pursuant to this ordinance shall maintain and operate it so as to preserve and continue its function in controlling stormwater quality and quantity at the degree or amount\nof function for which the structural BMP was designed.\n(B)\nPeriodic maintenance inspection and report. Generally, the Town of Jamestown will make a periodic inspection of structural BMPs to ensure compliance with this ordinance. It shall be the responsibility of the person responsible for maintenance of\nany structural BMP installed pursuant to this ordinance to submit to the stormwater administrator an annual inspection report from one of the following persons performing services only in their area of competence: a qualified registered North\nCarolina professional engineer, surveyor, landscape architect, soil scientist, aquatic biologist, or person certified by the North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service for stormwater treatment practice inspection and maintenance. The inspection\nreport shall contain all of the following:\n1. The name and address of the landowner;\n2. The recorded book and page number of the lot of each structural BMP;\n3. A statement that an inspection was made of all structural BMPs;\n4. The date the inspection was made;\n5. A statement that all inspected structural BMPs are performing properly and are in compliance with the terms and conditions of the approved maintenance agreement required by this ordinance; and\n6. The original signature and seal of the engineer, surveyor, or landscape architect.\nAll inspection reports shall be on forms supplied by the stormwater administrator. An original inspection report shall be provided to the stormwater administrator beginning one year from the date of as-built certification and each year thereafter\non or before the date of the as-built certification.\nSec. 19.25. Operation and Maintenance Agreement.\n(A) In general. Prior to the conveyance or transfer of any lot or building site to be served by a structural BMP pursuant to this ordinance, and prior to issuance of any permit for development or redevelopment requiring a structural BMP pursuant to\nthis ordinance, the applicant or owner of the site must execute an operation and maintenance agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of the site, portions of the site, and lots or parcels served by the structural BMP. Until the\ntransference of all property, sites, or lots served by the structural BMP, the original owner or applicant shall have primary responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the maintenance agreement. (Typically referred to as a property owner's\nagreement or homeowner's agreement)\nThe operation and maintenance agreement shall require the owner or owners to maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct the structural BMP, and shall state the terms, conditions, and schedule of maintenance for the structural BMP. In\naddition, it shall grant to the Town of Jamestown a right of entry in the event that the stormwater administrator has reason to believe it has become necessary to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, or reconstruct the structural BMP; however, in no\ncase\nshall the right of entry, of itself, confer an obligation on the Town of Jamestown to assume responsibility for the structural BMP.\nThe operation and maintenance agreement must be approved by the stormwater administrator prior to plan approval, and it shall be referenced on the final plat and shall be recorded with the county register of deeds upon final plat approval. A\ncopy of the recorded maintenance agreement shall be given to the stormwater administrator within 14 days following its recordation.\n(B) Special requirement for homeowners' and other associations. For all structural BMPs required pursuant to this ordinance and that are to be or are owned and maintained by a homeowners' association, property owners' association, or similar\nentity, the required operation and maintenance agreement shall include all of the following provisions:\n1. Acknowledgment that the association shall continuously operate and maintain the stormwater control and management facilities.\n2. Establishment of an escrow account, which can be spent solely for sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, or reconstruction of the structural BMPs. If structural BMPs are not performing adequately\nor\nas intended or are not properly maintained, the Town of Jamestown, in its sole discretion, may remedy the situation, and in such instances the Town of Jamestown shall be fully reimbursed from the escrow account. Escrowed funds may be\nspent by the association for sediment removal, structural, biological or vegetative replacement, major repair, and reconstruction of the structural BMPs, provided that the Town of Jamestown shall first consent to the expenditure.\n3. The Town of Jamestown recommends that both developer contribution and annual sinking funds should fund the escrow account. Prior to plat recordation or issuance of construction permits, whichever shall first occur, the developer should\npay into the escrow account an amount equal to 15 percent of the initial construction cost of the structural BMPs, based on a cost estimate from a professional engineer (signed and sealed by the engineer). Two-thirds of the total amount of\nsinking fund budget should be deposited into the escrow account within the first five years and the full amount should be deposited within ten years following initial construction of the structural BMPs. Funds should be deposited each year\ninto the escrow account. A portion of the annual assessments of the association should include an allocation into the escrow account. Any funds drawn down from the escrow account should be replaced in accordance with the schedule of\nanticipated work used to create the sinking fund budget.\n4.\nThe percent of developer contribution and lengths of time to fund the escrow account may be varied by the engineer's cost estimate, depending on the design and materials of the stormwater control and management facility.\n5. Granting to the Town of Jamestown a right of entry to inspect, monitor, maintain, repair, and reconstruct structural BMPs.\n6. Allowing the Town of Jamestown to recover from the association and its members any and all costs the Town of Jamestown expends to maintain or repair the structural BMPs or to correct any operational deficiencies. Failure to pay the Town\nof\nJamestown all of its expended costs, after 45 days written notice, shall constitute a breach of the agreement. In case of a deficiency, the Town of Jamestown shall thereafter be entitled to bring an action against the association and its members\nto pay or foreclose upon the lien hereby authorized by the agreement against the property, or both. Interest, collection costs, and attorney fees shall be added to the recovery.\n7. A statement that this agreement shall not obligate the Town of Jamestown to maintain or repair any structural BMPs, and the Town of Jamestown shall not be liable to any person for the condition or operation of structural BMPs.\n8. A statement that this agreement shall not in any way diminish, limit, or restrict the right of the Town of Jamestown to enforce any of its ordinances as authorized by law.\n9. A provision indemnifying and holding harmless the Town of Jamestown for any costs and injuries arising from or related to the structural BMP, unless the Town of Jamestown has agreed in writing to assume the maintenance responsibility for\nthe BMP and has accepted dedication of any and all rights necessary to carry out that maintenance.\n10. HOA/POA documents shall also address how the required buffers shall be maintained and preserved.\n19.25-1. Inspection Program.\nInspections and inspection programs by the Town of complaints or other notice of\npossible violations; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws.\nInspections may include, but are not limited to, reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in BMPs; and evaluating the condition of BMPs.\nThe Town of Jamestown reserves the right to require owners to hire a registered professional engineer licensed to operate in N.C. for the purposes of inspecting devices in the event that the Town of Jamestown cannot access the BMP or for the\n100 of 150\n10/24/2023, 12:54 PM\n"}, {"page": "101", "text": "Jamestown, NC Land Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\npurposes of certified sediment levels, soil medium efficiency, or other requirements to ensure that the BMP is operating as designed.\nIf the owner or occupant of any property refuses to permit such inspection, the stormwater administrator shall proceed to obtain an administrative search warrant pursuant to G.S. \u00a7 15-27.2 or its successor. No person shall obstruct, hamper or\ninterfere with the stormwater administrator while carrying out his or her official duties.\n19.25-2. Performance Security For Installation and Maintenance.\n(A) May be required. The Town of Jamestown may, at its discretion, require the submittal of a performance security or bond with surety, cash escrow, letter of credit or other acceptable legal arrangement prior to issuance of a permit in order to\nensure that the structural BMPs are:\n1. Installed by the permit holder as required by the approved stormwater management plan, and/or\n2. Maintained by the owner as required by the operation and maintenance agreement.\n(B) Amount.\n1. Installation. The amount of an installation performance security shall be the total estimated construction cost of the BMPs approved under the permit, plus a contingency amount to be determined by the Town of Jamestown, not to exceed\n150 percent of the total project cost.\n2. Maintenance. The amount of a maintenance performance security shall be the present value of an annuity of perpetual duration based on a reasonable estimate of the annual costs of inspection, operation and maintenance of the BMPs\napproved under the permit, at a discount rate that reflects the jurisdiction's cost of borrowing minus a reasonable estimate of long-term inflation. This estimate shall be based on a cost estimate prepared (and signed and sealed)\nby\na\nprofessional engineer licensed to operate in North Carolina.\nNote: Some annual maintenance cost estimates for BMPs in North Carolina are available in Wassick and Hunt, \"An Evaluation of Costs and Benefits of Structural Stormwater Best Management Practices in North Carolina, N.C. Extension Service,\navailable online as of 3/16/05 at http://www.bae.ncsu.edu/people/faculty/hunt/bmpcosts&benefits.pdf. Uses of Performance Security.\n3. Forfeiture provisions. The performance security shall contain forfeiture provisions for failure, after proper notice, to complete work within the time specified, or to initiate or maintain any actions which may be required of the applicant or\nowner in accordance with this ordinance, approvals issued pursuant to this ordinance, or an operation and maintenance agreement established pursuant to this ordinance.\n4. Default. Upon default of the owner to construct, maintain, repair and, if necessary, reconstruct any structural BMP in accordance with the applicable permit or operation and maintenance agreement, the stormwater administrator shall\nobtain and use all or any portion of the security to make necessary improvements based on an engineering estimate. Such expenditure of funds shall only be made after requesting the owner to comply with the permit or maintenance\nagreement. In the event of a default triggering the use of installation performance security, the Town of Jamestown shall not return any of the unused deposited cash funds or other security, which shall be retained for maintenance.\n5. Costs in excess of performance security. If the Town of Jamestown takes action upon such failure by the applicant or owner, the Town of Jamestown may collect from the applicant or owner the difference between the amount of the\nreasonable cost of such action and the amount of the security held, in addition to any other penalties or damages due.\n6. Refund. Within 60 days of the final approval, the installation performance security shall be refunded to the applicant or terminated, except any amount attributable to the cost (plus percent contingency) of ongoing construction associated\nwith the BMPs covered by the security (i.e., Landscaping). Any such ongoing construction or landscaping shall be inspected within six months after installation for compliance with the approved plans and specifications and, if in compliance,\nthe portion of the financial security attributable to landscaping shall be released.\n19.25-3. Notice To Owners.\n(A) Deed recordation and indications on plat. The applicable operations and maintenance agreement, conservation easement, or dedication and acceptance into public maintenance (whichever is applicable), pertaining to every structural BMP and\nrequired buffers shall be referenced on the final plat and shall be recorded with the county register of deeds upon final plat approval. If no subdivision plat is recorded for the site, then the operations and maintenance agreement, conservation\neasement, or dedication and acceptance into public maintenance, whichever is applicable, shall be recorded with the county register of deeds so as to appear in the chain of title of all subsequent purchasers under generally accepted searching\nprinciples.\n19.25-4.

The stormwater administrator may seek immediate enforcement, without prior written notice, through any remedy or penalty authorized by\nthis article.\nSECTION 6. BUFFER REQUIREMENTS FOR SURFACE WATERS\nThe following section deals specifically with buffer requirements for surface waters. This section was added as an amendment on October 19, 2010, in response to NCDENR's updates to the Randleman Lake Buffer Rules. There may be\ndiscrepancies in some areas including, but not limited to, enforcement, variances, applicability, and mitigation. The language in this section shall rule regarding buffer requirements and shall supersede other requirements. While these rules were\ncrafted specifically for the Randleman Lake Watersheds, they shall be applicable to ALL watersheds with the jurisdiction of the Town of Jamestown.\nSec. 19.27. Purpose and Intent.\nThe purpose of the Town of Jamestown in adopting the following ordinance is to protect and preserve existing riparian buffers throughout all watersheds including, but not limited to, the Randleman Lake Watershed as generally described in Rule\n15A NCAC 02B.0250 (Randleman Lake Water Supply Watershed: Nutrient Management Strategy), in order to maintain their nutrient removal and stream protection functions. Additionally, this ordinance will help protect the water supply uses of all\nbodies of water in each watershed within the Town of Jamestown's jurisdiction.\nBuffers adjacent to streams provide multiple environmental protection and resource management benefits. Forested buffers enhance and protect the natural ecology of stream systems, as well as water quality through bank stabilization, shading,\nand nutrient removal. They also help to minimize flood damage in flood prone areas. Well-vegetated streamside riparian areas help to remove nitrogen and prevent sediment and sediment-bound pollutants such as phosphorous from reaching the\nstreams.\n19.27-1. Jurisdiction.\nThis ordinance shall be applied to all land in the planning jurisdiction of the Town of Jamestown that is located within a water supply watershed.\n19.27-2. Applicability.\nThis ordinance applies to all landowners and other persons conducting activities in the area described in Section 19.27-1, with the exception of activities conducted under the authority of the State, the United States, multiple jurisdictions, or local\nunits of government, and forest harvesting and agricultural activities. The N.C. Division of Water Quality shall administer the requirements for protection of existing riparian buffers and mitigation of existing riparian buffers for these activities.\n19.27-3. Relation to Other Ordinances.\nThe requirements of this ordinance shall supersede all locally implemented buffer requirements as applied to WS-II, WS-III, and WS-IV waters. If the provisions of this ordinance otherwise conflict with the provisions of any other validly enforceable\nordinance(s) or laws, the most stringent provisions shall control. This ordinance is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law.\n19.27-4. Riparian Area Protection Within Watersheds.\n(A) Buffers protected. The following minimum criteria shall be used for identifying regulated buffers:\n1. This ordinance shall apply to activities conducted within 50-foot-wide riparian buffers directly adjacent to surface waters in any watershed (intermittent streams, perennial streams, lakes, reservoirs, ponds and specified ditches), excluding\nwetlands.\n2. Wetlands adjacent to surface waters or within 50 feet of surface waters shall be considered as part of the riparian buffer but are regulated pursuant to Rules 15A NCAC 2B.0230 and .0231, Rules 15A NCAC 2H.0500, 15A NCAC 2H.1300, and\nSections 401 and 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.\n3. For the purpose of this ordinance, surface waters shall be subject to the requirements of this ordinance if they are approximately shown on any of the following references, or if there is other site-specific evidence that indicates to the Town\nof Jamestown the presence of waters not shown on any of these maps:\na. The most recent version of the hardcopy soil survey maps prepared by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture.\nb.\nThe most recent version of the United States Geologic Survey (USGS) 1:24,000 scale (7.5 minute) quadrangle topographic maps.\nC. A map approved by the Geographic Information Coordinating Council and by the N.C. Environmental Management Commission. Prior to approving a map under this item, the Commission shall provide a 30-day public notice and\nopportunity for comment.\nA\nmap developed by the local government and approved by the N.C. Environmental Management Commission per 15A NCAC 02B.0250(4)(c).\nWhere the specific origination point of stream regulated under this item is in question, upon request of the N.C. Division of Water Quality or another party, the Town of Jamestown shall make an on-site determination. A Town\nof\nJamestown representative who has successfully completed the Division's Surface Water Identification Training Certification course, its successor, or other equivalent training curriculum approved by the Division, shall establish that point\nusing the latest version of the Division publication, Identification Methods for the Origins of Intermittent and Perennial Streams, v3.1 February 28, 2005 available at: https://files.nc.gov/ncdeq/Water%20Quality\nSurface%20Water%20Protection/PDU/Headwater%20Streams/NC%20Stream%20ID%20Manual___Ver%203.1.pdf or from the N.C. Division of Water Quality-401 Oversight Express Permitting Unit, or its successor. The Town of Jamestown\nmay accept the results of a site assessment made by another party who meets these criteria. Any disputes over on-site determinations made according to this Item shall be referred to the Director of the Division of Water Quality c/o the\n401\nOversight Express Permitting Unit, or its successor, in writing. The director's determination is subject to review as provided in Articles 3 and 4 of G.S. ch. 150B.\n4. Riparian buffers protected by this ordinance shall be measured pursuant to Section 19.27-4(D) of this ordinance.\n5. Parties subject to this ordinance shall abide by all state rules and laws regarding waters of the state including, but not limited to, Rules 15A NCAC 3.0230 and .0231, Rules 15A NCAC 2H.0500, 15A NCAC 2H.1300, and Sections 401 and 404\nof the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.\n(B) Exemption based on on-site determination. When a landowner or other affected party, including the division, believes that the maps have inaccurately depicted surface waters, he or she shall consult the Town of Jamestown. Upon request, a\nTown of Jamestown representative who has successfully completed the division of water quality's Surface Water Identification Training Certification course, its successor, or other equivalent training curriculum approved by the division, shall\nmake an on-site determination. The Town may also accept the results of site assessments made by other parties who have successfully completed such training. Any disputes over on-site determinations shall be referred to the Director of the\nDivision of Water Quality c/o the 401 Oversight Express Permitting Unit, or its successor, in writing. A determination by the director as to the accuracy or application of the maps is subject to review as provided in G.S. ch. 150B arts. 3 and\n4.\nSurface waters that appear on the maps shall not be subject to these buffer requirements if site evaluation reveals any of the following cases:\n1. Ditches and manmade conveyances, to include manmade stormwater conveyances, other than modified natural streams, unless the ditch or manmade conveyance delivers untreated stormwater runoff from an adjacent source directly to\nan intermittent or perennial stream.\n2. Areas mapped as intermittent streams, perennial streams, lakes, ponds, or estuaries on the most recent versions of the United States Geological Survey 1:24,000 scale (7.5-minute quadrangle) topographic maps, hard-copy soil survey maps,\nor other EMC approved stream maps where no perennial waterbody, intermittent waterbody, lake, pond or estuary actually exists on the ground.\n3. Ephemeral streams.\n4. Ponds and lakes created for animal watering, irrigation, or other agricultural uses that are not part of a natural drainage way that is classified in accordance with 15A NCAC 02B.0100. Ponds are part of the natural drainage way when they\nare hydrologically connected (i.e., the pond is fed by an intermittent or perennial stream) or when they have a direct discharge point to an intermittent or perennial stream.\n(C) Exemption when existing uses are present and ongoing. This ordinance shall not apply to uses that are existing and ongoing; however, this ordinance shall apply at the time an existing, ongoing use is changed to another use. Change of use\nshall involve the initiation of any activity that does not meet either of the following criteria for existing, ongoing activity:\n1. It was present within the riparian buffer as of the effective date of the original ordinance. This ordinance and has continued to exist since that time. Existing uses shall include agriculture, buildings, industrial facilities, commercial areas,\ntransportation facilities, maintained lawns, utility lines and on-site sanitary sewage systems, any of which involve either specific, periodic management of vegetation or displacement of vegetation by structures or regular activity. Only the\nportion of the riparian buffer occupied by the footprint of the existing use is exempt from this ordinance. Change of ownership through purchase or inheritance is not a change of use. Activities necessary to maintain uses are allowed\nprovided that the site remains similarly vegetated, no impervious surface is added within 50 feet of the surface water where it did not previously exist as of the effective date of this ordinance, and existing diffuse flow is maintained. Grading\nand revegetating Zone Two is allowed provided that the health of the vegetation in Zone One is not compromised, the ground is stabilized, and existing diffuse flow is maintained.\n102 of 150\n10/24/2023, 12:54 PM\n"}, {"page": "103", "text": "Jamestown, NC Land Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\n2.\nProjects or proposed development that are determined by the Town of Jamestown to meet at least one of the following criteria:\na.\nProject requires a 401 Certification/404 Permit, and these were issued prior to the effective date this ordinance, and prior to the effective date of this ordinance.\nb.

The protected riparian buffer shall have two zones as follows:\n1. Zone One shall consist of a vegetated area that is undisturbed except for uses provided for in the Table of Uses, Section 19.27-5(B) of this ordinance. The location of Zone One shall be as follows:\na.\nFor intermittent and perennial streams, Zone One shall begin at the top of the bank and extend landward a distance of 30 feet on all sides of the surface water, measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to a vertical line marking the\ntop of the bank.\nb. For ponds, lakes and reservoirs located within a natural drainage way, Zone One shall begin at the normal water level and extend landward a distance of 30 feet, measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to a vertical line marking\nthe normal water level.\n2. Zone Two shall consist of a stable, vegetated area that is undisturbed except for uses provided for in the Table of Uses, Section 19.27-5 (B) of this ordinance. Grading and revegetating in Zone Two is allowed provided that the health of the\nvegetation in Zone One is not compromised. Zone Two shall begin at the outer edge of Zone One and extend landward 20 feet as measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to the surface water. The combined width of Zones One and\nTwo shall be 50 feet on all sides of the surface water.\n(E) Diffuse flow requirements. Diffuse flow of runoff shall be maintained in the riparian buffer by dispersing concentrated flow prior to its entry into the buffer and reestablishing vegetation as follows:\n1. Concentrated runoff from new ditches or man-made conveyances shall be converted to diffuse flow at non-erosive velocities before the runoff enters Zone Two of the riparian buffer;\n2. Periodic corrective action to restore diffuse flow shall be taken as necessary and shall be designed to impede the formation of erosion gullies; and\n3. As set out this ordinance, the Zones of the Riparian Buffer and Table of Uses respectively, no new stormwater conveyances are allowed through the buffers except for those specified in the Table of Uses, Section 19.27-5 of this ordinance,\naddressing stormwater management ponds, drainage ditches, roadside ditches, and stormwater conveyances.\n19.27-5. Potential Uses and Associated Requirements.\n(A) Approval for new development.

The applicant shall certify that the project meets all\nthe following criteria for finding \"no practical alternatives\":\na. The basic project purpose cannot be practically accomplished in a manner that would better minimize disturbance, preserve aquatic life and habitat, and protect water quality;\nb. The use cannot practically be reduced in size or density, reconfigured or redesigned to better minimize disturbance, preserve aquatic life and habitat, and protect water quality; and\nC. Best management practices shall be used if necessary to minimize disturbance, preserve aquatic life and habitat, and protect water quality.\n2. The applicant shall also submit at least the following information in support of their assertion of \"no practical alternatives\":\na. The name, address and phone number of the applicant;\nb. The nature of the activity to be conducted by the applicant;\nC. The location of the activity, including the jurisdiction;\nd. A map of sufficient detail to accurately delineate the boundaries of the land to be utilized in carrying out the activity, the location and dimensions of any disturbance in riparian buffers associated with the activity, and the extent of\nriparian buffers on the land;\ne.\nAn explanation of why this plan for the activity cannot be practically accomplished, reduced or reconfigured to better minimize disturbance to the riparian buffer, preserve aquatic life and habitat and protect water quality;\nand\nf. Plans for any best management practices proposed to be used to control the impacts associated with the activity.\n3.\nWithin 60 days of a submission that addresses Section 19.27-6(A)(2), the Town of Jamestown shall review the entire project and make a finding of fact as to whether the criteria in Section 19.27-6(A)(1) of this section have been met. A finding\nof\n\"no practical alternatives\" shall result in issuance of an authorization certificate. Failure to act within 60 days shall be construed as a finding of \"no practical alternatives\" and an authorization certificate shall be issued to the applicant\nunless one of the following occurs:\na. The applicant agrees, in writing, to a longer period;\nb. The Town determines that the applicant has failed to furnish requested information necessary to the town decision;\nC. The final decision is to be made pursuant to a public hearing; or\nd. The applicant refuses access to its records or premises for the purpose of gathering information necessary to the Town's decision.\n4. The Town may attach conditions to the authorization certificate that support the purpose, spirit and intent of this ordinance.\n5.

Persons who wish to undertake prohibited uses may pursue a variance. The Town of Jamestown may grant minor variances. For major variances, the Town of Jamestown shall prepare preliminary findings and\nsubmit them to the Division of Water Quality, 401 Oversight Express Permitting Unit, or its successor for approval by the environmental management commission. The variance request procedure shall be as follows:\na. For any variance request, the Town of Jamestown shall make a finding of fact as to whether there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships that prevent compliance with the riparian buffer protection requirements. A finding of\npractical difficulties or unnecessary hardships shall require that the following conditions be met:\ni. Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the regulation. It is not necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.\nii. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography.

The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance is not a self-created hardship.\niv. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the regulation, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.\n2. Minor variances. A minor variance request pertains to activities that will impact only Zone Two of the riparian buffer. Minor variance requests shall be reviewed and approved based on the criteria in Section 19.27-6(A)(1) through Section\n19.27-6(A)(3) by the Town pursuant to G.S. 160D-705(d).

Any subsequent amendments to the County ordinance take precedence over this\ntext.\nSec. 20.1. General Requirements.\n20.1-1. Plan Required. No person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity without an erosion control plan approved by the jurisdiction, if the land disturbing activity:\n(A) Exceeds one acre;\n(B) Will take place on highly erodible soils with a \"k\" factor greater than .36 in a watershed critical area;\n(C) Includes a pond or retention structure in a watershed critical area; and\n(D) Will take place in Tier 1 or Tier 2 of a watershed critical area.\n20.1-2. Protection of Property. Persons conducting land-disturbing activity shall take all reasonable measures to protect all public and private property from damage or nuisance caused by such activity.\n20.1-3. More Restrictive Rules Shall Apply. Whenever conflicts exist between federal, state, or local laws, ordinances, or rules, the more restrictive provision shall apply.\nSec. 20.2. Basic Control Objectives.\nA soil erosion and sedimentation control plan may be disapproved pursuant to Section 20.12-13, Grounds for Plan Disapproval, of this ordinance if the plan fails to address the following control objectives:\nIdentify Critical Areas. On-site areas which are subject to severe erosion, and off-site areas which are especially vulnerable to damage from erosion and/or sedimentation, are to be identified and receive special attention;\nLimit Time of Exposure. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time;\nLimit Exposed Areas. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one time;\nControl Surface Water. Surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas should be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during the period of exposure;\nControl Sedimentation. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted so as to prevent off-site sedimentation damage and nuisances to adjacent properties, streets or streams; and\nManage Storm Water Runoff. When the increase in the velocity of storm water runoff resulting from a land-disturbing activity is sufficient to cause accelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse, plans are to include measures to control the\nvelocity at the point of discharge so as to minimize accelerated erosion of the site and increased sedimentation of the stream.\nSec. 20.3. Mandatory Standards for Land Disturbing Activity.\nNo land-disturbing activity subject to the control of this ordinance shall be undertaken except in accordance with the following mandatory standards:\n20.3-1. Buffer Zone. No land-disturbing activity shall be permitted in proximity to a lake or natural watercourse unless a buffer zone is provided along the margin of the watercourse of sufficient width to confine visible siltation within the 25 percent of the\nbuffer zone nearer the land-disturbing activity, provided, that this subsection (A) shall not apply to a land-disturbing activity in connection with the construction of facilities to be located on, over, or under a lake or natural watercourse;\n20.3-2. Graded Slopes and Fills. The angle for graded slopes and fills shall be no steeper than two to one slope if they are to be stabilized with vegetative cover. Slopes or fills steeper than two to one slope must be protected by structures. In any event,\nslopes left exposed will, within 30 days of completion of any phase of grading, be planted or otherwise provided with ground cover, devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion;\n20.3-3. Ground Cover. Whenever land-disturbing activity is undertaken on a tract comprising more than-one acre, if more than one contiguous acre is uncovered, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install such sedimentation and\nerosion control devices and practices as are sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of the tract during construction upon and development of said tract, and shall plant or otherwise provide\na permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion after completion of construction or development. Except as provided in Section 20.4-2(E) of this ordinance, provisions for a ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be accomplished\nwithin 30 working days or 120 calendar days following completion, whichever period is shorter; and\n20.3-4. Prior Plan Approval. No person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity if more than one contiguous acre is to be uncovered unless, 30 or more days prior to initiating the activity, an erosion and sedimentation control plan for such activity is filed\nwith and approved by the jurisdiction.\nSec. 20.4. Design and Performance Standards.\n20.4-1. Design for Ten-Year Storm. Except as provided in Section 20.4-2(B) of this ordinance, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices shall be so planned, designed, and constructed as to provide protection from the\ncalculated maximum peak rate of runoff from the ten-year storm. Runoff rates shall be calculated using the procedures in the USDA, Soil Conservation Service's \"National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices,\" or other acceptable\ncalculation procedures.\n20.4-2. High Quality Water Zones. In High Quality Water (HQW) zones the following design standards shall apply:\n(A) Uncovered areas in HQW zones shall be limited at any time to a maximum total area within the boundaries of the tract to 20 acres. Only this subsection shall govern the portion of the land-disturbing activity within a HQW zone. Larger areas\nmay be uncovered within the boundaries of the tract with the written approval of the director of the N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources.\n(B) Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures and devices within HQW zones shall be so planned, designed and constructed to provide protection from the runoff of the 25-year storm which produces the maximum peak rate of\nrunoff as calculated according to procedures in the United States Department of Agricultural Soil Conservation Service's \"National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices\" or according to procedures adopted by any other agency of\nthis state or the United States or any generally recognized organization or association.\n(C) Sediment basins within HQW zones shall be designed and constructed such that the basin will have a settling efficiency of at least 70 percent for the 40 micron size soil particle transported into the basin by the runoff of that two-year storm\nwhich produces the maximum peak rate of runoff as calculated according to procedures in the United States Department of Agricultural Soil Conservation Service's \"National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices\" or according to\nprocedures adopted by any other agency of this state or the United States or any generally recognized organization or association.\n(D) Newly constructed open channels in HQW zones shall be designed and constructed with side slopes no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical if a vegetative cover is used for stabilization unless soil conditions permit a steeper slope or\nwhere the slopes are stabilized by using mechanical devices, structural devices, or other acceptable ditch liners. In any event, the angle for side slopes shall be sufficient to restrain accelerated erosion.\n(E) Ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be provided for any portion of a land-disturbing activity in HQW zone within 15 working days or 60 calendar days following completion of construction or development, whichever period is\nshorter.\nSec. 20.5. Storm Water Outlet Protection.\n20.5-1. Intent. Stream banks and channels downstream from any land-disturbing activity shall be protected from increased degradation by accelerated erosion caused by increased velocity of runoff from the land-disturbing activity.\n20.5-2. Performance Standard. Persons shall conduct land-disturbing activity so that the post-construction velocity of the ten-year storm runoff in the receiving watercourse to the discharge point does not exceed the greater of:\n(A) The velocity established by Table 11-4-1; or\n(B) The velocity of the ten-year storm runoff in the receiving watercourse prior to development.\nIf conditions (A) or (B) above cannot be met, then the receiving watercourse to and including the discharge point shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity anywhere the velocity exceeds the \"prior to development\"\nvelocity by ten percent.\n20.5-3. Acceptable Management Measures. Measures applied alone or in combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if there are no objectionable secondary consequences. The jurisdiction recognizes that the management of\nstormwater runoff to minimize or control downstream channel and bank erosion is a developing technology. Innovative techniques and ideas will be considered and may be used when shown to have the potential to produce successful results.\nSome alternatives are to:\n(A)\nAvoid increases to surface runoff volume and velocity by including measures to promote infiltration to compensate for increased runoff from areas rendered impervious;\n(B) Avoid increases in stormwater discharge velocities by using vegetated or roughened swales and waterways in lieu of closed drains and high velocity paved sections;\n(C)\nProvide energy dissipaters at outlets of storm drainage facilities to reduce flow velocities at the point of discharge. These may range from simple rip-rapped sections to complex structures.\nTable 20.5-1\nMAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE VELOCITY FOR STORMWATER DISCHARGES\nMaterial\nMaximum Permissible Velocities\nF.P.S.\nM.P.S.\n113 of 150\n10/24/2023, 12:54 PM\n"}, {"page": "114", "text": "Jamestown, NC Land Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nSource: Adapted from recommendations by Special Committee on Irrigation Research, American Society of Civil Engineers, 1926.

This rule shall not apply where it can be demonstrated that stormwater discharge velocities will not create an erosion problem in the receiving watercourse.\nSec. 20.6. Borrow and Waste Areas.\nWhen the person conducting the land-disturbing activity is also the person conducting the borrow or waste disposal activity, areas from which borrow is obtained and which are not regulated by the provisions of the Mining Act of 1971, any waste\nareas for surplus materials other than landfills regulated by the department's division of soil waste management, shall be considered as part of the land-disturbing activity where the borrow material is being used or from which the waste material\noriginated. When the person conducting land-disturbing activity is not the person obtaining the borrow and/or disposing of the waste, these areas shall be considered a separate land-disturbing activity.\nSec. 20.7. Access and Haul Roads.\nTemporary access and haul roads, other than public roads, constructed or used in connection with any land-disturbing activity shall be considered a part of such activity.\nSec. 20.8. Operations in Lakes or Natural Watercourses.\nLand-disturbing activity in connection with construction in, on, over, or under a lake or natural watercourse shall be planned and conducted in such a manner as to minimize the extent and duration of disturbance of the stream channel. The\nrelocation of a stream, where relocation is an essential part of the proposed activity, shall be planned and executed so as to minimize changes in the stream flow characteristics, except when justification for significant alteration to flow characteristic\nis provided. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers shall be notified by the developer of any planned operation in lakes or natural watercourses for possible issuance of Section 404 or other permits.\nSec. 20.9. Responsibility for Maintenance.\nDuring the development of a site, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install and maintain all temporary and permanent erosion and sedimentation control measures as required by the approved plan, by any provision of this\nordinance, or by any ordinance adopted pursuant to this ordinance. After site development, the landowner or person in possession or control of the land shall install and/or maintain all necessary permanent erosion and sediment control measures,\nexcept those measures installed within a road or street right-of-way or easement accepted for maintenance by a governmental agency.\nSec. 20.10. Additional Measures.\nWhenever the Town determines that significant sedimentation is occurring as a result of land-disturbing activity, despite application and maintenance of protective practices, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity will be required to and\nshall take additional protective action.\nSec. 20.11 Existing Uncovered Areas.\n20.11-1. Applicability. All uncovered areas existing on the effective date of this ordinance which are the result of land-disturbing activity, which exceed one contiguous acre, which are subject to continued accelerated erosion, and which are causing off-site\ndamage from sedimentation, shall be provided with a ground cover or other protective measures, structures, or devices sufficient to restrain accelerated erosion and control off-site sedimentation.\n20.11-2. Notice of Violation. The jurisdiction will serve upon the landowner a written notice of violation by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice will set forth the measures needed to comply and will state the time within which\nsuch measures must be completed. In determining the measures required and the time allowed for compliance, the authority serving notice shall take into consideration the economic feasibility, technology, and quantity of work required, and shall\nset reasonably attainable time limits for compliance.\n20.11-3. Requiring Erosion Control Plan. The jurisdiction reserves the right to require preparation and approval of an erosion control plan in any instance where extensive control measures are required.\n20.11-4. Exemption. This rule shall not require ground cover on cleared land forming the future basin of planned reservoir.\nSec. 20.12. Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plans.\n20.12-1. Applicability An erosion control plan shall be prepared for all land-disturbing activities subject to this ordinance whenever the proposed activity is to be undertaken on a tract comprising more than one acre, if more than one contiguous acre is to\nbe uncovered.\n20.12-2. Preparation of Plan.

The plan shall be filed with the jurisdiction, and the Guilford Soil and Water Conservation District, 30 days prior to the commencement of the proposed activity.\n20.12-3. Submission of Plan. Persons conducting land-disturbing activity which covers one or more contiguous acres shall file five copies of the erosion control plan with the jurisdiction, at least 30 days prior to beginning of such activity, and shall keep\nanother copy of the plan on file at the job site. If the jurisdiction, either upon review of such plan or on inspection of the job site, determines that a significant risk of accelerated erosion or off-site sedimentation exists, the jurisdiction will require a\nrevised plan. Pending the preparation of the revised plan, work shall cease or shall continue under conditions outlined by the appropriate authority.\n20.12-4. Financial Responsibility Statement. Erosion control plans may be disapproved unless accompanied by an authorized statement of financial responsibility and ownership. The person financially responsible for the land-disturbing activity or his\nattorney shall sign this statement in fact.\nThe statement shall include the mailing and street addresses of the principal place of business of the person financially responsible and of the owner of the land or their registered agents.

Specific Civil Penalties. Civil penalties for specific violations of Article 20 (Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control) shall be assessed as follows:\n(A)\nGrading without permit: $500.00 per day for failure to secure a valid grading permit prior to conducting a land-disturbing activity for which a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan is required.\n(B) Failure to protect: $500.00 per day for failure to take all reasonable measures to protect public property, or private property, including lakes and/or natural watercourses, from damage caused by land-disturbing activities.\n(C) Failure to follow plan: $300.00 per day for failure to conduct a land-disturbing activity in accordance with the provisions of an approved erosion and sedimentation control plan.\n(D) Failure to install devices: $500.00 per day for failure, when more than one contiguous acre is disturbed, to install erosion and sedimentation control devices sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the\nboundaries of the tract(s) and prevent off-site sedimentation.\n(E) Failure to maintain measures: $300.00 per day for failure to maintain satisfactory erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures and/or devices on the site that are designed to provide protection from the calculated maximum peak\nrate of runoff from the ten-year storm or the 25-year storm in a high-quality storm (HQW) zone.\n(F)\nFailure to maintain temporary measures: $250.00 per day for failure to maintain temporary erosion and sedimentation control measures and facilities during site development.\n(G)\nFailure to maintain slopes: $250.00 per day for failure on graded slopes and fills to maintain an angle sufficient to retain vegetative cover or other adequate erosion and sedimentation control devices or structures.\n(H) Failure to cover slopes: $250.00 per day for failure within 30 days of completion of any phase of grading to plant or otherwise provide exposed, graded slopes or fills with ground cover, devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion.\n(I) Failure to plant cover: $250.00 per day for failure on a tract when more than one contiguous acre is disturbed, to plant or otherwise provide ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion within 30 working days or 120 calendar days, 15 working\ndays or 60 calendar days in high quality water zones, whichever is the shorter, following completion of construction or development.\n(J) Failure to revise plan: $250.00 per day for failure to file an acceptable, revised erosion and sedimentation control plan after being notified of the need to do so.\n(K) Failure to maintain buffer: $250.00 per day for failure to retain a buffer zone of sufficient width along a lake or natural watercourse to confine visible siltation within the 25 percent of the buffer zone nearest the land-disturbing activity.\n(L) Interference with official duties: $500.00 per day for obstructing, hampering, or interfering with any authorized agent of the jurisdiction or the sedimentation control commission while in the process of carrying out his official duties.\n(M) Failure to provide control: $250.00 per day for failure to install or maintain erosion control devices, or prevent off-site sedimentation on sites of land-disturbing activity not requiring a grading permit and with disturbed area of less than one\nacre.\n20.14-5. Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan. Any person who fails to submit an erosion and sedimentation control plan as required by this ordinance shall be subject to a single, non-continuing civil penalty of not more than $1,000.00. Any person may\nbe subject to additional civil penalties for violation of any other provision of this ordinance or rules or orders adopted or issued pursuant to this ordinance.\n20.14-6. Civil Penalty Use. Civil penalties collected for erosion and sedimentation control violations shall be used or disbursed as directed by G.S. 113A-64(a).\nSec. 20.15 Criminal Penalty-Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control.\nAny person who knowingly or willfully violates any soil erosion and sedimentation control provisions of this ordinance, or rule or order adopted or issued pursuant to the soil erosion and sedimentation control provisions, or who knowingly\nor\nwillfully initiates or continues a land disturbing activity for which an erosion and sedimentation control plan is required except in accordance with the terms, conditions, and provisions of an approved plan, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor\npunishable by imprisonment not to exceed 90 days, or by fine not to exceed $5,000.00, or both.\nSec. 20.16 Injunctive Relief-Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control.\nWhenever the enforcement officer has reasonable cause to believe that any person is violating or threatening to violate this ordinance or any rule or order adopted or issued pursuant to this ordinance, or any term, condition, or provision of an\napproved soil erosion and sedimentation control plan the enforcement officer may, either before or after the institution of any other action or proceeding authorized by this ordinance, institute a civil action in the name of the jurisdiction, for\ninjunctive relief to restrain the violation or threatened violation. The action shall be brought in the Superior Court of Guilford County. Upon determination by court that an alleged violation is occurring or is threatened, it shall enter such orders or\njudgments as are necessary to abate the violation or to prevent the threatened violation. The institution of an action for injunctive relief under this section shall not relieve any party to such proceedings from any civil or criminal penalty prescribed\nfor violations of this ordinance.\nARTICLE 21 OPEN SPACE\nSec. 21.1. Purpose.\nThe open space standards contained herein are established to provide for the reservation of open spaces in both residential and non-residential developments located in the Town of Jamestown and its area of jurisdiction. Preservation of open\nspace in developing areas serves a variety of purposes, including meeting the recreational needs of residents, improving the aesthetic character of the community, reducing stormwater runoff, and enhancing air quality. The standards set forth\n115 of 150\n10/24/2023, 12:54 PM\n"}, {"page": "116", "text": "Jamestown, NC Land Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nbelow establish regulations for open space in residential and non-residential developments.\nSec. 21.2 Open Space.\nAlthough open space can be agricultural or natural in character, open space is typically planned and developed as part of a residential or non-residential development. The following standards are hereby established for open space, with the\nexception of The Main Street District, which shall be exempt from the requirements of this section.\n21.2-1. Open Space Land Area Requirements. Open space shall be provided in accordance with the following table for:\n(A) Initial residential development containing eight or more units.\n(B) Redevelopment or additional development that adds eight or more units.\n(C) Initial nonresidential or mixed-use development.\n(D) Redevelopment or additional development that adds 25 percent more nonresidential or mixed-use floor area.\n21.2-2. Land Designated As Future Open Space. Regardless of the requirements and exemptions of this subsection, any portion of the site of the proposed development that is designated as future open space or greenway in any official plan adopted by\nthe Town of Jamestown shall be reserved for open space. This area may be counted toward the total amount of open space required for the development.\nIf the total amount of land required to comply with the area designated as future open space or greenway is less than the total amount of open space required for the development by the above table, then the developer shall provide additional\nopen space to meet the requirement of the above table. If the amount of land designated as future open space or greenway exceeds the total amount of open space required by the above table, then the developer must still provide the open\nspace designated in the official adopted plan.\nAs compensation for any open space dedication associated with implementing any official adopted plan above that requirement listed in the above table, the developer is eligible for a density bonus of one dwelling unit per each 1,000 square feet\nof land area in excess of that required in the above table or 500 square feet of nonresidential gross floor area per each 1,000 square feet of land area in excess of that required in the above table, up to a maximum of a 25 percent increase above\nthe maximum density or intensity allowed in the applicable zoning district.\nAll other regulations, such as erosion control and watershed requirements, shall be complied with when using the density bonus provision of this section.\n21.2-3. Minimum Open Space Area. Individual areas designated as open space areas shall not contain less than 500 square feet, although smaller areas may be approved by the planning director if the intent of this ordinance is determined to be met.\n21.2-4. Improvement of Open Space. With the exception of Natural and Agricultural Open Space, open space shall be planned and improved, accessible and usable by persons living nearby. Improved shall mean cleared of underbrush and debris and may\ncontain one or more of the following improvements: landscaping, walls, fences, walks, statues, fountains, ball fields, and/or playground equipment. Walls and fences shall be made of brick, stone, wrought iron, or wood and shall not exceed three\nand one-half feet in height. (Exceptions: fences used in conjunction with ball fields).\n21.2-5. Design and Location. In major subdivisions and multi-building developments in all zoning districts except Agricultural, open space shall be integrated into the design of the site. In subdivisions where 50 percent or more of the lots are less than one\nacre in size, open space shall be located within one-quarter mile of at least 90 percent of the building lots, as measured along the rights-of-way of streets providing access between the two. In subdivisions where 50 percent or more of the lots are\none acre or more in size, open space shall be located within one-half mile of at least 90 percent of the building lots, as measured along the rights-of-way of streets providing access between the two.\n21.2-6. Focal Point. Open space features should provide focal points for the neighborhood. A central square or green, for example, may comprise a majority of the open space. There should be a hierarchy of open space within new neighborhoods so that\nopen space serves the needs of multiple age groups.\n21.2-7. Types of Open Space. Open space types include squares, parks, forecourts, plazas, greenways, and natural and agricultural. Standards for these open space types are set forth below:\n(A) Squares.\nSquares are areas for passive recreational use. Squares shall be bounded by streets on a minimum of three sides or 75 percent of their perimeter.\nSquares should be used in tight urban environments where residents have little yard space. Squares are used to bring a more natural landscape into an urban environment. As such, not more than 25 percent of a square should be impervious\nsurface coverage. Hardscaping should be decorative, (example brick pavers instead of asphalt for walkways).\nMinimum size: 500 sq. feet\nMaximum Size: 1/2 acre\n(B) Parks.\nParks are areas for passive or active recreational use. Parks should be bounded by streets on a minimum of two sides or 50 percent of their perimeter.\nMinimum Size: 1/4 acre\nMaximum Size: three Acres. Maximum size may exceed three acres if the park serves multiple neighborhoods or preserves environmental features.\nParks should be areas where passive and active recreation occur simultaneously (example: park benches for elderly and a tot-lot for young children), encouraging intergenerational interactions among park users.\n(C) Forecourt.\nForecourts are open spaces that act as buffers between residential buildings and streets or non-residential buildings. Forecourts are entirely bounded by buildings or streets. It is recommended that forecourts be planted parallel to all street\nrights-of-way.\nMinimum Size: 500 square feet\nMaximum Size: 1/4 acre\n(D) Plaza.\n116 of 150\n10/24/2023, 12:54 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nTable 21.1\nCELL (2, 1): \nZoning District\nCELL (2, 2): \nRequired Open Space\nCELL (3, 1): \nAll residential districts.\nCELL (3, 2): \nSingle-family/duplex subdivisions: 10% of subdivision lot area.\nOther residential: 500 square feet of open space per unit or 10% of lot area, whichever is greater.\nNonresidential uses (e.g., churches, schools, etc.): 10% of lot area.\nCELL (4, 1): \nAll other districts, excluding MS (exempt from these requirements)\nCELL (4, 2): \n5% of lot area\n"}, {"page": "117", "text": "Jamestown, NC Land Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nA plaza is an open area adjacent to civic or commercial building. Plazas should be planted with deciduous trees to provide shade in the summer (example: the N.C. State Capital Building lawn in Raleigh, NC). Plazas function as gathering places\nand may incorporate a variety of non-permanent activities such as outdoor farmers markets or craft fairs. Limited parking is permissible on plazas. Plazas should match the architectural style of the buildings that they are adjacent to regarding\nmaterials and design. Plazas shall be level or gently sloping.\nMinimum Size: 2000 square feet\nMaximum Size 3/4 acre\n(E) Greenways.\nGreenways are spaces designed to incorporate natural settings such as creeks and significant stands of trees within a neighborhood.\nGreenways should have streets or pedestrian ROWs parallel to or integrated into at least 75 percent of their length. Greenways are used for walking, jogging, biking, and they are used as wildlife corridors. Greenways may have infrequent small-\nscale active recreational facilities such as playgrounds, although the majority of greenways should be for passive recreation.\n(F) Natural and Agricultural Open Space.\nNatural and agricultural open space preserves agricultural lands, environmentally sensitive areas, scenic views, cultural features, and rural character that would likely be lost through conventional development approaches. To accomplish this\ngoal, the Town of Jamestown encourages creativity and allows for greater flexibility in the design of developments through use of the Cluster Development Overlay District (Article 8).\nNatural and agricultural open space shall be placed in preserves, which may adjoin housing areas that have been designed more compactly to create larger areas that may be enjoyed equally by all residents of the development.\n21.2-8. Open Space Ownership and Conservation Easement. Open space may be owned or administered by one or a combination of the following methods: fee simple ownership by unit of government or private non-profit land conservancy; owned by a\nhomeowners' association; or by individual private ownership such as a farmer, developer or other private entity that maintains the open space (i.e., farming, equestrian facility, etc.).\nAll lands within areas required to be maintained as open space shall be protected by permanent conservation easement, prohibiting further development, and setting other standards safeguarding the site's special resources from negative\nchanges.\nPublic use of the open space may be limited to residents of the development except for land used for public sidewalks and multi-use trails.\n21.2-9. Maintenance. The owner or lessee of the property designated as the open space shall be responsible for the maintenance of the open space area. Landscaped areas shall be maintained in good condition and the entire area shall be kept clear of\ndebris. Failure to maintain the area shall constitute a violation of this ordinance and subject the violator to the penalty provisions of Article 23 if not corrected within 30 days of notification. Alternatively, if acceptable to the Town, as applicable,\nthe\nland may be dedicated to the city for public use and thereafter maintained by the Town.\n21.2-10. Land Acceptable for Open Space Designation. The classes of land enumerated below may be utilized to meet the requirements of this section:\n(A) Open water, wetlands, and undisturbed floodplains may account for up to 50 percent of the requirement.\n(B) Land used for public sidewalks significantly in excess of standard sidewalk requirements, streetscape and hardscape areas accessible to the public including sidewalk cafe areas, areas containing public art, and similar urban open space\namenities.\n(C) Land on which locally or nationally designated historic structures are located and determined to be contributing to the designation.\n(D) Land which exceeds a ten percent slope may be used to provide up to 50 percent of the required open space if existing slopes and vegetation so designated remain undisturbed.\n(E) Land used for stormwater retention, provided such land is natural in appearance and is not separately fenced, may be used for up to 50 percent of the required open space; green roofs are eligible to be counted as open space under this\nprovision. Additionally, land used for stormwater retention, provided such land is natural in appearance and is not separately fenced, that is developed using best management practices (e.g., constructed wetlands, rain gardens, green roofs or\nsimilar features), and either exceeds the required amount of retention or treats off-site stormwater may be used for up to 100 percent of the required open space at the discretion of the planning director after consultation with the public\nworks director.\n(F) Land available to residents or tenants for active or passive recreation, including parks, walking trails not used to meet sidewalk requirements, playgrounds, benches, picnic tables, and similar land uses or facilities.\n(G)\nLand that is suitable for agriculture, land that has environmentally sensitive areas (e.g., mature trees), or land that has cultural significance (e.g., important view such as a rural entrance into Town).\n21.2-11. Land Not Acceptable for Open Space Designation. The classes of land enumerated below shall not be utilized to meet the requirements of this section:\n(A) Land that is contaminated with hazardous or toxic waste or materials as defined by state or federal regulations, with the exception of land covered by an approved mitigation plan and deemed acceptable to the Town or land that is designated\nin an officially adopted open space or greenway master plan.\n(B) Land occupied by streets, drives, parking areas, required landscape buffers, or structures other than recreational structures.\n(C) Land with a minimum width less than 24 feet unless part of greenway system or specifically approved by the planning director. Mixed use developments in the TND district are exempt from the minimum width requirement.\nSec. 21.3 Fee-in-Lieu.\nFor open space requirements of 5,000 or less square feet in area and not involving property designated as a greenway on any official plan adopted by the Town of Jamestown, a property owner may elect to pay a fee-in-lieu of open space instead of\nproviding the open space provided that the planning director deems that there is reasonable existing or future open space proximate to the subject parcel. For other required open space areas, a property owner may pay a fee-in-lieu of open space\ndesignation for all or a portion of the open space requirement if such fee-in-lieu is acceptable to the Town. For developments and subdivisions containing more than 50 residential units, the fee-in-lieu option may only be used for up to 50 percent of\nthe\nopen space requirements in order to ensure that these larger projects provide on-site open space for their residents.\nThis fee shall be calculated by using the pro rata value of the designated property relative to the value of the entire site to be developed using tax appraisal data; for properties covered by agricultural or other exemptions, the Town may utilize\na\nseparate appraisal method in its sole discretion. Funds collected in this manner shall be maintained in a separate account and shall be used to purchase or to enhance recreational use of property provided such features are reasonably proximate\nto\nthe site(s) from which the funds are collected. Where practical, the collected fees for each project shall be designated for specific parks and recreation acquisitions and/or enhancements by the Town.\nARTICLE 22 INONCONFORMITIES\nSec. 22.1. Purpose.\nIt is recognized that, over time, lawful nonconformities may develop as a result of amendments to the zoning map or unified development ordinance which change the application of Town of Jamestown development regulations to particular\nproperties. It is important that such properties, while nonconforming, be adequately maintained and permitted to continue, but not expanded or enlarged in any fashion that increases the extent of nonconformity. Where possible, such\nnonconformities should be made, wholly or incrementally, conforming.\nSec. 22.2 Application.\nThe provisions of this section apply only to lawful nonconformities, except as noted below. Nonconformities other than lawful nonconformities shall be considered violations of the unified development ordinance. This article shall not apply,\nhowever, to any feature which is the subject of a variance from particular regulations that has been granted by an authorized reviewing board or commission or to applications of flexible development standards to such features. Where a variance or\nflexible development standards determination has been granted for a feature which does not otherwise conform to the requirements of this Code, that feature shall be deemed conforming. Nonconformities associated with signs are addressed in\nArticle 17.\nSec. 22.3. Dimensional Nonconformities.\n117 of 150\n10/24/2023, 12:54 PM\n"}, {"page": "118", "text": "Jamestown, NC Land Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\n22.3-1. Lawfully Established Nonconforming Lots. Lawfully established nonconforming lots having one or more dimensional nonconformities may be used for any permitted or special use allowed in the zoning district in which the lot is located provided\nthat any structure or expansion/addition to an existing structure proposed for the use meets all applicable dimensional and numerical requirements and all applicable procedures are followed. Such lots may be recombined with adjoining lots\nto\nincrease the extent of their conformity provided new nonconformities are not created.\n22.3-2. Structures. Structures having one or more dimensional nonconformities may be used for any permitted or special use allowed in the zoning district in which structure is located, and, upon any change in use, shall comply with the landscaping,\nbuffering, and parking requirements of Articles 11 and 12. Structures may be expanded or enlarged, provided the extent of the applicable nonconformity is not increased or new nonconformities are not created by expansion or enlargement.\nExpansions, enlargements or reconstruction of such structures to an extent equal to or greater than 50 percent of appraised value, shall require such structures to meet all applicable dimensional and numerical requirements, except density,\nwhich may be retained at the prior nonconforming level but not increased. For the purpose of this section, the value of any expansions, enlargements, or reconstruction of such structures over a three-year period shall be cumulated in calculating\nthe 50 percent threshold.\nA structure undergoing renovation (defined in Article 3) having a renovation cost equal to or greater than 50 percent of the structure's appraised value shall not be subject to the above provisions but shall be required to meet the landscaping,\nbuffering, and parking provisions of Articles 11 and 12.\nSec. 22.4. Nonconforming Uses.\n22.4-1. Discontinuation of Nonconforming Uses. A nonconforming use is allowed to continue unless the use is discontinued for a period of 180 or more consecutive days, and there are no substantial good faith efforts to re-establish the use during this\nperiod. Obtaining permits to maintain the existing use or significant continuous efforts to market the property for sale or lease for the existing use (e.g., MLS listing, realtor contract, etc.) shall be regarded as substantial good faith efforts.\nA\nnonconforming use shall be deemed discontinued after a period of 365 consecutive days regardless of any substantial good faith efforts to re-establish the use.\nThereafter, the structure or property associated with the use may be used only for conforming use. special uses discontinued for a period of 365 or more consecutive days shall be regarded as nonconforming uses and shall not be re-established\nwithout new special use permit approval.\nThe Town is required to bring enforcement action within ten years of discontinuation of any nonconforming use, or the use in question may continue without interference from the Town. Additionally, the Town may prevent any nonconforming use\nfrom restarting a terminated use for ten years from the time of expiration of the use.\n22.4-2. Replacement of One Nonconforming Use with Another Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming use may be allowed to be replaced by another nonconforming use of equal or lesser impact upon a finding by the planning board that the proposed use\nis more nearly compatible with the surrounding properties than the nonconforming use which it replaces, as measured by traffic or noise generation, site activity, hours of operation, and other factors that the planning board finds relevant to\ncompare or differentiate between the existing use(s) and the proposed replacement use(s). The planning board may establish reasonable conditions to ensure that use compatibility is maintained as approved.

No tower or other new support structure shall be permitted in any existing or planned (i.e., platted) residential neighborhood.\nB. If a new telecommunications support structure is proposed to be located within one-half mile of an existing or planned residential neighborhood, irrespective of the type of zoning, the support structure shall not be taller than ten feet above the\ntallest obstruction between the proposed support structure and a residential neighborhood.\nC. Applicants shall locate, site and erect all facilities and associated equipment in accordance with the following priorities, in the following order:\n1. On existing structures without increasing the height or size of the profile of the tower or structure.\n2.\nOn existing structures without increasing the height of the structure by more than can be proven by clear and convincing technical evidence is technically needed.\n3. On properties in areas zoned for commercial use.\n4. On properties in areas zoned for rural use.\n5. On properties in designated historic districts without increasing the height or size of the profile of the support structure and only if camouflaged or stealthed to the satisfaction of the planning director.\n6.

If the proposed site is not proposed for the highest priority listed above, then a detailed narrative and technical explanation shall be provided as regards why a site from all higher priority designations was not selected. The person seeking such an\nexception must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the planning director and the board the reason or reasons why a special use permit or administrative approval should be granted for the proposed site.\nF. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary, the Town may approve any site located within an area in the above list of priorities, provided that the Town finds that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the\nTown and its inhabitants and will not have a deleterious effect on the nature and character of the community and neighborhood. The Town may also direct that the proposed location be changed to another location that is more in keeping with\nthe\ngoals of this section and the public interest as determined by the board and that serves the intent of the applicant.\nG.\nNotwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an area of highest priority or highest available priority, the Town may disapprove an application for any of the following reasons:\n1. Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and requirements, including but not limited to setback and fall zone requirements;\n2. Non-compliance with zoning or land use regulations;\n3.\nThe placement and location of a facility or complex would create an unacceptable risk, or the reasonable possibility of such, to any person or entity for physical or financial damage, or of trespass on private property;\n4.

Conflicts with the provisions of zoning or land use regulations;\n6. Failure to submit a complete application as required under this section within 60 days after proper notice and opportunity to make the application complete shall be deemed to have been abandoned and require no action.\nH. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, for good cause shown such as the ability to utilize a shorter, smaller or less intrusive facility or complex elsewhere and still accomplish the primary service objective, if relocation could result\nin less intrusive facility or complex singly or in combination with other locations, the Town may require the relocation of a proposed site, including allowing for the fact that relocating the site chosen by the applicant may require the use of more\nthan one site to provide substantially the same service.\nSec. 25.14. Type and Height of Towers.\nA. All new towers shall be of the monopole type. No new towers of a lattice or guyed type shall be permitted, unless relief is otherwise expressly granted by the town council.\nB. The maximum permitted total height of a new tower or other proposed support structure shall be 100 feet above pre-construction ground level, unless it can be shown by clear and convincing technical evidence from a carrier who has committed\nto use the tower that such height would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service in the intended service area within the Town. The maximum permitted height is permissive and is expressly not as-of-right.\nC. As the policy decision has been made that more facilities of shorter and less intrusive height is in the public interest, as opposed to fewer but taller support structures, spacing or the distance between facilities shall be such that the service may\nbe provided without exceeding the maximum permitted height.\nIf proposed to be taller than the maximum permitted height, the applicant for a new tower or support structure shall submit clear and convincing technical evidence by a carrier or wireless service provider that has committed to use the tower\nor\nother support structure justifying the total height requested and the basis therefore, as well as a copy of lease or a written commitment to use the facility upon completion of its construction. If the applicant chooses to provide evidence in the\nform of propagation studies, such must include all modeling information and support data used to produce the studies at the requested height and a minimum of ten feet lower to enable verification of the need for the requested height. The Town\nor its delegee will provide the form that shall be used for reporting such information.\nD. The Town reserves the right to require a drive test to be conducted under the supervision of the Town or its delegate i) as evidence of; or ii) to verify the technical need for what is requested.\n133 of 150\n10/24/2023, 12:54 PM\n"}, {"page": "134", "text": "Jamestown, NC Land Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nE.
