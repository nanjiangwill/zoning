Mobile homes\non individual lots are permitted. (See Article V for permitted uses and Article VI\nfor specific area and yard requirements.)\nF.\nA-1, Agricultural District. This district is primarily intended to accommodate\nvery low density residential uses as well as associated public and institutional\nuses, low intensity commercial uses, and agricultural-related industrial uses\nwhich are interspersed throughout areas that are principally characterized as\nrural in nature. This district reflects the diverse nature of land uses within\npredominantly rural areas and, therefore, permits a wide array of land uses.\nHowever, those intensive land uses, which could have an adverse impact on the\nrural nature, are not permitted or are allowed only on a special use permit basis\nfollowing a formal review and approval process. The district is specifically\nestablished for the following purposes:\n1.\nTo preserve and encourage the continued use of land for agricultural,\nforestry, and open space purposes;\n2.\nTo encourage small-scale and low intensity commercial uses that primarily\nprovide goods and services to residents of the surrounding rural areas;\n3.\nTo encourage only those industries which are agricultural-related;\n4.\nTo encourage the concentration of more intensive urban land uses in and\naround identified growth areas that have the capacity to accommodate the\nutility and traffic demands of such development, thereby avoiding\npremature conversion of farmland to urban uses; and\n5.\nTo discourage any use which, because of its character, would create\npremature or extraordinary public infrastructure and service demands.\n(See Article V for permitted uses and Article VI for specific area and yard\nrequirements.)\nG.\nB-1, General Business District. This district is defined as certain areas that are\ndesigned to serve both non-residents and residents using the major state and\ncounty roads that run through the areas zoned. This district is designed to\naccommodate retail or service establishments customarily patronized by\ntransient traffic as well as non-transient traffic. This district allows a range of\nretail, service, office, limited wholesale, and moderate density residential uses\nthat have access to major roads and the necessary utilities to support such\ndevelopment.

This\ndistrict is intended to serve limited manufacturing, warehousing, wholesaling, and\nrelated commercial and service activities that have little or no adverse impact\nupon adjoining properties.

The\nrezoning process established in this Section provides for the accommodation of such\nuses by a reclassification of property into a conditional district, subject to additional\nconditions which ensure compatibility of the proposed use with the use and\nenjoyment of neighboring properties. A conditional district allows a particular use or\nuses to be established only in accordance with specified standards and conditions\ntailored to each individual development project. This is a voluntary rezoning\nprocedure that is intended for firm development proposals. It is not intended or\nsuited for securing early zoning for tentative proposals that may not be undertaken\nfor some time.\nB.\nThe review and approval process for conditional district petitions involves a\nlegislative hearing and legislative decision by the Board of County Commissioners.\nThe review of conditional district petitions shall be undertaken in accordance with the\nprovisions of Sections 14.03 through 14.05.\nC.\nProperty may be placed in a conditional district only in response to a petition by the\nowners of all the property to be included. A petition for a conditional district shall\ninclude:\n1.\nA master site plan prepared in accordance with Appendix A;\n2.\nWritten supporting documentation that specifies the actual use or uses\nproposed for the property, and\n3.\nProposed rules, regulations, and conditions that, in addition to all\npredetermined requirements of this Ordinance, will govern the development\nand use of the property.\n4.\nA statement analyzing the reasonableness of the proposed rezoning.\nD.\nConditional districts, as established in Section 4.03, parallel general use zoning\ndistricts. Only those land uses (including uses by right, special uses, and conditional\nArticle 14, Amendments\n14-5\nOctober 2, 2006\n"}, {"page": "302", "text": "uses) permitted in a general use zoning district to which a conditional zoning district\ncorresponds shall be allowed.

Before a public hearing may be\nheld on a petition for a conditional district, the petitioner must file with the Zoning\nAdministrator a written report of at least one community informational meeting held\nby the petitioner.\n1.\nThe community informational meeting shall be held prior to the date of the\nPlanning Board meeting at which the petition will be reviewed.\n2.\nWritten notice of such a meeting shall be given to the property owners and\norganizations entitled to notice as determined by policies established by the\nCounty.\n3.\nThe petitioner's report shall include, among other things, a listing of those\npersons and organizations contacted about the meeting and the manner and\ndate of contact; the date; time and location of the meeting; a roster of the\nnames, mailing addresses, and telephone numbers of the persons in\nattendance at the meeting; a summary of issues discussed at the meeting; and\na description of any changes to the rezoning petition made by the petitioner as\na result of the meeting.\n4.\nIn the event the petitioner has not held at least one meeting pursuant to this\nsubsection, the petitioner shall file a report with the Zoning Administrator\ndocumenting efforts that were made to arrange such a meeting and stating the\nreasons such a meeting was not held.\n5.\nThe adequacy of a meeting held or report filed pursuant to this section shall be\nconsidered by the Board of County Commissioners but shall not be subject to\njudicial review.\nF.\nReview and Approval Process. The review and approval of a petition for a\nconditional district shall follow the same process as outlined in Sections 14.03\nthrough 14.05 for a general use rezoning.\n1.\nIn the course of evaluating the proposed use, the Board of County\nCommissioners may request additional information deemed appropriate to\nprovide a complete analysis of the proposal.\n2.\nConditional district decisions are a legislative process subject to judicial review\nusing the same procedures and standard of review applicable to general use\ndistrict zoning decisions.\n3.\nConditional district decisions shall be made in consideration of identified\nrelevant adopted land use plans for the area, including, but not limited to, land\nArticle 14, Amendments\n14-6\nOctober 2, 2006\n"}, {"page": "303", "text": "development plans, comprehensive plans, strategic plans, district plans, small\narea plans, corridor plans, and other land development policy documents.\nG.\nConditions to Approval.

If a petition for a conditional district is approved, the\ndevelopment and use of the property shall be governed by the predetermined\nordinance requirements applicable to the district's classification, the approved site\nplan or master plan for the district, and any additional approved rules, regulations,\nand conditions, all of which shall constitute the zoning regulations for the approved\ndistrict and are binding on the property as an amendment to this Ordinance and to\nthe zoning map.\n1.\nIf a petition is approved, only those uses and structures indicated in the\napproved petition and site plan shall be allowed on the subject property.

Maintenance includes\nactions necessary to keep screening materials healthy, neat and orderly in\nappearance and free of litter and debris.
