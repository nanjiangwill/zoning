For purposes of this standard, the \"active\" wall\nshall be the side of the building containing the majority of storefronts, customer entrances, and windows.\n(F)\nSITE LAYOUT AND BUILDING ORIENTATION AT TWO INTERSECTING STREETS\n1) Intent\nMajor intersections of commercial activity in Midway need special attention so that all street corners\nare linked and function as a whole, and so that a sense of place and \"arrival\" unique to Midway is created.\n2) Applicability\nAll new nonresidential developments located at the intersection of two streets shall comply with this\nsubsection's site layout and building orientation standards.\n3) Site Layout and Building Orientation\nTo the maximum extent practicable, within each intersection quadrant, primary buildings and/or pad\nsite buildings shall be arranged to orient to the streets and to frame the corner at the intersection of the\ntwo streets. Deep building setbacks behind large expanses of parking areas or vacant land shall be\navoided.\nA minimum of sixty percent (60%) of all street frontages shall be occupied by:\nbuilding frontage;\ndecorative architectural walls no higher than three feet;\nlandscaped entryway signage or features;\nrequired focal point; and/or site amenities.\n"}, {"page": "28", "text": "The remaining forty percent (40%) of the street frontage may be occupied by parking areas, or by\nbreaks for vehicle or pedestrian access.\nParking areas shall not be located within a 150-foot radius from the intersection of the centerlines of\nthe two streets.\n4) Focal Point Required\nOn each of the corners of a street intersection, developments shall provide a \"focal point\" within a 200-\nfoot radius from the intersection of the centerlines of the streets. A \"focal point\" shall be visible from\nthe intersecting thoroughfare streets and may be either:\nA distinctively-designed building, which may include a pad site building, preferably with a vertical\nelement; but shall not include drive-through facilities and automobile service stations;\nAn architectural feature that is a minimum of twenty-five feet (25') tall and a maximum forty-five feet\n(45') tall (e.g., a clock tower, spire, or interesting roof form);\nPublic art or sculpture;\nFountains or other water\nfeature; Public plazas or other\nopen space; or Landscape\nfeature.\n5) Integration\nAny of the features listed above may be integrated with major entryway signage for the development.\nWith Town approval, the \"focal point\" required by Section 17-3(E)(4) above may be used to satisfy the\nsite amenities requirement for commercial developments stated in subsection 17-3(F)(3) below.\n6) (6.) Organization\nWithin each intersection quadrant, new buildings shall be organized to align with existing buildings\nlocated across the intersecting streets in a way that \"completes\" the space around the corner and unites\nthe adjacent developments.\n(G)\nPAD SITES\n1) Intent\nThe siting and design of smaller retail stores, or \"pads,\" can create a more inviting appearance in a larger\ndevelopment by visibly reducing the project's scale and by expanding the range of activities and\nbusinesses found within a single development. The location, orientation of the entry, and architecture\nof pad site buildings also provide opportunities to frame entries into larger developments and contribute\nto the development's visual interest by placing storefront spaces closer to the street and creating a street\nscene.

Even dispersal of pad sites in\na widely- spaced pattern within the development, even if along the street edge(s), is discouraged.\nPlacement of pad sites shall be consistent with the requirements for overall development pattern and\nsite layout set forth in this Section.\n4) Spaces Between Adjacent Pad Sites\nWherever practicable, spaces between adjacent pad site buildings should be improved to provide small\npockets (preferably heavily-landscaped) of customer parking, pedestrian connections, small-scale\nproject amenities, or focal points. Examples include, without limitation:\nA landscaped pedestrian walkway linking customer entrances between two or more pad site\nbuildings;\nA public seating or outdoor eating area;\nAn area landscaped with a variety of living materials emphasizing four-season colors, textures, and\nvarieties; or\nSculptures or fountains.\n5) Building Orientation on Pad Sites\nThe primary fa\u00e7ade of a building located on a pad site, typically the fa\u00e7ade containing the primary\ncustomer entrance, may be oriented in a variety of ways, including, without limitation, toward the\nprimary access street, toward an internal \"main street,\" framing a primary entrance to the development\nor center, toward the side (especially when that side faces another pad site building), or toward the\ninterior of the center.\n6) Pad Site Building Design\nPad site buildings shall incorporate the same materials and colors as those on the primary commercial\nbuilding(s) in the development or center.\nSignificant departures from \"off-the-shelf\" standardized corporate building design may be required to\nmeet this standard.\nPad site entrances are appropriate locations to express individual building character or identity.\nCustomer entrances shall be emphasized through incorporation of a building recess, projection, canopy,\nor similar design element.\n"}, {"page": "30", "text": "(H)\nSite Amenities\n1) Intent\nSite amenities and pedestrian-scale features (e.g., outdoor plazas, street furniture, playgrounds, statuary,\nsidewalk cafes) in commercial developments offer attractive spaces for customer and visitor interaction\nand create an inviting image for both customers and employees. The use of site amenities can also\nprovide pedestrian spaces at the entry to buildings, can break up expanses of parking, enhance the\noverall development quality, and contribute to the character of an area.\nDesign Guidelines and Standards\n2) General Guidelines\nSite amenities and gathering places can vary widely in size, in type, and in degree of amenity. Buildings,\ntrees, walls, topography, and other site features within a commercial development should be oriented\nand arranged to enclose such gathering places and lend a human scale.\nStandards for Site Amenities\n3) Minimum Area Devoted to Site Amenities\nNew commercial developments with a parking ratio of less than 5 spaces per 1000 square feet of gross\nfloor areas shall provide a minimum of 10 square feet of site amenities, open areas, and public gathering\nplaces for each 10 parking spaces.\nNew commercial developments with a parking ratio of 5 per 1000 square feet of gross floor area or\ngreater shall provide a minimum of 15 square feet of site amenities, open areas, and public gathering\nplaces for each 10 parking spaces.\n4) Allowed Site Amenities\nSite amenities may consist of any of the\nfollowing: Patio or plaza with seating area;\nMini-parks, squares, or greens;\nCustomer walkways or pass-throughs containing window displays;\nWater feature;\nClock tower;\nPublic art;\nAny other similar, deliberately shaped area and/or focal feature that adequately enhances such\ndevelopment and serves as a gathering place.\n5) Aggregation Allowed\nIn commercial developments containing more than one building, the required area may be aggregated\ninto one larger space, provided such space is within easy walking distance of the major tenant(s) in the\ndevelopment.\n"}, {"page": "31", "text": "6) Design Requirements\nAll site amenities within a commercial development shall be an integral part of the overall design and\nwithin easy walking distance of major buildings, major tenants, and any transit stops.\nAny such amenity/area shall have direct access to the public sidewalk network.\nThe amenity/area shall be constructed of materials that are similar in quality to the principal materials\nof the primary buildings and landscape.\n7) Site Amenities as Focal Points\nA site amenity may qualify as a focal point required under Section 17-3(E) above, provided the site\namenity meets all applicable requirements for focal points stated herein.\n8) Site Amenities as Transitions\nA site amenity may qualify as a \"green/open space transition\" required under Section 17-4 below,\nprovided the site amenity meets all applicable requirements for transitions stated in the following\nSection.\n(I)\nRELATIONSHIP TO SURROUNDING DEVELOPMENT\n1) Intent\nTypical tools for making the transition between commercial development and other, less intensive land\nuses have included back-to-back building orientation, large distances between uses, and heavily-\nlandscaped buffer areas, often with fences and walls. However, some of the unintended results of this\ninclude excessive land consumption and lack of pedestrian and vehicle connections. Accordingly, the\nfollowing design guidelines and standards ensure that new commercial development, where practicable,\nprovides convenient pedestrian and vehicle access and connections to adjacent uses. In addition, they\nurge the use of alternative transitions, including architectural transitions such as reducing the scale of\ncommercial building mass next to residential uses and at least some front-to-front building orientations,\nand development of less intense land uses between commercial and single-family residential areas, such\nas lower-intensity office, civic/open space, or multi-family land uses. Limited operational compatibility\nstandards are offered as a tool to further ease transitions from more intense to less intense land uses.\nLandscaped buffers, walls, and fences are used only when these other alternative transitions are not\neffective, not possible, or not desirable given prevailing development patterns in a specific area.\nTransitions Between Land Uses\n2) When Required\nTransitions shall be required in the following situations:\nChanges in use intensity between adjoining properties, such as from commercial to residential or multi-\nfamily residential to single-family residential.\nViews, uses, or activities on the commercial development site that could be a nuisance for neighbors,\nsuch as commercial loading and service areas.\n"}, {"page": "32", "text": "Transition Techniques\n3) General Guideline/Standard\nAn applicant shall incorporate architectural transitions and green/open space transitions and lesser\nintensive uses as transitions to the maximum extent practicable before employing more traditional\nbuffering and screening transitions. Operational compatibility standards shall apply to all commercial\ndevelopment, regardless of type of transition technique used; however, the combination of architectural\ntransitions, green/open space transitions, and operational compatibility standards should work to\nreduce the need for more intensive buffering and screening transitions.\n4) Preferred Techniques\nWhen a transition is required, an applicant shall incorporate, to the maximum extent practicable, the\narchitectural and green/open space transition techniques tools stated below:\n5) Architectural Transitions\nTo the maximum extent practicable, commercial development shall employ a minimum of three (3) of\nthe following techniques to ensure compatibility with surrounding development, including adjacent\nresidential development:\nUse similar building\nsetback. Use similar\nbuilding height. Use\nsimilar roof form.\nMitigate the larger mass of commercial buildings with fa\u00e7ade articulation.\nUse front-to-front building orientations, especially with commercial uses that are pedestrian-intensive\n(e.g., restaurants, banks). Other building-to-building orientations may be utilized except that a back-to-\nfront building orientation is not an acceptable transition tool.\n6) Green/Open Space Transitions\nCommercial development may employ the following technique to provide transitions and ensure\ncompatibility between the commercial development and surrounding development:\nUse small green spaces, courts, squares, parks, plazas, and similar spaces that can also function as\ncommunity gathering places.\nUse existing natural features as transitions, including natural differences in topography (not retaining\nwalls), streams, existing stands of trees, and similar features. When existing natural features are used as\ntransitions, pedestrian connections shall still be required between the land uses.\n7) Community-Serving Uses as Transitions\nWhen office, small-scale retail, pedestrian-intensive retail, civic, or public uses are planned as part of the\nsame development containing more intensive commercial uses, the applicant may site the lesser-\n"}, {"page": "33", "text": "intensive uses or more community-serving uses as transitions to lower-intensity, adjacent uses.

Conifers may be substituted for shrubs at a ratio of one (1)\nconifer for every four (4) shrubs. Landscaping materials shall meet the requirements of Section 17-7.\n10) Supplemental Fences and Walls\nWhen necessary, to further assure an adequate buffer between the commercial development and\nadjacent use, fences and walls meeting the requirements of this Ordinance may be used in combination\nwith the landscaping provided above.\n(J)\nVEHICULAR AND PEDESTRIAN ACCESS AND CIRCULATION\n1) Intent\nProvide safe, efficient, and convenient vehicular and pedestrian access and circulation patterns within\nand between developments. By creating a safe, continuous network of pedestrian walkways within and\nbetween developments, pedestrians will feel more inclined to safely walk (rather than drive) between\nstores. A pedestrian network that offers clear circulation paths from the parking areas to building entries\ncreates a friendlier, more inviting image.\nVehicle Access and Circulation\n2) Primary Vehicle Access--Large Commercial Centers\nPrimary access to large commercial centers shall be from the thoroughfare street system. In order to\nmaximize the efficiency of the Town's Street network, major traffic generators should be located so that\ntheir primary access is from a thoroughfare or commercial access road.\nLarge commercial centers should be located at the intersection of thoroughfare streets so that access is\navailable for both east/west and north/south traffic. Primary access points should be located so that\ncommercial traffic is separated from the residential street system.\nIf a large commercial center is proposed at a location or density that will have a significant effect on\ncurrent traffic patterns, a traffic impact study may be required to ensure that the street network can\naccommodate the anticipated traffic demands and to define required street improvements.\n"}, {"page": "34", "text": "3) Primary Vehicle Entrances\nThe number and location of vehicle entrances to a commercial development shall be consistent with the\nexisting or anticipated design of adjacent streets. The specific location of primary vehicle entrances are\nsubject to the approval of the Planning Board and NCDOT and will be largely dependent on the following\nfactors:\nThe location of existing or planned median breaks;\nSeparation requirements between the entrance and major intersections;\nSeparation requirements between adjacent entrances (or minor\nintersections); The need to provide shared access to adjacent parcels of land;\nThe need to align with previously approved or constructed access points on the opposite side of the\nstreet; and\nThe minimum number of entrances needed to move traffic onto and off the site safely and efficiently.\n4) Entry Driveway Configuration\nThe specific design or geometrics of commercial development entry driveways shall comply with the\nintent of these guidelines and shall conform to the standards of the NC Department of Transportation.\nCommercial driveway configuration and design shall be appropriate given the size of the development\nand the capacity of the street.\nDriveway geometrics shall be dependent on a variety of factors, including traffic volume, speed, and\ndistribution.

Corner and through lots will have no rear setbacks, but only front\nand side setbacks. For most lots, depth of a rear setback shall be measured perpendicular to the\nlot line, so that the required setback is a strip of the minimum depth prescribed by district\nregulations. However, in the case of lots whose rear lines intersect in the general form of an angle\npointing away from the street the required rear setback shall be construed as running between\nthe apex of the angle and a line parallel to the rear line of the required front setback, and at the\ndistance prescribed for a rear setback from the apex of the angle.

In lieu of seeking\nsuch a determination, a person claiming a vested right may bring an original civil action as provided by\nNCGS 160D-405(c).\n1) A vested right shall be deemed established upon the valid or conditional approval of a site-specific\ndevelopment plan submitted with the application by the Planning Board, the Board of Adjustments,\nor the Town Council (hereinafter referred to as the governing board) whichever has jurisdiction\nover the zoning action being considered following notice and a publichearing.\n2) Such vested right shall confer upon the landowner the right to undertake and complete the\ndevelopment and use of said property under the terms and conditions of the site-specific\ndevelopment plan which plan may be approved upon such terms and conditions as may be\nreasonably necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Failure to abide by the\nterms and conditions imposed shall result in the forfeiture of a vested right.\n3) A right which has been vested as provided for in this section shall remain vested for a period of two\nyears which period shall not be extended by any amendment or modification to a site-specific\ndevelopment plan unless expressly provided by the governing board.\n4) The establishment of a zoning vested right shall not preclude the application of overlay zoning that\nimposes additional requirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or\npreclude Ordinances or regulations that are general in nature and are applicable to all property\nsubject to land-use regulation by the Town, including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing,\n"}, {"page": "156", "text": "electrical, and mechanical codes.

Each type of vested right listed\nin this subsection is defined by and is subject to the limitations provided in this section.

Requirements for site-specific vesting plans. - For the purposes of this section, a \"site-\nspecific vesting plan\" means a plan submitted to the Town of Midway describing with\nreasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of\nproperty.

What\nconstitutes a site-specific vesting plan shall be defined by the relevant development\nregulation, and the development approval that triggers vesting shall be so identified at\nthe time of its approval. At a minimum, the regulation shall designate a vesting point\nearlier than the issuance of a building permit. In absence of a Town of Midway regulation\nsetting forth what constitutes a site-specific vesting plan, any development approval\nshall be considered to be a site-specific vesting plan. A variance shall not constitute a\nsite-specific vesting plan and approval of a site-specific vesting plan with the condition\nthat a variance be obtained shall not confer a vested right unless and until the necessary\nvariance is obtained. If a sketch plan or other document fails to describe with reasonable\ncertainty the type and intensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property, it may\nnot constitute a site-specific vesting plan.\n"}, {"page": "157", "text": "d. Process for approval and amendment of site-specific vesting plans. - If a site-specific\nvesting plan is based on an approval required by the Town of Midway development\nregulations, a notice and hearing is required for that underlying approval. If the duration\nof the underlying approval is less than two years, that shall not affect the duration of the\nsite-specific vesting plan established under this subdivision. If the site-specific vesting\nplan is not based on such an approval, a legislative hearing with notice as required by\nNCGS 160D-602 shall be held. The Town of Midway may approve a site-specific vesting\nplan upon such terms and conditions as may reasonably be necessary to protect the\npublic health, safety, and welfare. Such conditional approval shall result in a vested right,\nalthough failure to abide by its terms and conditions will result in a forfeiture of vested\nrights. The Town of Midway shall not require a landowner to waive vested rights as a\ncondition of developmental approval. A site-specific vesting plan shall be deemed\napproved upon the effective date of the local government's decision approving the plan\nor such other date as determined by the governing board upon approval. An approved\nsite-specific vesting plan and its conditions may be amended with the approval of the\nowner and the local government as follows: any substantial modification must be\nreviewed and approved in the same manner as the original approval; minor\nmodifications may be approved by the Zoning Administrator if such are defined and\nauthorized by local regulation.\n4) Seven years - Multiphase developments. - A multiphase development shall be vested for the entire\ndevelopment with the zoning regulations, subdivision regulations, and unified development\nordinances in place at the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multiphase\ndevelopment. This right shall remain vested for a period of seven years from the time a site plan\napproval is granted for the initial phase of the multiphase development. For purposes of this\nsubsection, \"multiphase development\" means a development containing 100 acres or more that (i)\nis submitted for site plan approval for construction to occur in more than one phase and (ii) is subject\nto a master development plan with committed elements, including a requirement to offer land for\npublic use as a condition of its master development plan approval.\n5)\nIndefinite - Development agreements. - A vested right of reasonable duration may be specified in\na development agreement approved under NCGS 160D.\n(C)\nContinuing Review\n(D)\nFollowing approval or conditional approval of a statutory vested right, a local government\nmay make subsequent reviews and require subsequent approvals by the local government\nto ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval, provided that\nsuch reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original approval. The local\ngovernment may revoke the original approval for failure to comply with applicable terms\nand conditions of the original approval or the applicable local development\nregulations.
