Some land\nuses are of such a nature or scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediately surrounding area and on the entire community which\ncannot be predetermined and controlled by general district standards. There are also circumstances in which a general district designation allowing\nsuch a use by right would not be appropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could, if properly planned, be appropriate for the\nproperty consistent with the objectives of this zoning ordinance and the comprehensive plan.

In light of this purpose, applicants for rezoning to conditional zoning districts are strongly encouraged to meet with neighboring\nresidents and property owners and to attempt to address their concerns, if any, in their application.\n4-4-1. Purpose.\nThe conditional zoning district approval process is established to address those situations when a particular use may be acceptable but the general\nzoning district which would allow that use would not be acceptable. It requires a legislative zoning map amendment with site-specific conditions\nincorporated into the zoning map amendment per G.S. 160D-102(7). It allows city council (legislative decision) to approve a proposal for a specific use\nwith reasonable conditions to assure the compatibility of the use with surrounding properties. Any use permitted under this process must also conform\nto the development regulations for the corresponding general zoning district. A conditional zoning district classification will be considered only upon\nrequest of the owner(s) of all property to be included in the proposed district.\n4-4-2. - Conditional zoning districts.\nFor the R-40, R-20, R-15, R-10, R-6, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, I-1, MIC, CMU, RCT, GHMU, HMU and CHMU zoning district classifications, there are hereby\nestablished parallel conditional zoning district classifications designated R-40CZD, R-20CZD, R-15CZD, R-6CZD, C-1CZD, C-2CZD, C-3CZD, C-4CZD, I-1CZD,\nMICCZD, CMUCZD, RCTCZD, GHMUCZD, HMUCZD and CHMUCZD pursuant to G.S. 160D-703.\n4-4-3. Uses permitted.\nWithin a conditional zoning district only those uses authorized by article V as permitted in the parallel zoning district with which the conditional zoning\ndistrict corresponds shall be permitted, and all other requirements of such parallel zoning district classifications shall be met. Specific conditions may\nbe proposed by the petitioner or the city or its agencies but only those conditions mutually approved by the city and the petitioner may be incorporated\ninto the zoning regulations or permit requirements.\n4-4-4. - Processing of applications.\nAll applications for rezoning to a conditional zoning district shall be submitted and processed under a rezoning to a conditional zoning district in\naccordance with the provisions of section 7-4, below.\nSec. 4-5. - Classification of uses.\nThe range of uses allowed in each district established in this ordinance is summarized in Table 4-5 Table of Permitted Uses, which is a part of this\nsection. In the event of a conflict between Table 4-5 and the text of this appendix, the text shall control.\nThe Table of Uses orders uses into the following four classifications. All uses must comply with regulations of general application in the zoning\nordinance, including, without limitation, those in articles VI, VII, and XV. In addition, uses must comply with specific development standards as noted\nbelow:\na) Permitted by right (P). A use which is permitted by right must comply with the development standards for the relevant zoning district.\nThis process requires administrative (i.e. professional city staff) review leading to an administrative decision.\nb) Permitted by right subject to supplementary standards (SS). Same as above except that the use must comply with one or more\nadditional standards not required of other permitted uses in the district. These additional standards are either incorporated into the\ndescription of the use or, when they are too lengthy, a reference is given to their location in the ordinance. This process requires\nadministrative (i.e. professional city staff) review leading to an administrative decision.\nc) Special Use (SU). A use which may be authorized only by means of a special use permit (SUP) issued by the board of adjustment pursuant\nto article X, below. This process requires initial administrative review (i.e. professional city staff) and a final quasi-judicial decision by the\nboard of adjustment (quasi-judicial process).\nd) Limited (L).\ne) Uses permitted only pursuant to a rezoning to a conditional zoning district.\n1) Any building or structure that exceeds the maximum square footage as stated in a conventional zoning district shall require a\nrezoning to a conditional zoning district which allows the proposed square footage for the building or structure in order to be\npermitted.\n2) Any of the following development or redevelopment shall require a rezoning to a conditional zoning district which allows it:\n(a) Any nonresidential development or redevelopment that includes a cumulative total gross floor area for all buildings combined for\n4 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "5", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nall phases combined of the development or redevelopment of 50,000 square feet

combined of the development or redevelopment of 50,000 square\nfeet or more;\n(c) Any amendment to an approved nonresidential or mixed-use development or redevelopment that, when added to the approved\ndevelopment or redevelopment for all phases of the development or redevelopment combined, brings the development or\nredevelopment (including the amendment) within the parameters of (a) or (b) above.\n(d) Any single, two or multi-family residential development or redevelopment that includes 51 or more residential dwelling units for\nall phases combined: or\n(e) Any amendment to an approved single, two or multi-family residential development or redevelopment that, when added to the\napproved number of dwelling units for all phases combined, brings the total number of dwelling

NOTE: Section 5-23-4.1.8 is not required for one- and two-family dwellings; property owners/developers may\nvoluntarily consent to these standards per G.S. 160D-702(b).\nThe scale of a building is a function of the size of the individual pieces of a building and their relationship to each other. The scale of a building\nis important in order to contribute to the overall diversity of building types, to give visual interest, and to maintain compatibility between\nbuildings. These design standards regulate scale by means of offsets, that is, protrusions or breaks in the plane of fa\u00e7ades.\na) Scale, buildings containing nonresidential uses. The following requirements apply to any building containing nonresidential uses,\nregardless whether the building also contains residential uses:\n1) The distance between required offsets is related to the height of the building wall on a two-to-one basis. Thus, a building which is\n20 feet tall may have no more than 40 feet of fa\u00e7ade wall between offsets. A building fa\u00e7ade which is less than or equal to the\nheight of the building shall not require an offset.\n2) The height of any particular fa\u00e7ade shall be measured from the average ground level to the soffit, or, if there is no soffit, to the\nparapet.\n3) The depth or projection of the offset shall be 1/10th the length of the longest adjacent wall panel; provided, however, the\nminimum offset depth shall be one foot. By means of illustration, a building with a 20-foot wall panel shall have a two-foot offset\nadjacent to such wall panel.\n4) Each fa\u00e7ade of a building shall comply with the offset requirements contained herein.\nb) Scale, buildings containing only residential uses. The following requirements apply to any building containing only residential uses:\n1) The distance between required offsets shall be related to the height of the building on a basis of 0.75/1; provided, however, no\nwall shall exceed 16 feet in length without an offset. By way of illustration, a fa\u00e7ade wall which is 20 feet tall may have no more\nthan 15 feet of wall between offsets; however, a fa\u00e7ade wall which is 30 feet tall, owing to the proviso, may have no more than 16\nfeet of wall between offsets. A building fa\u00e7ade which is less than 16 feet in length shall not require an offset. Provided, however,\nthe provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to require an offset for that portion of a fa\u00e7ade containing a two-car\ngarage.\n2) Offsets shall have a minimum depth or projection of two feet regardless of the length of adjacent wall fa\u00e7ades.\n3) Each fa\u00e7ade of a building visible from a street or common space shall comply with the offset requirements contained herein.\n5-23-4.1.9 Streets and sidewalks.

The city may defer the traffic impact analysis until after a rezoning to a conditional zoning district is approved for the\nproject only in those circumstances where city council, in the absence of a traffic impact analysis, determines that the existing public road system\nhas adequate capacity to handle projected traffic flow as required by section 7-11, below.\n5-24-1.3.2 Subsequent review. After the establishment of the urban village district, individual development projects within the district shall be\nsubject to final site plan review in accordance with section 7-3-4, below. In addition to the site plan requirements contained in section 7-3-4.3,\napplicants shall comply with the design submittal requirements of section 18-3-3.\n5-24-1.3.3 Modifications. Revisions to approved urban village district master plans may be approved by city council or by the city manager, or\na designee appointed by the city manager, depending on the type of revisions being requested. City council shall review any revisions to a master\nplan that increase the overall development intensity, change the proposed mix of uses by increasing or reducing any use category by ten percent\nor more, or increases maximum building heights from that shown on the approved master plan. Additionally, city council shall review any revision\nto a master plan that results in a decrease in the amount of perimeter open space or perimeter parking lot buffering, or in a 25 percent or greater\nreduction in the number of proposed blocks from that shown on the approved master plan. For the purpose of determining overall development\nintensity, one residential unit shall be regarded as the equivalent of 500 square feet of office floor area; one residential unit shall be regarded as\nthe equivalent of 200 square feet of commercial floor area; and 1,000 square feet of office space shall be regarded as the equivalent of 350\nsquare feet commercial. For other uses, the community development director shall determine the equivalency factor.\n5-24-2 Permitted uses.\nThe following uses are permitted by right in the UV Urban Village Conditional Zoning District Classification, provided they meet all requirements of this\nsection and all other relevant requirements of this zoning ordinance.\nAccessory dwelling units subject to supplementary standards contained in section 16-4, below\nAccessory uses & structures\nAdult care centers registered with the NC Department of Health and Human Services (DHSS)\nAdult care homes\n82 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "83", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nAnimal hospitals & clinics so long as they contain no outdoor kennels\nBanks & other financial institutions\nBed & breakfast facilities\nBusiness services\nChild care centers, subject to supplementary standards contained in section 16-4, below\nChild care homes\nCivic clubs and fraternal organizations\nCongregate care facilities, subject to supplementary standards contained in section 16-4, below\nCultural arts buildings\nDance, health & fitness facilities\nDry cleaning and laundry establishments containing less than 6,000 square feet of floor area\nFuneral homes\nHome occupations\nHotels & motels\nLaundries, coin-operated\nLawn & garden centers\nMicrobreweries, micro-distilleries, micro-cideries, and micro-wineries, subject to supplementary standards contained in section 16-4, below\nMusic & art studios\nNeighborhood community centers\nNewspaper offices & printing establishments\nOffices, business, professional and public\nParking lots & parking garages\nParks\nPersonal services\nPlanned residential developments (minor), subject to the requirements of article VII, below\nPublic & semi-public buildings, including, without limitation, post offices, police stations and fire stations\nPublic utility facilities\nRecreational facilities, indoors\nReligious institutions\nRepair services, miscellaneous\nResidential care facilities\nResidential dwellings, single family\nResidential dwellings, multi-family\nResidential dwellings, two-family\nRestaurants\n83 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "84", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nRetail stores (not including automobile, manufactured home, farm equipment, gasoline, and boat & heavy equipment sales)\nSchools, post-secondary, business, technical and vocational\nSchools, primary & secondary\nSigns, subject to the provisions of article XIII, below\nTelecommunications antennas, subject to supplementary standards contained in section 16-4, below\nTheaters, indoors or outdoors but not including drive-in theaters\n5-24-3 - Development standards.\nNOTE: Section 5-24-3 and subsections are not required for one- and two-family dwellings; property owners/developers may voluntarily consent to these\nstandards per G.S. 160D-702(b).\nSome development standards for the UV Urban Village Conditional Zoning District are specified in this ordinance. Where no standard is specified,\nit is incumbent upon the applicant to propose development standards which, if city council concurs, will be incorporated into the project. The\nfollowing standards shall apply to development within the UV Urban Village Conditional Zoning District Classification.\n5-24-3.1 Density. Residential density for an urban village district shall be established by city council in consideration of surrounding land uses and\nthe existence of adequate public facilities. The maximum density which may be approved shall not be otherwise limited except by other standards\nsuch as building height, parking, landscaping and buffering, open space, and traffic impact.\n5-24-3.2 Structure size. The maximum size of any structure shall be established by city council.\n5-24-3.3 Area. The minimum area required to establish an urban village district is ten acres.\n5-24-3.4 Lot size. There is no minimum lot size required for an urban village district; although, the applicant may specify minimum standards in\nits development document.\n5-24-3.5 Lot width. There is no minimum lot width required.\n5-24-3.6 Setbacks. There are no minimum setback requirements within the Urban Village Conditional Zoning District Classification; provided,\nhowever, setbacks shall be established around the perimeter of the district sufficient to protect adjoining properties from the impacts of proposed\ndevelopment within the district.\n5-24-3.7 Height. There are no maximum height restrictions. The applicant shall propose minimum and maximum height restrictions for all\nbuilding types and locations.\n5-24-3.8 Design considerations. NOTE: \"Building design element\" sub-sections noted below are not required for one- and two-family dwellings;\nproperty owners/developers may voluntarily consent to these standards per G.S. 160D-702(b).\nDesign is critical to the creation of an Urban Village District and to achieving the goals of this classification, as set forth in section 5-24, above. The\ndesign considerations set forth in this section are intended in some instances to guide project design and in others to provide specific design\nrequirements, and the text is intended to make this distinction clear. In general, the use of the term \"shall\" indicates a specific design requirement,\nwhereas the term \"should\" indicates design guidance. In order to obtain a rezoning to develop an Urban Village Conditional Zoning District, an\napplicant must demonstrate, among other things, that thedesign of the proposeddevelopment(1)meetsthespecific standards contained herein,\n(2) is generally in harmony with the design guidelines contained herein, and (3) will result in a development which is consistent with the purposes set\nforth in section 5-24, above.\n5-24-3.8.1 General site arrangement. Structures shall be placed and arranged so as not to adversely affect adjacent property. Adverse effects\nshall include, but are not limited to, the removal of lateral support on adjacent property, the creation of hazard, nuisance, danger, or\ninconvenience, or unreasonable loss of privacy. Development shall be arranged so as to be visually harmonious within the district. Insofar as is\npracticable, developments should be arranged so as to preserve or enhance vistas. Urban villages shall be oriented around one or more\nsignificant public spaces, such as parks or plazas.\n5-24-3.8.2 Physical integration of uses. All urban villages shall be designed and developed to provide an appropriate interrelationship\nbetween the various uses and structures within the development. Residential and commercial uses may be located within the same or adjoining\nstructures.\n5-24-3.8.3 Preservation of natural features and open space. Permitted flexibility in lot sizes, setbacks, street alignments and widths, and\n84 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "85", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nlandscaping shall be utilized to preserve natural features and drainage patterns and to provide open space.\n5-24-3.8.4 Architectural character. NOTE: Section 5-24-3.8.4 is not required for one- and two-family dwellings; property owners/developers\nmay voluntarily consent to these standards per G.S. 160D-702(b).\nThe rich architectural vocabulary of the City of Hendersonville presents a wide variety of development opportunities using traditional forms\nwhile avoiding any perception of monotony. Each building proposed for an urban village district shall have a well-proportioned form consistent\nwith the building use, and its construction materials. Materials shall be durable, attractive and compatible with the architectural vernacular of the\nregion. Massing of the building(s) shall create a building envelope that reflects simple, clearly articulated building volumes.\n5-24-3.8.5 Building orientation. It is preferred that primary fa\u00e7ades face the adjacent street or significant public space. Apartment buildings\nand buildings containing commercial or institutional uses shall have a main entrance facing a connecting walkway with a direct, safe, pedestrian\nconnection to the street. Where the main entrance does not face the adjacent street, buildings shall nonetheless be designed to provide an\nattractive streetside fa\u00e7ade.\n5-24-3.8.6 Building placement. Buildings shall be situated with regard to pedestrian and vehicular connectivity. Apartment buildings and\nbuildings containing commercial or institutional uses should be located close to the pedestrian street with off-street parking behind and/or\nbeside the building. Important mountain vistas and/or views of significant historic sites should be protected and accentuated.\n5-24-3.8.7 Privacy considerations. Elements of the development plan should be arranged to maximize the opportunity for privacy by the\nresidents of the project and minimize infringement on the privacy of adjoining land uses.\n5-24-3.8.8 Architectural details. NOTE: Section 5-24-3.8.8 is not required for and two-family dwellings; property owners/developers may\nvoluntarily consent to these standards per G.S. 160D-702(b).\nArchitectural elements like openings, details, bulkheads, posts, and other architectural features shall be used to establish human scale at the\nstreet level. On corner lots, the applicant is encouraged to provide a building entry, additional building mass, and distinctive architectural\nelements at the corner of buildings. Windows, doors, columns, leaves, parapets, and other building components shall be proportional to the\noverall scale of the building. Windows shall be vertically aligned wherever practical. The appearance of all exposed fa\u00e7ades (not just the streetside\nfa\u00e7ade) is important and shall be addressed in development design.\n5-24-3.8.9 Building walls. NOTE: Section 5-24-3.8.9 is not required for one- and two-family dwellings; property owners/developers may\nvoluntarily consent to these standards per G.S. 160D-702(b).\nBuildings shall avoid long, monotonous, uninterrupted walls or roof planes on their visible fa\u00e7ades. It is preferred that this design goal be\nachieved by means of building wall offsets, including projections, recesses, and changes in floor level, and roofline offsets. Such offsets add\narchitectural interest and variety and can assist in creating human size proportions. Parapets shall be designed as integral to the mass of the\nbuilding. When multiple wall materials are combined on one fa\u00e7ade, the designer is encouraged to place the heavier material(s) below.\n5-24-3.8.10 Building entrances. All buildings should include well-defined entrances facing the street at regular intervals. An operable entrance\non each primary fa\u00e7ade should be provided to encourage access by pedestrians. For buildings on corner lots, an entrance may be placed at the\ncorner, thereby eliminating the need for side entrances.\n5-24-3.8.11 Internal access and connectivity. The site shall be traversed by a network of internal streets built according to city standards.\nInternal streets should seek to avoid cul-de-sacs and dead end roads and other features that hamper connectivity. However, roads may terminate\nat a monumental structure or green space. In such cases a sidewalk or other connection must be provided to ensure the goals of connectivity. In\naddition, internal streets are also required to have sidewalks and street trees. If a bus line serves, or is expected to serve, the district, a bus\nshelter is required. Larger projects may require more shelters as determined by traffic impact analysis. ;p2; Connectivity is a goal of the internal\nstreet system and external connections to areas outside and adjacent to the urban village should be created where possible. Only one driveway\nper block face is allowed. Detached single-family housing and duplex housing are exempt from the driveway restriction. Parking access from\nalleyways, however, is encouraged.\n5-24-3.8.12 Block length. Block length may vary but shall not exceed 500 feet in length. For blocks on local streets that are 350 feet or longer, a\nmid-block pedestrian street crossing is required which may also include a parking lot driveway and/or pedestrian passageway between two or\nmore buildings, and shall have curb extensions (bulb-outs) for ease and safety of pedestrian street crossing. Collector streets may also require\nmid-block pedestrian crossings as noted above.\n5-24-3.8.13 Pedestrian zone and sidewalks. The pedestrian zone is the area between the street curb and the building edge or, for access\nroads, the street curb and the right-of-way area. The pedestrian zone includes sidewalks, street trees and other pedestrian amenities. The\npedestrian zone will generally be 15 feet wide but may be wider depending on the setback pattern. Sidewalks in urban village districts shall be\n85 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "86", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nrequired along one side of access streets and both sides of internal streets throughout the development. If appropriate to the design of the\nvillage, greenway paths may be substituted for sidewalks in residential areas to provide connections. The sidewalk shall be a minimum of seven\nfeet wide in the Urban Village Conditional Zoning District Classification. In solely residential areas containing less than eight units per acres,\nsidewalks are only required to be five feet wide. With institutional and public uses that have an increased setback, a sidewalk shall connect the\nbuilding fa\u00e7ade entrance with the street. The sidewalk may be as wide as the entire pedestrian area. Arcades, awnings, outdoor dining, shelters,\nseating areas, fountains, street trees, additional landscaped areas and other pedestrian amenities may be a part of this pedestrian area so long\nas seven feet of clear walking space is maintained. The pedestrian area may also be used to create an area for waiting, pick-up and drop-off. At\nlocations such as intersections and other crosswalks, curb extensions (bulb-outs) are required to create safer pedestrian crossings.\n5-24-3.8.14 Parking/loading standards. Parking and loading facilities shall be reviewed at the master plan level. The applicant shall\ndemonstrate that the amount of parking proposed is adequate to serve the needs of the district and is located and designed in such a fashion\nthat it does not detract from the overall appearance of the district or unreasonably interfere with pedestrian activity.\na) Amount of parking. Owing to the possibilities for shared use of parking, the number of parking spaces in the urban village district\nshould not exceed the minimum parking requirements for the district computed by means of the formulas contained in section 6-5,\nbelow.\nb) On-street parking. On-street parking is required for all local streets and for collector streets and shall count toward meeting parking\nneeds for the district. On-street parking may take the form of parallel or angle parking and shall be built according to city standards.\nc) Off-street parking. Applicants for rezoning to the UV Urban Village Conditional Zoning District Classification shall propose a master\nparking plan which shall provide sufficient parking for the entire project consistent with requirements of this section. Off-street\nparking lots are encouraged to be provided at the side or rear of buildings or the interior of a block of buildings and not closer to the\nstreet than the edge profile of the structures. No more than 20 percent of parking that is provided in an urban village district may be\nin the form of stand-alone surface lots not located to the side or rear of buildings. Off-street parking shall not be adjacent to street\nintersections. No parking is permitted in any setback area. Individual uses in the urban village district are not required to provide off-\nstreet parking or loading.\nd) Loading standards. Urban village districts may share off-street loading facilities and are therefore allowed to provide these facilities\nat half the rate listed for the applicable uses. On-street loading spaces may be counted towards the project loading requirements.\n5-24-3.8.15 Street trees. Street trees are required in the pedestrian zone and along access roads at an average of one tree every 30 feet for\nmid-story and understory trees, and one tree for every 40 feet for canopy trees. In selecting street trees, priority should be given to long lived\nspecies proven to function well in urban settings with a form and branching pattern compatible with the space and type of adjacent traffic. Trees\nmay be planted in minimum six-foot by six-foot pits. Tree frames and grates are not required but are recommended especially near store\nentrances, other sidewalk constraints, points of ingress, egress or public gathering areas. If tree grates are not used, an organic surfacing material\nshall be used to level the surface of the tree pit with the sidewalk. This material shall receive regular maintenance. To offer flexibility in the tree\nplanting requirement, trees may be planted in planting strips adjacent to the curb edge of the sidewalk. Planting strips shall be no narrower than\nsix feet wide. Planting strips may include grass, flowers and other plant material where appropriate. Planting strips may not be appropriate in\npedestrian gathering areas.\n5-24-3.8.16 Landscape/buffering standards. Landscaping and buffering shall be in accordance with article XV of this ordinance except as\nnoted herein. Parking lots shall include interior and perimeter tree plantings made up of deciduous trees at a rate of one tree for every 1,500\nsquare feet of vehicular use area. No parking space may be farther than 45 feet from a tree. No shrubs are required for interior plantings for\nparking lots that are behind, to the side or located at the interior of the block of buildings. Parking areas adjacent to roadways require buffering\nfrom the street as specified in article XV with the exception that the planting area will be eight feet wide. Stand-alone parking lots shall comply\nwith all applicable landscape and buffering standards except that trees shall be provided at a rate of one tree for every 1,500 square feet of\nparking and parking spaces shall be no further than 45 feet from a tree. Shrubs are also required as per the regular schedule. Landscaped islands\nwithin parking lots should be a minimum of 162 square feet in area with a minimum width of eight feet if they are to include tree plantings.\nResidential structures within an urban village may have up to a 100 percent reduction in buffering requirements from the rest of the urban\nvillage. Buffering for urban village district projects is measured and reviewed from the parcel lot lines used to establish the district and not on an\ninternal lot by lot basis.\n5-24-3.8.17 Open space standards. Functional open space enhances circulation within a site and contributes to the site's aesthetic qualities.\nAll open space should be designed to be accessible and usable for occupants and invitees of the development. An urban village district shall have\nan open space ratio of not less than 0.30. Open space includes any portion of the site not covered by a building or vehicular use area and any\ncommon space meeting the standards listed in the paragraph below.\n5-24-3.8.18 Common space standards. Common space is intended to shape the design and character of a project through a connecting\n86 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "87", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nsystem of pedestrian areas that create a relationship among the various components of the built environment. It shall be designed to create\nareas where workers, residents and shoppers, as the case may be, are directly or indirectly invited to gather, browse, sit, interact or congregate. It\nshall be arranged as community space with open areas, landscaping, seating facilities and lighting fixtures which provide for safety and visual\neffects.\nCommon spaces are intended to be places for social interaction and, thus, may include impervious surfaces. Unless interior common space is\napproved by the reviewing authority, common space shall be out-of-doors. Common space design shall comply with the following:\na) Size. At least ten percent of the acreage of a site shall be devoted to common space. Common space shall count toward meeting\nopen space requirements for a project.\nb) Trees. One tree shall be planted for each 500 square feet of common space. Trees shall have a minimum caliper of three to three and\none-half inches measured six inches above ground at the time of planting.\nc) Utilities. All utilities service lines and connections shall be underground.\nd) Seating. Seating shall be provided to accommodate workers, residents and/or shoppers. Seating may be accomplished in whole or in\npart using planters or other similar structures.\ne) Amenities. Common space for a development shall include two or more of the following amenities: ornamental fountains, stairways,\nwaterfalls, public art, arbors, trellises, planted beds, drinking fountains, clock pedestals, public telephones, awnings, canopies,\ninformational kiosks, and similar structures.\n( Ord. No. 22-11, 2-10-22)\nSec. 5-25. - UR Urban Residential Conditional Zoning District Classification.\nUrban areas are recognized as unique areas with many assets and opportunities. In order to foster the urban characteristics of these areas,\ndevelopment within an urban area should promote an environment of diverse uses at higher than normal density which focuses on pedestrian\nactivities, needs and movement, while at the same time recognizing the limited supply of urban land. It is necessary and desirable to promote the\nresidential nature of these areas through zoning classifications, which are intended to realize the growing opportunities for new infill development and\nredevelopment. Such residential development, properly located and developed, can enhance and support the overall mix of uses characteristic of\nurban areas.\na) The Urban Residential Conditional Zoning District is intended for use in special areas of the community where the prime considerations\nare the support and sustainability of existing commercial nodes and corridors, appropriate transitioning between commercial and\nresidential areas, availability of appropriate infrastructure, and compatibility with existing topography, and thus may be considered for\nlimited application. The comprehensive plan will be used to determine applicability. The official Zoning Map of the City of Hendersonville\nwill designate Urban Residential Conditional Zoning District boundaries.\nb) This district is designed to provide standards and incentives, which will promote the development or redevelopment of urbanizing areas\nthat contain a mix of land uses with a predominantly residential character. Emphasis is given to provisions, which will provide\nopportunities for imaginative new urban development compatible with the development objectives of these areas. Accordingly, the\ndevelopment objectives are:\n1) To maximize residential development potentials in urbanizing areas;\n2) To maintain a predominantly residential character at higher residential densities;\n3) To provide for sufficient local retail and office uses to support residential areas;\n4) To protect all residential areas from inappropriate and intrusive uses;\n5) To maximize open space and other amenities within residential areas;\n6) To transition existing single family residential areas from nearby high intensity commercial developments;\n7) To provide for the efficient utilization of scarce urbanizing land;\n8) To provide coordination and support between zoning districts within the City of Hendersonville;\n9) To provide sustainable growth and development patterns.\n5-25-1 - Minimum district size.\nThere shall be no minimum size requirement for the creation of an Urban Residential District. However, the applicant for an Urban Residential\nConditional Zoning District shall be required to specify the proposed district size. In considering whether to approve the size of the proposed district,\n87 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "88", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nthe city council shall consider the surrounding land uses, the existence of adequate public facilities, proposed buffering, open space, and traffic impact.\n5-25-2 Procedure.\nThe reclassification of property to Urban Residential Conditional Zoning District shall constitute an amendment of the zoning map which may be\ninitiated only by all of the owner(s) of a legal interest in the affected property. Urban Residential Conditional Zoning Districts shall be created only in\nlocales designated in the comprehensive plan as Medium Intensity Neighborhood, High Intensity Neighborhood, Neighborhood Activity Center,\nRegional Activity Center and Business Center. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Urban Residential Conditional Zoning District may be located on a lot(s)\nall or part of which fall within locales designated as Medium Intensity Neighborhood in the comprehensive plan only if any part of the boundary of the\nUrban Residential Conditional Zoning District is located no more than 100 feet from the boundary of a zoning district having a non-residential zoning\ndesignation.\n5-25-2.1 Pre-application conference. Every person proposing to apply for creation of an Urban Residential District is required to meet with the\ncommunity development department staff prior to the submittal of such application. This conference is intended to provide the applicant with an\nopportunity to discuss requirements, standards and procedures and to identify and solve potential problems for the proposed application. The\napplicant shall bring a sketch plan for the project showing, at a minimum, the location, the existing and proposed transportation network, phasing,\ngeneral development plans and a written synopsis of the development proposal. The pre-application conference shall take place at least 20 days\nprior to submitting an application to create an Urban Residential Conditional Zoning District.\n5-25-2.2 Application. Creation of an Urban Residential Conditional Zoning District shall be initiated by means of an application for rezoning to an\nUrban Residential District. No permit shall be issued for any development within an Urban Residential Conditional Zoning District except in\naccordance with an approved rezoning.\n5-25-2.3 Master plan. Applicants for creation of an Urban Residential Conditional Zoning District project shall submit a master plan for the entire\ndistrict, including the urban residential development, that indicates the following: (1) the general street network; (2) the proposed land use\nconfiguration within that network; (3) phasing boundaries if phasing is proposed; (4) the ultimate proposed development intensity (including the\nnumber of residential units and gross square footage of all nonresidential uses) for the entire development and for each phase; (5) a conceptual\nlandscape plan; (6) proposed setback, height, signage, architectural and other design standards for the overall project and for proposed uses; (7)\nbuilding elevations or perspective drawings to demonstrate proposed building character; and (8) a conceptual storm-water plan for the\ndevelopment. For initiation of this zoning classification, properties may fall under more than one ownership so long as there exist covenants or other\nlegally binding agreements that adequately address cross-access, cross-parking and other similar issues affecting joint operation of the projects.\n5-25-2.3.1 Traffic impact analysis. A traffic impact analysis developed in compliance with section 6-19 below is required for all urban\nresidential developments and shall be submitted with the application for the urban residential development. The city may defer the traffic impact\nanalysis until after a rezoning to a conditional zoning district is approved for the project only in those circumstances where city council, in the\nabsence of a traffic impact analysis, finds that the existing public road system has adequate capacity to handle projected traffic flow as required\nby section 7-11, below.\n5-25-2.3.2 Subsequent review. After the establishment of the Urban Residential Conditional Zoning District, individual development projects\nwithin the district shall be subject to final site plan review in accordance with section 7-3-4, below. In addition to the site plan requirements\ncontained in section 7-3-4.3, applicants shall comply with the design submittal requirements of section 18-3-3.\n5-25-2.3.3 Modifications. Revisions to approved Urban Residential Conditional Zoning District master plans may be approved by city council or\nby the city manager, or a designee appointed by the city manager, depending on the type of revisions being requested. City council shall review\nany revisions to a master plan that increases the overall development intensity, changes the proposed mix of uses by increasing any use category\nby ten percent or more, or increases maximum building heights from that shown on the approved master plan. Additionally, city council shall\nreview any revision to a master plan that results in a decrease in the amount of perimeter open space or perimeter parking lot buffering, or in a\n25 percent or greater reduction in the number of proposed blocks from that shown on the approved master plan. For the purpose of determining\noverall development intensity, one residential unit shall be regarded as the equivalent of 500 square feet of office floor area; one residential unit\nshall be regarded as the equivalent of 200 square feet of commercial floor area; and 1,000 square feet of office space shall be regarded as the\nequivalent of 350 square feet of commercial. For other uses, the community development director or a designee shall determine the equivalency\nfactor. Such determination shall be made in writing and shall be applied consistently to all Urban Residential Conditional Zoning Districts.\n5-25-3 Permitted uses.\nThe following uses are permitted within the UR Urban Residential Zoning District Classification.\nResidential dwellings, multi-family\n88 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "89", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nAccessory uses, limited.

For the purposes of this\nsection, the front yard applies to all street frontages, not just to the street toward which the structure is oriented.\n5-25-5 - Design considerations.\nNOTE: \"Building design element\" sub-sections noted below are not required for one- and two-family dwellings; property owners/developers may\nvoluntarily consent to these standards per G.S. 160D-702(b).\nDesign is critical to the creation of an Urban Residential District and to achieving the goals of this classification, as set forth in section 5-25, above.\nThe design considerations set forth in this section are intended in some instances to guide project design and in others to provide specific design\nrequirements, and the text is intended to make this distinction clear. The use of the term \"shall\" indicates a specific design requirement, whereas the\nterm \"should\" indicates design guidance. In order to be granted a rezoning to develop an Urban Residential development, an applicant must\ndemonstrate, among other things, that the design of the proposed development (1) meets the specific standards contained herein, (2) is generally in\nharmony with the design guidelines contained herein, and (3) will result in a development which is consistent with the purposes set forth in section\n5-25, above.\n5-25-5.1 General site arrangement. Structures shall be placed and arranged so as not to adversely affect adjacent property. Adverse effects shall\ninclude, but are not limited to, the removal of lateral support on adjacent property, the creation of hazard, nuisance, danger, or unreasonable loss of\nprivacy. Development shall be arranged so as to be visually harmonious within the district. Insofar as is practicable, developments should be\narranged so as to preserve or enhance vistas. Urban Residential developments shall be oriented around one or more significant open spaces, such\nas parks or plazas.\n5-25-5.2 Physical integration of uses. All Urban Residential Conditional Zoning developments shall be designed and developed to provide an\nappropriate interrelationship between the various uses and structures within the development. Residential and commercial uses shall be located\nwithin the same structures unless otherwise indicated in section 5-25-3. This limitation shall not apply to small commercial uses accessory to a\nprivate or public recreational use.\n90 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nMinimum lot width\nCELL (1, 2): \n20 feet\nCELL (2, 1): \nMinimum front yard\nCELL (2, 2): \n14 feet from back of existing or proposed curb, whichever is\ngreater.\nCELL (3, 1): \nMinimum side yard\nCELL (3, 2): \n5 feet\nCELL (4, 1): \nMinimum rear yard\nCELL (4, 2): \n10 feet 4\nCELL (5, 1): \nMaximum height\nCELL (5, 2): \n64 Feet\nCELL (6, 1): \nMaximum floor area ratio (gross floor space on entire\nparcel/parcel size)\nCELL (6, 2): \n1.5:1\n"}, {"page": "91", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n5-25-5.3 Preservation of natural features and open space. Permitted flexibility in lot sizes, setbacks, street alignments and widths, and\nlandscaping should be utilized to preserve natural features and drainage patterns and to provide open space.\n5-25-5.4 Architectural character. NOTE: Section 5-25-5.4 is not required for one- and two-family dwellings; property owners/developers may\nvoluntarily consent to these standards per G.S. 160D-702(b).\nThe rich architectural vocabulary of the City of Hendersonville presents a wide variety of development opportunities using traditional forms while\navoiding any perception of monotony. Each building proposed for an Urban Residential District shall have a well-proportioned form consistent with\nthe building use, and its construction materials. Materials shall be durable, attractive and compatible with the architectural vernacular of the region.\nMassing of the building(s) shall create a building envelope that reflects simple, clearly articulated building volumes.\n5-25-5.5 Building orientation. It is preferred that primary fa\u00e7ades face the adjacent street or significant open space. Residential buildings and\nbuildings containing commercial or institutional uses shall have a main entrance facing a connecting walkway with a direct, safe, pedestrian\nconnection to the street. Where the main entrance does not face the adjacent street, buildings shall nonetheless be designed to provide an\nattractive street-side fa\u00e7ade.\n5-25-5.6 Building placement. Buildings shall be situated with regard to pedestrian and vehicular connectivity. Residential buildings and buildings\ncontaining commercial or institutional uses should be located close to the pedestrian street with off-street parking behind and/or beside the\nbuilding. Important mountain vistas and views of significant historic sites should be protected and accentuated.\n5-25-5.7 Privacy considerations. Elements of the development plan should be arranged to maximize the opportunity for privacy by the residents\nof the project and minimize infringement on the privacy of adjoining land uses.\n5-25-5.8 Architectural details. NOTE: Section 5-25-5.8 is not required for one- and two-family dwellings; property owners/developers may\nvoluntarily consent to these standards per G.S. 160D-702(b).\nArchitectural elements like openings, details, bulkheads, posts, and other architectural features shall be used to establish human scale at the\nstreet level. On corner lots, the applicant is encouraged to provide a building entry, additional building mass, and distinctive architectural elements\nat the corner of buildings. Windows, doors, columns, leaves, parapets, and other building components shall be proportional to the overall scale of\nthe building. Windows shall be vertically aligned wherever practical. The appearance of all exposed fa\u00e7ades (not just the street-side fa\u00e7ade) is\nimportant and shall be addressed in development design. No development shall have exterior walls with a reflectivity value in excess of 35 percent,\nas measured under the applicable provisions of ASTM-C-1036. No reflective surfaces may be used on street level exterior facades.\n5-25-5.9 Building walls. NOTE: Section 5-25-5.9 is not required for one- and two-family dwellings; property owners/developers may voluntarily\nconsent to these standards per G.S. 160D-702(b).\nBuildings shall avoid long, monotonous, uninterrupted walls or roof planes on their visible fa\u00e7ades. It is preferred that this design goal be\nachieved by means of building wall offsets, including projections, recesses, and changes in floor level, and roofline offsets. Such offsets add\narchitectural interest and variety and can assist in creating human size proportions. Parapets shall be designed as integral to the mass of the\nbuilding. When multiple wall materials are combined on one fa\u00e7ade, the designer is encouraged to place the heavier material(s) below.\n5-25-5.10 Building entrances. All buildings should include well-defined entrances facing the street at regular intervals. An operable entrance on\neach primary fa\u00e7ade should be provided to encourage access by pedestrians. For buildings on corner lots, an entrance may be placed at the corner,\nthereby eliminating the need for side entrances.\n5-25-5.11 Extensions into building setback. In addition to being permitted in urban open space areas, canopies, lawnings, cornices and similar\narchitectural accents are permitted on exterior building walls. Such features may be constructed of rigid or flexible material designed to complement\nthe streetscape of the area. Any such facility may extend from the building up to one half of the width of the sidewalk area in front of the building or\nnine feet, whichever is less. Additionally, balconies and bay windows shall be allowed to extend from the building plane up to one-half of the width\nof the sidewalk area in front of the building or nine feet whichever is less provided they are located on the second floor or higher floor of the\nbuilding on which they are located. Overhead walkways between buildings shall be allowed provided they are located on the third floor or higher\nfloor of the buildings which they connect. If any extension allowed by this paragraph would reach into the public right-of-way, an encroachment\nagreement from the city or state is required. In no case shall any such facility extend beyond the curb line of any public street, nor should it interfere\nwith the growth or maintenance of street trees. A minimum overhead clearance of ten feet from the sidewalk shall be maintained.\n5-25-5.12 Building scale. NOTE: Section 5-25-5.12 is not required for one- and two-family dwellings; property owners/developers may voluntarily\nconsent to these standards per G.S. 160D-702(b).\nThe scale of a building is a function of the size of the individual pieces of a building and their relationship to each other. The scale of a building is\nimportant in order to contribute to the overall diversity of building types, to give visual interest, and to maintain compatibility between buildings and\n91 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "92", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nthe adjacent community. Thus the following standards shall apply within the Urban Residential Conditional Zoning District.\na) Scale, buildings containing nonresidential uses. The following requirements apply to any building containing nonresidential uses,\nregardless whether the building also contains residential uses:\n1) The distance between required offsets is related to the height of the building wall on a one-to-one basis. Thus, a building which is 20\nfeet tall may have no more than 20 feet of fa\u00e7ade wall between offsets. A building fa\u00e7ade which is less than or equal to the height of\nthe building shall not require an offset.\n2) The height of any particular fa\u00e7ade shall be measured from the average ground level to the soffit, or, if there is no soffit, to the\nparapet.\n3) The depth or projection of the offset shall be 1/10th the length of the longest adjacent wall panel; provided, however, the minimum\noffset depth shall be one foot. By means of illustration, a building with a 20-foot wall panel shall have a two-foot offset adjacent to\nsuch wall panel.\n4) Each fa\u00e7ade of a building shall comply with the offset requirements contained herein.\nb) Scale, buildings containing only residential uses. The following requirements apply to any building containing only residential uses:\n1) The distance between required offsets shall be related to the height of the building on a basis of 0.75/1; provided, however, no wall\nshall exceed 16 feet in length without an offset. By way of illustration, a fa\u00e7ade wall which is 20 feet tall may have no more than 15\nfeet of wall between offsets; however, a fa\u00e7ade wall which is 30 feet tall, owing to the proviso, may have no more than 16 feet of wall\nbetween offsets. A building fa\u00e7ade which is less than 16 feet in length shall not require an offset.\n2) Offsets shall have a minimum depth or projection of two feet regardless of the length of adjacent wall fa\u00e7ades.\n3) Each fa\u00e7ade of a building visible from a street shall comply with the offset requirements contained herein.\n5-25-5.13 Internal access and connectivity. The site shall be traversed by a network of internal streets built according to city standards. Internal\nstreets should seek to avoid cul-de-sacs and dead end roads and other features that hamper connectivity. However, roads may terminate at a\nmonumental structure or green space. In such cases a sidewalk or other connection shall be provided to ensure the goals of connectivity. In\naddition, internal streets shall have sidewalks and street trees. If a bus line serves, or is expected to serve, the district, a bus shelter is required.\nLarger projects may require more shelters as determined by traffic impact analysis. Connectivity is a goal of the internal street system and external\nconnections to areas outside and adjacent to the Urban Residential Conditional Zoning development should be created where possible. Only two\ndriveways per block face are allowed.\n5-25-5.14 Block length. Block length may vary but shall not exceed 500 feet in length. For blocks on local streets that are 350 feet or longer, a\nmid-block pedestrian street crossing is required which may also include a parking lot driveway and/or pedestrian passageway between two or more\nbuildings, and shall have curb extensions (bulb-outs) for ease and safety of pedestrian street crossing. Collector streets may also require mid-block\npedestrian crossings as noted above.\n5-25-5.15 Pedestrian zone and sidewalks. The pedestrian zone is the area between the street curb and the building edge or, for access roads, the\nstreet curb and the right-of-way area. The pedestrian zone includes sidewalks, street trees and other pedestrian amenities. The pedestrian zone will\ngenerally be 15 feet wide but may be wider depending on the setback pattern. Sidewalks in Urban Residential Districts shall be required along one\nside of access streets and both sides of internal streets throughout the development. If appropriate to the design of the development, greenway\npaths may be substituted for sidewalks in residential areas to provide connections. The sidewalk shall be a minimum of seven feet wide in the Urban\nResidential Conditional Zoning District. All structures shall connect the building fa\u00e7ade entrance with the street. The sidewalk may be as wide as the\nentire pedestrian area. Arcades, lawnings, outdoor dining, shelters, seating areas, fountains, street trees, additional landscaped areas and other\npedestrian amenities may be a part of this pedestrian area so long as seven feet of clear walking space is maintained. The pedestrian area may also\nbe used to create an area for waiting, pick-up and drop-off. At locations such as intersections and other crosswalks, curb extensions (bulb-outs) are\nrequired to create safer pedestrian crossings.\n5-25-5.16 Parking/loading standards. Parking and loading facilities shall be reviewed at the preliminary plan level. The applicant shall\ndemonstrate that the amount of parking proposed is adequate to serve the needs of the development and is located and designed in such a fashion\nthat it does not detract from the overall appearance of the development or unreasonably interfere with pedestrian activity.\na) Amount of parking. Owing to the possibilities for shared use of parking, the number of parking spaces in the Urban Residential\nConditional Zoning District should not exceed the minimum parking requirements for the District computed by means of the formulas\ncontained in section 6-5, below.\nb) On-street parking. On-street parking is required for all local streets, and for collector streets when determined by the council, and shall\ncount toward meeting the off-street parking requirements for the district. On-street parking may take the form of parallel or angle\nparking and shall be built according to city or state standards as applicable.\n92 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "93", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nc) Off-street parking. Applicants for rezoning to the Urban Residential Conditional Zoning District Classification shall propose a master\nparking plan which shall provide sufficient parking for the entire project consistent with requirements of this section. Off-street parking\nlots are encouraged to be provided at the side or rear of buildings or the interior of a block of buildings and not closer to the street than\nthe edge profile of the structures. No more than 20 percent of parking that is provided in an Urban Residential District may be in the\nform of stand-alone surface lots not located to the side or rear of buildings. Off-street parking shall not be adjacent to street\nintersections. Parking shall be permitted to extend into any setback area no more than two feet.\nd) Loading standards. Urban Residential Districts may share off-street loading facilities and are therefore allowed to provide these facilities\nat half the rate listed for the applicable uses. On-street loading spaces may be counted towards the project loading requirements as per\nsection 6-6 below.\ne) Landscaping. Landscaping shall meet the requirements of section 5-25-5.18.\n5-25-5.17 Street trees. Street trees are required in the pedestrian zone and along access roads at an average of one small maturing tree every 30\nfeet and one large maturing tree for every 40 feet for canopy trees. In selecting street trees, priority should be given to long-lived species proven to\nfunction well in urban settings with a form and branching pattern compatible with the space and type of adjacent traffic. Trees may be planted in\nminimum six-foot by six-foot pits. Tree frames and grates are not required but are recommended especially near store entrances, other sidewalk\nconstraints, points of ingress, egress or public gathering areas. If tree grates are not used, an organic surfacing material shall be used to level the\nsurface of the tree pit with the sidewalk. This material shall receive regular maintenance. To offer flexibility in the tree planting requirement, trees\nmay be planted in planting strips adjacent to the curb edge of the sidewalk. Planting strips shall be no narrower than six feet wide. Planting strips\nmay include grass, flowers and other plant material where appropriate. Planting strips may not be appropriate in pedestrian gathering areas.\nNotwithstanding the restrictions contained in other sections of this ordinance or the City Code, no trees may be planted within 35 feet of street\nintersections.\n5-25-5.18 Landscape/buffering standards. Landscaping and buffering shall be in accordance with article XV of this ordinance except as noted\nherein. Parking lots shall include interior and perimeter tree plantings made up of deciduous trees at a rate of one tree for every 1,500 square feet of\nvehicular use area. No parking space shall be farther than 45 feet from a tree. No shrubs are required for interior plantings for parking lots that are\nbehind, to the side of, or located at the interior of the block of buildings. Parking areas adjacent to roadways require buffering from the street as\nspecified in article XV with the exception that the planting area will be eight feet wide. Stand-alone parking lots shall comply with all applicable\nlandscape and buffering standards except that trees shall be provided at a rate of one tree for every 1,500 square feet of parking and parking spaces\nshall be no further than 45 feet from a tree. Shrubs are also required as per the regular schedule. Landscaped islands within parking lots should be a\nminimum of 162 square feet of planting area with a minimum width of eight feet if they are to include tree plantings. Buffering for Urban Residential\nConditional Zoning District projects is measured and reviewed from the parcel lot lines used to establish the district and not on an internal lot by lot\nbasis.\n5-25-5.19 Open space standards. Functional open space enhances circulation within a site and contributes to the site's aesthetic qualities. All\nopen space should be designed to be accessible and usable for occupants and invitees of the development. An Urban Residential Conditional Zoning\nDistrict shall have an open space ratio of not less than 30 percent.\n5-25-5.20 Common space standards. Common space is intended to shape the design and character of a project through a connecting system of\npedestrian areas that create a relationship among the various components of the built environment. It shall be designed to create areas where\nworkers, residents and shoppers, as the case may be, are directly or indirectly invited to gather, browse, sit, interact or congregate. It shall be\narranged as community space with open areas, landscaping, seating facilities and lighting fixtures which provide for safety and visual effects.\nCommon spaces are intended to be places for social interaction and, thus, may include impervious surfaces. Common space design shall comply\nwith the following:\na) Size. At least ten percent of the acreage of a development shall be devoted to common space. Common space shall count toward\nmeeting open space requirements for a project.\nb) Trees. One tree shall be planted for each 500 square feet of common space. Trees shall have a minimum caliper of three to three and\none-half inches measured six inches above ground at the time of planting.\nc) Utilities. All utilities service lines and connections shall be underground.\nd) Seating. Seating shall be provided to accommodate workers, residents and/or shoppers. Seating may be accomplished in whole or in part\nusing planters or other similar structures.\ne) Amenities. Common space for a development shall include two or more of the following amenities: ornamental fountains, stairways,\nwaterfalls, public art, arbors, trellises, planted beds, drinking fountains, clock pedestals, public telephones, awnings, canopies,\ninformational kiosks, and similar structures.\nf) Location.

Any nonconformity created by a change in the\nclassification of property or the text of these regulations shall be regulated by the provisions of this section. As used in this section, the term, \"effective\ndate of this ordinance, or any amendment thereto,\" refers to the date of the ordinance which first rendered a use, structure or land nonconforming.\n6-2-1 - Nonconforming uses.\nA nonconforming use is a use of land, buildings, or structures that was lawfully established prior to the effective date of this ordinance, or any\namendment thereto, but which does not conform to the regulations for the zoning classification in which it is located. Nonconforming uses may be\ncontinued subject to the following limitations:\na) No nonconforming use shall be extended, expanded, enlarged, or moved to occupy a different or greater area of land, buildings or\nstructures than was occupied by such use at the time it became nonconforming; provided, however, a nonconforming use may be\nextended throughout any parts of a building which were specifically designed and arranged for such use at the time it became\nnonconforming.\nb)\nNo building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered\nunless such building or structure is thereafter devoted to a conforming use; provided, however, such building or structure may be\nenlarged or extended upon prior authorization from the board of adjustment, which authorization shall not be granted unless the board\nof adjustment makes each of the following findings of fact:\n1) The proposed enlargement or extension shall be de minimis in relation to the existing building or structure.\n2) The proposed enlargement or extension shall not increase the intensity of the nonconforming use, which is to say, it will not result in\nan increase in dwelling units for a residential use nor in gross floor area for a nonresidential use.\n3) The proposed enlargement or extension is designed so that it will not render the use of the property any less compatible than it is in\nits existing circumstances.\n4) The authorization of such proposed enlargement or extension is not otherwise contrary to the public health, safety or welfare.\nc)\nA nonconforming use of a structure may not be changed to another nonconforming use unless such change is authorized by the board of\nadjustment.

It is designed to provide\nthe applicant an opportunity to obtain at a reasonable cost binding authorization to develop property in a certain fashion. Review of preliminary plans\nis a function of the planning board. Preliminary plan review is required of all development undergoing site plan review except for the following:\na) Any commercial, industrial or institutional development consisting of less than 20,000 square feet of floor area;\nb) Addition of not more than 30 parking spaces;\nc) Any development which has already received preliminary site plan approval;\nd) Any minor planned residential development consisting of less than nine dwelling units.\nFor development projects under a) above, notice of receipt of a development application for commercial or industrial development between\n10,000 square feet to less than 20,000 square feet of floor area shall be provided in the following manner. The city shall prominently post a notice of\nreceipt of a development application on the site or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way. The notice shall be a minimum of 18 inches\nby 24 inches in size and shall identify the means to contact an official for information about the development application. The notice shall be posted\nwithin ten days of receipt of a development application and remain on the site or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way for a\nminimum of 30 days.\nApproval of a preliminary site plan by the planning board does not entitle the applicant to develop property, but it does entitle the applicant to\nfinal site plan approval pursuant to subsection 7-3-4, below, upon submittal of an application for final site plan approval, payment of the applicable\nfee and submittal of a final site plan conforming to the preliminary site plan approval, including any conditions attached thereto.\n7-3-3.1 Processing of applications for preliminary site plan approval. The community development director or a designee shall conduct a\npreliminary review of an application to determine if it is complete, which is to say, all information requested on the application has been provided\nand the site plan contains all items required by section 7-3-3.2. If the community development director or a designee determines that an application\nis incomplete, the community development director or a designee shall notify the applicant in writing of all deficiencies. A complete application and\nsite plan must be in the possession of the community development director or a designee at least 32 days prior to a planning board meeting in order\nto be scheduled for that meeting.\nOnce the development assistant director or a designee determines the application to be complete, the community development director or a\ndesignee shall cause an analysis to be made by qualified representatives of the city and such other agencies or officials as appear appropriate in the\ncircumstances of the case, to determine compliance with applicable provisions of this ordinance. Notice of the completeness determination shall be\nprovided to the applicant(s) as required by chapter 40 of the Code of Ordinances for the City of Hendersonville. The community development\ndirector or a designee shall then submit to the planning board a report of their analysis.\nSubstantial modification of the site plan subsequent to the community development director's determination of completeness may result in the\napplication being deferred to a subsequent meeting of the planning board. Any material modification of the site plan within seven days of the\nplanning board meeting shall result in deferral of the application to the next available meeting.\nThe city manager may waive these time lines in extraordinary circumstances where strict enforcement would work a substantial hardship on the\napplicant and where the city's ability to make an informed decision on the application would not be compromised.\n7-3-3.2 Contents of preliminary site plan. Applicants for developments required to undergo preliminary site plan review shall, as a part of the\napplication for such development, submit a preliminary site plan which shall show the following:\na) The date of the site plan or submittal, including any revisions thereto;\nb) The proposed title of the project and the name of the engineer, architect, landscape architect, planner and/or licensed surveyor;\ndeveloper; and owner of record;\nc) The north arrow point, scale at not greater than one inch equals 40 feet and such information as the names of adjacent roads, streams,\n123 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "124", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nrailroads, subdivisions or other landmarks sufficient to clearly identify the location of the property;\nThe development assistant director or a designee has the authority to waive any application requirement where the type of use or scale of\nproposal makes providing that information unnecessary or impractical. The community development director or a designee, planning board or city\ncouncil may require additional information from the applicant where such is necessary to enable a fully informed decision on the matter.\nIf the project is to be completed in phases, items a), b), and c), above, may be submitted in phases as well.\n7-3-3.3 Planning board action. Action on an application for preliminary site plan approval shall be taken by the planning board only after\nconsideration at a regular or special meeting. Notice of the date, time and place of the meeting at which the matter is to be considered shall be\npublished once in a newspaper of general circulation not less than five nor more than 15 days prior to the date of the hearing. Similar notice shall\nalso be mailed to the owner of the property which is the subject of the application and the owners of all parcels of land adjacent thereto. Ownership\nshall be determined by reference to the Henderson County tax listing. If the community development director or a designee deems that a proposed\nproject is likely to have significant impacts on additional neighboring properties, may mail notice to the owners of such neighboring properties.\n7-3-3.4 Standards for review. An application for preliminary site plan approval shall not be approved unless the planning board determines that\nthe application and final site plan demonstrate compliance with this ordinance, including the provisions of section 7-11 below, and other applicable\nregulations. The planning board may impose such reasonable conditions on an approval as will ensure such compliance with this ordinance.\n7-3-3.5 Reserved.\n7-3-3.6 Effect of preliminary site plan approval. Approval of a preliminary site plan shall entitle the applicant to the issuance of a zoning\ncompliance permit upon submittal of an application and final site plans meeting the requirements of section 7-3-4, below.

No. 19-1075, \u00a7 1, 10-3-19)\nSec. 7-5. Project phasing.\nIf a project is to be developed in phases, the plan for the entire development will be used to determine the nature of review it will receive. Before\ndevelopment may commence, the entity with power to issue development authorization, that is, the city manager, planning board, or city council, as\nthe case may be, must approve a master plan for the entire development site.\nFinal plans for the development may be submitted in stages and may be approved by the entity which approved the master plan provided that the\nfollowing requirements are met:\na) All stages shall be shown with precise boundaries on the master plan and shall be numbered in the expected order of development.\nb) Each phase must be able to function independently of subsequent phases.\nc) All the data required for the project as a whole shall be given for each stage shown on the plan.\nd) A proportionate share of open space shall be included in each stage of the development.\ne) The phasing shall be consistent with the traffic circulation, drainage, and utilities plan for the entire development.\nSec. 7-6. - Modification of development authorizations.\nDevelopment may only take place in accordance with approvals granted hereunder. Any deviation from approved development requires review and\napproval pursuant to this section.\nIn general, the entity which approved the development for which modification is sought will be responsible for deciding whether to approve\nmodifications to such development. There are two exceptions to this rule. First, in some circumstances, as defined herein, the city manager, or a\n129 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "130", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\ndesignee appointed by the city manager, may authorize modifications which are deemed minor. Second, if the intensity of the entire development,\ntaking into consideration the proposed modification and any previous modifications, would exceed the threshold for a higher level of review and if such\nmodifications, viewed cumulatively, do not qualify as de minimis, as defined herein, the entire development will be required to undergo the higher level\nof review.\nProposed modifications shall qualify as de minimis if the cumulative effect of such modifications would not alter any development standard by more\nthan ten percent as allowed by G.S. 160D-403(d) for administrative decisions, G.S. 160D-703 for conditional district rezonings, and G.S. 160D-705 for\nquasi-judicial decisions. No change in density nor in permitted uses may be approved as a de minimis modification, but may only be approved as an\namendment approved by the original approval authority.\nDe minimis (ten percent) increases or reductions in developmental intensity for nonresidential development may be approved pursuant to this\nsection. Intensity shall be measured in terms gross floor area. The established intensity shall be intensity as originally approved, or in existence as of\nSeptember 6, 1996, whichever is later. By way of illustration, if the owner of a commercial development with an established intensity of 45,000 square\nfeet of floor area proposed a 6,000 square feet addition, the entire development, including that which is existing or previously approved, will be\nrequired to undergo rezoning to a conditional zoning district in accordance with section 7-4. If the owner of such development proposed a 4,000 square\nfeet addition, the modification would qualify as de minimis and would be processed under site plan review.\n7-6-1 - Modifications of developments authorized under zoning compliance review.\nThe city manager may approve minor modifications to developments authorized under zoning compliance review so long as the total development,\nincluding all modifications, complies with applicable provisions of the zoning ordinance and so long as the total development does not exceed the\nthresholds for site plan review.\n7-6-2 - Modifications of developments authorized under site plan review.\nThe city manager may approve a minor modification of a zoning compliance permit for changes to plans approved under site plan review as long as\nsuch changes continue to comply with the approving action of the planning board and all other applicable requirements and so long as the total\ndevelopment, including all modifications, does not exceed the threshold for rezoning to a conditional zoning district. The city manager shall not have\nthe authority to approve a modification for any substantial changes to plans approved under site plan review unless such changes are specifically\nrequired by a condition of approval.\nIf a substantial change is proposed, the city manager shall require the filing of an application for approval of the modification which shall be\nreviewed in accordance with the procedures established in section 7-3.\n7-6-3 - Modifications of developments authorized under special use review and conditional zoning districts.\nThe city manager is authorized to approve minor modifications to the approved final plans of developments authorized under special use permit review\nand conditional zoning districts but major modifications may only be authorized by city council in accordance with procedures set forth herein. A\nmodification shall be deemed minor if it is not a major modification. A modification shall be deemed major if it proposes a substantial departure from\nthe approving action of city council with regard to the original application or any subsequent modifications. Substantial departure from such approving\naction shall exist whenever the proposed modification would result in one or more of the following:\na) A substantial change in the boundaries of the site approved by city council;\nb) A substantial change from the use(s) approved by city council;\nc) A substantial increase in the floor area approved by city council;\nd) A substantial increase in the number of residential dwelling units;\ne)\nA substantial increase in the density of nursing homes, rest homes, congregate care facilities or progressive care facilities;\nf) A substantial change in the location of one or more principal and/or accessory structures approved by city council;\ng) Structural alterations significantly affecting the basic size, form, style, ornamentation, and appearance of principal and/or accessory\nstructures as shown on the plans approved by city council;\nh) A substantial change in pedestrian or vehicular access or circulation approved by city council; and\ni) A substantial change in the amount or location of open space, landscaping or buffer screens approved by city council.\nIf the proposed action is determined to be a major modification, the city manager shall require the filing of a request for a map amendment. The\ncity manager shall prescribe the form(s) of application as well as any other material reasonably required to determine compliance with this article.\n130 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "131", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nSec. 7-7. - Expiration and revocation of zoning compliance permits.\nThis section governs the expiration and revocation of zoning compliance permits issued subsequent to zoning compliance review or site plan review.\nThe expiration and revocation of zoning compliance permits issued subsequent to rezoning to a conditional zoning district are governed by the\nprovisions of subsection 7-4-12.\n7-7-1 Commencement.\nIf a building permit for the use, construction, or activity authorized by approval of an application for a zoning compliance permit or modification of\na\nzoning compliance permit is not obtained within six months of the date of approval, or within such further time stipulated in the approval, the approval\nshall expire and any city permit issued pursuant to the approval shall be void.

Whether and the extent to which the proposed amendment would result in a logical and orderly development pattern\nthat benefits the surrounding neighborhood, is in the public interest and promotes public health, safety and general welfare. Also, see\nG.S. 160D-601(d), down-zoning.\ne) Public facilities.

As part of its consideration, the city council shall adopt a comprehensive plan consistency statement as required by G.S. 160D-605 when\nmaking a legislative zoning decision. The comprehensive plan sets forth the goals and policies which serve as the basic policy guide for development in\nthe City of Hendersonville and its extraterritorial jurisdiction. These goals and policies may be amended from time to time to meet the changing\nrequirements of the city and its extraterritorial jurisdiction.\nSec. 14-2. - Amendments to the comprehensive plan.\nAmendments to the comprehensive plan may be initiated at any time and shall be made in accordance with the following procedures:\na) An amendment to the plan may be adopted only by city council, either on its own initiative or at the request of the planning board or any\nother person or agency.\nb) Requests to amend the comprehensive plan shall first be reviewed by city council. If council is willing to consider the proposed\namendment, it will refer the matter to planning board which shall make a recommendation thereon to council.\nc) City council shall hold at least one public hearing on each amendment or group of amendments initiated. Notice of the public hearing\nshall be provided and the public hearing shall be conducted in accordance with section 7-4-9 of this ordinance. Nothing in this chapter\nshall be construed as preventing this public hearing from being held at the same meeting as a public hearing for the rezoning of a\nparticular tract or parcel affected by the amendment.

Requests for alternative compliance shall be accepted if one or\nmore of the following conditions are met:\na) Topography, geologic features, drainage channels or streams, existing natural vegetation, overhead or underground utilities, or other\nconditions make it unreasonable or meaningless to plant a buffer or meet other landscape requirements;\nb) Space limitations, unusually shaped lots, unique relationships to other properties, and/or prevailing practices in the surrounding\nneighborhood (such as use of a specific type of vegetation) may justify alternative compliance when changing the use type of an existing\nbuilding in an established mature neighborhood or when developing in an historic district; or\nc)\nAn alternative compliance proposal is equal or better than normal compliance in its ability to fulfill the intent of this article and exhibits\nsuperior design quality.\nSec. 15-4. - Existing vegetation.\na) Preservation of existing vegetation. Preserving trees can improve the aesthetic quality of the site and improve property values, provide\nenvironmental benefits, mitigate the impacts of development on the community, and help minimize opposition to a proposed development.\nIt is recommended that groups of trees be preserved, as well as individual trees. Existing preserved trees and shrubs may be credited\ntowards required buffer trees, street trees, and parking lot trees, in accordance with paragraph b), below.\nb)\nCredits and other incentives to preserve vegetation. Preserved trees may be credited at the following rate:\n2-6 inch caliper tree = 1 tree\n7-12 inch caliper tree = 2 trees\n13-18 inch caliper tree = 3 trees\n19-24 inch caliper tree = 4 trees\n25+ inch caliper tree = 5 trees.\nIn order to receive credit, preserved vegetation must be in good health and condition. Trees designated to be preserved must be indicated on the\nsite plan and on landscape and grading plans. Protective barriers, if utilized in accordance with paragraph c), below, must also be shown on the\nlandscape and grading plans. A preserved tree shall be replaced with the total number of trees which were credited to the existing tree under the\nfollowing circumstances: a) when the developer has elected to protect existing trees during construction in accordance with paragraph c), below, if the\npreserved tree dies within five years of completion of the project; b) when the developer has not elected to protect existing trees in accordance with\nparagraph c), below, if the preserved tree dies within ten years of completion of the project.\nc) Protection of existing trees during construction. The regulations contained in this paragraph shall apply in those circumstances when a\ndeveloper has elected to protect trees during construction and, thus, after the passage of five years, be excused from the requirement to\nreplace preserved trees.\n1) No grading or other land-disturbing activity can occur on a site with existing trees which are designated to be preserved in order to meet\nlandscaping requirements until protective barriers are installed by the developer and approved by the community development director\nor a designee appointed by the community development director. Trees designated for preservation which are counted toward the\nlandscape requirements must be protected by barriers, while trees designated for preservation which do not count toward the landscape\nrequirements are encouraged to be protected by barriers. The diameter of the preserved trees and the location of protective barriers\nmust be shown on landscape and grading plans with the dimension between the tree trunk and barrier indicated.\nBarricades shall be placed around the critical root zone of preserved trees that are within 50 feet of any grading or construction activity.\nThe critical root zone is a circle extending around the tree with a one-foot radius for every one inch of tree diameter. For example, a ten-\ninch diameter tree would have a barricade surrounding it, erected ten feet away from the trunk. All protective barriers must be\nmaintained throughout the building construction process.\nProtective barriers shall consist of either:\nA) A fence which is at least three feet high and constructed in a post and rail configuration, using two-by-four posts and one-by-four\nrails; or\n165 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "166", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nB) A fence with two-by-four posts placed no farther than ten feet apart covered with a four-foot orange polyethylene laminar safety\nfencing.\n2) All contractors must be made aware of the areas designated for protection. No disturbance can occur within the tree protection areas\nincluding the following:\nA) Grading;\nB) Filling, unless an aeration system, certified by a registered landscape architect, certified arborist, or North Carolina Agricultural\nExtension Specialist, is installed to protect the tree from suffocation;\nC) Parking;\nD) Storage of debris or materials, including topsoil;\nE) Disposal of hazardous wastes or concrete washout; and\nF) Attaching of nails, ropes, cables, signs, or fencing to any tree designated for preservation.\nIf any area within the critical root zone will be disturbed for any reason, a registered landscape architect, certified arborist, or North\nCarolina Agricultural Extension Specialist must recommend measures to minimize any potential impact and certify that the activity will\nnot damage the tree under normal circumstances.\n3) The developer should coordinate with utility companies early in the design process to resolve potential conflicts about the placement of\nutilities and landscape requirements. Utilities must either be placed outside of the tree protection area or, with planning department\napproval, tunneled at least two feet directly below the tree roots, to minimize root damage.\n4) If silt fencing is required to control sedimentation, the fencing must be placed along the uphill edge of a tree protection zone in order to\nprevent sediment from accumulating in the critical root zone area.\nd) Trees in public rights-of-way. Trees located in any public right-of-way cannot be pruned or removed without a permit from the public works\ndepartment in accordance with the City of Hendersonville Tree Ordinance.\nSec. 15-5. - General standards.\nThe following general standards shall apply to all landscaping requirements in this article.\na) Unless otherwise specified, the exact placement of required plants and structures shall be the decision of the developer. The type of\nplants used shall be limited to those on the approved \"Species List\" which shall be published and revised from time to time by the\nplanning director in consultation with the tree board. Required landscaping shall be designed in such a manner as to impart its aesthetic\ncharacter when viewed from any area accessible to the public or from adjacent properties.\nb) Plant material. Plant materials used for installation shall conform to the standards established by the American Association of\nNurserymen in the \"American Standard for Nursery Stock,\" for each type (i.e., canopy tree, shrub, etc.) with minimum size as appropriate\nfor the minimum caliper size designated in paragraph a), above. Grass sod, when made a part of a buffer, must be healthy, clean and\nreasonably free of weeds, noxious pests or diseases.\nc) Installation. All landscaping/screening shall be installed in a sound, workmanlike manner and according to accepted good planting\nprocedures with the quantity and quality of plant materials as described. All elements of landscaping shall be installed so as to meet all\nother applicable ordinances and code requirements.\nd) Maintenance. The owner, occupant, tenant and the respective agent of each, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the\nmaintenance of all buffer and landscaping. Buffers and landscaping shall be maintained in a good condition so as to present a healthy,\nneat and orderly appearance at least equal to the original installation and shall be kept free from refuse and debris. Dead vegetation and\nlandscaping material shall be promptly replaced with healthy, living plantings. Evergreen hedges shall be trimmed annually or as needed\nto provide a full visual screen and, in any event, shall not be allowed to exceed eight feet in height without written approval of the zoning\nadministrator.\ne) Walls and fences. Any walls used for screening or as part of a buffer shall be constructed in a durable fashion of brick, stone, or other\nmasonry materials. When concrete block is utilized, it shall be finished with stucco on both sides. Wood posts and planks or metal or\nother materials specifically designed as fencing materials may be approved by the zoning administrator for use in a Type C Buffer. Other\nmaterials may also be considered through the alternative buffer and screening process described in section 15-3. No more than ten\npercent of the surface of a fence or wall shall be left open and the finished side of the fence or wall shall face the abutting property. A\nchain link fence may not be used to satisfy the requirements of this article.\nf) Overhead utilities.

A bufferyard is a permanent unit of land\ntogether with plantings and structure(s), if any, which is designed to ameliorate such adverse impacts. Bufferyards, as required in this section, shall be\ndepicted on any site plans reviewed under this ordinance and shall be depicted and described on drawings submitted for the purpose of zoning\ncompliance review. Unless deferred pursuant to a letter of compliance issued under section 15-8, below, buffers shall be emplaced and approved prior\nto issuance of any certificate of occupancy for the development.\na) Location of buffers. Buffers shall be located on lot or parcel boundary lines. Buffers shall not be located on any portion of an existing\npublic or private street or right-of-way, whether opened or unopened.\nb) Determination of buffer requirements. To determine a buffer required between two adjacent parcels or between a parcel and a street,\nthe following procedure shall be followed:\n1) Identify the proposed land use;\n2) Identify the use or, if vacant, the zoning district classification, of land adjacent to the proposed use;\n3) Determine the buffer required on each boundary (or segment thereof) of the subject parcel by referring to the following Table of\nBuffer Requirements. This specifies the buffer required between proposed land uses and existing adjacent land uses or zoning\ndistricts.\nTABLE OF BUFFER REQUIREMENTS\nNotes for Table of Buffer Requirements:\n1 Buffering is required if adjacent parcel of land is used or zoned for the category noted regardless whether adjacent parcel is located in\nthe city, the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ), or the planning jurisdiction of another governmental entity. Existing adjacent land use\ntakes precedence over zoning district. Buffer requirement for the district will be used if adjacent land is vacant.\n2 Includes the following use districts: R-40, R-20, R-15, R-10, R-6, RCT, PRD.\n3 Includes the PMH district or an existing mobile/manufactured home park.\n4 This category includes religious, recreational, child care and educational uses and the following use districts: MIC and PID.\n5 Includes the following use districts: C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, PCD, CMU, GHMU, HMU, UV, UR and CHMU.\n6 Includes the following use districts: I-1, PMD.\nc) Buffer specifications.\n1) The following schedule sets forth the specifications of each of the buffers included in the Table of Buffer Requirements.

Screening.\nThese screening requirements shall apply to any development or use other than single-family or two-family residences. A buffer as specified in this\narticle may be used to meet the requirements of this section. Where practicable, the following uses must be screened from abutting property and from\npublic view from a public right-of-way or a parking lot:\na) Dumpsters or trash handling areas;\nb) Utility structures associated with a building;\nc) Loading docks or spaces;\nd) Outdoor storage of materials, stock and equipment, which shall not include the display of goods for sale; and\ne) Any other uses for which screening is required under this ordinance.\nAs far as practicable, any screening used to comply with the provisions of this section shall consist of a planting area which is at least five feet wide.\nThis area may contain any type screening materials sufficient to separate visually the land uses, provided such materials meet the requirements of this\narticle. If only a wall or fence is used, then the area devoted to the screen need only be wide enough to accommodate the wall or fence and allow for its\nmaintenance. Where practicable, screening shall be designed and maintained in such a manner as to conceal the use from view from the street, from\nvehicular use areas, and from adjoining properties.\n168 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nType of Buffer\nCELL (1, 2): \nPlanting Requirements per 100 Linear Feet\nCELL (1, 3): \nSize Requirements\nCELL (2, 1): \nA\nCELL (2, 2): \n3 broadleaf canopy trees\n20 evergreen shrubs (4-foot centers) 25 flowering shrubs\nCELL (2, 3): \n5-6 feet\n18-24 inches\n12-18 inches\nCELL (3, 1): \nB\nCELL (3, 2): \n4 broadleaf canopy tree\n25 evergreen shrubs (4-foot centers) 33 flowering shrubs\nCELL (3, 3): \n11/2-13/4 inch caliper\n18-24 inches\n18-24 inches\nCELL (4, 1): \nC\nCELL (4, 2): \n4 broadleaf canopy tree\n10 understory trees\n33 flowering shrubs\nberm\nfence or wall on top of berm\nCELL (4, 3): \n1 3/4-2 inch caliper\n5-6 feet\n18-24 inches\n6 feet\n8 feet\nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nNo buffer required\nCELL (5, 3): \nNot applicable\n"}, {"page": "169", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nSec. 15-8. - Letter of compliance.\nIt is recognized that land development occurs continuously and that vegetation used in buffers should be planted at certain times of the year to\nensure the best chance of survival. In order to ensure compliance with this article and to reduce the potential expense of replacing buffering,\nlandscaping or screening materials which were installed in an untimely or improper fashion, a letter of compliance must be filed with the zoning\nadministrator at the time of zoning compliance review. A letter of compliance will allow the issuance of a conditional certificate of occupancy. This letter\nwill acknowledge that the applicant for a certificate of zoning compliance is aware of any buffer, landscaping or screening requirements which may\napply to their property and that the applicant will comply with those requirements by a specific date, generally to be within the next planting season,\nbut in no case more than one year after the completion of construction of that portion of the project or building for which the certificate was issued. In\nno event shall a final certificate of occupancy be issued prior to emplacement and approval of the required buffer, landscaping or screening. Failure to\ncomply with the provisions of this section within the time noted in the letter of compliance will be a violation of the zoning ordinance.\nSec. 15-9. Landscaping for vehicular use areas.\nTrees and shrubs are required in and around vehicular use areas with more than six spaces to provide attractive views from roads and adjacent\nproperties, provide shade to reduce the heat generated by impervious surfaces, reduce glare from vehicular use areas, and to help filter exhaust from\nvehicles.\na) Perimeter and interior plantings. Vehicular use areas must be planted with at least one tree and two shrubs for every 4,000 square feet\nof vehicular use area, which includes parking spaces, aisles, driveways, and loading areas. Trees shall be spaced so that no parking space\nis more than 63 feet from a tree. At least 75 percent of the required parking lot trees must be broadleaf canopy trees. Trees and shrubs\nmust be planted within 20 feet of the vehicular use area to count as parking lot landscaping; provided, however, all street trees required\nby other provisions of this zoning ordinance shall count as parking lot landscaping.\nWhen a development contains 20 or more parking spaces, 50 percent of the trees and shrubs required by paragraph a), above, must be\nplanted in islands or medians located within the parking lot. Tree islands shall be evenly distributed throughout the parking lot in order\nto provide an even tree canopy throughout the lot. At a minimum, such tree islands shall consist of an area at least equal in size to two\nparking places side-by-side (360 square feet). Parking bays shall be broken up with landscaped islands or medians to avoid long\nmonotonous rows of parking. Planting trees in groups is encouraged to increase the total amount of planting area for roots to grow.\nAt the time of planting, trees and shrubs required in this section shall meet the following minimum size requirements:\n1) Broadleaf canopy trees: One and one-half to two-inch caliper;\n2) All other trees: Five to six feet in height;\n3) All shrubs: Height or spread of 18 to 24 inches.\nb) Planting strips. When a vehicular use area lot is located within 100 feet of an abutting property and no bufferyard is required, a planting\nstrip which is a minimum of five feet wide shall be planted between the vehicular use area and the abutting property, except along\napproved driveway openings which run perpendicular to the planting strip. One large evergreen or deciduous tree and five evergreen or\ndeciduous shrubs shall be planted for every 40 linear feet of property line that parallels the vehicular use area. Fifty percent of these\ntrees and shrubs may be counted toward the parking lot trees and shrubs required in paragraph a), above, if the planting strip is located\nwithin 20 feet of the vehicular use area. Adjacent businesses on separate lots which share parking or driveways shall be exempt from this\nrequirement provided that the required planting strip would interfere with the reasonable use of the shared parking or driveway.\nVehicular use areas located behind buildings and screened from view from public rights-of-way shall be exempt from this requirement.\nc) Buffering from street. Vehicular use areas greater than 4,000 square feet any portion of which is located within 50 feet of the right-of-\nway of a street must be buffered from the street. The buffer shall be at least three feet high at maturity and can consist of plant material\nalone, or berms, fences, walls, or grade changed combined with plant material. A vegetative buffer shall consist of at least one evergreen\nor deciduous shrub planted for every five linear feet of buffer required. If a fence or wall is used, it must be constructed of wood, brick,\nstone or other masonry and be architecturally compatible with the proposed structure. Seventy-five percent of the fence or wall must be\nopaque with any spaces evenly distributed. The finished side of the fence or wall shall face the street. At least one shrub shall be planted\non the street side for each eight linear feet of fence or wall. Berms and grade changes must be completely covered with vegetation. All\nshrubs planted can count toward the parking lot landscaping requirements.\nd)\nStructured parking facilities. Structured parking facilities, or parking decks, shall be excused from the parking lot landscaping\nrequirements contained in this section but shall comply with the provisions of this paragraph. In the event that any openings for\nventilation, service, or emergency access are located at the first floor level in the building facade, then they shall be an integral part of the\noverall building design. These openings as well as pedestrian and vehicular entrances shall be designed to minimize visibility of parked\n169 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "170", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\ncars. The remainder of street level frontage shall be either commercial space or an architecturally articulated facade designed to\nminimize the visibility of parked cars. All levels of a structured parking facility shall be designed and screened in such a way as to\nminimize visibility of parked cars. In no instance will rails or cabling alone be sufficient to meet this screening requirement.\nThe design elements of this paragraph shall only apply to building facades which are visible from a public right-of-way.\ne) Automobile sales facilities. Automobile sales facilities, due to the fact that inventory is typically stored and displayed for sale on\nvehicular use areas, require separate analysis with regard to the parking lot landscaping requirements in this section. Automobile sales\nfacilities are, accordingly, exempted from the need to comply with interior parking lot landscaping requirements for that portion of an\nautomobile sales facility utilized exclusively for the display of goods for sale. Automobile sales facilities are required to comply with the\nperimeter and planting strip requirements of this section; provided, however, such facilities shall be permitted one display area, which\nshall not be required to be screened, for each 100 feet of roadway frontage. Each display area shall extend no more than 50 feet in\nlength.\nf) Effect on other regulations. Areas devoted to meeting the landscaping requirements of this section may count toward the common\nopen space requirements contained in section 6-16, above. Where site characteristics and development considerations make it prudent\nand feasible, landscaping proposed to meet the requirements of this section may also contribute toward meeting the buffering and\nscreening requirements contained in this article.\ng) Small lots. Small lots, defined as lots with less than 100 feet of frontage on a roadway or with less than 100 feet of depth, may have site\nconstraints which make strict compliance with the regulations contained in this section a hardship. In such cases, the approving authority\nfor the city may approve deviations from such regulations so long as the plans of development are consistent with the goals and\nobjectives stated herein.\nSec. 15-10. - Buffer requirements when a street separates incompatible uses.\nIf a street with right-of-way of less than 30 feet lies between two land uses which would require a bufferyard between them, a buffer shall be\nrequired along the affected side or rear property lines of the developing use. No bufferyard is required along the front property line.\nSec. 15-11. - Bufferyards in the Central Business District.\nIn order to preserve and promote existing development patterns the bufferyard requirements of article XV shall not apply within the C-1 Central\nBusiness District.\nSec. 15-12. - Special provisions regarding residential dwellings in nonresidential zoning designations.\nResidential uses developed after January 8, 1998 and situated in areas zoned C-2, C-3, C-4 or I-1 shall receive special treatment with regard to these\nbuffering, screening and landscaping regulations. They shall be treated as if they were commercial uses, if located in a commercial designation, or\nindustrial uses, if located in an industrial designation, for the purpose of determining what buffering requirements will be imposed on adjacent uses\nwhich develop subsequent to such residential uses.\nSec. 15-13. - Special provisions regarding open space landscaping in Mixed Use Districts.\nIn addition to all other landscaping required by this zoning ordinance, each development parcel in a Mixed Use Zoning District shall contain a\nminimum of one tree and five shrubs for every 4,000 square feet of open space on such development parcel. A minimum of 50 percent of the trees\nshall be canopy trees.\nAt the time of planting, trees and shrubs required in this section shall meet the following minimum size requirements:\n(a) Broadleaf canopy trees: one and one-half to two-inch caliper;\n(b) All other trees: five to six feet in height;\n(c) All shrubs: height or spread of 18 to 24 inches.\nNo landscaped area shall be constructed with more than ten percent of the total area of gravel, stone, concrete, asphalt, or other similar material,\nexcepting necessary walks and vehicular use areas.\nARTICLE XVI. - SUPPLEMENTARY STANDARDS FOR CERTAIN USES\nSec. 16-1. Purpose.\n170 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "171", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nThis article provides for the regulation of certain land uses which, because of their nature or locational requirements, demand additional unique\nstandards in order to be compatible with other permitted or conditional uses within the relevant zoning district.\nSec. 16-2. Applicability.\nThese standards apply to a particular use only when it is designated as a special use, conditional zoning district or a \"permitted use subject to\nsupplementary standards\" in any particular zoning classification. They do not apply when a use is a permitted use that is permitted by right. In such a\nsituation, the general development standards contained in article VI and the applicable district standards will guide development and use. It is\nimportant to note this distinction because the same use may be a conditional use or a permitted use subject to supplementary standards in one zoning\nclassification, in which case the standards contained in this article would apply, and a permitted use in another classification in which case they would\nnot.\nThe standards contained in this article also serve as minimum requirements for developments undergoing rezoning to a conditional zoning district;\nprovided, however, nothing herein shall be construed to limit applicants from proposing, and city council from approving, plans which exceed these\nstandards.\nSec. 16-3. - Procedures for applying standards.\nThis article does not distinguish between standards on the basis of procedural review. Please refer to the appropriate zoning classification to\ndetermine if the proposed use is a conditional zoning district, a special use or a permitted use subject to supplementary standards. If it is a special use,\nthen a special use permit must be obtained from the board of adjustment in accordance with article X, above. If the proposed use is a conditional\nzoning district or a permitted use subject to supplementary standards, then the standards will be applied during the applicable development review\nprocedure in accordance with article VII, above.\nSec. 16-4. Standards.\nAs stated herein, the following standards apply to the indicated use when such use is either a conditional zoning district, special use or a permitted\nuse subject to supplementary standards. These standards are in addition to other applicable development standards contained in this ordinance.\n16-4-1 Accessory dwelling units.\na) Accessory dwelling units may only be situated on a lot on which a principal residential dwelling unit is also situated and shall be clearly\nincidental or accessory to such principal residential structure.\nb) No more than one accessory dwelling unit may be situated on any lot.\nc) Accessory dwelling units may not exceed 800 square feet of floor area.\n16-4-2 Adaptive reuses.\nThis section is intended to allow a means for the development of new uses for a building originally designed for a different use. It is intended to have\napplication in two particular areas. The first is for the reuse of a structure which has been used historically for a use permitted in the zoning district\nclassification but for which there is no longer any reasonable demand for such previous use. Example of this first class include church buildings and\nschools. The second class involves situations in which structures have been devoted historically to a nonconforming use, the owner of the property no\nlonger desires to devote the property to that use or the use has ceased, and there is no reasonable likelihood that the property will revert to a use\npermitted in the zoning district classification.\nAdaptive reuses may only be authorized by means of a rezoning to a conditional zoning district processed through the conditional zoning district\nrequirements of article VII, above. In addition to the standards set forth therein, adaptive reuses must also meet the following special requirements:\na) The developer proposes the reuse of a structure or structures used historically for a use permitted in the zoning district classification but\nfor which there is no longer any reasonable demand for such previous use, or the developer proposes the reuse of a structure or\nstructures used historically as nonconforming use and there is no reasonable likelihood that the property will revert to a use permitted in\nthe zoning district classification.\nb) The developer shall state the precise nature of the proposed adaptive reuse, which shall be compatible with neighboring residential uses.\nIf a special use permit is granted for the adaptive reuse, future use of the property shall be limited to the specified use unless 1) the use\nis changed to another use permitted in the zoning classification or 2) a new adaptive reuse is approved.\nc) The adaptive reuse shall be housed in an existing structure or structures.\n171 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "172", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nd) Such structures may be modified or expanded so long as the gross floor area is not increased by more than ten percent and so long as\nthe appearance of the modification is in harmony with the neighboring residential uses.\ne) Off-street parking meeting the requirements of section 6-5, above, shall be provided. Such off-street parking shall be screened so that it\nis not readily visible from the street or from adjoining residential uses.\nf)\nThe adaptive reuse may have one sign not exceeding four square feet in area.\ng) The developer shall propose, install and maintain landscaping which will assist in giving it a residential appearance.\nh) The adaptive reuse shall provide open space which shall be not less than 60 percent of the total area of the development parcel.\ni) Lighting for the adaptive reuse shall be no more than is necessary for safe use of the facility, and shall be designed and installed so that it\nis directed away from the roadway and any adjacent properties.\nj) Traffic generated by the adaptive reuse shall not be expected to cause an inconvenience to residents of the neighborhood.\nk) The developer shall propose hours of operation for the adaptive reuse which are designed to be compatible with neighboring residential\nuses. Such hours of operation shall become a condition of the special use permit, violation of which shall be grounds for revocation of\nthe permit.\n16-4-3 Adult establishments.\na) It shall be unlawful to develop or operate an adult establishment within the planning jurisdiction of the City of Hendersonville without a\nspecial use permit issued by the board of adjustment as provided herein.\nb) The standards for issuance of a special use permit are as follows:\n1) The owner/operator of the adult establishment must have a current, valid permit to operate an adult establishment issued pursuant\nto article V, chapter 5, City Code.\n2) No portion of the premises on which the adult establishment is located shall be situated within 300 feet of any of the following zoning\ndistricts: R-40 Estate Residential, R-20 Low Density Residential, R-15 Medium Density Residential, R-10 Medium Density Residential,\nR-6 High Density Residential, PRD Planned Residential Development, PMH Planned Manufactured Housing, MIC Medical Institutional\nCultural, RCT Residential Commercial Transition.\n3) No portion of the premises on which the adult establishment is located shall be situated within 750 feet of a lot line of a primary or\nsecondary school or a public park.\n4) No portion of the premises on which the adult establishment is located shall be situated within 1,000 feet of a lot line of another\nadult establishment or of any enterprise engaged in the retail sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages.\n5) There shall be no more than one adult establishment business in the same building, structure, or portion thereof.

No person who is under the influence of an impairing substance or alcohol or who has an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or\nmore shall be or remain upon the premises of any adult establishment.\nc) A special use permit issued pursuant to this section shall function as an operating permit and shall have a term of one year. The operator\nof an adult establishment must reapply each year and be issued a new conditional use permit in order to continue in operation. Such\nconditional use permit shall be issued so long as the operator demonstrates compliance with the standards set forth in paragraph b),\nabove, and so long as the establishment has not violated any of the grounds for revocation contained in paragraph e), below.\n172 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "173", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nd) Anyone desiring to operate an adult establishment shall make application for a conditional use permit, shall pay a fee therefor as\nestablished by resolution of city council, and shall demonstrate compliance with the standards contained in paragraph b), above.

Purpose.\nRecognizing that protection of the natural resources of the City of Hendersonville represents prudent stewardship and good business, this article is\ncreated to establish standards intended to accomplish the following:\na) To preserve and enhance the quality of the water in creeks, streams, ponds and lakes that flow into and out of the city;\nb) To minimize future flooding problems by guiding development away from flood prone areas;\nc)\nTo preserve the water carrying capacity of watercourses and the natural water storage capacity of the special flood hazard area;\nd) To protect land and watercourses from pollutants, sedimentation and erosion;\ne) To retain open spaces in order to protect their environmentally-sensitive character; and\nf) To protect and conserve significant natural resources from degradation due to urbanization.\nSec. 17-2. - Floodplain protection standards.\nThe primary objective of floodplain protection standards is to preserve and maintain the natural floodplain in an undisturbed vegetated state in\norder to maintain flood storage capacity, control stormwater, improve water quality and conserve plant and wildlife habitat.\n17-2-1 - Development prohibited in the floodway and special flood hazard area.\nDevelopment within the floodway and special flood hazard area, as defined in section 12-2, above, shall be prohibited, except as provided in this article.\nFor purposes of this article the term development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to,\nbuildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials.\n17-2-2 Development allowed in the floodway and special flood hazard area.\na) Land in the floodway and special flood hazard area may be used for the following purposes, provided that such uses are designed and\nconstructed to minimize clearing, grading, erosion and water quality degradation:\n1) Crossings by streets, driveways, culverts and railroads;\n2) Active and passive recreational activities authorized in the zoning district in which the property is situated;\n3) Intakes, docks, utilities (including water and wastewater treatment, stormwater control and sedimentation and erosion control\nfacilities), bridges, other public facilities and water-dependent structures;\n4) Wetlands constructed or restored for mitigation purposes;\n5) Redevelopment pursuant to section 17-2-4, below; and\n6) Land within the floodway and special flood hazard area can serve to meet minimum lot size requirements if there is sufficient\nbuildable area remaining on the tract.\nb) Land in the special flood hazard area may be used for up to 25 percent of the parking required for the development on the tract;\nprovided, there is no increase in the elevation of the land resulting in a loss of flood storage. Furthermore, no more than one-third of the\nspecial flood hazard area on any development tract shall be used for parking. Parking in the special flood hazard area shall undergo\ndevelopment review in accordance with article VII, above. In considering the application for development approval, the city shall consider\nwhether the proposed parking on the site is designed and arranged to minimize adverse environmental impact from placement of\nparking in the special flood hazard area and whether the proposed development would result in significant degradation of water quality,\nloss of significant wetlands, increase in sedimentation and erosion, increase in stormwater runoff, loss of significant plant and wildlife\nhabitat or would otherwise constitute a threat to public safety. Where feasible, the proposed parking shall be designed making maximum\n186 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "187", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nuse of pervious materials.\nc) Streets and driveways may run generally within special flood hazard area and parallel to the stream only where no other access to the\nproperty is feasible. Such streets and driveways shall be designed to minimize loss of flood storage.\nd) In order to allow design flexibility to achieve high quality site design and better utilization of land adjacent to the special flood hazard\narea, a property owner or developer may fill and/or use for development up to ten percent of the special flood hazard area contained\nwithin the boundaries of any development site upon satisfactorily demonstrating the following:\n1) The proposed fill and/or development provides for a higher quality site design and better utilization of land adjacent to the special\nflood hazard area than would be possible without the intrusion necessary to achieve the high quality design; and\n2) The proposed fill and/or development represents the minimum amount of special flood hazard area intrusion necessary to achieve\nthe high quality design.\nPublic and private roads and sidewalks shall not count toward the allowable ten percent of the special flood hazard area on a tract that\ncan be filled and/or used for development in accordance with section 17-2-2(d).\nA property owner or developer may fill and/or use for development more than ten percent of the special flood hazard area when such\nwould be necessary so that the property to be developed, including both the special flood hazard area and land adjacent thereto, equals\none-half acre.\ne)\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, for parcels existing prior to the effective date of this ordinance situated entirely within the 100-year flood\nplain as depicted on the most recent Flood Insurance Rate Map, a property owner or developer may fill and/or use for development up to\none-half acre or ten percent of such property, whichever is greater. Provided, however, in order to develop such lands, the property\nowner or developer must comply with all applicable regulations of the Federal Emergency Management Administration including\nobtaining a \"no-rise\" certificate, if necessary.\nFurthermore, in order to qualify for the exception contained in this paragraph, proposed development shall be situated and designed in\nsuch a way as to be consistent with the purposes of this article as set forth in section 17-1, above.\nf) It is intended that this ordinance be congruous with the City of Hendersonville Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance. Therefore, any uses,\ndevelopment or land disturbing activity allowed by section 17-2 shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the flood\ndamage prevention ordinance, including, without limitation, the requirement to obtain a \"no-rise\" certificate for activities within the\nfloodway.\n17-2-3 - Density credits.\nThe amount of land in the special flood hazard area may be credited for residential density on land adjacent to the special flood hazard area at a rate of\n100 percent of that allowed by the zoning.\n17-2-4 Redevelopment in the floodway and special flood hazard area.\nHistorically, some areas of the city's planning jurisdiction were developed despite the fact that they lie within the 100-year floodplain. In order to\naddress concerns about urban blight, this section allows redevelopment to occur on existing developed sites which no longer function as natural flood\nplain and when such redevelopment will not result in any further loss of flood-plain functionality. Where feasible, redevelopment proposals should\ndemonstrate an improvement in the site's functionality as a flood plain. In light of this intent, redevelopment of existing developed sites shall be\npermitted within the floodway and special flood hazard area only when the applicant has satisfactorily demonstrated the following:\na) The proposal is to redevelop an existing developed site as of the date of this ordinance evidenced by substantial coverage of the site by\nbuildings, fill, gravel or paved drives or parking areas or other impervious surfaces.\nb) There shall be no loss of flood storage capacity on the site as a result of the redevelopment.\nc) The applicant, utilizing best management practices, shall reduce the post-redevelopment rate of stormwater runoff from the pre-\nredevelopment rate of runoff, if feasible. In any event, the post-redevelopment rate of runoff shall not be greater than the pre-\nredevelopment rate.\nd)\nThe project design, including any best management practices (BMPs) will result in a project which is consistent with the purposes of the\nNatural Resources Protection Ordinance as stated in section 17-1, above. In this regard, the applicant shall demonstrate the following:\n1) The project shall not degrade the quality of the water in creeks, streams, ponds and lakes that flow into and out of the city.\n2) The project shall not contribute to future flooding problems.\n3) The project preserves the water carrying capacity of watercourses and the natural water storage of the special flood hazard area.\n187 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "188", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n4) The project protects land and watercourses from pollutants, sedimentation and erosion.\n5) The project retains open spaces in order to protect their environmentally-sensitive character; and\n6) The project protects and conserves significant natural resources from degradation due to urbanization.\ne) The applicant shall comply with all relevant provisions of the flood damage prevention ordinance including obtaining a no-rise certificate,\nif needed.\nSec. 17-3. - Stream buffer protection standards.\nThe primary objective of stream buffer protection standards is to maintain land adjacent to streams in an undisturbed vegetated state in order to\nenhance and maintain water quality, protect stream channel wetlands, minimize stormwater runoff, reduce sedimentation and erosion, conserve plant\nand wildlife habitat and protect wildlife movement corridors. The standards contained in this section will further this objective (1) by regulating water\ntemperature through shading of the stream bed, (2) by limiting sedimentation from streambank erosion and stormwater flow, and (3) by supporting\naquatic life through the provision of organic debris such as leaves and twigs.\n17-3-1 Applicability.\nExcept as modified in this section, stream buffer protection standards shall apply to all watercourses depicted as a solid blue line on the most recent\nUSGS seven-and-one-half minute quadrangle topographic maps covering the City of Hendersonville and its area of extraterritorial jurisdiction. Stream\nbuffers shall be clearly indicated on all development plans, including concept plans, preliminary plans and final plans, and on all preliminary and final\nplats.\n17-3-2 Stream buffer size.\nStream buffers shall apply on each side of the stream and shall measure 30 feet horizontally from the top of the stream bank in a direction\nperpendicular to the stream flow.\n17-3-3 - Prohibition against development within the stream buffer.\nTo avoid a loss of effectiveness in protecting streams, the stream buffer shall remain in natural undisturbed forest vegetation and no development or\nland-disturbing activities shall be undertaken therein, except as provided in section 17-3-5. Furthermore, there shall be a 20-foot transitional area\nimmediately landward of the stream buffer which may be graded landscaped and/or used for pedestrian or vehicular purposes so long as no\nimpervious materials are utilized. Certain uses of land, as specified in section 17-3-5, below, may be permitted within the stream buffer so long as they\nmeet the requirements of that section and are designed and constructed to minimize the amount of intrusion into the stream buffer and to minimize\nclearing, grading, erosion and water quality degradation.

Functional integration of\nresidential and commercial uses shall be considered during project design. This section seeks to set forth the design philosophy for the mixed use\nzoning districts and is intended to provide guidance to design professionals. It is also intended to provide standards for reviewing projects undergoing\nalternative design review pursuant to section 18-3, above.\n18-6-1 - General site arrangement.\nStructures shall be placed and arranged so as not to adversely affect adjacent property. Adverse effects shall include, but are not limited to, the\nremoval of lateral support on adjacent property, the creation of hazard, nuisance, danger, or inconvenience, or unreasonable loss of privacy.\nDevelopment shall be arranged so as to be visually harmonious within the development site and, where appropriate, in relation to adjacent\ndevelopments. Site design elements of the development shall be integrated to the degree of their compatibility with each other and shall be separated\nto the degree of their incompatibility. Insofar as is practicable, developments shall be arranged so as to preserve or enhance vistas.\n18-6-2 - Physical integration of uses.\nAll mixed use developments shall be designed and developed to provide an appropriate interrelationship between the various uses and structures\nwithin the development. Residential and commercial uses may be located within the same or adjoining structures.\n18-6-3 - Preservation of natural features and open space.\nPermitted flexibility in lot sizes, setbacks, street alignments and widths, and landscaping shall be utilized to preserve natural features and drainage\npatterns and to provide open space.\n18-6-4 - Building and project design compatibility.\nThe mixed-use districts are proposed for corridors where there is considerable existing development, much of which is not consistent with the purpose\nand goals of this article. To the degree existing development is consistent with these purpose and goals, new development should be designed to be\ncompatible with such existing development. However, where there is a conflict between the design of existing development and the purpose and goals\nof this article, the purpose and goals of this article shall prevail. The following elements shall be addressed to ensure compatibility.\n18-6-4.1 Architectural character. NOTE: Section 18-6-4.1 is not required for one- and two-family dwellings; property owners/developers may\nvoluntarily consent to these standards per G.S. 160D-702(b).\nThe rich architectural vocabulary of the City of Hendersonville presents a wide variety of development opportunities using traditional forms while\navoiding any perception of monotony. Each building proposed for the mixed use districts shall have a well-proportioned form consistent with the\nbuilding use, and its construction materials and methods. Massing of the building(s) shall create a building envelope that reflects simple, clearly\narticulated building volumes. Such straight-forward building massing is distinguished from additive or collective forms which generally are not\nallowed unless clearly related to specific functions and uses of the building.\nAssuming they are consistent with the purpose and goals of this article, as well as the general architectural standards stated above, new\ndevelopments in or adjacent to existing developed areas shall be compatible with the established architectural character of such areas by using a\ndesign that is complementary. Compatibility may be achieved through techniques such as the repetition of roof lines, the use of similar proportions\nin building mass and outdoor spaces, similar relationships to the street, similar window and door patterns, and/or the use of building materials that\nhave color shades and textures similar to those existing in the immediate area of the proposed infill development.\n194 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}, {"page": "195", "text": "Hendersonville, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n18-6-4.2 Building orientation.

A main entrance shall face a\nconnecting walkway with a direct, safe, pedestrian connection to the street. Where the main entrance does not face the adjacent street, buildings\nshall nonetheless be designed to provide an attractive streetside fa\u00e7ade.\n18-6-4.3 Building placement. Buildings shall be situated with regard to pedestrian and vehicular connectivity. It is preferred that they be located\nclose to the pedestrian street with offstreet parking behind and/or beside the building. Important mountain vistas and/or views of significant historic\nsites shall be protected and accentuated to the extent practicable.\n18-6-4.4 Privacy considerations. Elements of the development plan shall be arranged to maximize the opportunity for privacy by the residents of\nthe project and minimize infringement on the privacy of adjoining land uses. Additionally, the development plan shall create opportunities for\ninteractions among neighbors.\n18-6-4.5 Architectural details. NOTE: Section 18-6-4.5 is not required for one- and two-family dwellings; property owners/developers may\nvoluntarily consent to these standards per G.S. 160D-702(b).\nArchitectural elements like openings, sill details, bulkheads, posts, and other architectural features shall be used to establish human scale at the\nstreet level. On corner lots, the applicant is encouraged to provide a building entry, additional building mass, and distinctive architectural elements\nat the corner of buildings. Windows, doors, columns, leaves, parapets, and other building components shall be proportional to the overall scale of\nthe building. Windows shall be vertically aligned wherever practical. The appearance of all exposed fa\u00e7ades (not just the streetside fa\u00e7ade) is\nimportant and shall be addressed in development design.\n18-6-4.6 Circulation and access. Street designs shall permit the comfortable use of the street by cars, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Pavement\nwidths, design speeds, and the number of vehicle lanes should be minimized without compromising safety. The specific design of any given street\nmust consider the building types which front on the street and the relationship of the street to the city's street network. This Ordinance encourages\nthe development of a network of interconnecting streets that work to disperse traffic while connecting and integrating neighborhoods with the\nexisting urban fabric of the city. Equally as important, the Ordinance encourages the development of a network of sidewalks and bicycle lanes that\nprovide an attractive and safe mode of travel for pedestrians and cyclists.\nMinor variations and exceptions to street cross-sections may be permitted with approval of the administrative officer and the city engineer. Such\nexceptions include variations to the pavement width, size and location of on-street parking, tree planting areas, street grade, and centerline radii in\naccordance with principles below. Right-of-way widths should be preserved for continuity.\nStreets shall interconnect within a development and shall be designed with due regard to designated corridors shown on the city transportation\nplan. Streets shall be designed as the main public space of the city and shall be scaled to the pedestrian. Applicants are encouraged to design streets\nso that they interconnect with adjacent properties.\nSidewalks shall be required along streets adjacent to proposed developments. They shall form a logical, safe, and convenient system for\npedestrian access to all dwelling units and commercial establishments within the development and shall be required along such streets, drives and\nparking areas as is necessary to accomplish this. Pedestrian/bicycle pathways may be substituted for sidewalks, if appropriate.\n18-6-4.7 Building walls. NOTE: Section 18-6-4.7 is not required for one- and two-family dwellings; property owners/developers may voluntarily\nconsent to these standards per G.S. 160D-702(b).\nBuildings shall avoid long, monotonous, uninterrupted walls or roof planes on their visible fa\u00e7ades. It is preferred that this design goal be\nachieved by means of building wall offsets, including projections, recesses, and changes in floor level, and roofline offsets. Such offsets add\narchitectural interest and variety and can assist in creating human size proportions. Parapets shall be designed as integral to the mass of the\nbuilding. When multiple wall materials are combined on one fa\u00e7ade, the designer is encouraged to place the heavier material(s) below.\n18-6-4.8 Building materials. NOTE: Section 18-6-4.8 is not required for one- and two-family dwellings; property owners/developers may\nvoluntarily consent to these standards per G.S. 160D-702(b).\nBuilding materials shall either be similar to the materials already being used in the neighborhood or, if dissimilar materials are being proposed,\nother characteristics such as scale and proportions, form, architectural detailing, color and texture, shall be utilized to ensure that enough similarity\nexists for the building to be compatible, despite the differences in materials.\nBuilding materials shall not create excessive glare. Highly reflective building materials, such as aluminum, unpainted metal and reflective glass,\nhave a high potential for glare, and designs utilizing such materials shall be evaluated to determine whether or not the glare would create a\nsignificant adverse impact on the adjacent property owners, neighborhood or community in terms of vehicular safety, outdoor activities and\nenjoyment of views.\n195 of 195\n1/17/2024, 3:15 PM\n"}], "town": "hendersonville"}
