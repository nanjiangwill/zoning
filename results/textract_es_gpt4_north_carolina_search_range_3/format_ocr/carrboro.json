ZONING DISTRICTS\nSection 15-135 Residential Districts Established.\n(a)\nThe following basic residential districts are hereby established: R-20, R-15, R-10,\nR-7.5, R-3, R-2, R-R, R-S.I.R., and R-S.I.R.-2. The purpose of each of the foregoing residential\ndistricts is to secure for the persons who reside there a comfortable, healthy, safe, and pleasant\nenvironment in which to live, sheltered from incompatible and disruptive activities that properly\nbelong in non-residential districts. (AMENDED 5/12/81; 12/7/83; 2/4/86)\n(b)\nThe WR (watershed residential) district is also established. All land within this district\nis located within the University Lake Watershed, and while this district is designed to achieve the\nobjectives identified in subsection (a), it is also intended to protect the community water supply by\nallowing residential development of the land within the University Lake Watershed only at reduced\ndensity levels. (AMENDED 12/7/83; 05/15/90)\n(c)\nThe R-R (rural residential) district is designed to accommodate the residential and\nrelated uses as well as several additional uses that would be appropriate in the more sparsely populated\nareas of the town's joint planning transition area or extraterritorial planning area, but that would be\ninappropriate within the more intensively developed residential zones. (AMENDED 11/14/88)\n(d)\nThe R-S.I.R. (suitable for intensive residential) zone is designed (i) to encourage high\ndensity residential development that is compatible with the housing element of the town's\nComprehensive Plan, and (ii) to locate this high density development in areas most suitable for it,\nthereby reducing pressure for growth in less desirable locations and reducing urban sprawl. Land in\nthis zone is deemed especially suitable for intensive residential development because of (i) the\navailability of police, fire, and sanitation service at low marginal cost due to existing service patterns,\n(ii) the availability of public water and sewer service, (iii) the ample road system serving the area, (iv)\nthe compatibility of existing development in the area with high density residential development, and\n(v) the compatibility of high density residential development with environmental concerns, especially\nwater quality. Developers are encouraged to construct housing that is consistent with the town's\nhousing objectives through density bonuses, as set forth in Section 15-182.1.\n(e)\nThe R-S.I.R.-2 zoning district is designed to serve essentially the same purposes as\nthe R-S.I.R. zone, but the maximum density allowed in the R-S.I.R.-2 district is less than that\npermitted in the R-S.I.R. district (see Section 15-182.1). Except as otherwise specifically provided in\nthis chapter, all regulations and standards applicable to the R-S.I.R. district are also applicable to the\nR-S.I.R.-2 district.

(AMENDED 12/7/83)\nThere is hereby established a conservation (C) district. The purpose of this district is to protect\nthe public health, safety, and welfare by severely restricting development within and adjacent to\ncertain lakes, ponds, watercourses, streams, creeks, drainage areas, floodplains, wetlands, and other\nflood-prone areas within the University Lake Watershed. The limited development allowed\nwithin\na\nconservation district not only minimizes the danger to the community water supply from the more\nintensive development of this land but also allows this land to act as a natural buffer between more\nintensively developed areas and the watercourses contained within a conservation district.\n(AMENDED 12/7/83)\nSection 15-136 Commercial Districts Established.

Because of the B-1(g) district's close\nproximity to established residential single-family neighborhoods, the EAT overlay\nis restricted to properties a minimum distance of one property width from abutting\nresidential zones and is limited in the types of night uses permitted.

At the same time, continued residential use\nof existing and nearby structures, and preservation of the existing character and\nappearance of this area is encouraged. Accordingly, however, whenever the use of\nthe land in this district is changed to commercial, it is intended and desired that\nexisting residential structures be converted and adapted to commercial use rather than\nnew buildings constructed, and to encourage this, the regulations for this district allow\ndevelopment at a lower density than is permitted in the B-1 districts and permit uses\nthat tend to generate minimal traffic. In this way, the B-2 district should provide a\nsmoother transition from the more intensively developed B-1 areas to residential\nareas. Any development within the B-2 district shall comply with the following\nrequirements: (AMENDED 9/06/88; 6/20/06).\na.\nTo the extent practicable, development shall otherwise retain, preserve and be\ncompatible with the residential character of the older homes within and\nimmediately adjacent to this district;\nb.\nTo the extent practicable, vehicle accommodation areas associated with uses\non lots in this district shall be located in the rear of buildings SO that parking\nareas are not readily visible from the streets; and\n(4)\nB-3 NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESS. This district is designed to accommodate\ncommercial needs arising at the neighborhood level, such as grocery stores, branch\nbanks, gas sales, and the like, as well as other commercial and office uses that are\nof such size and scale that they can compatibly coexist with adjoining residential\nneighborhoods. To insure compatibility between B-3 areas and the neighborhoods,\nno B-3 district shall be greater than five acres, and no areas shall be zoned B-3 if\nany portion of a pre-existing business district lies within one-half mile in any\ndirection.

This zone is designed to accommodate\na variety of commercial enterprises that provide goods and services to a larger market\narea than those businesses permitted in the neighborhood business district.\nDevelopment regulations also permit higher buildings and increased density over that\nallowed in the B-3 zone.
