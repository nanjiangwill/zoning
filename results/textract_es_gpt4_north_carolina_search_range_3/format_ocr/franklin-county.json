When used throughout this Article, the words \"request,\" \"application,\"\nand \"proposal\" are equivalent.\nB. References to \"permits\" throughout this UDO do not necessarily include\nbuilding permits. A development approval alone does not necessarily\ngrant the holder rights to commence construction or development.\n4.2.3. Vested Rights and Expiration\nPursuant to G.S. \u00a7 160D, a vested right is the right to undertake and\ncomplete the development and use of a property.\nA. Building Permits\n1. As provided in G.S. \u00a7 160D-108(d)(1), building permits expire six\nmonths after issuance, if the permit work has not commenced.\n2.

Approval Criteria\nIn granting a Special Use Permit, the Board of County Commissioners\nshall affirmatively make the following findings of fact based on\nsubstantial, material, and credible evidence presented:\n1. The use or development is located, designed, and proposed to be\noperated SO as to maintain or promote the public health, safety, and\ngeneral welfare\n2. The use or the development complies with all required regulations of\nthis Unified Development Ordinance and all applicable specific\nstandards and regulations\n3. The use or development is located, designed and proposed to be\noperated SO as to maintain or enhance the value of contiguous\nproperty, or that the use or development is a public necessity\n4. The use or development conforms with general plans for the physical\ndevelopment as embodied in this chapter, the Franklin County\nComprehensive Development Plan, or other development policies\nas adopted by the Board of County Commissioners\n5. The location and arrangement of the use on the site, screening,\nbuffering, landscaping, and pedestrian and vehicular ways\nharmonize with adjoining properties and the general area, and\nminimize adverse impacts\n6.

Utilities, schools, fire, police, and other necessary public and private\nfacilities and services will be adequate to handle the proposed use.\nE. If the Board of Commissioners approves a Special Use Permit, it may, as\npart of the terms of such approval, impose any additional reasonable\nconditions and safeguards as may be necessary to insure that the\ncriteria for the granting of such a permit will be complied with and to\nreduce or minimize any potentially injurious effect of the use on\nadjoining properties, the character of the neighborhood, or the health,\nsafety, morals, or general welfare of the community. Where\nappropriate, such conditions may include requirements that street and\nutility rights-of-way be dedicated to the public and that provisions be\nmade for recreational space and facilities.\n4.5.11. Written Interpretation, including Determination of Vested Rights\nA. Purpose\nWhen uncertainty exists and unless otherwise specified, the Planning\nDirector shall be authorized to make all interpretations concerning the\nprovisions of this Ordinance, review of administrative decisions taken in\naccordance with this Ordinance, including determination of existing\nvested rights of property in accordance with G.S. \u00a7 160D-108\nB. Establishment\n1. A zoning vested right is established upon the valid approval, or\nconditional approval, by the Board of Commissioners, Board of\nAdjustment, or the Administrator, as applicable, of a development\napproval.\n2. The approving authority may approve a site-specific development\nplan (also known as a site-specific vesting plan) upon such terms and\nconditions as may reasonably be necessary to protect the public\nhealth, safety, and welfare.\n3. Notwithstanding subsections 1 and 2 (above), approval of a site-\nspecific development plan with the condition that a Variance or\nSpecial Use Permit be obtained shall not confer a zoning vested right\nuntil the corresponding approval is obtained.\n4.5.12.

No change in permitted uses may be authorized by a Variance.\nC. The burden of proof of a Variance lies with the applicant.\nD. Review Criteria\nWhen unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict\nletter of a zoning ordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall vary any of\nthe provisions of the ordinance to the least amount necessary to\nachieve the stated objective upon a showing of all of the following:\n1. Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the\nregulation. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the\nabsence of the Variance, no reasonable use can be made of the\nproperty.\n2. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property,\nsuch as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from\npersonal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions\nthat are common to the neighborhood or general public, may not\nbe the basis for granting a Variance. A Variance shall be granted\nadministratively by the Administrator when necessary and\nappropriate to make a reasonable accommodation under the\nFederal Fair Housing Act for a person with a disability.\n3. The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the\nproperty owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that\ncircumstances exist that may justify the granting of a Variance shall\nnot be regarded as a self-created hardship.\n4. The requested Variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and\nintent of the regulation, such that public safety is secured, and\nsubstantial just is achieved.\nE.

GENERAL\n5.1.1. Purpose\nA. It is in the interest of the health, safety, and public welfare of Franklin\nCounty and its residents that Franklin County establishes the zoning\ndistricts contained herein.\nB. Through these regulations, Franklin County aims to\n1. Provide for consistent, orderly development throughout its\njurisdiction.\n2. Prevent and ameliorate conflicts between incompatible land uses.\n3. Minimize impacts to the natural environment.\n4. Protect local character, aesthetic harmony, and quality-of-life.\n5.1.2. Applicability\nA. These regulations shall apply to all public and private development\nwithin the unincorporated areas of Franklin County.\nB. Bona fide Farms\nProperty used for bona fide farm purposes is exempt from the regulations\ncontained in this UDO.\n5.1.3. Rules of Interpretation\nIn addition to the standards established in this Article, see also Article 1,\nEstablishment and Administration.\n5.2. ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS\n5.2.1. Conventional Zoning Districts\nAlso known as base districts or general use districts, conventional zoning\ndistricts establish the minimum standards of development. These standards\ngovern unless they are paired with an overlay district or conditional zoning\ndistrict. Franklin County establishes the following conventional zoning\ndistricts:\nA. Residential\n1. Agricultural Residential (AR)\nLocated in rural areas with limited public services, the AR district\ncontains a mixture of agricultural, forestry, conservation, and very\nlow-density residential uses. This district seeks to protect the\nFRANKLIN COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-1\n"}, {"page": "79", "text": "ARTICLE 5\nZONING DISTRICTS AND STANDARDS\nenvironment, preserve farmland, and foster the continued\nenjoyment of rural life.\n2. Residential 80 (R-80)\nThis district is typically used to provide water quality protection in the\ndrainage basin area in the water supply watershed. It consists\nprimarily of very low-density residential uses. In other respects, this\ndistrict is also very similar to the Agricultural-Residential district.\n3. Residential 30 (R-30)\nThe R-30 district consists of low-density residential uses. It is generally\nfound where there are no existing water and sewer services or\nplanned extensions of water and sewer services. The County intends\nto protect these areas from the encroachment of medium- and high-\ndensity developments.\n4. Residential 8 (R-8)\nThe R-8 district primarily contains a mix of medium- and high-density\nresidential uses, relative to the rest of the County. Single-family homes\nare the most common use found throughout this district. Open lands\nin this district are suitable for residential development. In instances\nwhere utilities are not readily available, expansion is (or should be)\nplanned. There is minimal non-residential development.\nB. Business\n1. Neighborhood Business (NB)\nThe NB district is established for low impact commercial, retail, and\nservice uses serving the needs of rural crossroads and historical\ncommercial areas of the County. In general, activity is concentrated\n(not dispersed linearly) near thoroughfares or major crossroads and\ndoes not interfere with surrounding residential areas. This district may\ninclude very limited office or institutional uses.\n2. General Business (GB)\nThis district primarily provides for orderly development of roadside\nnonresidential uses, including uses that are more high impact than\nNeighborhood Business and of a commercial nature. This district\ncontains a range of commercial, service, retail, and office, and\nlimited light industrial uses that are accessible to the public and\nsurrounding neighborhoods. Businesses in this district fulfill a wide\nrange of needs for area residents and travelers, while minimizing\nblight and traffic congestion. Adjacency and/or direct thoroughfare\naccess is typical for inclusion in this district. Concentrating these uses\nFRANKLIN COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-2\n"}, {"page": "80", "text": "ARTICLE 5\nZONING DISTRICTS AND STANDARDS\nat nodes is preferable to linear or strip zoning. This district may also\ninclude office or institutional uses.\nC. Industrial\nHeavy Industrial (HI)\nThe HI district is designed to accommodate industrial uses with\nmoderate to high external impacts. Uses permitted by right must\nminimize their emission of smoke, dust, fumes, glare, noise, and\nvibrations. Lands in this district are strategically located to minimize\nconflict with areas housing non-industrial uses, particularly residential\nuses.\n5.2.2. Conditional Zoning Districts\nConditional zoning districts are based on conventional zoning districts but\ninclude site-specific conditions. The County Board of Commissioners\nestablishes conditional zoning districts through the legislative map\namendment (rezoning) process described in Article 4, Review Procedures.\nApplicants voluntarily offer conditions or restrictions to the permitted uses to\nensure that development is compatible with the surrounding land uses.\n5.2.3. Overlay Districts\nOverlay districts apply additional criteria to the underlying conventional\nzoning district. The overlay regulations are more restrictive and supersede\nthe conventional zoning district standards.\nA. Airport Height Overlay (AHO)\nThe Airport Height Overlay District (AHO) is established as an overlay\ndistrict of all general zoning districts in the vicinity of the Franklin County\nAirport. The purpose of the AHO is to protect the airport environs from\nencroachment of incompatible land uses which present hazards to users\nof the airport as well as to persons residing or working in the airport\nvicinity. The additional regulations imposed in the AHO are designed to\nplace additional height restrictions on buildings, structures, and trees.\n1. The Airport Height Overlay (AHO) District is not intended to be utilized\nas a district classification, but as a designation which identifies areas\nsubject to regulations which are supplementary to the regulations of\nthe district to which such designation is attached, appended or\n\"overlaid\". Regulations which apply to areas designated on the\nzoning map as being within such appended or overlaid designation\nmust be determined by joint reference to the regulations of both the\nbasic district classification and the appended or overlay\nclassification.\nFRANKLIN COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-3\n"}, {"page": "81", "text": "ARTICLE 5\nZONING DISTRICTS AND STANDARDS\n2. It is the intent of this section to restrain influences which are averse to\nthe property and safe conduct of aircraft in the vicinity of the Franklin\nCounty Airport, to prevent creation of conditions hazardous to\naircraft operation, to prevent conflict with land development which\nmay result in a loss of life and property, and to encourage\ndevelopment which is compatible with airport use characteristics\nwithin the intent and purpose of zoning. To this end, the AHO\ndesignation, when appended to a basic district classification, is\nintended to coordinate the purpose and intent of this section with\nother regulations duly established by the County of Franklin whose\nprimary intent is to further the purposes set out above.\nB. Highway Overlay (HO)\nThe Highway Overlay (HO) district is established along the US-1, US-64,\nUS-401, NC-39, NC-56, NC-96, NC-98, and NC-561 corridors. This overlay\ndistrict provides for efficient, safe, and scenic transportation for\nautomobiles. Through its standards, it enhances the visibility and\naesthetic character of Franklin County. Properties within this overlay\ninclude all properties abutting these highway rights-of-way, having\ndirect access to these highways, or that are within 150' of the outer\nedge of the right-of-way of these roads.\nC. Lake Royale Overlay (LR)\nThe Lake Royale Overlay (LR) district is established as an overlay district\nfor the parcels located within the Lake Royale development including\nresidential and multi-use lots. The purpose of the LR district is to preserve\nthe character of Lake Royale and the surrounding lake area and to\nensure that new development in the district meets or exceeds the\ncurrent standards.\nD. Water Supply Watershed Protection (W)\nThis overlay district is established to provide water quality protection in\nthe drainage basin area of water supply watersheds within and outside\nof critical areas. This district provides for added securities in\nenvironmentally sensitive areas beyond those established in\nthe\nunderlying conventional zoning district. The boundaries of this district are\nestablished by the state.\n5.3. USE REGULATION\n5.3.1. Interpretation\nA. The Administrator is responsible for interpretation of the Table of\nPermitted Uses.\nFRANKLIN COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-4\n"}, {"page": "82", "text": "ARTICLE 5\nZONING DISTRICTS AND STANDARDS\nB. All primary uses not explicitly listed in the Table of Permitted Uses require\nTier 2 Conditional Zoning.\n5.3.2. Use Classifications\nA. General\n1. Use Groups\nFor the purpose of interpreting the use table of Section 5.3, land uses\nare classified into seven major groupings: \"Residential,\" \"Public and\nCivic,\" \"Commercial,\" \"Industrial,\" \"Agriculture\", \"Utilities and Other\",\n\"Accessory, Temporary, and Home Occupation.\" These broad\ngroupings are referred to as \"use groups.\"\n2. Use Categories\nEach use group is further divided int more specific \"use categories.\"\nUse categories classify land uses and activities based on common\nfunctional, product, or physical characteristics. Characteristics\ninclude the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or\nresidents, how goods or services are sold or delivered and site\nconditions. The use categories are intended to provide a systematic\nbasis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate\nzoning districts. Principal uses are assigned to the use category that\nmost describes the nature of the principal use. The \"characteristics\"\nsubsection of each use category describes the common\ncharacteristics of each principal use.\n3. Developments with Multiple Principal Uses\nWhen all principal uses of a development fall within one use\ncategory, the entire development is assigned to that use category.\nA development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore, and bakery,\nfor example would be classified in the retail sales and service\ncategory because all the development's principal uses are in that\ncategory. When the principal uses of a development fall within\ndifferent use categories, each principal use is classified in the\napplicable category and each use is subject to all applicable\nregulations for that category.\na. When there are 2 or more principal uses that require different\ntypes of permits (zoning, specials use, etc.), then the development\nshall be reviewed using the most restrictive process from among\nthe proposed uses.\nb. Multiple dwellings as principal uses on a single parcel shall be\nprohibited.\n4.

Use of Examples\nThe \"examples\" subsection of each use category lists typical uses\nincluded in the respective use category but is not intended to\nrepresent an exhaustive list. The names of these typical uses are\ngeneric. They are based on common meaning and not on what a\nspecific use may call itself. For example, a use that calls itself\n\"wholesale warehouse\" but sells mostly to consumers is included in\nthe retail sales and service category. This is because the actual\nactivity on the site matches the description of the retail sales and\nservice category.\n6. Similar Use Interpretation Criteria\nWhen a specific use type cannot be classified into a use category or\nappears to fit into two or more use categories, the Planning\nAdministrator is authorized to determine the most appropriate Use\nCategory. The following considerations may be used in making similar\nuse interpretations:\na. The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in\nrelationship to the stated characteristics of each use category\nb. The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment\ndevoted to the activity\nC. Relative amounts of sales from each activity\nd. The customer type for each activity (ex - retail or wholesale)\ne. The relative number of employees in each activity\nf. Hours of operation\ng. Building and site arrangement\nh. Vehicles used with the activity\ni.\nThe manner in which uses are classified by commonly used\nbusiness classification reference sources, such as the North\nAmerican Industrial Classification System (NAICS) or the Land\nBased Classification System (LBCS)\nj. The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the use; and/or\n1 An individual who repairs vehicles owned by other people will, for example, be deemed to be\noperating a prima facie business regardless of whether payment is received for such services.\nFRANKLIN COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n5-6\n"}, {"page": "84", "text": "ARTICLE 5\nZONING DISTRICTS AND STANDARDS\nk.

Conservation Easements\na. Developers have the option of partially offsetting their nitrogen\nand phosphorus loads by providing legal assurance of dedicated\nuse of on-site areas that maintains restrictions of natural\nvegetation upon change or ownership.\nb.

Negotiations must be\namicable and, in the event that negotiations fail, the State will not\nbe able to acquire the property, and NCDMS will not be able to\nimplement the project.\nC. Donating a conservation easement does not mean giving up title\nto the property. The fee-simple title to the land still resides with the\nlandowner. The landowner has the use of the property consistent\nwith the rights specifically reserved in the easement. For example,\nthis might include hunting, hiking and fishing, control of access,\nand the passive enjoyment of the property under the easement.\nFRANKLIN COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA\nUNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\n9-55\n"}, {"page": "358", "text": "ARTICLE 9\nNATURAL RESOURCES\nIn general, the landowner may continue to use the land consistent\nwith the conditions agreed upon in the easement.

The easement does not require or imply any\npublic access to your land.\ne. Conveying a conservation easement on wetlands or stream\nbuffers may increase the value of the remainder of your land.\nBuyers will often pay more for homes near permanently protected\nopen space.

The dry weather monitoring program is an\nintegrated outfall field survey program that incorporates outfall identification, inspection and\ninventory; field screening; and preliminary follow-up field investigation. Additional investigation\nand follow-up may be required to accomplish the elimination of an illicit discharge or improper\ndisposal practice. Furthermore, the field survey program will identify and inspect additional\nstormwater outfalls located in the field.\nWhen precipitation has occurred within 72 hours, outfalls would be located or identified, and\ninspected. Later, during dry weather, the field team would return to any outfall having evidence\nof flow to determine whether the outfall had a dry weather flow, and, for those dry weather\nflows, to conduct field screening.\nWhen precipitation has not occurred within 72 hours, the outfall identification, inspection and\ninventory step will be followed immediately by field screening of any dry weather flows that\nwere observed.\nFIELD SCREENING PARAMETERS AND METHODOLOGY\nThe field screening conducted under the Part 1 permit application included physical\nobservations at the selected field screening points, and grab sampling and field analysis of dry\nweather flows. Where dry weather flows were observed, a second follow-up grab sample was\ncollected and field analyzed within the ensuing 24 hour period.\nField analysis evaluated pH, total chlorine, total soluble copper, phenols, and detergents\n(anionic surfactants) using the CHEMetrics M-1000 Stormwater Discharge Kit, using visual\nevaluation of color metric results using color comparators.\nThe current field screening program incorporates the methodology and parameters used in the\nPart 1 permit application, with some minor modifications. One change is that the current\nmethodology allows outfall identification and inspection to occur during periods that do not\nmeet dry weather criteria, provided there is subsequent follow up during dry weather to\ndetermine whether a dry weather flows exist. In the 'old industrial areas' of the pilot basin, field\ninvestigators have found a number of pipes that terminate at the open channel and that were\nnot identified in the stormwater outfall inventory. Some of these pipes appear to be\nabandoned, while others appeared to be floor drain or yard drain discharges. Where such\npipes exist, performing the identification and investigation work during wet weather can help to\nestablish whether the pipe is currently used to discharge stormwater. Furthermore, during wet\nweather it is easier to identify stormwater outfalls that may be overgrown and obscured by\nvegetation.\nUnknown pipes terminating in stormwater channels are expected to be very rare outside of the\n'old industrial areas' identified in the Part 2 permit application. In most other areas in the\nCounty, it is expected that outfall identification and inspection work will be accomplished during\ndry weather and will coincide with field analytical chemistry testing, as indicated in the Part Il\npermit application.\nAnother modification to the field screening program is the availability of two additional\nmonitoring parameters for field screening. Field investigators will carry CHEMetrics color metric\ntest kits for ammonia and phosphates. Existing data on water quality of urban streams within the\nCounty indicates three sites periodically have some combination of high fecal coliform bacteria,\nFRANKLIN COUNTY\n"}, {"page": "487", "text": "high BOD, or low dissolved oxygen. In addition, ongoing discussions with Public Health\npersonnel indicate that there are numerous failing on-site, non-discharge systems within the\nCounty. In drainage basins where fecal contamination is suspected, the availability of an\nammonia test to the field screening parameters will be useful in identifying and isolating cross-\nconnections, as well as flows originating from failing septic systems. Similarly, the availability of a\nphosphate test will be useful upstream of ponds that have been impacted by heavy growth of\nalgae.\nWhen deemed appropriate for follow-up investigations, field investigators will have the\ncapability of measuring the additional parameters of dissolved oxygen and total dissolved solids\nin the field.\nCopies of the field form for outfall identification and inspection and the field form for flow\ninspection and field analysis are attached. Note that the flow inspection form can also be used,\nwhen appropriate, for investigation of water quality complaints referred to the County by\nCitizen's or other agencies.\nThe screening methodology has been developed into a set of standard operating procedures\n(SOPs). These SOPs provide both general guidance and, where appropriate, detailed, step-by-\nstep instructions for field investigators in order to promote safety, consistency and quality in data\ncollection and field analysis. The procedures cover:\nchecklists,\npersonal protective equipment,\ninstrument calibrations and maintenance,\nequipment maintenance\nobservations and record keeping\nfield analysis, and\npreliminary evaluation of field data.\nThe field SOPs for the dry weather program have been tested and refined. Additional\nrefinements will be made as necessary.\nSCHEDULING\nA schedule has been established for completing the field screening within the permit period.\nThis schedule is based on conducting field screening on approximately 35 outfalls per month. It\nis anticipated that the field screening would be substantially complete by the time a permit\nrenewal application would be submitted.\nThe Part Il application identified priority areas within the County, generally following land use\npatterns, with \"old industrial areas\" having the highest priority, followed by industrial/\ncommercial areas, and then by older residential areas. Initial priority for the field screening\nprogram is based on completing field screening of the pilot basin selected in the Part Il permit\napplication.\nTRAINING\nA training program has been developed for field investigators. Initial training has been provided,\nbut training is an on-going activity within the field screening component.\nClassroom training has been provided on the overall intent of the program, the specific\ncomponents of the outfall identification and inspection, and flow inspection and analysis tasks.\nField investigators have received First Responder training in dealing with hazardous material spills,\nand have had classroom training in field safety, including a review of all MSDS sheets for\nchemicals being used in the program.\nFRANKLIN COUNTY\n"}, {"page": "488", "text": "Hands-on training has been provided in the use and maintenance of field instruments, the use\nof the CHEMetrics field analytical chemistry kits, and the use of field data collection forms. Field\npractice sessions have been conducted using all tests and measurements.\nDetailed standard operating procedures have been developed for the field outfall survey work\ncovering: record keeping; safety and use of personal protective equipment; receipt and use of\nchemicals; use, calibration and maintenance of field analytical equipment; sample collection;\nfield analysis; and dye testing to identify/locate illicit drains. These procedures also provide\nguidance in making a preliminary evaluation of field results to assist timely information collection\nfor follow-up investigation. The SOPs also serve as a training resource for field personnel.\nDATABASES AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS\nMicrosoft Access relational database software has been selected to maintain database\ninformation for the program as an interim measure. A database has been developed for the\nfield screening component containing separate (but related) tables for:\noutfall identification and inspection, and\ndry weather flow inspection and analysis.\nIn addition, a table has been developed for water quality data from urban stream sampling,\nand one is planned for data from wet weather sampling.\nA database on potential sources of contamination has also been developed incorporating\ntables for:\nNCDEQ Incident Management Contamination Sites\nEmergency Management spills reports\nNCDEQ General Stormwater Permits\nNCDEQ NPDES Permits\nNCDEQ Non-discharge Permits\nFire Department Inspection Reports (inspections of industrial and related facilities)\nA third database on potential sources of contamination contains information on hazardous\nsubstances reported pursuant to SARA Title III tier Il reporting requirements.\nThe sources databases will be utilized to identify likely sources of illicit discharge and improper\ndisposal, or of any other source of contamination encountered.\nReports are currently being developed to allow some data analysis and reporting within MS\nAccess. For greater flexibility, data can be exported from MS Access to a MS Excel spreadsheet\nfor analysis.\nA grid system has been developed for tracking field screening and sources databases in MS\nAccess, and is currently being implemented in all the appropriate source database tables.\nOnce the GIS system has been developed for the pilot facilities inventory program, and existing\nfacilities have been inventoried, it is planned that the field screening and sources databases will\nbe imported into the GIS system to facilitate more accurate and more detailed geographic\nevaluation of data.\nFRANKLIN COUNTY\n"}, {"page": "489", "text": "STORMWATER ORDINANCE APPENDIX\nAPPENDIX I\nEXAMPLE LETTER TO\nPREVENT ILLEGAL DISCHARGES\nFRANKLIN COUNTY\n"}, {"page": "490", "text": "STORMWATER ORDINANCE APPENDIX\nDear\n,\nIt appears the above referenced property is in violation of the Franklin County Unified\nDevelopment Ordinance (UDO).

The unpermitted non-\nstormwater flows listed as incidental do not significantly impact water quality. Franklin County has evaluated residential\nand charity car washing and street washing for possible significant water quality impacts.\nStreet washing discharges are addressed under the Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination section of this SWMP. The\nDivision has not required that other non-stormwater flows be specifically controlled by Franklin County.\nWash water associated with car washing that does not contain detergents or does not discharge directly into the local\ndrainage system is considered incidental. However, these types of non-stormwater discharges that do contain\ndetergents have been evaluated by Franklin County to determine whether they may significantly impact water quality.\nThe Franklin County Unified Development Ordinance Article 9.3.9 establishes methods for controlling the introduction of\npollutants and non-stormwater discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the stormwater\ncollection system any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause\nor\ncontribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater.\nThe discharges listed in Table 8 below are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by the Ordinance provided\nthat they do not significantly impact water quality:\nTable 8: Non-Stormwater Discharges\n23\nCELL (1, 1): \nNon-Stormwater Discharge\nCELL (1, 2): \nWater Quality Impacts\nCELL (2, 1): \nWater line and fire hydrant flushing\nCELL (2, 2): \nIncidental\nCELL (3, 1): \nLandscape irrigation\nCELL (3, 2): \nIncidental\nCELL (4, 1): \nDiverted stream flows\nCELL (4, 2): \nIncidental\nCELL (5, 1): \nRising groundwater\nCELL (5, 2): \nIncidental\nCELL (6, 1): \nUncontaminated groundwater infiltration\nCELL (6, 2): \nIncidental\nCELL (7, 1): \nUncontaminated pumped groundwater\nCELL (7, 2): \nIncidental\nCELL (8, 1): \nUncontaminated potable water sources\nCELL (8, 2): \nIncidental\nCELL (9, 1): \nFoundation drains\nCELL (9, 2): \nIncidental\nCELL (10, 1): \nAir conditioning condensate\nCELL (10, 2): \nIncidental\nCELL (11, 1): \nIrrigation waters\nCELL (11, 2): \nIncidental\nCELL (12, 1): \nSprings\nCELL (12, 2): \nIncidental\nCELL (13, 1): \nWater from crawl space pumps\nCELL (13, 2): \nIncidental\nCELL (14, 1): \nFooting drains\nCELL (14, 2): \nIncidental\nCELL (15, 1): \nLawn watering\nCELL (15, 2): \nIncidental\nCELL (16, 1): \nResidential and charity car washing\nCELL (16, 2): \nIncidental\nCELL (17, 1): \nFlows from riparian habitats and wetlands\nCELL (17, 2): \nIncidental\nCELL (18, 1): \nDechlorinated swimming pool discharges\nCELL (18, 2): \nIncidental\nCELL (19, 1): \nStreet wash water\nCELL (19, 2): \nIncidental\nCELL (20, 1): \nFlows from firefighting activities\nCELL (20, 2): \nIncidental\n"}, {"page": "516", "text": "Franklin County Local Program\n6.2 Measurable Tasks for Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination BMPs\nFranklin County will develop, manage, implement, document, report and enforce an Illicit Discharge Detection and\nElimination Program which includes the following illicit discharge detection and elimination BMPs.\nTable 9: Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination BMPs\n24\nCELL (1, 1): \nIllicit Discharge Detection and Elimination BMPs\nCELL (1, 2): \nIllicit Discharge Detection and Elimination BMPs\nCELL (1, 3): \nIllicit Discharge Detection and Elimination BMPs\nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nStormwater Drainage Network Map\nMeasures to develop, update and maintain a stormwater drainage network map including stormwater\nconveyances, flow direction, major outfalls and waters of the United States receiving stormwater discharges.\nCELL (2, 3): \nStormwater Drainage Network Map\nMeasures to develop, update and maintain a stormwater drainage network map including stormwater\nconveyances, flow direction, major outfalls and waters of the United States receiving stormwater discharges.\nCELL (2, 4): \nMeasures to develop, update and maintain a stormwater drainage network map including stormwater\nconveyances, flow direction, major outfalls and waters of the United States receiving stormwater discharges.\nCELL (2, 5): \nMeasures to develop, update and maintain a stormwater drainage network map including stormwater\nconveyances, flow direction, major outfalls and waters of the United States receiving stormwater discharges.\nCELL (3, 1): \nBMP\nCELL (3, 2): \nA\nCELL (3, 3): \nB\nCELL (3, 4): \nC\nCELL (3, 5): \nD\nCELL (4, 1): \nNo.\nCELL (4, 2): \nDescription of BMP\nCELL (4, 3): \nMeasurable Task(s)\nCELL (4, 4): \nSchedule for\nImplementation\nCELL (4, 5): \nAnnual Reporting\nMetric\nCELL (5, 1): \n9.1\nCELL (5, 2): \nCreation and Maintenance of Stormdrain Network Map\nCELL (5, 3): \nCreation and Maintenance of Stormdrain Network Map\nCELL (5, 4): \nCELL (5, 5): \nCELL (6, 1): \nCELL (6, 2): \nThe stormdrain network map of\nall County maintained stormwater\n(only) facilities will be created\nthrough field mapping and GIS\nanalysis of existing data.
