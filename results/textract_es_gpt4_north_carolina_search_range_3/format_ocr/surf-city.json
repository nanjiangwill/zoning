If the applicant and the Town Council do not both explicitly accept these conditions, then the Town Council shall deny the\n"}, {"page": "34", "text": "conditional rezoning request.\nb) Any such conditions should relate to the relationship of the proposed use(s) and design to the impact on town services and\ncapital plans adopted, surrounding properties and population, proposed support or accessory facilities such as parking areas and\ndriveways, pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems, screening and buffer areas, the timing of development, street and right-of-way\nimprovements, water and sewer improvements, stormwater drainage, the provision of or access to open space, and other matters that\nthe participants in the public input meeting, staff, Planning Board, and Town Council find appropriate, or that the petitioner may\npropose. Such conditions to approval of the petition may include, but are not necessarily limited to, right-of-way dedication to the state\nor town, as appropriate, of any rights-of-way or easements for streets, water, sewer, or other public utilities necessary to serve the\nproposed development.\nc) The petitioner shall consider and respond to any such conditions after the Planning Board meeting at least three (3) days prior\nto the staff report for the Town Council being published. If the applicant does not agree with the Planning Board or staffs\nrecommendations of additional conditions, the applicant shall provide written evidence or opinion to support their objection.\nd) If for any reason any condition for approval is found to be illegal or invalid or if the applicant or subsequent owner should fail to\naccept or fulfill any condition following approval, the approval of any site plan or preliminary plat for the district and the conditional\nrezoning shall be null and void and of no effect and proceedings shall be instituted by the Administrator to rezone the property to a\ncontext-appropriate general use district zoning classification. The administrator will use appropriate judgement when recommending\nwhich properties (developed, undeveloped, vacant, half-built, existing non-conformities, etc.) be reassigned to which general use\nzoning districts. The rezoning may result in the creation of non conformities, which shall be the responsibility of the property owner to\nrectify at such time as required by Section 7, Nonconforming Situations\n5) Effect of Approval\na) Once a conditional rezoning is approved, the development and use of the property shall be governed by the established\nstandards for the district, the approved sketch plan for the district, and any additional approved rules, regulations, and conditions, all of\nwhich shall constitute the zoning regulations for the approved district and are binding on the property as an amendment to these\nregulations and to the zoning maps.\nb) Following the approval of the petition for a conditional zoning district, the subject property shall be identified on the zoning\nmaps by the district designation \"CZ\" and a unique, consecutive numerical identifier (for example, the fifteenth conditional zoning\ndistrict established in the town would be labeled \"CZ 15\"). The unique identifier number will reference the approved ordinance and\nsketch plan that established the zoning district.\nc) Since each CZ district represents a newly created zoning district, the approved sketch plan and district standards and\nconditions shall be maintained as an adopted appendix to this Ordinance.\nd) The approved sketch plan, may substitute for an approved master development plan if it is explicitly reviewed and approved as\nsuch during the petition for the CZ district.\ne) No permit shall be issued for any development activity within a conditional zoning district except in accordance with the\napproved petition and site plan or preliminary plat (as appropriate) for the district.\nf) Any violation of the approved site plan or any rules, regulations and conditions for the district shall be treated the same as any\nother violation of this section and shall be subject to the same remedies and penalties as any such violation.\n6) Alterations to Approval\na) Changes to an approved conditional zoning district or to the standards, uses, requirements, or conditions attached to the\napproved conditional zoning district shall be treated the same as amendments to this Ordinance or to the zoning maps and shall be\nprocessed as a Conditional Rezoning, unless possible to modify as an Administrative Adjustment. Minor changes may be modified as\nan Administrative Adjustment. The below list represents examples of both minor and major changes.\ni)\nMinor changes such as those listed below would require staff level approval.\n1. Modifications in building placement, provided the placement complies with the setbacks of the corresponding base zoning,\nand does not decrease the setbacks agreed to and approved during the conditional rezoning process by more than 10%;\n2. Increases to building size and height not to exceed 10% provided all other applicable standards of this Ordinance are met;\n3. Modifications to structure floor plans;\n4. Modifications to the driveway locations not exceeding 10% of the length of the subject property line, or as required by the\nNorth Carolina Department of Transportation; and\n5. Modifications to the proportion of housing type not to exceed 10%.\nii) Major changes such as those listed below will require reapproval by Council.\n1. Land area being added or removed from the Conditional District;\n2. Modification of special performance criteria, design standards, or other requirements specified by the original approval;\n3. A change in land use or development type;\n4. When there is introduction of a new vehicular access point to an existing street, road or thoroughfare not previously\ndesignated for access;\n5. When there is an increase in the total number of residential dwelling units greater than 5%. This includes both single family\nhomes and multi family homes;\n6. When the total floor area of a development is increased more than 10% beyond the total floor area last approved by Town\n"}, {"page": "35", "text": "Council. Changes of less than 10% may be approved by the Administrator.\n7) Review of Approval of a Conditional Zoning District\na) It is intended that property shall be reclassified to a conditional zoning district only in the event of firm plans to develop the\nproperty. Therefore, no sooner than three (3) years after the date of approval of the petition, the Administrator shall examine the\nprogress made toward developing the property in accordance with the approved conditional zoning district and any standards, uses,\nrequirements, or conditions attached to the approval.\nb) If the Administrator determines that progress has not been made in accordance with the approved petition and conditions, the\nAdministrator shall begin proceedings to rezone the property(ies) to its previous zoning classification or to another district(s), as\nappropriate.\nc) The Administrator shall continue to monitor conditional zoning districts in this manner at least every two (2) years, until they\nare determined to be substantially built out (90% or more of units, square feet, or land built out).\n(Ord.

No. 2004-38, 11-3-04; Ord. 2020-10, 12-1-20)\nSECTION 5.0 SUPPLEMENTAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS\n5.1 Off-street parking and loading.\n5.1.1 Off-street parking standards.\na) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide off-street parking standards that will alleviate congestion in the streets and\nallow for the efficient storage of motor vehicles while, concurrently, reducing any adverse environmental impacts to the urban area. By\nreducing glare, noise levels and air pollution to occupants and residents of adjoining properties, and by controlling storm water\ndrainage and soil erosion, these standards will generally contribute to the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizenry and\nwill create a more aesthetically pleasing environment in the Town of Surf City.\nb) Parking must be provided for new construction of principal building and certain instances of alterations to existing sites and\nconversions of buildings from one district use to occupancy to another district or district use. No lands or buildings, or any part thereof,\nshall be occupied or used for any purpose, nor shall any building permit be approved by the town planner, until the owner of the real\nestate involved provides off-street motor vehicle parking and driveways in accordance with the minimum requirements set forth herein\nand in the section for truck loading (section 5.1.2), off-street parking spaces (section 5.1.3), off-street parking design (section 5.1.4)\nand driveways (section 5.1.5). No additional parking shall be required for the issuance of a building permit under section 7.3\n(Reconstruction of nonconforming uses). When an existing building or use on the same lot is altered or expanded to increase its gross\nfloor area by fifty (50) percent or more, or whenever a conversion of buildings from any district use to another district use required\nadditional off-street parking, all parking lot design requirements of this section shall be met. Other off-street parking facilities for which\na plan is required under section 5.13 shall meet only those standards which the town planner or his designee determine to be\nnecessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare; except that this waiver shall not apply to expansions that occur within two (2)\nyears of each other as noted by the dates the building permits were issued and that together would otherwise require all off-street\nparking improvements to be made. (See section 5.7 for application of the landscaping requirements to building or use expansions.)\nc) Vehicle movement. All off-street parking areas, except those serving a single or two- family housing unit, shall be arranged so\nthat ingress and egress is by the forward motion of the vehicle.\nd) Location on other property. If the required automobile parking space cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot as the\nprincipal use, it may be provided on a lot within two (2) town blocks or six hundred fifty (650) feet (whichever is greater) of the principal\nuse structure. This parking area shall be held in fee simple by the owner of the use served, or in another manner that assures\ncontinued availability for required parking, provided the form of tenure shall be approved by the town attorney before such use is\nissued a certificate of occupancy.\ne) Nonresidential off-street parking in residential district. Such parking may be provided in residential districts upon issuance of a\nspecial use permit as required in section 8.9.\nf) Parking space in private driveways. Private driveways serving detached single and two-family housing units of sufficient size to\nmeet the requirements of this section shall be considered as providing the required off-street parking space.\ng) Safety barriers. All service stations, parking lots, display or sales areas for motor vehicles of any type shall erect a safety barrier\ninside the street yard exclusive of driveway entrances. Such barriers shall be at least seven (7) inches in height and six (6) inches in\nwidth, and shall be approved construction and otherwise designed to prohibit any overhang of motor vehicles in any public right-of-\nway.\nh) Combination of parking spaces on a lot. Required parking spaces for any number of separate buildings or uses may be\ncombined in one (1) parking lot, but the required spaces assigned to one use may not be assigned to another use if the uses normally\noperate at the same time.\ni) Exception to off-street parking standards\n1) C-1 central business district. The provisions of subsection (b) shall not apply to the central business district, however, when\nsuch spaces are provided they shall be designed in accordance with the minimum design requirements of this section.\nj) Use of parking facilities\n1) Limitations on use of required parking facilities.\na. Permitted use. Required parking spaces approved in accordance with this chapter shall only be used for the intermittent\nparking of licensed motor vehicles of employees, occupants, owners, tenants or customers utilizing the building served by said\nrequired parking space.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCON\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (1, 6): \nCELL (1, 7): \nCELL (1, 8): \nCELL (2, 1): \nR-15\nCELL (2, 2): \n15,000\nCELL (2, 3): \n50\nCELL (2, 4): \n15\nCELL (2, 5): \n10\nCELL (2, 6): \n15\nCELL (2, 7): \n20\nCELL (2, 8): \n40%\nCELL (3, 1): \nSF\nCELL (3, 2): \n5,000\nCELL (3, 3): \n50\nCELL (3, 4): \n15\nCELL (3, 5): \n7.5\nCELL (3, 6): \n10\nCELL (3, 7): \n20\nCELL (3, 8): \n40%\nCELL (4, 1): \nMFC\nCELL (4, 2): \n2ac\nCELL (4, 3): \n50\nCELL (4, 4): \n25\nCELL (4, 5): \n10\nCELL (4, 6): \n10\nCELL (4, 7): \n20\nCELL (4, 8): \n40%\n"}, {"page": "44", "text": "b.

Loading facilities shall be\nconstructed so that all maneuvering will take place entirely within the property lines of the facility. Interior off-street loading spaces may\nbe located inside the structure it serves provided the other provisions of this section, such as size and access, are met.\nb) Size. Unless otherwise specified, an off-street loading space shall be twelve (12) feet in width by forty-five (45) feet in length,\nexclusive of aisles and maneuvering space, and shall have a vertical clearance of at least fifteen (15) feet.\nc) Surfacing. All off-street loading spaces shall be paved with asphalt or concrete material, or with alternative paving material (e.g.,\nconcrete pavers, brick, \"turfstone\" or similar material) determined to exhibit equivalent wear resistance and load bearing\ncharacteristics as asphalt or concrete, of a type and thickness, capable of carrying, without damage, the heaviest vehicle loads\nreasonably anticipated on such surface. Loading spaces associated with parking facilities which are exempted from the paving\nrequirements of this ordinance (see section 5.1.4(a)(4)) shall likewise be exempted from these paving requirements.\nd) Repair and service. No motor vehicle repair work or service of any kind shall be permitted in conjunction with loading facilities,\nexcept emergency repair service necessary to relocate a vehicle to a normal repair facility.\ne) Utilization. Off-street loading space shall not be used to satisfy the space requirements for off-street parking facilities or portions\nthereof, nor vice versa.\nf) Similar use applicable. The town planner shall apply the off-street loading requirements for the most similar use listed herein to\nan unspecified use.\ng) Access.

Parking lot design shall comply with the vision clearance provisions set forth in the section 5.3 (visibility at\nintersection in residential districts) herein.\n(4) All new, enlarged or repainted parking facilities shall comply with the following:\na. Each parking space shall be a minimum of nine feet by eighteen [feet] (9' X 18') with a minimum drive aisle of twenty-two (22)\nfeet for two-way traffic. Where one-way traffic is allowed and the angle of parking stalls is forty-five degrees (45\u00b0) or less the drive aisle\nmay be reduced to no less than fourteen (14) feet.\nb. Parking spaces for small vehicles may be provided in lieu of standard parking spaces for parking decks and for residential,\nnon-medical office, warehousing, and industrial uses. However, no more than twenty-five (25) percent of the total number of required\nparking spaces shall be small vehicle spaces. The minimum width of a small vehicle space shall be eight (8) feet and its minimum\nlength shall be sixteen (16) feet. Small vehicle parking spaces shall be designated by proper signage alerting drivers to the limitation of\nspace size. Small vehicle parking spaces are not permitted in conjunction with other uses than those listed above.\nC.

All parking facilities containing between five (5) and twenty-four (24) spaces or stalls, inclusive, may be paved or surfaced\nwith a stone material; provided that all spaces set aside for parking by handicapped persons must comply with all applicable codes,\nordinances and technical requirements, and paved access to a handicapped-accessible entrance to the principal building must be\nprovided.\ng. Alternative parking surfaces. The town may require that parking proposed in excess of the minimum standard be stabilized\ngrass parking or an alternative permeable surface appropriate to the specific site. Alternative parking surfaces shall be adequately\nmaintained to provide a stable parking surface.\nh. Shared parking studies. Multi-purpose developments may perform parking studies proposing a reduction in the amount of\nrequired parking. The requested reduction in required parking may be justified by the difference in peak hour demand for the different\nuses (i.e., a movie theater and an office building may propose to share parking spaces due to their different peak hour demand for\nparking). The provision of transit service and transportation demand measures such as ride sharing, van pooling, and non-peak hour\nshift changes may also be studied as factors that may reduce the amount of required parking.\ni. Drainage. No storm water drainage from a parking facility shall cross the surface of any adjoining public right-of-way to reach\na storm water drainage system.\n5.1.5 Driveways.\na) Improvement to existing residential driveways will not be required to submit engineered plans if pervious materials are used.

Nonconforming lots.\nWhen a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations (other than the area or width requirements) applicable\nto the district in which the lot is located, such a use may be made as of right. Otherwise, the nonconforming lot may be used only in\naccordance with a special use permit issued by the board of adjustment. The board shall issue such a permit if it finds that 1) the\nproposed use is one permitted by the regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located, and 2) the property can be\ndeveloped as proposed without any significant negative impact on the surrounding property or the public health, safety, or welfare. In\nissuing the permit authorized by this paragraph, the board may allow deviations from applicable dimensional requirements (such as\nsetback lines and yard size minimums) if it finds that no reasonable use of the property can be made without such deviations.\n(Ord. No. 2020-10, 12-1-20)\n7.3 Extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations.\n1) Except as specifically provided in this subsection, it shall be unlawful for any person to engage in any activity that causes an\nincrease in the extent of non-conformity of a nonconforming situation.\n2) Subject to paragraph (4) of this subsection, a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed\nbuilding that, when the use was made nonconforming by this ordinance, was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such\nuse. However, subject to subsection 7.6 of this section (authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain\ncircumstances), a non-conforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building.\n3) Subject to subsection 7.6 of this section (authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances), a\nnonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became\nnonconforming.\n4) The volume, intensity, or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the\nequipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes\namount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other paragraphs of this subsection\noccur.\n5) Physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land are unlawful if they result in:\na) An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use;\nb) Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as yard requirements, height limitations, or density\nrequirements; or\nc) The enclosures of previously unenclosed areas, even though those areas were previously used in connection with the\nnonconforming activity. An area is unenclosed unless at least seventy-five (75) percent of the perimeter of the area is marked by a\npermanently constructed wall or fence.\n6) Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged. Major\nrenovation, i.e., work estimated to cost more than twenty (20) percent of the appraised replacement value of the structure to be\nrenovated (and not required by the partial or total destruction of a structure see paragraph (8)), may be done pursuant to a special use\npermit issued by the board of adjustment. The board of adjustment shall issue such a permit if it finds that the work will not result in a\nviolation of any other paragraphs of this subsection (particularly paragraph (5)) or make the property more incompatible with the\nsurrounding neighborhood.\n7) Notwithstanding paragraph five (5), any structure used for single-family residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming\nuse may be replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so long as the replacement does not create new non-conformities with\nrespect to yard size and setback requirements. In particular, a manufactured home may be replaced with a larger manufactured home,\nand a \"single-wide\" manufactured home may be replaced with a \"double-wide.\" This paragraph is subject to the limitations stated in\nsubsection 7.5 on abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations.\n8) A structure that is conforming in any respect or a structure that is used in a nonconforming manner may be reconstructed or\nreplaced if partially or totally destroyed, subject to the following restrictions:\na) Such structure may be restored and occupancy or use allowed if that structure is destroyed or damaged. In order to rebuild a\nnonconforming structure the permits for repairs or rebuilding must be issued within 12 months.\nb) The total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use may not be increased, except that a larger, single-family residential\nstructure may be constructed in place of a smaller one and a larger manufactured home intended for residential use may replace a\nsmaller one;\nc) The reconstructed building may not be more nonconforming with respect to dimensional restrictions such as yard requirements,\nheight limitations, or density requirements, and such dimensional nonconformity's must be eliminated if that can reasonably be\naccomplished without unduly burdening the reconstruction process or limiting the right to continue the nonconforming use of such\nbuilding;\nd) The reconstructed building may not enclose areas that were previously unenclosed, even though those areas were used in\nconnection with the nonconforming activity. An area is unenclosed unless at least seventy-five (75) percent or more of the perimeter of\nthe area is marked by a permanently constructed wall or fence.\n9) Manufactured homes in nonconforming manufactured home parks may not be increased in number. Manufactured homes, when\nnonconforming, may not be substituted for conforming types of dwelling units or other nonconforming dwelling units.\n(Ord. No. 2007-31, 6-5-07; Ord.

Thereafter, the property may not revert to a nonconforming use.\n2) A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use only in accordance with a special use permit issued by the\nboard of adjustment. The board shall issue such a permit if it finds that the proposed use will be more compatible with the surrounding\nneighborhood than the use in operation at the time the permit is applied for. If a nonconforming use is changed to any use other than a\nconforming use without obtaining a special use permit pursuant to this paragraph, that change shall constitute a discontinuance of the\nnonconforming use, with consequences as stated in subsection 7.5.\n3) If a nonconforming use and a conforming use, or any combination of conforming and nonconforming uses, or any combination of\nnonconforming uses exist on one lot, the use made of the property may be changed substantially (except to a conforming use), only in\naccordance with special use permit issued by the board of adjustment. The board shall issue such a permit if it finds that the proposed\nuse will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use or combination of uses in operation at the time the permit\nis applied for.\n(Ord. No. 2020-10, 12-1-20)\n7.5 Abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations.\n1) When a nonconforming use is 1) discontinued for a consecutive period of twelve (12) months, or 2) discontinued for any period\nof time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use, the property involved may thereafter be used only for\nconforming purposes, except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection.\n2) The board of adjustment may issue a special use permit to allow a nonconforming use that has been discontinued for more than\ntwelve (12) months to be reinstated if it finds that 1) the nonconforming use has been discontinued for less than two (2) years, and 2)\nthe discontinuance resulted from factors that, for all practical purposes, were beyond the control of the person maintaining the\nnonconforming use.\n3) If the principal activity on property where a nonconforming use exists is 1) discontinued for a consecutive period of twelve (12)\nmonths, or 2) discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity, then the property may thereafter\nbe used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located, unless the board of\nadjustment issues a special use permit to allow the property to be used (for a conforming purpose) without correcting the\nnonconforming situation. The board shall issue such a permit if it finds that 1) the nonconforming situation cannot be corrected without\nundue hardship or expense, and 2) the nonconforming situation is of a minor nature that does not adversely affect the surrounding\nproperty or the general public to any significant extent.\n4) For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this subsection, all of the\nbuildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one\n(1) apartment in a nonconforming apartment building or one (1) space in a nonconforming manufactured home park as whole is\ncontinuously maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a\nnonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter. And so, if a manufactured home is used as\na nonconforming use on a residential lot where a conforming residential structure also, is located, removal of that manufactured home\nfor twelve (12) months terminates the right to replace it.\n5) When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this ordinance is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this\nordinance, the twelve (12) month period, for purposes of this subsection, begins to run at the effective date of the ordinance.\n(Ord. 2020-10, 12-1-20)\n7.6 Completion of nonconforming projects.\nThe completion or erection of any nonconforming project may be completed provided all construction is done pursuant to a valid\nbuilding permit issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance.\n(Ord.

Subject to high standards of planning and design, certain\nproperty uses may be allowed in several districts where these uses would not otherwise be acceptable. By means of controls\nexercised through the special use permit procedures, property uses which would otherwise be undesirable in certain districts can be\ndeveloped to minimize any adverse effects they might have on surrounding properties.\n8.1.2 General. Special use permits may be issued by the town council for those uses of land and buildings requiring a special use\npermit as listed in each zoning district classification. Special use permits may be granted by the town council after planning board\nreview and recommendations, and after an evidentiary hearing. Statutory quasi-judicial procedures in accordance with G.S. 160D-406\nshall be followed for the issuance or denial of any proposed special use permit.\n8.1.3 Application.
