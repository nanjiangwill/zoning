The purpose of this Article is to protect the rights of property owners who lawfully\nestablished and continually maintained a use, lot, site, or structure prior to this\nOrdinance which fails to comply with one or more standards of this Ordinance.\nSECTION 6.2: GENERALLY\nA. APPLICABILITY\n1. This Article applies to any nonconformity. There are four categories of\nnonconformities as defined below:\na. Nonconforming Lot: A lot, parcel, or tract of land lawfully established prior to\nthe adoption or amendment of the Zoning Ordinance that fails to meet all\ncurrent requirements for area, width, and/or configuration of the zoning\ndistrict in which it is located. A lot of record reduced to less than the required\narea, width, and/or setback dimensions of the zoning district in which it is\nlocated as the result of a condemnation or purchase by a Local, County, State,\nor Federal Government Agency becomes a nonconforming lot of record.\nb. Nonconforming Site Feature: A feature, or absence of a feature, of a\ndevelopment site that was lawfully established before the adoption or\namendment of the Zoning Ordinance.\nC. Nonconforming Structure: A structure lawfully established before the\nadoption or amendment of the Zoning Ordinance that no longer complies with\nall regulations applicable to the zoning district in which the structure is\nlocated.\nd. Nonconforming Use: A nonconforming situation that occurs when property is\nused for a purpose or in a manner made unlawful by the use regulations\napplicable for the district in which the property is located. The term also refers\nto the activity that constitutes the use made of the property. The term includes\nany pre-existing structure, object of natural growth, or use of land or building\nthat is inconsistent with the provisions of this Ordinance or an amendment\nthereto.\n2. Any use or structure not established legally at the time, it shall be considered a\nviolation of this Ordinance and is not a nonconformity.\nB. CONTINUATION OF NONCONFORMITIES\n1. On or after the effective date of this Ordinance, a nonconformity that was lawfully\noperated, established, or commenced in accordance with the provisions of all\nordinances, statutes, or regulations in effect at that time may continue subject to\nthis Article.\n2. For the purpose of determining whether a right to continue nonconformity is lost\npursuant to this subsection, all of the structures, activities and operations\nmaintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole.

EXPANSION OR ENLARGEMENT\n1. A nonconforming use may be extended throughout the existing structure.\n2. A nonconforming use may not expand beyond the existing structure to include an\naddition to the existing structure, an additional structure, or outside of the\nstructure without a Special Use Permit. (See Section 6.6)\n3. Structure remodeling, repairs, upgrading equipment, or changes in processes may\noccur provided the existing nonconforming use does not change or expand, and\nno violation of this Ordinance occurs.\n4. Nonconforming uses of open land may not be extended to cover more area than\nwas occupied by the use when it became nonconforming. A use involving\nremoval of natural material from the lot (e.g., a sand pit) may be expanded to the\nboundaries outlined by their original permit from the State of North Carolina.\n5. The number of spaces within a nonconforming manufactured home park may not\nbe increased except by a Special Use Permit. Manufactured homes within a\nnonconforming manufactured home park may be replaced with a single-family\nstick built or manufactured home with the appropriate permits; replacement with\nan RV or attached multi-family shall be treated as a new use and requires the\nnecessary approvals.\n6. A nonconforming manufactured home park may be permitted to a single\nexpansion if the expansion complies with the following standards:\na. The number of spaces may only increase by ten (10) percent of the number of\nspaces established on December 15th, 2003; or the date which established\nnonconforming status. The spaces must not have been unoccupied for more\nthan two (2) years since the date establishing nonconforming status.\nb. The expansion must conform to the standards listed in this Ordinance.\nB. CHANGE OF USE\n1. Any nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use provided the site\nshall comply with any applicable Additional Requirement Standards in Article 9\n(Use Standards), and all other development standards in Article 10 (Development\nStandards) for the use.\nC. ABANDONMENT AND TERMINATION OF NONCONFORMITIES\n1. If the nonconforming use is abandoned or terminated for twenty-four (24)\nconsecutive months, only conforming uses will be permitted and must comply\nwith the previsions of this Ordinance.\n2. Any of the following specific acts immediately terminates nonconformity:\na. Changing to a conforming use;\nb.

Nonconforming structures may be occupied, operated and maintained in a state of\ngood repair subject to all limitations in this Section and the provisions of\nSubsection 6.5.D (Exception for Repairs Pursuant to Public Order), but no\nnonconforming structure may be enlarged or extended except as allowed by this\nSection.\nB. REPLACEMENT OF NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES\n1. For all of the following, the burden of proof shall be on the applicant to provide\nlegally binding evidence of the nonconforming status of the structure.\n2.

A property owner or an applicant may apply to replace a nonconforming structure\nby a Special Use Permit provided the structure has not been absent for more than\ntwo (2) years.\n4. A nonconforming structure destroyed by an Act of God may be replaced by right\nwith permits.\n5. Manufactured homes within a nonconforming manufactured home park may be\nreplaced with the appropriate permits.\n6. A nonconforming sign may have the sign face replaced provided the area of the\nsign face is not increase and it does not increase the degree of nonconformity.\nC. ENLARGEMENT AND EXPANSION OF NONCONFORMING\nSTRUCTURES\n1. The enlargement or expansion of a nonconforming structure is permitted provided\nit does not increase the degree of nonconformity. For example, a back porch or\naddition could be added when the non-conformity is failing to meet the front\nsetback.\n2. While the replacement of manufactured home within a manufactured home park\nspace is considered a replacement, the increase in the number of spaces shall\nconstitute an expansion and require a Special Use Permit if the use is permitted in\nthe Zoning District.\nD.

Nothing in this Section will be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration\nof a structure to a safe condition in accordance with an order of a public official\ncharged with protecting the public safety, provided the restoration is not\notherwise in violation of the various provisions of this Section prohibiting the\nrepair, restoration of partially damaged or destroyed structures.\n6-3\n"}, {"page": "105", "text": "SECTION 6.2: BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT AND NONCONFORMITIES\nA.

A Planted Buffer may be utilized along property lines, or along\nportions of property lines, where insufficient vegetation exists to meet\nthe standards for plantings for the type of required buffer, or where\nvegetation will be removed as part of the development process.\niii. Barrier Buffer\nA. A Barrier Buffer may be utilized, at the option of the property owner,\nalong property lines where a Planted Buffer would otherwise be\nrequired, and where either insufficient width exists to provide the\nplanted buffer, or an additional barrier is desired.\n2. Buffer Width Standards\na. The width standards shown in Table 10-2 shall apply to the various buffer\nyard types, based on the selected option.\n3. Buffer Planting Standards\na.

All\ninstalled vegetation shall meet the requirements of Section 10.6.B (Plant\nMaterial Standards).\n4. Barrier Standards\na. Materials\ni. Barriers must be opaque and can include pre-treated wood fences, solid\nvinyl fences, brick walls or berms. The finished side of the fence or wall\nshall face the adjacent property.
