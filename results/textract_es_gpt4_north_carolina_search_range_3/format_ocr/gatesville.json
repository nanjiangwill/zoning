For example, a large tract may be developed with a mix of\nsingle-family and multi-family housing, with part of the site also devoted to commercial and office uses.\nThe CZD allows for greater flexibility in dimensional standards (such as lot sizes and setbacks) upon\napproval of an overall master plan for the entire development. The district does not require a rigid\nseparation of different land uses. Uses are limited to the uses identified in Article VII Schedule of District\nRegulations. All of the site-specific standards and conditions, including a site plan, are incorporated into\nthe zoning district regulations for the CZD. Approval of the site plan will establish all zoning\nrequirements for the subject property. A large site CZD district shall not be less than three (3) acres in\narea.\nThis negotiated approach to a legislative decision allows maximum flexibility to tailor regulations to a\nparticular site and project. But it also has great potential for abuse - both in terms of impacts on\nindividual landowners seeking approval and their neighbors and on the public interests zoning is\nsupposed to promote. Thus, special restrictions have been placed on conditional zoning. Conditional\nZoning Districts may only occur at the owner's request and cannot be imposed without the owner's\nagreement. The individual conditions and site-specific standards that can be imposed are limited to\nthose that are needed to bring a project into compliance with county ordinances and adopted plans and\nto those addressing the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by use of the site. The Town must\nassure that all of the factors defining reasonable spot zoning are fully considered and that the public\nhearing record reflects that consideration.\nConditional zoning provides important opportunities to carefully tailor regulations to address the\ninterest of the landowner, the neighbors, and the public. The Town may use conditional zoning when it\nconcludes that a particular project should be approved but that the standards in the comparable\nconventional zoning district(s) are insufficient to protect neighbors or public interests (perhaps because\nthe conventional zoning allows other uses not suitable for the site or dimensional standards inadequate\nto preserve the neighborhood). Conditional zoning often allows a developer to proceed with a project in\na way that addresses site-specific concerns of neighbors and the Town of Gatesville.

A right vested as provided in this subsection shall\nterminate at the end of the applicable vesting period which respect to buildings and\nuses for which no valid building permit applications have been filed. Upon issuance of a\nbuilding permit, the provisions of NCGS 160D-1110 and 160D-1113 shall apply, except\nthat the permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the running of time while a\nvested right under this section exists.\nCELL (3, 1): \n(3)\nCELL (3, 2): \nRequirements for Site-Specific Vesting Plans. For the purposes of this section, a \"site-\nspecific vesting plan\" means a plan submitted to the Town describing with reasonable\ncertainty the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of property. The\nplan may be in the form of, but not be limited to, any of the following plans or\napprovals: a planned unit development plan, a subdivision plat, a site plan, a preliminary\nor general development plan, a special use permit, a conditional zoning, or any other\ndevelopment approval as may be used by the Town. Unless otherwise expressly\nprovided by the Town, the plan shall include the approximate boundaries of the site;\nsignificant topographical and other natural features effecting development of the site;\nthe approximate location on the site of the proposed buildings, structures, and other\nimprovements; the approximate dimensions, including height, of the proposed buildings\nand other structures; and the approximate location of all existing and proposed\ninfrastructure on the site, including water, sewer, roads, and pedestrian walkways. The\nTown uses existing development approvals, such as a preliminary plat, a special use\npermit, or a conditional zoning, to approve a site-specific vesting plan. A variance shall\nnot constitute a \"site specific vesting plan,\" and approval of a site-specific vesting plan\nwith the condition that a variance be obtained shall not confer a vested right unless and\nuntil the necessary variance is obtained. If a sketch plan or other document fails to\n"}, {"page": "88", "text": "Town of Gatesville\nZoning Ordinance\ndescribe with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specified parcel or\nparcels of property, it may not constitute a site-specific vesting plan.\n(4)\nProcess for Approval and Amendment of Site-Specific Vesting Plans. If a site-specific\nvesting plan is based on an approval required by a local development regulation, the\nTown shall provide whatever notice and hearing is required for that underlying\napproval. If the duration of the underlying approval is less than two years, that shall not\naffect the duration of the site-specific vesting established by this subsection. If the site-\nspecific vesting plan is not based on such an approval, a legislative hearing with notice\nas required by NCGS 160D-602 shall be held. The Town may approve a site-specific\nvesting plan upon such terms and conditions as may reasonably be necessary to protect\nthe public health, safety, and welfare. Such conditional approval shall result in a vested,\nalthough failure to abide by such terms and conditions will result in a forfeiture of\nvested rights. The Town shall not require a landowner to waive vested rights as\na\ncondition of developmental approval. A site-specific vesting plan shall be deemed\napproved upon the effective date of the Town's decision approving the plan or such\nother date as determined by the Town Council upon approval. An approved site-specific\nvesting plan and its conditions may be amended with the approval of the owner and the\nTown as follows: Any substantial modification must be reviewed and approved in the\nsame manner as the original approval; minor modifications may be approved by staff,\nif\nsuch are defined and authorized by local regulation.\n(D)\nSeven Years - Multi-Phase Developments\nA multi-phased development shall be vested for the entire development with the Unified Development\nOrdinance in place at the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased\ndevelopment. This right shall remain vested for a period of seven years from the time a site plan\napproval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased development. For the purposes of this\nsubsection, \"multi-phased development\" means a development containing 100 acres of more that (i) is\nsubmitted for site plan approval for construction to occur in more than one phase and (ii) is subject to a\nmaster development plan with committed elements, including a requirement to offer land for public use\nas a condition of its master development plan approval.\n(E)\nIndefinite - Development Agreements\nA vested right of reasonable duration may be specified in a development agreement approved under\nArticle XVI of this Ordinance.\nSECTION 15.05: CONTINUING REVIEW\nFollowing approval or conditional approval of a statutory vested right, the Town may make subsequent\nreviews and require approvals by the Town to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the\noriginal approval, provided that such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original\napproval. The Town may revoke the original approval for failure to comply with applicable terms and\nconditions of the original approval or the applicable local development regulations.\n11/1/2023\nPage 79\n"}, {"page": "89", "text": "Zoning Ordinance\nTown of Gatesville\nSECTION 15.05: EXCEPTIONS\nA vested right, once established as provided for by Section 15.04, precludes any zoning action by a local\ngovernment that would change, alter, impair prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or\nuse of the property as set forth in an approved vested right, except:\nThe establishment of a vested right under subsection 15.05(D), shall not preclude the application of\noverlay zoning or other development regulation that imposes additional requirements but does not\naffect the allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations that are general in nature and\nare applicable to all property subject to development regulation by the Town including, but not limited\nto, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes.
