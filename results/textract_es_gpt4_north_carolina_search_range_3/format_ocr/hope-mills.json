Before the board may grant any\nVariance, the board must find that all of the following conditions exist for an individual case:\nA. There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of\nproperty in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other\nlands or structures in the same district.\nB. Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the applicant any special privileges that\nare denied to other residents in the district in which the property is located.\nC. The literal interpretation of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of\nrights commonly enjoyed by other residents of the district in which the property is located.\nD. The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this Ordinance and\nwill not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare.\nE. The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant.\nF. The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the\nland, building or structure.\nG. The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, building or structure which is not\npermitted by right or by special exception in the district involved and will not constitute any\nchange in district boundaries.\nH. The existence of a nonconforming use of neighboring land, buildings or structures in the\nsame district or of permitted or nonconforming uses in other district does not constitute a\nreason for approval of the requested variance.\nIn granting a variance, the board may attach and the record shall reflect such conditions\nregarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it\nmay deem advisable. The record shall also state in detail any exceptional difficulty or\nunnecessary hardship upon which the appeal was based and which the board finds to exist.\nAny variance granted becomes null and void if not exercised within the time specified in\nsuch approvals, or if no date is specified, within one calendar year from the date of such\napproval. The Board of Adjustment is not authorized to grant variances to a Special Use\nPermit or to a Conditional Use Permit allowed in Conditional Use Districts or to the\nspecific conditions or other performance criteria imposed upon such uses.\nIf the board denies the variance request, it shall enter the reason for its action in the\nminutes of the meeting at which the action is taken. In the event of a denial, the Board of\nAdjustment shall not consider re-submission of the application for the same variance\nrequest on the same property without a substantial material change concerning the\nproperty and the application.\nTown of Hope Mills BOA Variance\nPage 2 of 5\nRevised: 01-22-2013\n"}, {"page": "195", "text": "TOWN OF HOPE MILLS BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT\nLOCATION OF PROPERTY:\nOWNER:\nADDRESS:\nZIP CODE:\nTELEPHONE: HOME\nWORK\nAGENT:\nADDRESS:\nTELEPHONE: HOME\nWORK\nE-MAIL:\nAPPLICATION FOR A VARIANCE\nAs required by the Zoning Ordinance\nA.\nParcel Identification Number (PIN #) of subject property:\n(also known as Tax ID Number or Property Tax ID)\nB.\nAcreage:\nFrontage:\nDepth:\nC.\nWater Provider:\nD.\nSeptage Provider:\nE.\nDeed Book\n, Page(s)\n, Cumberland County\nRegistry.
