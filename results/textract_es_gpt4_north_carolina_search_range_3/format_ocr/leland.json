Some land uses are of such a\nnature or scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediately surrounding area and on the\nentire community, which cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district standards. There are\nalso circumstances in which a general district designation allowing such a use by right would not be\nappropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could, if properly planned, be appropriate\nfor the property consistent with the objectives of these regulations, the adopted land use plan and other\nlong range plans. The review process established in this division provides for the accommodation of such\nuses by a reclassification of property into a conditional zoning district, subject to specific conditions, which\nensure compatibility of the use with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties. The conditional\nzoning district is intended for property that has immediate development plans. The following zoning district\ncategories are conditional zoning districts: Parallel conditional zoning districts. A parallel conditional zoning\ndistrict is a conditional zoning district in which the potential permitted use or uses are, except as limited by\nthe conditions imposed on the district, of the same character or type as the use or uses permitted in a\ngeneral district having a parallel designation or name.\n(Code 2003, \u00a7 30-191; Ord.

The intent of the requirements set forth in this section shall be to enhance the visual and aesthetic\nappearance of the town; provide space definition and landscape continuity between the built environment\nand the natural environment; provide appropriate barriers and relief from traffic, noise, heat, glare and the\nspread of dust and debris; reduce the impact of development on the community's storm drainage system\nand reduce flooding; aid in the conservation of energy; replenish the atmosphere with oxygen; provide for a\nmore pleasant and relaxing urban environment; and increase property values. Furthermore, the intent of\nthis section shall be to create a screen between residential zoning districts and other zoning districts or to\nscreen certain uses in order to minimize potential nuisances, such as noise, dust, odor and light glare;\nreduce the visual impact of unsightly aspects of adjacent development; provide for the separation of spaces;\nand establish a sense of privacy.\n(b) Temporary waiver. A certificate of compliance shall not be issued for any use located on a lot upon which\nscreening and/or landscaping is required, unless such screening and landscaping are provided on such lot as\nspecified in this section. The provision may be temporarily waived by the code enforcement officer in cases\nwhere it is not possible for the developer to install certain species of plant material prior to occupancy due\nto the recommended planting season not occurring at an appropriate phase in construction. In such case,\nthe time deadline for planting such materials shall be extended only to the nearest seasonal period suitable\nfor planting such materials.\n(c) Installation and maintenance. The plantings that constitute required buffering and landscaping shall be\nproperly installed and maintained in order to fulfill the purpose of which this section is established. Plant\nspecies shall be recommended for healthy growth under local climate conditions, not of a type highly prone\nto disease, and be of a type expected to be grown in a manner which will satisfy the spirit and intent of this\nsection. Plant materials shall be planted in accordance with generally recommended and accepted planting\nand growing practices. The owner of the property and any tenant on the property where buffering and\nlandscaping are required shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all required\nlandscaped materials. Such maintenance shall include all actions necessary to keep the buffered and\nlandscaped areas free of litter and debris; keep plantings healthy; keep growth from interfering with safe\nvehicular or pedestrian travel, or use of parking areas, or from creating any nuisances to adjoining\nproperties; and keep walls, fences and berms in good repair and neat in appearance. Any vegetation that\nconstitutes a required screen or landscaped area shall be replaced if it dies. All buffering and landscaping\nmaterial shall be protected from damage.\n(d) Relief requirements.\n(1) The planning and inspections director or their designee may waive certain portions of this section when\nhe determines that unusual topography or elevation of a development site or the location or size of the\nparcel to be developed would make strict adherence to the requirements of this section and serve no\nmeaningful purpose or would make it physically impossible to install or maintain the required screening.\n(2) The planning and inspections director or their designee may alter the requirements of this section if he\n89 of 163\n3/11/24, 19:39\n"}, {"page": "90", "text": "Leland, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\ndetermines that screening devices already exist and/or the location and/or the size of the parcel involved\ncreates a situation whereby the installation of the required plantings would serve no useful purpose, or\nwhere a variation to the amount and/or type of screening or landscaping required would serve equally\neffectively as that which is required, provided that the spirit and intent of this chapter are maintained.\nSuch an alteration may occur only at the request of the developer, who shall submit a plan to the\nplanning and inspections director or their designee showing existing site features and proposed\nscreening and landscaping features. This section shall not be construed to categorically negate the\nnecessity for establishing screening for uses which are adjacent to vacant properties.\n(e) Easements and rights-of-way. Any planting which is proposed to be placed in a general drainage and utility\neasement or in a street right-of-way must be approved by the town engineer.\n(f)\nDistance from roads and sidewalks. All trees shall be placed in the most feasible manner so as not to\ninterfere with roadways, sidewalks or streetlights and shall not be planted closer than eight feet to a fire\nhydrant.\n(g) Distance from utilities. Any trees required by this section which are placed within 20 feet lateral distance\nfrom the centerline of an above-ground electric utility line (the line connecting pole centers) should have a\nmaximum expected maturity height as follows:\n(1) Zero to ten feet lateral distance of the centerline, 15-foot maximum expected maturity height; and\n(2) Greater than ten feet and up to 20 feet lateral distance of the centerline, 25-foot maximum expected\nmaturity height. Outside such 20 feet lateral distance, trees should be placed in the most feasible\nmanner to avoid future conflict with above-ground electric utilities and violations of the National\nElectrical Safety Code, and to avoid conflict with any below-ground utilities and drainage facilities.\nVariations to such distance requirements may be made with the approval of the town engineer.\n(h) Additional landscaping. Any tree or planting required as provided in this section shall stand alone and shall\nnot be counted toward meeting the requirements for any other section.\n(i) Where screening required. Screening shall be required under the following circumstances:\n(1) Screening between residential and nonresidential uses shall be required when a nonresidential use\nabuts a residential use. Screening shall be provided on the nonresidential use lot at the time such lot is\ndeveloped, initially or otherwise.\n(2) Where a multifamily development abuts a residential zoning district, level 1-A screening shall be required\non the lot developed for multifamily purposes.\n(j) Screen and buffer strip standards. Required screening may be in the form of natural plantings, planted\nberms, walls and/or fences. Screening, however, shall be encouraged in the form of natural plantings.\nExisting plantings may be used, in whole or in part, to satisfy the requirements of this section. Screening in\nthe form of a planted berm, wall or fence may be used, provided that such structures comply with all other\napplicable subsections of this section.\n(1) Wall and fence standards. Fences shall be constructed in a durable fashion, with weather-resistant wood,\nand be of a consistent pattern. All materials used in the construction of a fence shall be designed and\nintended for such use. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the code enforcement officer may approve a\nbuffer fence constructed of other materials, provided the materials and finish used will generally provide\nthe same degree of opacity, durability and aesthetic compatibility as weather-resistant wood.

The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be\ncomputed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical\nsign faces are placed back-to-back so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time,\nand when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and not more than 42 inches apart, the\nsign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces. If the sides of the sign are not\nidentical the larger sign face will determine the square footage allowed.\n(3) Computation of combined development ground sign area. Logos and/or text on ornamental or support\nstructures of the combined development sign may not exceed one logo and two lines of text and shall\nnot exceed 25 percent of the total allowable sign area of the combined development sign face. This\ncomputation is not included in the total allowable sign area for combined development signs.\n(4) Computation of height. The maximum height of a sign shall be measured at the base of the sign from\nnormal grade to the top of the highest part of the sign exclusive of ornamental features. This includes\nany base construction.\na. Normal grade shall be construed to be either the existing grade prior to construction or the newly\nestablished grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding or excavating solely\nfor the purpose of locating the sign.\nb. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed\non the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the\nelevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal\nentrance to the principal structure on the lot or parcel, whichever is lowest.\n(5) Computation of area of V-shaped signs. When determining the available sign area of a V-shaped sign\nhaving an angle between the two sides of the sign of 30 degrees or more, the area of two sides of such\nsign shall be included. When determining the available sign area of a V-shaped sign having an angle\nbetween the two sides of the sign of less than 30 degrees, the area of only one side of such sign shall be\nincluded. Area of the sign faces will be regulated by the tables in section 66-362.
