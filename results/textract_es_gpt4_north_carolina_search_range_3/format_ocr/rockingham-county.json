The Conditional Zoning districts included in this section allow for the consideration of uses\nand development standards that, because of their nature or scale, have particular impacts on both\nthe immediate area and the community as a whole. This district may be appropriate when only\nspecific uses or development standards within a general zoning district would be consistent with the\nobjectives of the UDO. To accommodate those situations, this section establishes the Conditional\nZoning district process.\n(b) Applicability. A conditional zoning amendment is not intended for speculative purposes. Rather, it is\nbased on a firm development proposal. Conditional zoning may be appropriate when a developer\nwishes to present a site-specific development plan for approval.\n(c) Application. Petitions to acquire conditional zoning approval must be submitted and will be\nprocessed in accordance with the provisions in this chapter.

When dealing with the conditional zoning process, it may be desirable to\nrequest additional information in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the\nsurrounding area. Therefore, the Community Development Director, Planning Board and/or Board of\nCommissioners may request additional information in addition to that required above, as they deem\nnecessary.\n(f) Review. In evaluating an application for the establishment of a Conditional Zoning district, it is\nappropriate for the Planning Board and Board of Commissioners to consider the following:\n(1) Adherence to the general policies and objectives of the adopted land use plan, particularly in\nrelation to the proposed site and surrounding area;\n(2) The potential impacts on the surrounding area, including but not limited the specific use(s),\ntraffic, stormwater, land values and the compatibility of surrounding land use activities.

Promoting economic development; and\ne.\nEncouraging different uses in close proximity to lessen traffic and environmental concerns.\n(5)\nConsistency with adopted plans. The Planning Board and the Board of Commissioners must\nmake written findings that either:\na.\nThe proposed zoning is consistent with the adopted plan(s) based upon criteria in section\n33.03(f)(1)-(4) above; or\nb.\nThe proposed zoning is not consistent with the adopted plan(s), but is reasonable in light of\ncircumstances generally defined under subsection 33.03(f)(1)-(4) above, with the\nexception of (f)(3)b. above.\n(g) Conditions of approval of petition. In approving a petition for conditional rezoning, the Planning\nBoard may recommend and the Board of Commissioners may (of its own accord) require that\nreasonable and appropriate conditions be attached to approval of the petition. The applicant must\nprovide written consent to any conditions in the Board of Commissioner's approval to ensure\nenforceability pursuant to G.S. 160D-703(b).

The claim shall be concurrent with\nan application for a zoning map amendment, subdivision plan approval, a conditional coning, a special\nuse permit, a site plan approval or a planned unit development approval. The Community Development\nDirector shall make an initial determination as to the existence of the vested right. Any determination may\nbe appealed under G.S. 160D-405. On appeal, the existence of a vested right shall be reviewed de novo.\nIn lieu of seeking such a determination, a person claiming a vested right may bring an original civil action\nas provided by G.S. 160D-405(c).\nSec. 35.02. - Types and Duration of Statutory Vested Rights\nAmendments in Rockingham County development regulations shall not be applicable or enforceable with\nregard to development that has been permitted or approved pursuant to N.C.G.S. 160D-108 long as one\nof the types of approvals listed in this subsection remains valid and unexpired. Each type of vested right\nlisted in this subsection is defined by and is subject to the limitations provided in this section. Vested\nrights established under this section are not mutually exclusive. The establishment of a vested right under\nthis section does not preclude the establishment of one or more other vested rights or vesting by common\nlaw principles. Vested rights established by Rockingham County approvals are as follows:\n(a)\nSix months - Building permits. - Pursuant to G.S. 160D-1109, a building permit expires six months\nafter issuance unless work under the permit has commenced. Building permits also expire if work is\ndiscontinued for a period of 12 months after work has commenced.\n(b) One year - Other local development approvals. - Pursuant to G.S. 160D-403(c), unless otherwise\nspecified by statute or local ordinance, all other local development approvals expire one year after\nissuance unless work has substantially commenced. Expiration of a local development approval shall\nnot affect the duration of a vested right established under this section or vested rights established\nunder common law.\n(c) Two years - Site-specific vesting plans.\n(1) Duration. - A vested right for a site-specific vesting plan shall remain vested for a period of two\nyears. This vesting shall not be extended by any amendments or modifications to a site-specific\nvesting plan unless expressly provided by Rockingham County ordinance.\n(2) Relation to building permits. - A right vested as provided in this subsection shall terminate at the\nend of the applicable vesting period with respect to buildings and uses for which no valid building\npermit applications have been filed. Upon issuance of a building permit, the provisions of G.S.\n160D-1109 and G.S. 160D-1113 shall apply, except that the permit shall not expire or be\nrevoked because of the running of time while a vested right under this subsection exists.\n(3) Requirements for site-specific vesting plans. - For the purposes of this section, a \"site-specific\nvesting plan\" means a plan submitted to Rockingham County describing with reasonable\ncertainty the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of property. The plan may\nbe in the form of, but not be limited to, any of the following plans or approvals: a planned unit\ndevelopment plan, a subdivision plat, a site plan, a preliminary or general development plan, a\nspecial use permit, a Conditional Zoning, or any other development approval as guided by\nRockingham County ordinance. What constitutes a site-specific vesting plan shall be defined by\nthe relevant development regulation, and the development approval that triggers vesting shall be\nso identified at the time of its approval. At a minimum, the regulation shall designate a vesting\npoint earlier than the issuance of a building permit. In absence of a Rockingham County\nregulation setting forth what constitutes a site-specific vesting plan, any development approval\nshall be considered to be a site-specific vesting plan. A variance shall not constitute a site-\nspecific vesting plan and approval of a site-specific vesting plan with the condition that a\nvariance be obtained shall not confer a vested right unless and until the necessary variance is\n68\n"}, {"page": "69", "text": "obtained. If a sketch plan or other document fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type\nand intensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property, it may not constitute a site-\nspecific vesting plan.\n(4) Process for approval and amendment of site-specific vesting plans. - If a site-specific vesting\nplan is based on an approval required by Rockingham County development regulations, a notice\nand hearing is required for that underlying approval. If the duration of the underlying approval is\nless than two years, that shall not affect the duration of the site-specific vesting plan established\nunder this subdivision. If the site-specific vesting plan is not based on such an approval, a\nlegislative hearing with notice as required by G.S. 160D-602 shall be held. Rockingham County\nmay approve a site-specific vesting plan upon such terms and conditions as may reasonably be\nnecessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Such conditional approval shall result\nin a vested right, although failure to abide by its terms and conditions will result in a forfeiture of\nvested rights. Rockingham County shall not require a landowner to waive vested rights as a\ncondition of developmental approval. A site-specific vesting plan shall be deemed approved\nupon the effective date of the local government's decision approving the plan or such other date\nas determined by the Board of County Commissioners upon approval.

For purposes of this\nsubsection, \"multiphase development\" means a development containing 100 acres or more that is\n(1) submitted for site plan approval for construction to occur in more than one phase and\n(2) subject to a master development plan with committed elements, including a requirement to offer\nland for public use as a condition of its master development plan approval.\n(b) Indefinite - Development agreements. - A vested right of reasonable duration may be specified in a\ndevelopment agreement approved under N.C.G.S. 160D-1001.\n(c) Continuing Review\nFollowing approval or conditional approval of a statutory vested right, a local government may make\nsubsequent reviews and require subsequent approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and\nconditions of the original approval, provided that such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the\noriginal approval. The local government may revoke the original approval for failure to comply with\napplicable terms and conditions of the original approval or the applicable local development regulations.\n(d) Exceptions The provisions of this section are subject to the following:\n(1) A vested right, once established precludes any zoning action by a local government that would\nchange, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the\nproperty as set forth in an approved vested right, except when any of the following conditions are\npresent:\na.

Watershed Areas)\nRockingham County is home to several protected drinking water watersheds and a portion of the\nprotected Jordan Lake watershed. Within these areas, watershed rules also determine minimum lot sizes,\nallowed uses and density limitations. The table below summarizes minimum lot sizes and impervious\nsurface area limitations within each type of watershed located in the county, except for the Jordan Lake\nProtected Watershed, which only deals with riparian buffer requirements. Where noted, Critical Areas\n(CA) are those lands within a protected watershed generally located within one half-mile of a drinking\nwater intake. Because the potential impacts of pollution or contamination are significantly greater in\nCritical Areas, regulations tend to be stricter. Balance of Watershed Areas (BW) are located further away\nfrom drinking water intakes, make up the majority of lands located in protected watersheds, and are less\nstrictly regulated. In WS IV Balance of Watershed (BW) areas, the residential and nonresidential\nimpervious surface area limitation is 24% on a parcel by parcel basis with curb and gutter systems. This\nallowance increases to 36% where development does not include curb and gutter systems. Built-upon\nlimitations shall be calculated using the total acreage of the parcel on which development is proposed.\nFor example, residential development on a one-acre lot (43,560 sq ft) in the critical area of the\nTroublesome Creek protected watershed will equal 5,227 sq ft (43560 X 0.12 = 5,227).

The site plan shall be neatly drawn and\nindicate north point, name and address of person who prepared the plan, date of the original\ndrawing, and an accurate record of any later revisions.\n(2) A complete and detailed description of the proposed variance, together with any other pertinent\ninformation which the applicant feels would be helpful to the Board in considering the application.\n(3) The Watershed Administrator shall notify in writing each local government having jurisdiction in\nthe watershed and the entity using the water supply for consumption.

In order to determine that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary\nhardships, the Board must find that the five following conditions exist:\n1.\nIf he complies with the provisions of the Ordinance, the applicant can secure no\nreasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of, his property. Merely proving that\nthe variance would permit a greater profit to be made from the property will not be\nconsidered adequate to justify the Board in granting an variance. Moreover, the Board\nshall consider whether the variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of\nthe Ordinance that will make possible the reasonable use of his property.\n2.\nThe hardship results from the application of the Ordinance to the property rather than\nfrom other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship.\n3.\nThe hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such as its size,\nshape, or topography, which is different from that of neighboring property.\n4. The hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or\nunknowingly violates the Ordinance, or who purchases the property after the effective\ndate of the Ordinance, and then comes to the Board for relief.\n5.\nThe hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property, rather than the result of conditions\nthat are widespread. If other properties are equally subject to the hardship created in the\nrestriction, then granting a variance would be a special privilege denied to others, and\nwould not promote equal justice.\n(2) The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the Ordinance and preserves\nits spirit.\n130\n"}, {"page": "131", "text": "(3) In the granting of the variance, the public safety and welfare have been assured and substantial\njustice has been done.

The\npreliminary record of the hearing shall include:\n(1) The variance application;\n(2) The hearing notices;\n(3) The evidence presented;\n(4) Motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence, and rulings on them;\n(5) Proposed findings and exceptions;\n(6) The proposed decision, including all conditions proposed to be added to the permit.\n(g) The preliminary record shall be sent to the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission\nfor its review as follows:\n(1) If the Commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance qualifies as a major\nvariance and that\na. the property owner can secure no reasonable return from, nor make any practical use of the\nproperty unless the proposed variance is granted, and\nb. the variance, if granted, will not result in a serious threat to the water supply, then the\nCommission shall approve the variance as proposed or approve the proposed variance with\nconditions and stipulations. The Commission shall prepare a Commission decision and send it\nto the Board.
