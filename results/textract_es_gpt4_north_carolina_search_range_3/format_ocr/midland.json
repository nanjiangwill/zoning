Farm land is a defining element of\nMidland's identity and the protection of these lands aids in preserving the character of the\nTown. Permitted uses are limited, with an emphasis on uses that are agricultural in nature.\nDevelopment density is very low to encourage preservation of agricultural lands while\ndiscouraging large lot residential development. The Agriculture District can also be used to\nprotect open spaces.\nThe Single Family Residential District (SFR) provides for the completion of existing\nresidential neighborhoods and the development of new residential neighborhoods in a pattern\nthat encourages the wise use of land.

districts established in Article 8. The standards set forth below are\nestablished to ensure that new development and construction is compatible with the character\nof the Town of Midland, that it accomplishes the purposes of this Ordinance, and that it\nachieves the goals identified in the Town Plan 2030 - Land Use and Comprehensive Master\nPlan - Revision 1, as amended, and other adopted and or approved plans.\n9.2\nDetached House Lot and Building Type\n9.2-1 Description. The detached house is the most prevalent building type in Midland. The\ndetached house building type is generally found in residential neighborhoods,\nalthough it may coexist with other, similarly scaled buildings in commercial or\nmixed-use areas. Where possible, structures shall be designed to maintain a\nharmonious image of the neighborhood when viewed from a distance. Where\nappropriate and possible, structures shall be designed to terminate vistas. For\ndetached homes on large lots accessed by a private drive in rural areas,\nbuilding placement and site planning shall be dictated by landscape features and\nlandscape preservation. Within the limits described below and unless the zoning\ndistrict standards require greater measures, these regulations shall apply to all houses\nbuilt on public streets.\nThe photographs of detached single-family houses in the Carolinas below are\nexamples for illustration purposes only and not intended to regulate lot/building\nstyles, patterns, or forms.\n1\n"}, {"page": "51", "text": "9.2-2 Detached House Lot Type.\n2\nCELL (1, 1): \nBuilding Placement/Parking/Vehicle Access\nCELL (1, 2): \nEncroachment/Pedestrian\nAccess/Commercial Use Standards\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (3, 1): \n1.
