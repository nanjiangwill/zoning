Zoning districts within the town's jurisdiction fall within one\n(1) of the following three (3) categories.\n(1) General use zoning districts\nEach general use district category serves a different purpose and imposes its\nown set of requirements and restrictions on the use of land in addition to the\ngeneral requirements and restrictions imposed on all land or uses within the\nzoning jurisdiction. A general use district may be layered with an overlay\ndistrict, which is a special type of general use district.\n(2) Conditional zoning districts (CD)\na)\nMost Conditional Districts are established as parallel or counterpart\ndistricts to a general use district. In such cases, references in the\nZoning Ordinance to the general use district shall be construed to also\ninclude the counterpart conditional district. Conditional Districts, like\ngeneral use districts, may be layered with overlay districts.\nb)\nEach Conditional District with a counterpart general use district is\nintended to accomplish the purposes of the counterpart district through\nthe development of identified uses at a specific location in accordance\nwith this section. All regulations and uses which apply to a general\nuse district also apply to the counterpart Conditional District and no\nuse shall be allowed in the Conditional District that is not allowed in\nits counterpart general use district.\nc)\nThe Master Plan Overlay is a district in which the approval of a\nConditional District is required to proceed with development in order\nto ensure that the conceptual plans within the Town's Comprehensive\nPlan are considered prior to development and that the development of\none area within the overlay will not impede the orderly development\nof another area.\nd)\nAdditional conditions, which may be suggested by the petitioner as\npart of the rezoning process, shall be binding upon property within a\nSec. 3 - Page 1\nTown of Bermuda Run Zoning Regulations - Amended 1/9/2024\n"}, {"page": "15", "text": "CHAPTER 3\nZONING DISTRICTS\nConditional District in perpetuity or until the property is rezoned by\nthe Town Council.

Such\nconditions must be enforceable by the Town, presented by the\npetitioner during the public hearing as part of the rezoning petition,\nand agreed to by the Town Council during the rezoning process.\ne)\nThis is a voluntary procedure which is intended for firm development\nproposals. It is not intended or suited for securing early zoning for\ntentative or speculative proposals which may not be undertaken for\nsome time.\n(3) Overlay districts\nOverlay districts are established to provide for certain additional\nrequirements, to permit uses not otherwise permitted in the underlying\ndistrict, to prohibit uses allowed in the underlying district, to establish\nspecial development requirements for uses permitted, or to ensure\nconsideration of conceptual plans within the Town's Comprehensive Plan.\nThus, where overlay districts exist and there is a conflict between the\nrequirements and/or uses specified between the overlay and the underlying\ndistrict, the standards of the overlay district shall prevail.
