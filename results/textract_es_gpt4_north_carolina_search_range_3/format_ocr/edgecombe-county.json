ARTICLE INTRODUCTION\n2.1.1. ORGANIZATION\nA.\nThis article includes all the development application review provisions, and is comprised of the\nfollowing three sections:\n1. A section setting out the summary table of application types;\n2. A section that describes each individual application type in alphabetical order; and\n3. A section describing the basic review procedures organized by stage in the review process.\nB.\nThe table in Section $2.2, Application Summary Table, lists each development application type in\nthis Ordinance and identifies the review authorities who decide them.\nC.\nSection $2.3, Application Types, lists each of the individual application types in alphabetic order.\nIt describes the purpose for each procedure, when the procedure is used, which review\nauthority decides the application, the review criteria that will be used, how an approved\napplication may be amended, if and how the approval may expire, and how decisions on an\napplication may be appealed;\nD.\nThe description of each application type includes a procedural flowchart. The procedural\nflowchart uses a symbol for each step in the process with text inside the symbol describing the\nstep in greater detail. The procedural flowchart is color coded to depict differing\nresponsibilities. For example, white boxes indicate actions or responsibilities of the applicant.\nBoxes with dashed lines show optional steps an applicant may choose to undertake. Light grey\nboxes indicate actions of County staff. Brown boxes show public hearings or public meetings\n(as appropriate).\nE.\nSection $2.4, Review Procedures, describes the basic procedures used by County staff and other\nreview authorities in the consideration of every proposed development application. It sets\ndown the standards for pre-application conferences, application submittal, application\ncompleteness determination, staff review and report, public notification, public meeting or\nhearing procedures, and notification of decision.\n$2.2. APPLICATION SUMMARY TABLE\nThe following table lists each of the specific development application review procedures under this\nOrdinance and the review authority (ies) involved in the decision-making process. Review authorities\nare listed in columns across the top of the table and procedures are listed in rows down the side. Cells\nin the middle show actions taken by a particular review authority as part of the review process. Blank\ncells (\"e\") indicate that a particular review authority has no role in the particular procedure.\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage 45\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n"}, {"page": "46", "text": "ARTICLE 2.

There is sufficient public park land in proximity to the proposed development based on\na review of the County's adopted policy guidance and information from County staff;\nii. Private common open space resources provided on the subject site will be available for\npublic use and will mitigate park land needs created by the proposed development;\niii. Collected funds could be utilized to further improve an existing park facility in a\nproximate location;\niv. The topography or other natural conditions of the site do not provide adequate\nopportunities for on-site recreation and park areas;\nV. The amount of park land to be dedicated is too small to provide adequate recreation\nand park opportunities or to be efficiently maintained;\nvi. The intended location of the park land is too far from existing recreation and park areas\nto be efficiently maintained; or\nvii.Adequate access is not available to the proposed park land.\n3.

ZONING AND SUBDIVISION-RELATED VARIANCE STANDARDS\nI. REQUIRED FINDINGS OF FACT\nA zoning- or subdivision-related variance shall be approved on a finding the applicant\ndemonstrates all of the following:\na. Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the Ordinance. It\nshall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no\nreasonable use can be made of the property.\nb. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as\nlocation, size or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as\nwell as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood\nor the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance.\nC. The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property\nowner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist\nthat may justify the granting of the variance shall not be regarded as a self-created\nhardship.\nd. The variance approval is the minimum necessary to make possible the reasonable\nuse of the land, building, or structure.\ne. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the\nOrdinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.\nII. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS\nIn addition to the making the required findings in subsection 2.3.26.E.1 above, the\nBoard of Adjustment may also consider if the variance approval is the minimum\nnecessary to make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.\nIII. FACTORS THAT MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED\nNone of the following may be used as the basis for approving a zoning-related or\nsubdivision-related variance:\na. Personal circumstances;\nb. A request for a particular use that is expressly, or by inference, prohibited in the\nzoning district;\nC. Hardships resulting from factors other than application of the relevant standards of\nthis Ordinance;\nd. The fact that land or a structure may be utilized more profitably or be more\nmarketable with a variance;\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage\n112\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n"}, {"page": "113", "text": "ARTICLE 2.

Will be used by an individual or individuals with a disability or handicap protected\nunder federal law;\nb. Is the minimum needed to provide accommodation; and\nC. Is reasonable and necessary.\nii. For the purposes of this section, an accommodation is reasonable if it would not\nundermine the legitimate purposes of this Ordinance, it does not constitute a\nsubstantial alteration of this Ordinance or other County standard, and it will not impose\nsignificant financial and administrative burden upon the County.\niii.

Conditions shall be in accordance with the following:\n1. Conditions must be reasonably related to the variance application.\n2. A variance granted subject to a condition of approval shall be permitted as long as there is\ncompliance with the condition.\n3. Violation of a condition of approval shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance.\n4.\nIf a violation or invalidation of a condition of approval occurs, the Planning Director may\ninitiate proceedings to revoke the authorization for the development subject to the\nvariance.\n5.

MIXED RESIDENTIAL (R-20) DISTRICT\nA.\nR-20 DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENT\nThe Mixed Residential (R-20) district has a neighborhood-scale or character with individual\ndevelopments arranged along major transportation corridors and within designated areas proximate to\nmunicipal areas. The district allows a wide variety of dwelling unit types at moderate densities of\naround two units per acre, though densities may be increased based on open space provision and\ndesign quality. Residential neighborhoods include a variety of different lot sizes and housing types to\npromote diverse housing options for County residents (though some require approval of special use\npermits). Landscaping and careful siting helps preserve compatibility between different housing types\nlocated adjacent to one another. Nonresidential uses are allowed though typically served by public\npotable water and sanitary wastewater services, and there is a fine-grained network of greenways and\nsidewalks that allow for mobility within and between neighborhoods. Residential uses maintain\nmodest building heights of between one and three stories. Neighborhood-scale or low-intensity\nnonresidential and institutional uses like schools, religious institutions, parks, and minor utility uses are\npermitted to support neighborhood character and convenience. In order to maintain compatibility with\nsurrounding uses and ensure a high quality of development, all activities shall comply with the\nstandards in Article 6.

MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL (R-10) DISTRICT\nA.\nR-10 DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENT\nThe Multi-Family Residential (R-10) district is the most dense of the residential districts and allows a\nbroad range of residential use types. The R-10 district is typically configured as a single development\non one or two lots, though are also some examples of multiple lot developments throughout the\nCounty. Multi-family development is typically more dense than its immediate surroundings, and can\nalso serve as an effective transition between single-family detached development and adjacent\ncommercial or employment uses. Buildings in the R-10 district tend to have shared site access, shared\nbuilding access, common site features (like recreation space) owned in common, and centralized\nservice functions. Residential densities are slightly higher for most forms of allowable residential\ndevelopment than is permitted in the other residential districts, though multi-family density is double\nthat in the other residential districts. Uses that are potentially detrimental to residential development\nare generally discouraged in the R-10 district.

SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL (R-30) DISTRICT\nA.\nR-30 DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENT\nThe Single- Family Residential (R-30) district has a suburban character typically comprised of single-\nfamily detached residential uses in numerous locations throughout the County's planning jurisdiction.\nAllowable residential densities are around one and one-half units an acre but may be increased based\non design quality or open space provision. Lot sizes are generally larger than in neighborhoods and\nmore urbanized portions of the County and tend to be landscaped or include undisturbed vegetation.\nMost uses are not served by public potable water and sanitary wastewater services, though\nneighborhood-scale water and wastewater facilities may be present. Most buildings are low-rise in\nheight, or between one and three stories tall. Off-street parking is common. Neighborhood-scale or\nlow-intensity nonresidential and institutional uses like schools, religious institutions, parks, and minor\nutility uses are allowed, provided they do not detract from the quiet, residential character of the district.\nIn order to maintain compatibility with surrounding uses and ensure a high quality of development, all\nactivities shall comply with the standards in Article 6.

FLOOD HAZARD OVERLAY (FHO) DISTRICT\nA.\nSTATUTORY AUTHORIZATION\nThe Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in Part 6, Article 21 of Chapter 143; Parts 3\nand 4 of Article 18 of Chapter 153A; and Part 121, Article 6 of Chapter 153A of the North\nCarolina General Statutes, delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt\nregulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.\nB.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n1. The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of Edgecombe County are subject to periodic\ninundation which results in loss of life, property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of\ncommerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood\nprotection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the\npublic health, safety, and general welfare.\n2. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains\ncausing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas\nof uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.\nC.\nSTATEMENT OF PURPOSE\nIt is the purpose of these standards to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and\nto minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by\nprovisions designed to:\n1.\nRestrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or\nerosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities;\n2.\nRequire that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected\nagainst flood damage at the time of initial construction;\n3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective\nbarriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;\n4. Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or\nflood damage; and\n5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood\nwaters, or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\nD.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objectives of these standards are to:\n1. Protect human life, safety, and health;\n2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\n3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally\nundertaken at the expense of the general public;\n4. Minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;\n5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and gas mains, electric,\ntelephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in flood prone areas;\n6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood\nprone areas; and\n7. Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area.\nE.\nEFFECTIVE DATE\nThese standards shall become effective on June 2, 2015.\nF.\nDEFINITIONS\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage\n179\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n"}, {"page": "180", "text": "ARTICLE 3.

WATERSHED PROTECTION OVERLAY DISTRICT\nA.\nOVERVIEW\nThe watershed protection overlay districts are designed to protect designated public water\nsupply watershed from activities that could degrade water quality. These two separate\nwatershed protection overlay districts have been established, both of which are within a public\nwater supply watershed that has been classified by the State of North Carolina as a WS-IV\nwatershed:\nB.\nAREAS DISTINGUISHED\n1. The WCA, Watershed Critical Area Overlay District consists of that portion of the Tar River\npublic water supply watershed designated by the NC Environmental Management\nCommission which is located within the Edgecombe County planning jurisdiction, and which\nis located one-half mile upstream from a public water supply intake located directly in the\nTar River or the ridge line of the watershed, whichever comes first.\n2. The WPA, Watershed Protected Area Overlay District consists of that portion of the Tar River\npublic water supply watersheds designated by the NC Environmental Management\nCommission which are located within the Edgecombe County planning jurisdiction, and\nwhich are located within 10 miles upstream from and draining to the public water supply\nintake on the Tar River or to the ridge line of the watershed, whichever comes first.\nC.\nPURPOSE AND INTENT\nThese standards are found by the Board of Commissioners to be necessary and appropriate to:\n1. Protect those portions of designated public water supply watersheds which lie closest to\nexisting and proposed public water supply sources from activities which could degrade\nwater quality in those water supply sources;\n2. Reduce the volume of nutrients and other chemicals that could enter the water supply by\nreducing the amount of runoff that any given development will generate;\n3.\nMinimize land disturbance to reduce the amount of sediment washing into streams and\nlakes and to enhance the infiltration of runoff into soil, thus alleviating the sedimentation of\nwater supply sources which reduces their storage capacity, shortens their useful life, and\nmakes them less able to withstand drought;\n4. Reduce the probability of the release of harmful chemicals into water supply sources, either\nthrough natural catastrophe or human error; and\n5. Provide for natural and engineered methods for managing the stormwater that flushes\ncontaminants off of impervious surfaces in the watershed areas and that may reach water\nsupply sources unless controlled.\nD.\nWATERSHED AREA ESTABLISHED\nThe provisions of this Ordinance shall apply within the areas designated as a Public Water\nSupply Watershed by the N.C.

LAND USES DISTINGUISHED\nArticle 4. Land Uses, contains all the standards related to the use of land in the County's planning\njurisdiction, and is organized by the three types of land uses: principal, secondary, and temporary.\nA.\nPrincipal uses are the primary, permanent use types proposed on a lot (like a single-family\nhome).\nB.\nSecondary (or accessory) uses are secondary or subordinate uses found on the same lot as a\nprincipal use (like a detached garage structure serving a single-family home) and may be a\nstructure or an activity.\nC.\nTemporary uses are structures or activities permitted for a limited duration of time on a lot (like\na portable storage container used for the purposes of storing or moving a household's\nbelongings).\n4.1.2. ARTICLE ORGANIZATION\nA.\nPRINCIPAL USES\n1. Section 4.1.2.A, Principal Uses, sets out the principal use table, or the master listing of\nprincipal use types and the districts where they are allowed. Each principal use listed in the\ntable is defined in Section $8.4, Words Defined.\n2.\nSection $4.3, Principal Use Standards, sets out the requirements applied to designated\nprincipal uses, regardless of the zoning district where they might be located.\nB.\nSECONDARY USES\nSection $4.5, Secondary Uses, sets out the general standards applicable to all secondary uses as\nwell as any additional standards applicable to specifically designated secondary uses or\nstructures commonly found in the County.\nC.\nTEMPORARY USES\nSection $4.6, Temporary Uses, sets out the standards for temporary uses, including the districts\nwhere allowed, the maximum allowable duration for the temporary use, and any additional\nstandards applicable to specific temporary uses or activities.\nD.\nPROHIBITED USES\n1.\nSection $4.4, Prohibited Uses, identifies principal and secondary use types that are\nprohibited throughout the County's planning jurisdiction.\n2. In some cases, overlay zoning districts such as the Airport or Flood Hazard Overlay District\ninclude prohibitions on certain principal or secondary uses. Information on these use\nprohibitions is located within the particular overlay district standards (see Section $3.4,\nOverlay Zoning Districts).\nE.\nUNLISTED USES\nSection $4.7, Unlisted Uses, sets out use type classification details for use by the Zoning\nAdministrator in determining how to classify and process a proposed principal or secondary\nuse type that is not listed in this Ordinance.\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage\n228\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n"}, {"page": "229", "text": "ARTICLE 4.

GENERALLY\nTable 4.2.1, Principal Use Table, lists use categories, principal use types and indicates\nwhether the principal use type is permitted by-right, by a special use permit, or is prohibited\nin a particular zoning district. It also includes a reference to any applicable use standards\nthat apply to a particular principal use.\n2. USE CLASSIFICATIONS\ni.\nIndividual principal uses in the principal use table are organized into one of the\nfollowing five different use classifications, based upon their characteristics: Agricultural;\nCommercial; Industrial; Institutional; and Residential.\nii. Use classifications are more generally described in Section $4.7, Unlisted Uses.\n3. USE CATEGORIES\ni. Each of the five use classifications includes a series of use categories. Use categories\nare groupings of similar use types that are grouped based on similar purposes or\nfunctional characteristics.\nii.\nIndividual use types listed in the table of principal use types are listed in alphabetical\norder by use category.\niii. Use categories are more generally described in Section $4.7, Unlisted Uses.\n4. USE STANDARDS\nThe right-most column of the table includes a reference to any applicable use standards\nassociated with a particular use type. Unless otherwise stated in the standards, a use\nstandard applies to a particular use regardless of the zoning district where it is located.\nB.\nUSES PERMITTED BY RIGHT\n1. A \"P\" in a cell of the principal use table indicates that the specific use type is permitted by-\nright in the corresponding zoning district, subject to compliance with any referenced use\nstandards and any other applicable standards in this Ordinance.\n2.

Special uses must also comply with any referenced use\nstandards and any other applicable standards in this Ordinance.\nD.\nUSES ALLOWED IN A PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT\n1. An \"A\" in a cell of the principal use table indicates that the specific use type is allowable in a\nplanned development district, provided the specific use type is included in the list of\npotential use types in the master plan or terms and conditions document approved as part\nof the zoning map amendment establishing the planned development district.\n2. Allowed uses are subject to any referenced use standards identified in the principal use\ntable.\n3.

Several of the provisions in this Ordinance are applied at the time of a change in use. For\nthe purposes of this Ordinance, each of the following shall constitute a \"change in use:\"\ni.\nWhen an existing principal use is replaced by a new principal use that is of a different\nuse classification, use category, or use type designation (see Section $4.7, Unlisted\nUses);\nii. When an existing principal use that is conducted entirely indoors becomes conducted\nentirely outdoors, or vice versa;\niii. When an existing use type that is a nonconfoming use changes to a different use type\nthat is also nonconforming, regardless of whether the newer nonconforming use is\nmore intense than the prior nonconforming use;\niv. Any change in an existing use or development site that triggers the application of a\ndiffering set of building code requirements, such as the switch from residential\nrequirements to non-residential or combined use requirements;\nV. When an existing principal use intensifies or expands (with or without a shift in the use\ntype) in a manner that increases the average daily trips associated with the use by 100\npercent or more; and\nvi. If a combined or multiple principal use is changed in ways where the mixture of use\ntypes changes or where the relative proportion of floor area devoted to one of the\nexisting use types is modified to the extent that the total minimum off-street parking\nstandards for the entire development are changed.\n2. Conversion from one use type to the same use type under the same or a different owner is\nnot a change in use. Additions or expansions of an existing use may require the need for\ncompliance with development or design standards in this Ordinance.\n3. Changes of use type within a planned development district do not constitute a change in\nuse provided the new use types is identified in the planned development terms and\nconditions document. The addition of a new or unlisted use types within a planned\ndevelopment shall require an amendment to the planned development district.\n4.\nAddition or conversion of secondary uses or the operation of a temporary use does not\nconstitute a change in principal use.\nG.\nCOMBINATION OR MULTIPLE PRINCIPAL USES\nDevelopments with combination or multiple principal uses, such as shopping centers, shall:\n1. Incorporate only those use types allowed in the applicable zoning district;\n2. Comply with all the use standards that apply to each use type in the development; and\n3. Comply with the required method of establishment for the use type identified in Table 4.2.1,\nPrincipal Use Table.\nCELL (1, 1): \nEDGECOMBE COUNTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nLAST AMENDED\nCELL (2, 1): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 2): \nPage\n230\nCELL (2, 3): \n5.2.22\n"}, {"page": "231", "text": "ARTICLE 4.
