Statement of consistency. The Town Council shall adopt a written statement as to the consistency of the rezoning\nwith any adopted land use plans. The requirement for a plan consistency statement may also be met by a clear indication in\nthe minutes of the Town Council meeting that at the time of action on the amendment the Town Council was aware of and\nconsidered the Planning Board's recommendations and any relevant portions of an adopted comprehensive plan. If a zoning\nmap amendment is adopted and the action was deemed inconsistent with the adopted plan, the zoning amendment shall\nhave the effect of also amending any future land-use map in the approved plan, and no additional request or application for\na plan amendment shall be required. A plan amendment and a zoning amendment may be considered concurrently. The\nplan consistency statement is not subject to judicial review. If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a large-scale rezoning\nunder G.S. \u00a7 160D-602(b), the Town Council statement describing plan consistency may address the overall rezoning and\ndescribe how the analysis and policies in the relevant adopted plans were considered in the action taken.\nD. Statement of reasonableness. A written statement shall be adopted as to the reasonableness of the rezoning. This\nstatement of reasonableness may consider, among other factors, (i) the size, physical conditions, and other attributes of the\narea proposed to be rezoned, (ii) the benefits and detriments to the landowners, the neighbors, and the surrounding\ncommunity, (iii) the relationship between the current actual and permissible development on the tract and adjoining areas\nand the development that would be permissible under the proposed amendment; (iv) why the action taken is in the public\ninterest; and (v) any changed conditions warranting the amendment. If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a large-scale\nrezoning under G.S. \u00a7 160D-602(b), the Town Council statement on reasonableness may address the overall rezoning. The\nstatement of reasonableness and the plan consistency statement required by this section may be approved as a single\nstatement.\n4.3.10 Resubmission of application.\nA. Upon final action by the Town Council to deny or approve an application for the rezoning of property, the Planning\nBoard shall not accept for review any applications for changes affecting the same property or any portion thereof until the\nexpiration of one year from the date of such previous action except as provided in division B. below.

The decision authority may vary certain requirements of this ordinance in harmony with the general purpose of these\nregulations, where special conditions applicable to the subject property would make the strict enforcement of the regulations\nimpractical or result in a hardship in making reasonable use of the property.\nB. No variance shall be permitted that would have the effect of allowing a use not permitted in the subject zoning\ndistrict\n(see use table set forth in Article 7), or a density exceeding the maximum allowed in the subject zoning district.\nC. No variance may be granted where explicitly prohibited by this ordinance.\n4.5.2. Decision authority. The Board of Adjustment shall be the decision authority for all variance applications.\n4.5.3. Pre-application conference. All applicants seeking a variance shall schedule a re- application conference with the\nUDO Administrator to discuss the procedures, standards, and regulations required for variance approval in accordance with\nthe provisions of this ordinance.\n4.5.4. Application requirements. An application for a variance shall be signed by the owner(s) of the subject property or\nthe owner(s) agent with a valid power of attorney and submitted in accordance with Article 4.1.3 (Application Requirements).\n4.5.5. Notice and evidentiary hearings. Once the application has been determined complete, the UDO Administrator shall\nschedule an evidentiary hearing and give public mailed and posted notice as set forth in Article 4.1.4.\n4.5.6 Burden of proof. The applicant seeking the variance shall have the burden of presenting evidence sufficient to allow\nthe decision authority to reach the conclusions set forth below (Findings, Article 4.5.9), as well as the burden of proof on\nthose issues.\n4.5.7 Action by the UDO Administrator. The UDO Administrator shall provide the decision authority a copy of the\napplication and all relevant materials pertaining to the request prior to the public hearing.\n4.5.8 Action by the decision authority.\nA. Each decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact by the decision authority that specifies the reasons for the\ndecision.\nB. A decision to approve a variance requires a concurring vote of four-fifths of the members of the decision authority.\nC. The decision authority may approve in whole or in part, deny, or continue the request. In granting the variance, the\napproving authority may prescribe reasonable and appropriate conditions that will ensure that the use will be compatible with\nadjacent properties and will not alter the character of the neighborhood. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such conditions\nmust be directly related to the impacts of the proposed use and must be roughly proportional to these anticipated impacts.\n4.5.9 Findings of fact.\nA. In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of the zoning regulation upon a\nshowing of all of the following:\n1. Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the regulation. It is not necessary to demonstrate\nthat, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property;\n2. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography.\nHardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the\nneighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance. A variance may be granted when\nnecessary and appropriate to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a person with a\ndisability;\n3. The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing\nproperty with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance is not a self-created hardship;\nand\n4. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the regulation, such that public safety is\nsecured and substantial justice is achieved.\nB. Any variance granted must be the minimum variance required for reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.\nThe fact that property may be utilized for greater profit, however, is not considered adequate to justify the granting of a\nvariance.\nC. Neither the nonconforming use of lands, buildings, or structures in the same zoning district; nor the permitted use of\nlands, buildings, or structures in other zoning districts; nor personal circumstances may be considered as grounds for the\nissuance of a variance. Furthermore, mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for granting a variance.\nD. The decision authority's final decision shall be delivered in writing by personal delivery, electronic mail, or first class\nmail to applicant.\n4.5.10 Effect of approval.\n"}, {"page": "29", "text": "A. The applicant shall file the approved variance with the County Register of Deeds within six months from the date of\napproval or the variance shall be deemed void.\nB.

The Town Council shall issue a special use permit if it has evaluated an application through a quasi-judicial process\nand determined that:\n1. The proposed use will have either a minimal effect or positive effect on the public health or safety;\n2. The use meets all required conditions and specifications;\n3. The proposed use will have no material adverse effect on the value of adjoining or abutting properties unless the\nuse is a public necessity; and\n4. The proposed use is in harmony with the CAMA Land Use Plan/comprehensive plan and/or other plans adopted by\nthe Town Council.\n4.9.8 Effect of approval.

Will not decrease the off-street parking ratio or reduce the yards provided at the periphery of the site by greater\nthan five feet.\nB. Further changes to the development may only be made by the original issuing authority in accordance with the\nprocess for initial approval.\nC. For example, if a special use permit is issued for a building having a gross floor area of 100,000 square feet, under\nthis provision the property owner could, subject to approval of the UDO Administrator, construct a building with a gross floor\narea of up to 110,000 square feet.

Standards for roads are provided in Article 12.\nNote: In the case of lots on the turning circle of a cul-de-sac, the curb width will be a minimum of 50% of the district lot width\nrequirement but not less than 20 feet.\nZoning districts within the town's jurisdiction fall within one of the following three categories.\n7.1.1 General use zoning districts. Each general use district category serves a different purpose and imposes its own set\nof requirements and restrictions on the use of land in addition to the general requirements and restrictions imposed on all\nland or uses within the zoning jurisdiction. A general use district may be layered with an overlay district, which is a special\ntype of general use district.\n7.1.2 Conditional zoning districts.\nA. Typically, conditional districts are established as parallel or counterpart districts to a general use district. In such\ncases, references in the zoning ordinance to the general use district shall be construed to also include the counterpart\nconditional district. Conditional districts, like general use districts, may be layered with overlay districts.\nB. Each conditional district with a counterpart general use district is intended to accomplish the purposes of the\ncounterpart district through the development of identified uses at a specific location in accordance with this Article. All\nregulations and uses which apply to a general use district also apply to the counterpart conditional district, and no use shall\nbe allowed in the conditional district that is not allowed in its counterpart general use district.\n7.1.3 Overlay districts.\nA. Overlay districts are established to provide for certain additional requirements, to permit uses not otherwise\npermitted in the underlying district, to prohibit uses allowed in the underlying district, or to establish special development\nrequirements for uses permitted. Thus, where overlay districts exist, and there is a conflict between the requirements and/or\nuses specified between the overlay and the underlying district, the standards of the overlay district shall prevail. Otherwise,\nthe standards of the underlying district shall also be in effect for any area additionally zoned for an overlay district.\nB. A zoning map change either establishing or changing any overlay district shall be subject to the same procedures\nand requirements as any other zoning map change.\n"}, {"page": "53", "text": "(Ord. passed 2-3-2021; Ord. 2023-03, passed 3-1-2023)\n\u00a7 7.2 CLASSIFICATION OF AREAS UNDER WATER OR OTHERWISE UNCLASSIFIED.\n7.2.1 All areas within the jurisdiction of the town that are under water and are not shown as included within any district\nshall be subject to all of the regulations of the district which immediately adjoins the water area.

The builder, user, carrier, and the like, shall\nalso submit documentation that the owner of the tower or antenna is willing to permit other user(s) to attach accessory\ncommunications facilities which do not interfere with the primary purpose of the tower or antenna, provided that such other\nuser(s) agree to negotiate a reasonable compensation to the owner from such liability as may result from such attachment;\n3. That in the event of a collapse, the proposed WTF facility has been engineered to fall in a radius of less than the\nprovided setback;\n4. Report on service gaps or service expansions that are addressed by the proposed WTF (\"the proposed service\"),\nand accompanying maps and calculations;\n5. That the facility meets or exceeds applicable American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards as adopted\nby the FCC in order to protect the public from unnecessary exposure to electromagnetic radiation;\n6. A statement that the proposed facility is the least visually obtrusive, as defined herein, and that the proposed\nfacility conforms with state of the art, as defined herein, or alternatively, that state of the art technology is unsuitable for the\nproposed facility. Costs of state of the art technology that exceed customary facility development costs shall not be\npresumed to render the technology unsuitable; and\n7. A listing and locations of any possible/future additional towers that may be necessary to meet the users long-term\noverall goals.\n8.101.6 Third party review.

Replace an existing WTF with a new WTF resulting in compliance with this Article.\n8.101.8 Approval authority.\nA. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for the approval of stealth attached WTFs, and co-location on existing\nantenna supporting structures, except those located within 300 feet of a designated State of North Carolina Scenic Byway.\nB. In addition to the requirements for special use permits, the Planning Board, in determining whether a WTF is in\nharmony with the area, or the effects and general compatibility of a WTF with adjacent properties may consider the\naesthetic effects of the WTF as well as mitigating factors concerning aesthetics. The Planning Board may disapprove an\napplication on the grounds that the WTFs aesthetic effects are unacceptable, or may condition approval on changes in WTF\nheight, design, style, buffers, or other features of the WTF or its surrounding area. Such changes need not result in\nperformance identical to that of the original application. Factors relevant to aesthetic effects are: the protection of the view in\nsensitive or particularly scenic areas and areas specially designated in adopted plans such as unique natural features,\nscenic roadways and historic sites, the concentration of WTFs in the proposed area, and whether the height, design,\nplacement, or other characteristics of the proposed WTF could be modified to have a less intrusive visual impact.\n8.101.9 Construction and operation.\n"}, {"page": "94", "text": "A.

General. Innovative approaches which reduce the amount of impervious cover within the town are encouraged when\nthe public interest is served and protected. The UDO Administrator or Planning Board, as specified, may reduce the\nminimum amount of off-street parking required (beyond that permitted by Article 9.1.6.C, Modifications) where developer-\nsubmitted parking data, prepared and sealed by a registered engineer with transportation expertise, illustrates that the\nstandards of this Article do not accurately apply to the specific development. The data submitted for an alternative parking\nplan shall include, at a minimum, the size and type of the proposed development, the mix of uses, the anticipated rate of\nparking turnover and the anticipated peak parking and traffic loads of all uses. The following factors may also be considered.\nB. Factors considered in alternative parking plans\n1. Public parking. Up to 35% of the required off-street parking spaces may be waived by the Planning Board if\npublicly-controlled-parking is located within a 500 foot walking distance along public walkways from the main entrance of the\nproposed use and the UDO Administrator also determines that adequate parking spaces are available within the publicly-\ncontrolled parking area to accommodate the anticipated use.\n2. Off-site and cooperative parking.\na. Generally. Cooperative provision of required parking space and other innovative parking arrangements that\nprotect and serve the public interest are encouraged.\nb. Separate lot. The Planning Board may approve the location of up to 50% of required off-street parking spaces on\na separate lot from that on which the principal use is located if the off-site parking complies with all of the following\nstandards. This factor shall not be used to satisfy the off-street parking requirements for convenience stores or similar\nconvenience-oriented uses or for handicapped accessible parking.\nC. Location. No off-site parking space shall be located more than 500 feet from the primary entrance of the use\nserved (measured along public walkways). Off-site parking spaces shall not be separated from the use served by a highway,\nunless a grade-separated pedestrian walkway is provided, or traffic control or remote parking shuttle bus service is provided.\nOff-site parking shall be located in a district where commercial parking is a permitted principal use.\nd. Agreement for off-site and cooperative parking. If an off-site parking area is not under the same ownership as the\nprincipal use served, a written agreement between the record owners shall be required. The owner of the off-site parking\narea shall enter into a written agreement in a form acceptable to the Town Attorney, (with enforcement running to the record\nowners of the area and the town) providing that the land comprising the parking area shall never be disposed of except in\nconjunction with the sale of the building which the parking area serves so long as the facilities are required; and that such\nagreement shall bind heirs, successors, and assigns.\n3. Valet parking. The Planning Board may approve valet parking as a means of satisfying otherwise applicable off-\nstreet parking requirements where all of the following standards have been met.\na. Adequate assurance of the continued operation of the valet parking, such as a contractual agreement for valet\nservices or the tenant's affidavit agreeing to provide such services, shall be provided;\nb. An equivalent number of valet spaces shall be available to replace the required parking spaces. Such valet\nspaces do not require individual striping, and may take into account the tandem or mass parking of vehicles.\n9.1.8 Vehicle stacking areas.\nA. Vehicle stacking areas.

The purpose of this Article is to supplement development standards elsewhere in these zoning regulations with\nspecific criteria that apply to the design of commercial buildings and projects which are 200,000 gross square feet or greater\nin area.\nB. The town's goal is to create and maintain a positive ambiance and community image and identity by providing for\narchitectural and site design treatments that will enhance the visual appearance of the applicable commercial development\nand the quality of life.\nC. The applicable commercial development depends on high visibility from public streets. In turn, design of certain\ncommercial buildings and sites determines much of the image and attractiveness of the streetscapes and character of the\ncommunity. Massive, duplicative, or generic projects that do not contribute to, or integrate with, the community in a positive\nmanner can be detrimental to a community's image and sense of place.\nD. This Article incorporates a basic level of architectural design which, in conjunction with site design, landscaping,\nlighting, and sign treatments located elsewhere in this ordinance, is intended to result in a comprehensive scheme for\nbuilding design and site development. However, this Article is not intended to require any specific style of architecture.\nE. This Article is also intended to:\n1. Promote high standards in architectural design and the construction of creative, innovative, aesthetically pleasing\nstructures;\n2. Encourage landowners, designers, and developers to look closely at local conditions and the development site,\nand produce new development that enhances and complements both the built and natural environment; and\n3. Ensure that development and building design is sensitive to the specific site, consistent with the existing and\nproposed character of the area, including residential and nonresidential uses in the surrounding area, and does not detract\nfrom the positive elements of the community and existing neighborhood characteristics.\n9.3.2 Standards. The standards found in this Article shall be in addition to all other applicable standards found in this\nordinance.\nA. Building materials. Predominant exterior building materials shall be high quality material. These include, without\nlimitation: brick, natural decay-resistant quality exterior wood siding, rock, stone or tinted and textured concrete masonry\nunits, and transparent glass windows and doors. Facade colors shall be neutral or earth tone colors. Building trim and\naccent areas may feature brighter colors, including primary colors, but these colors may not comprise more than 15% of any\nbuilding facade.\nB. Requirements for building mass and articulation. The design shall help integrate the development with its\nsurroundings by breaking down the apparent mass and scale of the building on all sides.\n1. The first floor should be taller than upper floors. Lower floors should be differentiated architecturally to create a\nsense of human scale.\n2. Buildings shall avoid long, monotonous, uninterrupted walls or roof planes on their visible facades. Building wall\noffsets, including projections, recesses, and changes in floor level, shall be used in order to add architectural interest and\n"}, {"page": "103", "text": "variety; relieve the visual effect of a single, long wall; and subdivide the wall into human scale proportions. No more than\n60,000 gross square feet of the structure shall be designed as a distinct mass.\n3. All facades visible from a public roadway shall be given equal design significance. There shall be no blank,\nfeatureless walls, including rear walls. The design shall present a continuity of style on all facades visible from the public\nroadway, except where separated by a party wall located on a lot line. The primary facade shall be designed to comply with\nthe requirements of Article 9.4 (Building Facade Design).\n4. Similarly, roofline offsets shall be provided to lend architectural interest and variety to the massing of a building\nand to relieve the effect of a single, long roof.\n5. Outparcels shall be designed and integrated with the main project.\n6. Internal and new streets shall be constructed in accordance with the regulations set forth in Article 9.2 (Commercial\nAccess).\n(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)\n\u00a7 9.4 BUILDING FACADE DESIGN.\n9.4.1 Applicability.

All uses except for one- or two-family residences; and\nC. Expansion or modification of an existing commercial or office use that increases the total enclosed floor area by at\nleast 50% or 5,000 square feet, whichever is greater.\n9.4.2 Standards.\nA. The primary facade shall be constructed of one or a combination of the following materials: concrete, aggregate,\nstucco, brick, stone, glass, natural decay-resistant quality exterior wood siding, or faced concrete block. Artificial materials\nthat closely resemble these materials shall also be allowed. Facade colors shall be neutral or earth tone colors. Building trim\nand accent areas may feature brighter colors, including primary colors, but these colors may not comprise more than 15%\nof the building facade.\nB. The remaining sides of the building shall be treated with the same materials of construction of the primary facade.\nAs an alternative, for the principal use building(s), powder coated painted metal panels may be used on the non-primary\nfacade walls under the following conditions. (The goal is to use architectural detail to provide visual interest).\n1. Metal panels can only be used on buildings in the CI District.\n2. Metal panels can be used for roofing material.\n3. The (wall) metal panels will have deep, embolden ribs (or equivalent) to bring definition to the wall (e.g., MBCI\nShadowRibTM) with colors complementing or matching the primary facade. Other approaches to achieve the desired\nappearance will be considered at the pre-application conference.\n4. Long continuous building walls are prohibited. No single metal wall shall extend unbroken more than 15% of the\ntotal wall length or 15 feet (whichever is greater) in a horizontal plane. Primary facade material should be used to trim out\nand/or break up the metal walls in both the horizontal and vertical planes.\nC. No building facade facing the public street right-of-way shall be devoid of architectural enhancements or interest. For\nstreet corner buildings, both street elevations shall be architecturally enhanced as a front facade.\nD. Long continuous building walls are prohibited and no single facade extending unbroken more than 35 feet in a\nhorizontal plane may be visible from a public roadway. Compliance may be obtained through one of the following:\n1. The use of projections or recesses (articulation). When used, each projection or recess shall have a projection\n(depth) dimension of no less than 18 inches and a width of no less than 36 inches; or\n2. The use of columns or other architectural detail to provide visual interest. Where used, columns should be\nharmonious with the general design of the structure.\nE. At least 25% of the first floor of the street facade shall be transparent.\nF. Roofs shall be simple forms such as hip, flat, shed, mansard, gable to front, or gable to side, and shall avoid\nexcessive articulation. Recommended roofing materials include slate shingles, asphalt and fiberglass shingles, and metal\nstanding seam or tiles.\nG. As an alternative, powder coated painted metal panels may be used on all the walls of an accessory structure in the\nCLD or CI District under the following conditions. (The goal is to use architectural detail to provide visual interest and/or\nlandscaping buffers to screen the structure).\n1. The accessory structure shall be no closer than 200 feet from the primary structure.\n2. The accessory structure shall be no closer than 35 feet from the nearest lot line for buildings under 12 feet in\n"}, {"page": "104", "text": "height; for every foot higher than this, the required distance to the lot line shall be increased by four feet.\n3. Colors shall be neutral or earth tone complementing the primary structure.\n4. Where possible, architectural enhancements shall be used to break up long continuous walls.\n5. With architectural enhancements, a screening of 0.4 opacity shall be required on all sides; without enhancements,\na screening of 0.8 opacity shall be required.\n6. All access points (e.g., driveways) shall not eliminate the need for continuous landscaping on the access point\nside.\n7.

The purpose of these regulations is to provide developers with greater flexibility in the design and\ncreation of residential subdivisions while preserving significant amounts of open space and environmentally sensitive areas.\nThis is achieved by allowing the clustering of residential lots with reduced area, frontage, and setback standards in relation\nto the underlying district, on areas of the proposed site which are best suited for development and leaving the remaining\nland as permanently protected open space.\n9.13.2 Minimum area for a cluster subdivision. The minimum area for a cluster subdivision is 25 acres.\n9.13.3 Minimum open space dedication. The minimum amount of open space that must be dedicated and permanently\nprotected within a cluster subdivision is 20% of the gross acreage of the proposed subdivision. In exchange for dedication of\nthe additional land for open space preservation, further reductions in lot frontage and setback standards shall be granted in\naccordance with 9.13.6 below.\n9.13.4 Maximum number of lots.\nA. The maximum number of lots that may be created in a cluster development shall be computed from the gross area\nof land to be developed minus 20% that represents the approximate area needed for roadways, drainage, and other\nimprovements.\nB. Divide the remainder by the minimum lot area requirement for single-family dwellings of the zoning district where the\ndevelopment is located.\nC. The result is the maximum number of lots that may be created in the development. Where fractions of lots remain,\nthe result will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of lots. The 20% factor shall be constant regardless of the\nactual amount of land used for the street system.\nEXAMPLE: The maximum number of lots allowed in a proposed cluster subdivision consisting of 100 gross acres of land\nwhich is Zoned R-15 would be calculated as follows:\n100 acres: 20% = 80 acres\n80 acres X 43,560 sq. ft. = 3,484,800 sq. ft.\n3,484,800 sq. ft.\n"}, {"page": "108", "text": "15,000 sq. ft. = 232 lots\n9.13.5 Minimum lot area. The minimum residential lot area requirements of the underlying zoning district may be reduced\nby up to 25% within a cluster subdivision. In no case shall any residential lot within a cluster subdivision be smaller than the\nstandards shown below:\n9.13.6 Minimum lot frontage and building setbacks. The minimum lot frontage and building setback requirements of the\nunderlying zoning district may be reduced by up to 25% within a cluster subdivision. In exchange for the dedication of\nadditional land for open space preservation, the lot width and building setback requirements may be reduced by an\nadditional 1% for each additional 1% of the gross acreage of the project that is dedicated for open space preservation. In no\ncase shall the lot width or building setback requirements be reduced below 50% of the requirements of the underlying\nzoning district.\nEXAMPLE #1: If the minimum open space dedication of 20% were proposed by the developer of a 100 acre cluster\nsubdivision within an 'R-15' Zoning District, then the minimum lot frontage and building setback standards within the\nsubdivision would be reduced by 25% as shown below:\nEXAMPLE #2: If the same developer were to propose the dedication of 35% of the gross acreage of the subdivision to open\nspace preservation then the minimum lot frontage and setback standards would be reduced by 40% as shown below:\n9.13.7 Peripheral lot standards. Lots located on the periphery of a cluster subdivision which is adjacent to property that is\nzoned or used for residential purposes shall conform to the minimum standards of the underlying zoning district as set forth\nin Article 7 of this ordinance. For the purpose of this Article, peripheral lots shall be defined as any lot that contains a point\nwhich lies within 30 feet of the boundary of the subdivision.\n9.13.8 Open space standards.\nA. All open space dedicated to satisfy the requirements of this section shall be deeded to the town or another\ngovernment entity, a homeowner's association, or a nonprofit land trust or conservation organization. In consideration of the\npurposes served by a cluster subdivision, the title to such areas as provided shall be preserved to the perpetual benefit of\nthe public generally or the private properties in the development and shall be restricted against private ownership for any\nother purposes.\nB. To the greatest extent possible, the parcels containing open space dedicated to satisfy the requirements of this\nArticle shall be contiguous and compact. The Planning Board shall approve the design of all required open space areas prior\nto approving the preliminary plat for a cluster subdivision.\nC. Improvements upon land dedicated as open space shall be limited to those which contribute to the passive\nenjoyment of the open space. Examples of allowed passive improvements include multi-use paths, hiking trails, boardwalks,\npicnic shelters, viewing platforms, kayak or canoe launching areas, and similar improvements. If provided within the\ndedicated open space, motor vehicle parking shall utilize pervious pavement technology over 100% of the parking area.\nUnder no circumstances shall improvements cover more than 10% of the dedicated open space.\n9.13.9 Access to open space. All lots created within the development shall have direct access to all parks or open space\nas provided by means of public streets, dedicated walkways, other public lands, or lands in common ownership by all\nresidents.\n9.13.10 Phase developments. A cluster subdivision may be developed in phases provided that:\nA. The entire project receives approval before any phase of development begins;\nB.

The cost of such maintenance\nshall be charged to those persons having the primary responsibility for maintenance of the buffer area.\n70.7.4 Hardship relief. Landscape requirements may be modified by the UDO Administrator upon a finding that a\nmodification would be consistent with the purpose and intent of this Article, with any adopted land use plans, and that such\nmodification would not adversely affect the land use compatibility or public interest.\n(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)\n\u00a7 10.8 PROJECT BOUNDARY BUFFER YARD AND LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS.\n10.8.1 Definition and purpose of buffer yards.\nA. A BUFFER is a specified land area, located parallel to and within the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel and extending\nto the lot or parcel boundary line, together with the planting and landscaping required on the land. A BUFFER may also\ncontain, or be required to contain, a barrier such as a berm, fence, or wall, or combination thereof, where such additional\nscreening is necessary to achieve the desired level of buffering between various land use activities. A BUFFER is not the\nsame as the term \"yard\".\n1. Both the amount of land and the type and amount of planting specified for each buffer yard required by this Article\nare designed to ameliorate nuisances between adjacent land uses, or between a land use and a public road.\n2. The planting units required of buffer yards have been calculated to ensure that they do, in fact, function to \"buffer\".\n"}, {"page": "114", "text": "B. Buffer yards shall be required to separate different land uses from each other, in order to:\n1. Eliminate or minimize potential nuisances, such as dirt, litter, noise, glare of lights, signs, and unsightly buildings or\nparking areas; or\n2. Provide spacing to reduce adverse impacts of noise, odor, or danger from fires or explosions.\n10.8.2 Location of buffer yards.\nA. Buffer yards shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, extending to the lot or parcel boundary line.\nB. Buffer yards shall not be located on any portion of an existing public or private street or right-of-way.\n10.8.3 Types of required buffers. There are two types of required buffers that may occur on any given development site,\nas follows.\nA. Street buffers. Generally, a street buffer is located along the street(s) that border a development. The buffer requires\na modest amount of landscaping, enhancing the \"public\" environment.\nB. Project boundary buffers. Generally, a project boundary buffer is located around the sides and rear of a\ndevelopment. This buffer ensures an appropriate transition between uses. A buffer located around the perimeter of a\nnonresidential use is intended to protect adjoining land uses from noise, heat, dust, lights, and aesthetic impacts from more\nintense land uses.\n10.8.4 Permitted use of buffer area\nA. A buffer may be used for passive recreation and picnic facilities; and it may contain pedestrian, bike, or equestrian\ntrials, provided that:\n1. Minimal existing plant material is eliminated;\n2. The total depth of the buffer is maintained; and\n3. All other requirements of these regulations are met.\nB. Other appurtenances which require high visibility and easy access, such as fire hydrants, public and emergency\ntelephones, and mail boxes. No screening of such appurtenances is permitted.\nC. A required buffer is encouraged to retain areas of native habitat and may incorporate water resources, including\nstormwater detention/retention facilities designed as a natural-appearing amenity. However, a minimum ten-foot contiguous\nwidth of the buffer shall be preserved as a planting area without stormwater facilities.\nD. Ingress and egress to the proposed use, and utility lines and appurtenances, may cross the buffer provided they\nminimize the amount of buffer taken.\nE. The buffer area may be included as part of the calculation of any required open space.\nF. Identification signs may be located within a buffer as specifically permitted in the sign ordinance. The landscape\nbuffer shall be designed to address visibility of permitted ground signs.\nG. Lighting may be located within a buffer as specifically required in Article 9.5, Outdoor Lighting.\nH. Other activities and development required by this ordinance or expressly authorized by the UDO Administrator.\n10.8.5 Prohibited use of buffer area.\nA. Buffer area shall not be used for any building or use, accessory building or use, parking or loading area, storage\narea, or other principal or accessory uses except as specifically permitted in this ordinance.\n10.8.6 Planting in easements.\nA. Where required plantings are located in easements, the utility provider shall be responsible for replacement of such\nrequired vegetation if maintenance or other utility requirements require their removal.\nB. No trees shall be planted in wet retention ponds, drainage maintenance easement, or any utility maintenance\neasements.\nC. Shrubs may be planted within easements, provided they are only within the outer three feet of the easement. No\nnew trees may be planted in an easement.\nD. Existing trees may remain in dry retention ponds provided that the natural grade is undisturbed to the tree line, they\nare a species adapted to seasonal flooding and the pond is adequately maintained.\n10.8.7 Determination of buffer requirements. To determine the type of buffer required between two adjoining lots or\nparcels, or between a lot or parcel and a street, the following procedure shall be followed:\nA. Street buffers. Determine the appropriate street buffer based on Article 10.8.8.\nB. Project boundary buffers. Identify the zoning districts/use of the subject parcel and all adjoining properties.\n"}, {"page": "115", "text": "Determine the buffer opacity class required on each boundary (or segment thereof) of the subject parcel. Refer to the\nminimum project boundary buffer table in Article 10.8.9.\n10.8.8 Street buffers. Street buffers shall be required and existing vegetation should be used to satisfy these planting\nrequirements where possible (see Article 10.8.3). Berms constructed in accordance with Article 10.8.10.C, Berm with\nVegetation, are encouraged as a component of any street buffer and the UDO Administrator may allow up to 50% reduction\nin the required buffer depth with a berm.\nA. Measurements.\n1. Street buffers shall be measured along a perpendicular line from the future right-of-way line determined during site\nand development plan review. Buffer depth averaging may be used in conformance with paragraph (5), below.\n2. Required driveways may penetrate required street buffers.\n3. Driveway widths (measured at the inside edge of the buffer) shall not be counted in the calculation of the plant\nmaterial required.\n4. Vehicular access easements shall not be treated as a street, but shall be buffered as a project boundary buffer\noutside the easement area. The buffer may be provided on either side of the easement.\n5. While the buffer depth is normally calculated as parallel to the property line, design variations are allowed and are\ncalculated on the average depth of the buffer per 100 feet of linear width measured along the property line. Minimum depth\nof buffer in any case shall not be less than 50% the required depth of the buffer chosen. Maximum depth shall not be more\nthan 150% the required depth of the buffer chosen.\nB. Collector or thoroughfare street buffers. All development located along either a collector or thoroughfare street shall\nbe required to provide one of the following buffers along the entire street frontage:\n1. Two canopy trees per 100 linear feet of property frontage, located within a 20-foot landscape buffer;\n2. One canopy tree and two understory trees per 100 linear feet of property frontage, located within a 20-foot\nlandscape buffer;\n3. Under utility lines only, three understory trees per 100 linear feet of property frontage, located within a ten-foot\nlandscape buffer. No trees under utility lines shall have a natural height over 25 feet; or\n4. In all the above options, there shall also be 15 shrubs per 100 linear feet.\n10.8.9 Project boundary buffers.\nA. Required project boundary buffer table.\n1. Description.\na. The buffer standards in the table below address the opacity of the buffer that is required on the property\nboundary between zoning districts, and in some instances within a zoning district.\nb. An opacity of 0.2 screens 20% of an object, and an opacity of 0.6 would screen 60% of the adjoining\ndevelopment during summer months after five years of growth.\n2. Measurement. Project boundary buffers shall be measured along a perpendicular line from the lot line.\n3. How to read the buffer table.\na. The required opacity of project boundary buffers is represented in the table below by two numbers (for example,\n.2/.6).\nb. The second number represents the total required buffer opacity between any two properties.\nC. Where the proposed project adjoins vacant property, the first number represents the applicant's required buffer\nopacity.\nd. Where the adjoining property is already developed with no buffer, the proposed project is responsible for\nproviding the total required opacity (the second number).\ne. Where the adjoining property is already developed with a partial buffer, the proposed project is responsible for\nproviding the remaining opacity required.\nf. A zero means no project boundary buffer is required.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nZoning District of Adjoining Property\nCELL (1, 3): \nZoning District of Adjoining Property\nCELL (1, 4): \nZoning District of Adjoining Property\nCELL (2, 1): \nZoning District of Subject Property\nCELL (2, 2): \nR-20, R-15, R-10,\nEPUD\nCELL (2, 3): \nMR, CN\nCELL (2, 4): \nCLD, CI\nCELL (3, 1): \nR-20, R-15, R-10, EPUD\nCELL (3, 2): \n0/0\nCELL (3, 3): \n.2/.2\nCELL (3, 4): \n.4/.6\n"}, {"page": "116", "text": "NOTE: Wireless telecommunication towers shall require a buffer yard with an opacity of 0.8 regardless of their location\n(refer to Article 8.101).\nExample.

This dimension must be measured from the back of the curbs. Linear planting strips\nbetween the lengths of parking isles are strongly encouraged rather than numerous small one tree islands. If linear planting\nstrips are used, then the distance of parking spaces from a trunk of a canopy tree may be increased to 70 feet.\nC. A minimum ten-foot wide continuous planted median shall be installed in off-street parking areas approximately\nevery 130 linear feet in one direction for vehicular surface areas exceeding 40,000 square feet. Other design options may be\napproved provided that the intent of \"breaking up\" large areas of parking is met. Saving existing interior trees may be\ncredited toward this requirement. This requirement does not apply to vehicular display lots, vehicular rental lots, and other\nsimilar lots.\nD. The size of the planting area and size of plant material at maturity shall allow for a two and one-half foot bumper\noverhang from the face back of the curb. Barriers, such as curbs or wheel stops, must be provided between vehicular use\nareas and landscaped areas.\nE. All sidewalks shall be at least five feet from the trunks of large trees, unless otherwise approved by the TRC. For\nexample, when the placement of the sidewalk would require the removal of an existing large tree to meet this requirement or\nwhere there is not enough space on the site to accommodate both the tree and the sidewalk, this requirement may be\nmodified.\nF. Parking lots shall be graded so that landscape islands do not impound water, unless surface impoundment is\nrequired as a method of on-site retention of stormwater. Landscape islands should be composed of well-prepared structured\nsoil and thoroughly cultivated and amended so as to support healthy plant growth.\nG. Preservation of existing groups, stands, or groves of trees, as well as isolated islands with single trees, is strongly\nencouraged.\nH. Canopy trees shall be at least two inches in caliper when installed.\nI. Evergreen shrubs shall be at least 18 to 24 inches in height and minimum three-gallon container size at the time of\ninstallation.\nJ.

General. The town hereby determines and recognizes that an interconnected street system is necessary in order to\nprotect the public health, safety, and welfare. This will be accomplished by ensuring that streets will function in an\ninterdependent manner by providing continuous and comprehensive traffic routes and adequate access for emergency and\nservice vehicles. The interconnected system of roads should also enhance non-vehicular travel such as pedestrians and\nbicycles. Street interconnection design shall address connection of the subject subdivision to the adjacent thoroughfare\nwithin the subject subdivision. Rights-of-way for future street connections shall be dedicated to the public at the time of final\nplat approval.\nB. External access required.\n1. External access to a development will meet the following requirements. In determining the number of access points\nthat shall be required, the cumulative impacts of prior developments on the roads shall be considered:\na. There shall be at least two points of access for development with 120 or fewer lots, unless waived by the\nPlanning Board. Certain land characteristic may require more than two access points.\nb. For developments with more than 120 lots, at least three points of access to the roadway shall be provided. If the\ndevelopment is bounded by more than one thoroughfare, there shall be at least one entrance to each thoroughfare.\nC. The required points of access shall be installed at the time of final plat approval. If the development is being\ndeveloped in phases and a subject point of access is not necessary for the current phase, additional point(s) of access may\nbe approved as construction access.\n2. A divided entrance shall count as one point of access.\n3. The Planning Board may approve variations in the requirements of this Article when additional access points are\nprecluded in the following circumstances:\na. If the only additional access points available would require crossing floodplains, steep slopes, or other similar\nnatural features; or\nb. When the existing development pattern precludes additional access points and fewer units than would otherwise\nbe allowed would be out of character with the surrounding development.\nC. Access to adjacent property.\n1. Access to existing developments shall be achieved by connecting to temporary turnarounds or the equivalent\nprovided in the existing development.\n2. Access to future developments is required on each side (as defined by each of the cardinal directions) of a\ndevelopment as follows:\na. At least one future connection for every 1,400 linear feet on any single side of the proposed development; and\nb. Future connections are not required to adjoining sites that are permanently protected from development through\nconservation easements or ownership that precludes development. Nor are future connections required if the only point of\naccess would require crossing floodplains, wetlands, or other similar natural features.\nD. Within the proposed subdivision. All proposed streets shall be continuous and connect to existing or platted streets.\nStreet offsets are not desired and must be approved by the Planning Board. Cul-de-sacs will be allowed if they enhance the\n"}, {"page": "129", "text": "appearance of the neighborhood and the utilization of the land. The street network for any subdivision shall achieve a\n\"connectivity ratio\" of not less than 1.00 in all zoning districts.\n1. The phrase CONNECTIVITY RATIO means the number of street \"links\" divided by the number of \"nodes\" or link\nends, including cul-de-sac heads.\n2. A \"link\" means and refers to that portion of a street defined by a node at each end or at one end. Approved stubs to\nadjacent property shall be considered links.\n3. A \"node\" refers to the terminus of a street or the intersection of two or more streets, except that intersections that\nuse a roundabout shall not be counted as a node.\n4. For purposes of Article 12.7.10, the street links and nodes within the collector or thoroughfare streets providing\naccess to a proposed subdivision shall not be considered in computing the connectivity ratio.\nE. The street connectivity requirements set forth in this Article are established as standards. The town recognizes,\nhowever, that due to the particular nature of a tract of land or other factors strict adherence to these standards may not be\npractical or desirable and, therefore, the Planning Board has discretion whether or not to require the actual connection to\nadjacent property.\n(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)\n\u00a7 12.8 STREETS.\n12.8.1 Street classification.\nA. Classifications. In all new subdivisions, streets shall be classified as provided in this Article.\n1. The classification shall be based upon the projected volume of traffic to be carried by the street, stated in terms of\nthe number of trips per day.\n2. The number of dwelling units to be served by the street may be used as a useful indicator of the number of trips\nbut is not conclusive.\n3. Whenever a subdivision street continues an existing street that formerly terminated outside the subdivision or it is\nexpected that a subdivision street will be continued beyond the subdivision at some future time, the classification of the\nstreet will be based upon the street in its entirety, both within and outside of the subdivision.\nB. The classification of streets shall be as follows.\n1. Alley.

Every subdivider of land for residential purposes shall dedicate a portion of such land, as set\nforth herein, for the purpose of providing active and passive recreation areas to serve the residents of the immediate\nneighborhood within the subdivision.\n12.9.2 Active and passive recreation space dedications. Recreation areas shall be defined for active or passive\nrecreation use as follows.\nA. Active recreation consists of areas such as park land chosen without regard to natural features for the explicit\npurposes of enhancing design, such as village commons, or providing space for outdoor recreation activities that may\ninclude, but not be limited to, golf courses, tennis courts, ball fields, swimming pools, and tot lots with play equipment. No\nmore than 25% of the required active recreation may be located in an indoor facility such as, but not limited to, exercise\nrooms, clubhouses, and gymnasiums. Parking spaces associated with these uses, whether required or not, shall not be\ncounted towards satisfying the required active recreation space provision.\nB. Passive recreation areas shall include amenities such as walking paths, piers, picnic areas, and other passive\nrecreational uses. Such uses shall be subject to approval and/or permits issued by the proper authorities, including any\nnecessary CAMA approvals, and only will be allowed with minimal disturbance of the vegetation. The passive recreation\nareas may consist of undisturbed, unique, and sensitive natural features and may include streams, floodplains, wetlands\n(excluding tidal marsh), conservation resources, and natural heritage areas if identified. Undisturbed soils and natural\nvegetative cover for wildlife habitat will characterize these natural spaces:\n1. The town subject to the acceptance by the Town Council;\n2. Other public jurisdictions or agencies, subject to their acceptance;\n3. Property owner, condominium or cooperative associations or organizations; and\n4. Shared, undivided interest by all property owners in the subdivision, which interest shall run with the land and be\ntransferred when the individual properties are sold.\n12.9.3 Required recreation space.\nA. All new residential subdivisions shall provide recreation space in the amount of 10% of the gross acreage within the\nsubdivision, with not more than 25% of the recreation space to be used for active recreation. The developer shall designate\nthe area which meets the required recreation space on the subdivision plan and in the event additional recreation space is\nprovided (in excess of the required amount), said excess recreation space shall not be used in the future for any other\npurpose, but shall remain in perpetuity as recreation space. The recreation space either shall be dedicated to the town or a\nconservation easement shall be granted to the town.\nB. Recreation space areas shall be of such minimum dimensions as to be functionally usable and maintainable.\nResidential subdivisions that are small enough so that the amount of required recreation space area does not exceed\n20,000 square feet shall be exempt from providing such space when the Planning Board determines that:\n1. Recreation space area cannot be combined with such areas serving adjacent property to form a functionally usable\nand maintainable area; or\n2. The recreational needs of the development can be adequately met by existing or planned town-owned park\nor\nrecreation space areas located close enough to such development to reasonably serve its residents. In determining the size\nof a subdivision for the purposed of this Article, the Planning Board shall consider the entire project developed on a single\ntract or contiguous multiple tracts under common ownership, regardless of whether the subdivision is constructed in phases\nor stages.\n"}, {"page": "131", "text": "12.9.4 Standards for park and recreation areas. Except as otherwise approved by the appropriate governing body, all\npark, recreation, and open space areas shall meet the following criteria.\n1. Unity. The dedicated land shall form a single parcel of land, whether or not the subdivision is developed in phases\nor sections, except where it is determined by the Planning Board that two or more parcels would be in the best interests of\nthe residents of the subdivision and the public; and in such case, the Planning Board may require that such parcels be\nconnected.\n2. Usability. At least two-thirds of the total land dedicated must be outside of wetland areas under the jurisdiction of\nfederal and state regulatory agencies and be usable for active and/or passive recreation.\n3. Shape. The portion of dedicated land to be used for active recreation shall be of such a shape to be usable for\nactive recreation facilities, including, but not limited to, tennis courts, racquetball courts, swimming pools, exercise rooms,\nclubhouses, athletic fields, basketball courts, swings, slides, and play apparatus. The developer shall include said areas(s)\non the preliminary and final subdivision plat, and must demonstrate that the shape and size of the area is adequate for the\nintended purpose(s).\n4. Access within the subdivision for which the land dedication is made and can be combined All dwelling units in the\nsubdivision shall have free, easy, and convenient ingress and egress to and from the park, recreation, and open space areas\nprovided within the development by means of improved streets or dedicated walkways. Rights-of-way for such access shall\nbe shown on the preliminary plats and final plats.\n5. Topography. The average slope of the portion of dedicated land deemed usable for active recreation shall not\nexceed the average slope of the entire subdivision to be developer, and in no case shall the slope of the land dedicated be\ngreater than 10%. The developer shall include said area(s) on the preliminary and final subdivision plat, and must\ndemonstrate that the land is adequate for the intended purpose(s).\n6. Landscaping. Park, recreation, and open space areas shall be landscaped and shall be provided with sufficient\nnatural or human-made screening or buffer areas to minimize any negative impacts upon adjacent residences.\n7. Encroachments. The park, recreation, and open space areas required by this section shall exclude roadways,\nparking areas, and other accessory uses except recreational facilities.\n12.9.5 Procedure for dedication of land.\nA. Designation of land to be dedicated Subdividers shall designate on the preliminary subdivision plat the area or\nareas to be dedicated pursuant to this Article.\nB. Review of land to be dedicated A copy of the preliminary subdivision plat showing the areas to be dedicated shall be\nsubmitted to the Planning Board for review and approval at its next scheduled meeting.\nC. Ownership. The owner, developer, or subdivider, subject to the approval of the Planning Board, shall select the type\nof ownership of land dedicated for park, recreation, or open space purposes. The type of ownership may include, but is not\nnecessarily limited to, the following:\n1. The town subject to the acceptance by the Town Council;\n2. Other public jurisdictions or agencies, subject to their acceptance;\n3. Property owner, condominium, or cooperative associations or organizations; and\n4. Shared, undivided interest by all property owners in the subdivision, which interest shall run with the land and be\ntransferred when the individual properties are sold.\n12.9.6 Flexibility in administration authorized.\nA. The requirements set forth in this Article concerning the amount, size, location, and nature of park, recreation, and\nopen space areas to be provided in connection with residential developments are established by the Town Council as\nstandards that preemptively will result in the provision of that amount of recreational facilities and open space that is\nconsistent with officially adopted town plans. The town recognizes, however, that due to the particular nature of a tract of\nland, or the nature of the facilities proposed for installation, or other factors, the underlying objectives of this Article may be\nachieved even though the standards are not adhered to with mathematical precision. Therefore, the Planning Board is\nauthorized to permit minor deviations from these standards whenever it determines that:\n1. The objectives underlying these standards can be met without strict adherence to them; and\n2. Because of peculiarities in the developer's tract of land or the facilities proposed, it would be unreasonable to\nrequire strict adherence to these standards.\nB. Whenever some deviation from the standards set forth in this Article is authorized, the official record of action taken\non the development application shall contain a statement of the reasons for allowing the deviation.\n(Ord. passed 2-3-2021)\n\u00a7 12.10 PROPERTY OWNER ASSOCIATIONS.\n12.10.1 Final plans shall not be approved until the Planning Board has determined that adequate provisions have been\n"}, {"page": "132", "text": "made through legal covenants and restrictions which shall govern a property owners association, or through other legal\nagreements, that the responsibility for maintenance of streets, utilities, storm water management facilities, drainage ditches\nor swales, or other area designated as private areas is the responsibility of the property owners association.\n12.10.2 Required conditions of property owners associations.

The purpose for this section is to establish permit requirements, allowable time frames, and\nsubmittal requirements for four recognized types of events. These provisions are intended to address potential significant\nnegative impacts to public or private properties from events or event-related activities, not to prevent such activities from\noccurring or to unduly restrict private events.\n14.7.2. Types of events.\nA. Community center events, public and private. Community centers are locations or facilities where members of a\ncommunity may gather for group and club activities, social activities, information meetings, educational activities,\nrecreational activities, special events, and other purposes. They are often facilities that community members (and\nsometimes others), can rent for a function or event. They may sometimes be open for the whole community or for a\nspecialized group within the greater community. Examples of groups that use community centers include youth groups,\nseniors, specific religious groups, and the like. Community centers may be municipally owned (public facilities) or privately\nowned. Parks and recreational centers/facilities are considered community centers. The typical mission of community\ncenters is to provide a facility for programs that meet the served community needs, enhance the quality of life, and promote\ncommunity involvement through the provision of a venue for recreation, cultural activities, education, health, wellness, and\nfitness activities, as well as family life activities. Gymnasiums, ceramic rooms, meeting rooms, kitchens, multipurpose activity\nrooms, weight/fitness rooms, pre-school rooms, and restrooms are often found in community centers. Outdoor amenities are\noften included in community centers (e.g., play equipment, athletic fields, multipurpose courts, and parks). Municipally\nowned community centers are duly chartered for such activities and are exempt from temporary use permit requirements.\nThe town's Community Center is an example of a municipally owned facility. Privately owned community centers approved\nby the town and conforming to the requirements of this UDO are also exempt from temporary use permit requirements for\nactivities within the boundaries of the approved charter and facilities.\nB.

Private events. Private events are any organized events which are not open to members of the general public,\ntypically has a duration of less than 12 hours, and which is not expected to have significant negative impacts on surrounding\nproperties. Examples of such events include, but are not limited to wedding ceremonies, funerals, private parties, or other\nsimilar gatherings. Events that take place in such venues as privately owned and managed clubs, lodges, churches,\ngathering areas, sports facilities, and the like that may be open to both members and non-members are exempt from\ntemporary use permit requirements, but are subject to meeting the facility conditions set forth in Article 8.\n"}, {"page": "137", "text": "F.

Any additional information that will help to inform the review and/or convey the\nintent such as topography plans, landscape planting plans, artistic rendering, and the like is encouraged.\n15.1.5 Site lighting design requirements. Lighting shall be designed to sufficient levels to allow for safe use of a site while\naccenting key architectural elements and emphasizing landscape features. Light fixtures shall be designed as an integral\ndesign element that complements the design of the project. This can be accomplished through style, material, and/or color.\nThe Illuminating Engineering Society (IES), a not-for-profit professional organization of lighting practitioners has\nestablished recommended design standards for various lighting applications which should be followed within the context of\nother established town standards and customs. All lighting fixtures designed or placed so as to illuminate any portion of a\nsite shall meet the following requirements.\n15.1.5.1 Light source (lamp).\nA. Preferred electric light sources are fluorescent, metal halide, or static white light emitting diodes (LED), with a\ncorrelated color temperature between 4000-5000K.\nB. Color corrected high-pressure sodium is also acceptable.\nC. Filament sources (incandescent, halogen, xenon) sources are discouraged due to the safety and aesthetic\nimplications of these short-lived sources which also have poor efficacy.\nD. Non color-corrected high-pressure sodium and low-pressure sodium lamps are expressly prohibited.\nE. The same light source type must be used for the same or similar types of lighting on any one site throughout any\ndevelopment.\n15.1.5.2 Luminaires (lighting fixtures).\nA. The light source, or luminous area or aperture, of a luminaire shall be completely shielded behind an opaque housing\n"}, {"page": "141", "text": "and/or otherwise directed so that the light source is not visible from any street rights-of-way or adjoining properties. Full\ncutoff classification is preferred for all pole-mounted area lighting above 15 feet. Cutoff classification is preferred for pole-\nmounted lighting below 15 feet. Semi-cutoff classification is not permitted.\nB. Canopy lighting fixtures should be completely recessed within the canopy. Similarly, in- grade luminaires shall be\nfully recessed into the finished grade. Open-structure canopies shall be designed to shield lighting equipment so the source\nis not visible from the roadway or adjacent property lines.\n15.1.5.3 Fixture height. Lighting fixtures shall be a maximum of 40 feet in height within parking lots and shall be a\nmaximum of 15 feet in height within non-vehicular pedestrian areas. This is inclusive of a raised base where provided. All\nlight fixtures located within 50 feet of any residential use or residential property boundary shall not exceed 15 feet in height.\nThe UDO Administrator may allow fixtures above this height to provide internal lighting for stadiums, arenas, and similar\nfacilities. All outdoor sports field and outdoor performance area lighting fixtures shall be equipped with a glare control\npackage (louvers, shields, or similar devices). The fixtures must be aimed so that their concentrated beam spreads are\ndirected and fall within the primary playing or performance area. The hours of operation for the lighting system for any game\nor event shall not exceed one hour after the end of the event.\n15.1.5.4 Mounting. Refer to 15.1.6 for mounting restrictions as they relate to illumination levels. All light poles shall be\nround aluminum and rated for the total EPA of the attached luminaires at 100 mph winds with a 1.3 gust factor. Pole bases\nshall be installed with a concrete base. Base detailing shall be reviewed and sealed by a structural engineer registered in the\nstate of North Carolina.\n15.1.5.5 Limit lighting to periods of activity. The use of sensor technologies, timers, or other means to activate lighting\nduring times when it will be needed may be required by the UDO Administrator to conserve energy, provide safety, and\npromote compatibility between different land uses.\n15.1.5.6 Architectural facade lighting. Architectural facade lighting is required for all nonresidential or multi-family\nbuildings fronting a right-of-way. Refer to 15.15 for quantitative lighting criteria. Refer to North Carolina Energy Conservation\nCode for maximum allowable wattage per LZ1 of this non-tradeable surface illumination. Light fixtures shall be carefully\nselected, located, aimed, and shielded so that light is directed only onto the building facade. Fixtures shall not be directed\ntoward adjacent streets or properties. To the extent practicable, fixtures shall be mounted on the building, shielded, and\ndirected downward to wash or graze the facade or roof with light. Luminaires used to uplight architectural elements, such as\nleaves, shall be adjustable and aimed to ensure concentrated beam falls fully on subject surface.\n15.1.6 Design metrics.\n15.1.6.1 Light loss factors. All illumination levels are intended as maintained, meaning that an appropriate light loss\nfactor (LLF) must be applied to calculations to ensure that the light levels will be reasonably maintained over the life of the\nsystem. The most typical and recoverable light loss factors are lamp-lumen depreciation (LLD) and luminaire dirt\ndepreciation (LDD) which must be considered. The LDD shall be considered to be 0.80 which assumes a moderately dirty\nenvironment, enclosed/ventilated luminaires, and maximum 36-month maintenance cycle. The LLD per source is as follows:\nA. Metal halide: 0.70;\nB. Color-corrected high-pressure sodium: 0.90;\nC. Fluorescent: 0.95; and\nD. Solid state (LED): 0.90, based on non-linear lumen depreciation over the L70 life of the LEDs assumed to be 50,000\nhours.\nThe maximum LLF = 0.8 X LLD. For any design wishing to consider a different light loss factor, the technical justification and\ncalculation must accompany the submittal.\n15.1.6.2 Illumination levels. All site lighting shall be designed so that the level of illumination as measured in footcandles\n(fc) at any one point meets the standards in the table below.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nIlluminance Criteria\nCELL (1, 3): \nIlluminance Criteria\nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (1, 5): \nCELL (2, 1): \nType of Lighting\nCELL (2, 2): \nEhorz\nCELL (2, 3): \nEvert\nCELL (2, 4): \nMax: Avg\nCELL (2, 5): \nAvg: Min\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nIlluminance Criteria\nCELL (3, 3): \nIlluminance Criteria\nCELL (3, 4): \nCELL (3, 5): \nCELL (4, 1): \nType of Lighting\nCELL (4, 2): \nEhorz\nCELL (4, 3): \nEvert\nCELL (4, 4): \nMax: Avg\nCELL (4, 5): \nAvg: Min\nCELL (5, 1): \nArchitectural facades\n1\nCELL (5, 2): \nn/a\nCELL (5, 3): \n2.0 4.0\nCELL (5, 4): \nn/a\nCELL (5, 5): \nn/a\nCELL (6, 1): \nBuilding entry/exit (avg.)\nCELL (6, 2): \n1.0 1.5\nCELL (6, 3): \n0.4 0.8\nCELL (6, 4): \n3:1\nCELL (6, 5): \n2:1\nCELL (7, 1): \nSite gated entries (avg.)\nCELL (7, 2): \n0.4 0.8\nCELL (7, 3): \n0.2 0.6\nCELL (7, 4): \n3:1\nCELL (7, 5): \n3:1\nCELL (8, 1): \nCanopy areas (avg., recreational)\nCELL (8, 2): \n3.0 10\nCELL (8, 3): \n1.0 3.0\nCELL (8, 4): \n2:1\nCELL (8, 5): \n3:1\nCELL (9, 1): \nParking lots, asphalt (min.)\nCELL (9, 2): \n0.5\nCELL (9, 3): \n0.2\nCELL (9, 4): \n3.5:1\nCELL (9, 5): \n4:1\n"}, {"page": "142", "text": "Notes:\n1.

IESNA-RP-8-00 recommended ratios are 0.3 (0.3 to 1) for expressways and major roadways and 0.4 (0.4\nto 1) for collector and local roads. (The determination of this ratio is a function of a combination of the road width pole\nspacing, rated lamp lumens, mounting height, and the classification or type of fixture [cutoff, semi-cutoff, or non-cutoff].\nProblems occur most often with non-cutoff post mounted fixtures at low mounting heights [less than 20 feet] with low to\nmedium lumen packages. To meet the ratio requirements, the spacing of poles may need to be as close as 25 or 30 feet\nstaggered spacing with the use of 9,500 lumens in a non-cutoff post- mounted acorn fixture. Wider spacing can be\naccomplished with cutoff type distribution fixtures.)\nWALL PACK. A type of light fixture typically flush-mounted on a vertical wall surface.\nWIDE-BODY REFRACTIVE GLOBE.
