Greater non-conformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as height limitations, or density requirements.\n(f) Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist is permitted and encouraged.\n(g) Notwithstanding subsection (5), any structure used for single-family residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming\nuse may be replaced with a similar structure of a larger size. In particular, a mobile home may be replaced with a larger mobile\nhome, and a \"single-wide\" mobile home may be replaced with a \"double-wide.\" This paragraph is subject to the limitations\nstated in subsection (6), \"abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations.\"\n(h) A structure that is nonconforming in any respect or a structure that is used in a nonconforming manner may be reconstructed\nor replaced if partially or totally destroyed, subject to the following restrictions:\n1.

Changes in a principal use are also considered as changes to any accessory use or building.\n(d) If a nonconforming use and a conforming use, or any combination of a conforming and nonconforming use, or any\ncombination of nonconforming uses exist in one lot, the use made of the property may be changed substantially (except to\na\nconforming use), only in accordance with approval issued by the board of commissioners.

For example, the failure\nto rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building or one space in a nonconforming mobile home park for 180\ndays shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building or\nmobile home park as a whole is continuously maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a\nconforming use, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it\nthereafter.\nAnd so, if a mobile home is used as a nonconforming use on a residential lot where a conforming residential structure also is\nlocated, removal of that mobile home for 180 days terminates the right to replace it.\n(c) When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this article is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this article,\nthe 180-day period for purposes of this subsection begins to run at the effective date of this article.\n7 of 47\n4/22/24, 19:19\n"}, {"page": "8", "text": "Craven County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(7) Marking and lighting.

Special uses add flexibility to this division. Subject to high standards of planning and design, certain\nproperty uses are allowed in the zones established within this division where those uses would not otherwise be applicable. By\nmeans of controls exercised through the special use permit procedures, property uses which would otherwise be undesirable in\ncertain zones can be developed to minimize any bad effects they might have on surrounding properties. Approval of a special use\npermit is made the duty of the board of adjustment.\nThe uses for which special use permits are required are set forth specifically in this division, along with a detailed description of the\nprocedures which must be followed in the approval of each such permit. Uses specified in this section shall be permitted only upon the\nissuance of a special use permit.\n(2) Procedure for special use permit granted by the board of adjustment. Special use permits may be issued by the planning director,\nor his designee, after approval by the board of adjustment, for uses designated in this division as special uses and after planning\n44 of 47\n4/22/24, 19:19\n"}, {"page": "45", "text": "Craven County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nboard review and recommendations. The petition for a special use permit and the accompanying plans shall be submitted to the\nplanning director at least three weeks prior to the board of adjustment meeting at which it is to be heard. Such application shall\ninclude all of the requirements pertaining to it as specified in this section. The board of adjustment shall consider the application\nusing the quasi-judicial process set forth in the chapter.\n(3) Findings of fact. The special use permit, if approved, shall include approval of plans as may be required. In approving the permit,\nthe board of adjustment and planning board shall find as a specific finding of fact and reflect in their minutes that the permit will\ncomply with the following four facts:\n(a) That the use will not materially endanger the public health, safety, or general welfare if located where proposed and developed\naccording to the plan as submitted and approved;\n(b) That the use meets all required conditions and specifications;\n(c) That the use will not adversely affect the use or any physical attribute of adjoining or abutting property, or that the use is a\npublic necessity; and\n(d) That the location and character of the use, if developed according to the plan as submitted and approved, will be in harmony\nwith the area in which it is to be located. The special use shall demonstrate conformance to the land use plan or other plan in\neffect at the time.\n(4) Prohibited uses. As a condition(s) of the issuance of a special use permit, the following are prohibited:\n(a) Any moving, pulsating, flashing, rotating, or oscillating light, which may interfere with air traffic other than navigational\nmarkings or lights marking potential obstructions in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration requirements.\n(b) Flood lights, spotlights, or other lighting devices which are not shielded so as to prevent illumination in an upward direction.\n(c) Any light which constitutes a \"misleading light\" within the meaning of Federal Aviation Administration regulations.\n(d) Any electronic impulse or signal which interferes with communications between aircraft and the airport, or which interferes\nwith established navigational aids.\n(e) Structures and signs of a height which obstructs the takeoff and landing of aircraft, as determined by the Federal Aviation\nAdministration.\n(f) A gathering or residential special use located in a RPZ as delineated on the Coastal Carolina Regional Airport Layout Plan.\n45 of 47\n4/22/24, 19:19\n"}, {"page": "46", "text": "Craven County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(5) Approval/disapproval. In approving the special use permit, the board of adjustment may require such conditions in addition and in\nconnection therewith as will, in its opinion, assure that the use in its proposed location will be harmonious with the area in which it\nis proposed to be located and with the spirit of this division. All such additional conditions shall be entered in the minutes of the\nmeeting at which the special use permit is granted and also on the special use permit approving, and on the approved plans\nsubmitted therewith. All specific conditions shall run with the land and shall be binding on the original applicant for the special use\npermit, the heirs, successors, and assigns. In order to ensure that such conditions and requirements for each special use permit\nwill be fulfilled, the petitioner for the special use permit may be required to enter into a contract with Craven County providing for\nthe installation of the physical improvements required as a basis for the issuance of the special use permit. Performance of said\ncontract may be secured by cash or surety bond which will cover the total estimated cost of the improvements as determined by\nCraven County.\nIn addition to the conditions specifically imposed by the board of commissioners, special uses shall comply with the height, area, and\nparking regulations of the zone in which they are located.\nIn the event of failure to comply with the plans approved by the board of adjustment or with any other conditions imposed upon the\nspecial use permit, the planning director may utilize the enforcement provisions set forth in article I of this chapter.
