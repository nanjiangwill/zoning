Equally as important, the Code encourages the development of a network of sidewalks and\nbicycle lanes that provide an attractive and safe mode of travel for pedestrians and cyclists. In addition\nto dispersing traffic, interconnecting street networks encourages alternate modes of transportation to\nthe automobile, enhances transit service opportunities, improves traffic safety through promoting\nslower speeds, and potentially reduces vehicle miles traveled within the street network. The overall\nnetwork function and the comfort and safety of multi-modal or \"shared\" streets to slow and disperse\ntraffic are primary to vehicular efficiency.\nIt is the intent of this Code to build streets that are integral components of community design.

These\nelements are of economic value to the Town and make it a desirable place to live and visit.\nA. Tree Protection and Removal: Wooded sites provide distinct aesthetic, economic and environmental\nsignificance and value as a natural resource of the Town. Vegetation on sloping sites plays a critical\nrole in maintaining aesthetic quality, water quality, and in minimizing erosion and downstream\nflooding. At a minimum selective retention of certain significant vegetation should occur,\nparticularly in areas or portions of a site that are located within a fragile ecological setting. The\nregulating of tree removal along rights-of-way and public property within the Town ensures a\npedestrian friendly atmosphere along with the preservation and natural balance of vegetation.\nB. Landscaping: The purpose of this section is to regulate the protection, installation, and long-term\nmanagement of trees and shrubs within the Town of Cornelius. Landscape requirements under the\nprovisions of this section are intended to minimize potential nuisances such as visual impacts from\nadjacent properties; transmission of noise, dust, odor, litter, and glare of lights; provide for a\nseparation of space and establish a sense of privacy. Generally, the responsibility for the screening is\nthat of the more intense land use. The appropriate use of existing and supplemental landscaping\nenhances the aesthetic appearance of new development and blends new development with the\nnatural landscape. Quality landscaping is an essential component of the built urban form of the\nTown. Existing landscaping should be retained where possible to ensure as natural as possible an\nestablished environment.

SWIM Buffers: These regulations protect the long-term water quality of the Mountain Island Lake\nand Lake Norman watersheds thereby protecting our drinking water. The purpose of a stream buffer\nnetwork is to filter pollutants, store floodwaters, provide habitat, and contribute to the \"green\ninfrastructure\" of the Town of Cornelius and lands within its jurisdiction. Stream systems are\ncomprised of each stream and its respective drainage basin. Streams have the primary natural\nfunctions of conveying storm and ground water, storing floodwater, and supporting aquatic life.\nVegetated lands adjacent to the stream channel in the drainage basin serve as \"buffers\" to protect\nthe stream's ability to fulfill its natural functions. Buffers have the primary natural functions of\nprotecting water quality by filtering sediments; pollutants such as nitrogen, phosphorus, trace\nmetals, and hydrocarbons; providing intermittent storage for floodwaters, allowing channels to\nmeander naturally; and providing suitable habitat for wildlife.\nD. Land Suitability: This section defines suitable areas for development while promoting the health,\nsafety and welfare of our citizens.\nE.\nSedimentation and Erosion Control: The prevention of soil erosion and sedimentation pollution of\nstreams, springs, water bodies, or other drainage networks are intended to protect the Town's soil\nresources, natural drainage areas, control runoff velocity, and collect excess storm water which\nflows into the Town drainage system.\nTOWN OF CORNELIUS LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE\n9 - 1\n6/21/2021\n"}, {"page": "110", "text": "CHAPTER 9 : ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION\nSECTION 9.2: GENERAL PROVISIONS/APPLICABILITY\nAll land uses requiring Development Plan approval shall be designed in accordance with the\nrequirements of this Chapter.

The\nterm \"sign\" does not include the flag or emblem of any nation, organization of nations, state, political subdivision\nthereof, or any fraternal, religious, school, or civic organization; works of art which in no way identify a product\nor business; scoreboards located on athletic fields; or religious symbols.\nQUANTITY\nA. Unless otherwise specified in the Code, or as per special circumstances listed below as B, C and D,\nestablishments with only one entrance or wall front shall have no more than one primary identification wall\nsign.\nB. Corner lots may be permitted to have one (1) wall sign per street frontage.\nC. Signs may be permitted on non-street fronting walls only if a primary entrance fronts a parking lot.\nD. Structures that are deemed subordinate to the principle uses are permitted one wall sign unless otherwise\npermitted within this ordinance. (HC, IC, BC, CO districts only.)\nSIGN AREA\nThe sign area is the area of smallest geometric figure, which encompasses the facing of the sign including the copy,\ninsignia, logo, symbol, photograph, background, and borders.\nSign Area Width\nIn the case of signs mounted back-to-back, only one side of the sign is to be used for\ncomputation of the area. Back-to-back signs shall be defined as double-faced signs.\nOtherwise, the surface area of each sign is to be separately computed. In the case of\ncylindrical signs, signs in the shape of cubes, or other signs that are substantially\nthree-dimensional with respect to their display surfaces, the entire display surface or\nsurfaces is included in computations of area. If a sign is attached to a ground mounted\nsign serving as an entrance wall, only that portion of that wall onto which the sign\nface or letters are placed shall be calculated in the sign area. Entrance wall area\noutside of the sign height and width shall not be considered a part of the sign.

Environmental Management Commission to obtain\nadditional development rights through an increase in a site's built-upon-area (\"BUA\") by averaging the\ntotal BUA of the developing lot (i.e. \"receiving lot\") with the total BUA of an undeveloped/less\ndeveloped lot within the same watershed and jurisdiction (\"donating lot\"). This is accomplished by\ntransferring undeveloped area on a donating lot to a receiving lot via a BUA Averaging Certificate, which\nincludes a non-revocable easement, metes and bounds description, and recorded plat(s) of the affected\nlots including the area(s) to remain undisturbed. The BUA Averaging Certificate requires approval by the\nWatershed Review Board, a sub-set of the Planning Board; for the purposes of this ordinance, the\nPlanning Board may act as the Watershed Review Board.\n11.3.1 Purpose & Eligibility\nA. Purpose: The purpose of this provision is to preserve open space in the more sensitive areas of the\nwatershed, and to ensure orderly and planned development throughout the watershed.\nB. Uses: All parcels are eligible to be a receiving lot or a donating lot.\nC. Requirements: The following requirements must be met by all parcels:\n1. Ownership: Only the owner(s) of the participating parcels may submit a Built-Upon Area\nAveraging Certificate application. Areas subject to easements, covenants, and/or development\nrestrictions not legally controlled by the owner may not be included as donated parcel area;\nthis includes right-of-way area.\n2.\nPre-Existing Variance: No parcel for which a watershed variance has been granted, or would be\nrequired, may be included as a donating or receiving parcel.\n3. Location: Participating parcels shall be located in the same water supply watershed. BUA\ntransfers may not occur between critical areas and protected areas.

Preservation: The donated area shall remain in an undisturbed vegetated or natural state.\nPreviously developed or graded lots may be used as donating parcels so long as the donated\narea of the lot is revegetated in accordance with Section 9.9.6, Replacement of Vegetation,\nof this Code. The donated area shall be irrevocable unless amended per the requirements of\nthis ordinance prior to the undertaking of any development activity on the participating\nparcels.\n6.\nStormwater Design: All participating parcels must meet the applicable buffer and\nengineered stormwater controls as outlined in the ordinance. For clarity any participating\nparcels buffers shall at least meet the applicable, minimum ordinance requirements for\nparcels located in water supply watersheds. For further clarity, development meeting\napplicable high density requirements shall have on-site stormwater facilities and\ndevelopment meeting applicable low density requirements shall transport stormwater\nrunoff by vegetated conveyances to the maximum extent practicable; all in accordance with\napplicable ordinance requirements.\n7. Design: Built-upon areas shall be designed and located to minimize stormwater runoff\nimpact to the receiving waters, minimize concentrated stormwater flow, maximize the use\nof sheet flow through vegetated areas, and maximize the flow length through vegetated\nareas.\n11.3.2: Process\nA Built-Upon Area (BUA) Averaging Certificate shall be obtained from the Watershed Review Board to\nensure that all participating parcels considered together meet the standards of the ordinance, including\nany standards and requirements on previously recorded subdivision plats, and that potential owners\nhave a record of how the watershed regulations were applied to each parcel.\nA. Applicability: All participating parcels may be processed under a single BUA Averaging Certificate\napplication, and will be considered as one development for the purpose of counting total built-\nupon-area. If approved by the Watershed Review Board, one BUA Averaging Certificate will be\nissued per application. Unless otherwise specified, the application shall follow the rules and\nprocedures specified by the Planning Board and Appeals & Variances sections of this ordinance.\nB. Process: The following steps outline the typical process for obtaining a BUA Averaging Certificate.\nNote: Application preparation is considered an iterative process; an application must be deemed\ncomplete by the Planning Director or designee, and all revisions addressed in order for the request\nto be added to the next regularly scheduled Planning Board meeting agenda for their consideration\nas the Watershed Review Board.

The limits of the study area for the TIA shall be reviewed and approved by\nPlanning Staff, the Town Engineer, and NCDOT staff at the mandatory scoping meeting. At a\nminimum, the study area should include all streets and signalized intersections within a 1-mile\nradius of the proposed site and/or where site traffic estimated for build-out of the project will\nconstitute 5% or more of any signalized intersection approach during the peak hour.\nUnsignalized intersections between the required signalized intersections will be added to the\nscope as directed by the Town. To initially determine the impacts, the Town will maintain a\ndatabase of recent peak-hour intersection turning-movement counts. The applicable\nintersection counts will be equated to current year baseline volumes. Based on the proposed\ndevelopment program submitted by the Developer, a preliminary trip generation analysis,\ndistribution and assignment will be performed within the area surrounding the site and\ncompared to the current year base volumes. Due to related impacts or current operational\nproblems, town staff and/or NCDOT staff may require other intersections be included in the\nstudy area. A narrative describing the study area should identify the location of the proposed\nproject in relation to the existing transportation system and list the specific study intersections\nand/or segments. Any unique transportation plans or policies applicable to the area (e.g., CATS\nbus service and future plans) should be mentioned. A site location map shall be provided and\nshould identify natural features, major and minor roadways within the study area, study\nintersections, and a boundary of the site under consideration.\nh. Existing Conditions - Shall include a narrative and map that represents AM and PM peak hour\nturning movement volumes for all intersections within the study area. Traffic volumes shall be\n15-minute interval weekday turning movement counts (Tuesday through Thursday) and no more\nthan twelve months old. The required count timeframes are from 7:00-9:00 a.m. and 4:30-6:30\np.m.; however site-specific conditions may necessitate additional or different traffic counting\nhours and/or days depending on the development program and location within the Town (these\nunique circumstances will be determined and directed by the Town). For example, 12-hour\nturning movement counts shall be required to complete the analysis if a traffic signal warrant\nanalysis is required as part of the TIA. Planning staff and the Town's Engineer will determine if\nadditional peak hours or weekend analyses shall be included in the TIA at the mandatory\nscoping meeting. For example, if the development is nearby a school that significantly alters\ntraffic volumes at times other than the peak hours described above, additional study hours will\nbe required. Traffic volumes should also represent weeks that have no observed federal, state,\nor local holidays and periods of the year when local schools are in session. The source of existing\ntraffic volume information should be explicitly stated (e.g., Town counts, new counts collected\nby the Developer, NCDOT counts, etc.). If previous counts were obtained, only counts collected\nwithin the one year of the Scoping Meeting will be deemed acceptable Summary sheets for\nexisting turning movement counts should be included in the appendix of the TIA report.

Field notes for the existing conditions investigation may be included\nin the appendix of the TIA report.\ni.\nFuture Year Background Conditions - The number of phases will determine the build out\nscenario of a particular development. Unless otherwise approved by the Planning staff and the\nTown Engineer, future year conditions for a single phase development shall be analyzed for the\nyear the development is expected to be at full occupancy (build-out year) and five years after\nthe build-out year (build-out + 5). For multiple phases, the scenarios should be completed in\norder, with any improvements specified by development included in the subsequent build\nscenarios, including five years after the full build-out year (build-out + 5). Specific analysis\nperiods to include in the study shall depend greatly upon the development program, proposed\nproject phasing plan, and significant improvements programmed for the transportation system.\nThe committed development and transportation projects to be included in the base Future Year\nConditions for the transportation system within the study area shall be determined during the\nscoping meeting. Transportation improvements assumed in the base future year conditions\nanalysis may include those with an expected completion date concurrent with that of the\ndevelopment and funded through either by the Town of Cornelius, State of North Carolina\nTransportation Improvement Program, or indicated as a required condition of approval from\nanother nearby development application. Only projects approved by the Planning Staff at the\nscoping meeting may be included in the analysis as future existing infrastructure. Those\nimprovements committed by other projects must be clearly identified in the report as approved\noffsite development road improvements. Adjacent development traffic information used in the\ndevelopment of the base future year condition should be included in the appendix of the TIA\nreport. Unfunded, planned infrastructure projects may be mentioned but the description should\nspecifically identify that these projects are not included in the base condition. Future year\nbackground traffic volumes shall be forecasted using historical growth rate information, regional\nmodels, and/or TIA reports for development approved by the Town but not yet built. A narrative\nand map shall be prepared that presents turning movement volumes for each peak hour for all\nintersections identified within the study area. Future year base volumes, other development\nvolumes, and site traffic volumes should be clearly separated, and combined in the map.\nj. Trip Generation - Base trip generation for the proposed land use(s) should be calculated using\ndata published in the latest version of the Institute of Transportation Engineers' (ITE) Trip\nGeneration Manual. Data limitations, data age, choice of peak hour or adjacent street traffic,\nchoice of independent variable, and choice of average rate versus equation shall be discussed at\nthe mandatory scoping meeting. Local trip generation rates may be acceptable if appropriate\nvalidation is provided by the Developer to support them. Any deviation from ITE trip generation\nrates shall be discussed in the mandatory scoping meeting and documented in the MOU if\napproved by Planning staff, the Town Engineer, and NCDOT. The NCDOT Municipal School\nTransportation Assistance (MSTA) calculator should be used to calculate projected trip\ngenerations for school sites.\nTOWN OF CORNELIUS LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE\n13 5\n12/19/2022\n"}, {"page": "190", "text": "CHAPTER 13: DEVELOPMENT PLAN SPECIFICATIONS\nInternal Capture - Base trip generation may be reduced by rate of internal capture when\ntwo or more land uses are proposed using methodology recommended in the most current\nTrip Generation Handbook published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers.\nReductions greater than 10% in any peak hour require consultation and acceptance by the\nPlanning staff, the Town Engineer and NCDOT. The internal capture reduction should be\napplied before pass-by trips are calculated.\nPass-by Trips - Pass-by trips are those made as intermediate trips between an origin and\nprimary destination (i.e., home to work, home to shopping, etc.). However, pass-by trips are\nnot diverted from another roadway. Base trip generation may be reduced by rate of pass-by\ncapture using methodology recommended in the most current Trip Generation Handbook\npublished by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. Pass-by trips associated with the\ndevelopment program may not exceed 10% of the existing volume reported for the adjacent\npublic street network. This network shall include the streets that provide primary access\nto/from the site. For example, a site access drive that connects to a low-volume local street,\nwhich its primary access is to a major collector road, the traffic on the major collector shall\nbe used as the adjacent street for pass-by calculation purposes. Evaluation of diverted trips\nmay apply depending on the specifics of each site. A trip generation table shall summarize\nall trip generation calculations for the project.\nk.\nTrip Distribution - External trip distribution shall be determined on a project-by-project basis\nusing one of several sources of information available to transportation and land planning\nprofessionals. Potential sources for determining project trip distribution may include the\nregional travel demand model, market analysis, existing traffic patterns, or professional\njudgment. At the Town's direction, multiple trip distributions may be required for differing land\nuse types. Regardless of methodology, the procedures followed and logic for estimating trip\ndistribution percentages must be well-documented in the TIA. Trip distribution percentages\nproposed for the surrounding transportation network should be discussed during the scoping\nmeeting and shall be approved by Planning staff, the Town Engineer, and NCDOT before\nproceeding with the TIA. A map showing the percentage of site traffic on each street included in\nthe study area should be included in the TIA.\nI.\nTrip Assignment - Project traffic shall be distributed to the surrounding transportation system\nbased on the site's trip generation estimates and trip distribution percentages. Future year\nbuild-out traffic forecasts (i.e., future year background traffic plus project traffic) shall be\npresented in both tabular and graphic formats for AM and PM peak hour conditions at all\nintersections included in the study area. If the project will be built in phases, traffic assignments\nshall be reported for each phase. Pass-by traffic shall be included at the driveways and access\npoints for evaluating driveway volumes. Multiple assignment analyses may be required if the\ntraffic control at the access drives varies (i.e., right-in/right-out VS. stop controlled vs.\nsignalized).\nm.\nCapacity Analysis - Level of Service (LOS) is the primary measurement for impacts to the\ntransportation system, and is defined by the most current edition of the Highway Capacity\nManual.

Unsignalized minor street approach LOS and delay shall be\nTOWN OF CORNELIUS LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE\n13 6\n12/19/2022\n"}, {"page": "191", "text": "CHAPTER 13: DEVELOPMENT PLAN SPECIFICATIONS\nreported according to HCM analysis, as reported by Synchro. LOS for existing signalized\nintersections shall be determined using existing signal timing plans provided by either the Town\nor NCDOT. Existing signal timing plans should be included in the appendix of the TIA report. If a\ntraffic signal is part of a coordinated system, it must be analyzed as such under all conditions.\nOther standard practices and default input values for evaluating signalized intersections should\nbe consistent with the most recent guidelines published by the NCDOT, Traffic Engineering and\nSafety Systems Branch, Congestion Management Unit (\"Capacity Analysis Guidelines\"). Planning\nstaff and the Town Engineer may also require safety, traffic simulation, gap and/or other\nanalyses appropriate for evaluating a development application. Additional analyses and/or\ntraffic capacity or simulation tools (such as VISSIM) required for the TIA shall be identified during\nthe scoping meeting. Capacity analyses shall be conducted to determine levels of service in each\npeak hour for all intersections, and their approaches, identified for study using methodologies\ncontained in the most current edition of the Highway Capacity Manual. Capacity calculations\nshould be included for the existing and all future year scenarios, as described in Section 7.i.\nImpacts from the proposed project shall be measured by comparing the Future year build year\nand the Future year no-build year conditions. Requirements for mitigation are described in\nSection 7.q. All TIA reports submitted to the Town shall use SYNCHRO, SimTraffic or VISSIM\nSoftware, for signalized and unsignalized intersections, or Sidra Software, for roundabouts,\nconsistent with policies released by the NCDOT. A narrative, table, and map shall be prepared\nthat summarizes the methodology and measured conditions at the intersections reported in\nlevel of service (LOS A - F), intersection and approach signal delay for signalized intersections,\napproach delay for unsignalized intersections, and 95th percentile queue lengths for all\nmovements. Capacity analysis worksheets and auxiliary turn lane warrants for unsignalized\nintersections should be included in the appendix of the TIA report.\nn.\nQueuing Analysis - 95th percentile and simulation analysis of future year queues shall be\nconsistent with NCDOT's Traffic Engineering and Safety Systems Branch, Congestion\nManagement Unit current practices and published Capacity Analysis Guidelines. Turn lanes for\nunsignalized driveways serving the site shall be identified using volume thresholds published in\nthe NCDOT's Policy on Street and Driveway Access to North Carolina Highways (see Warrant for\nLeft- and Right-Turn Lanes Nomograph, pg. 80). Recommendations for left and right turn lanes\nserving the site shall be designed to meet future year capacity needs identified in the TIA report.\nFor projects that include drive-through facilities, pick-up/drop-off areas or entrance gates, a\nqueuing analysis may be required by the Town to ensure that vehicle stacking will not adversely\nimpact the public transportation system. The queuing analysis must be performed using\naccepted transportation engineering procedures approved by the Town. This analysis shall be\nrequired for all drive-through facilities. If a TIA is required for a new school site, the consultant\nmust model the internal circulation and ingress/egress of the site using a \"dummy signal\" in the\nSYNCHRO software as prescribed by NCDOT Municipal School Transportation Assistance (MSTA)\ndepartment.\nO.\nCollision Analysis - A summary of crash data (type, number, and severity) for the most recent 3-\nyear period at each study location is required. Traffic Engineering Accident Analysis System\nreports will be provided by the Town and/or NCDOT and should be included in the appendix of\nthe TIA report. For locations with prevalent crash types and/or frequency, a discussion shall be\nincluded describing factors that may be contributing to the incidents.

If contributing factors are identified, recommendations to eliminate or mitigate these\nfeatures shall be included.\np.\nTraffic Signal Warrants - Town staff and NCDOT may consider potential signal locations at the\nscoping meeting. However, traffic flow progression is of paramount importance when\nconsidering a new traffic signal location. A new traffic signal should not cause an undesirable\ndelay to the surrounding transportation system. Installation of a traffic signal at a new location\nshall be based on the application of warrants criteria contained in the most current edition of\nthe Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and engineering judgment. Traffic\nsignal warrants should be included in the appendix of the TIA report. Additionally, spacing of\ntraffic signals within the Town must adhere to NCDOT requirements. Pedestrian movements\nmust be considered in the evaluation and adequate pedestrian clearance provided in the signal\ncycle split assumptions. If a signal warrant analysis is recommended in the TIA, the Town and/or\nNCDOT may decide to defer a signal warrant analysis until after the development has opened in\norder to use actual turning movement counts at an intersection. The TIA recommendations\nmust clearly state that this analysis shall occur at a specified date following the opening of the\ndevelopment. The Developer must issue a bond or letter of credit in the name of the Town for\nthe estimated cost of the signal warrant analysis and resulting signal prior to final approval of\nthe TIA. The cost shall be established based on an engineer's estimate provided by the engineer\nof record for the Developer, however final approval of the dollar amount rests with the Town.\nq. Mitigation Measure Recommendations - This section shall provide a description of the study's\nfindings regarding impacts of the proposed project on the existing and proposed transportation\nsystem and describe the location, nature, and extent of all mitigation measures recommended\nto the Developer to improve and/or maintain the future background year no-build level of\nservice (LOS) conditions through phasing and build-out of the project. This mitigation will be\nbased on the build-out year scenario. The Developer is only required to mitigate transportation\ndeficiencies for their development and not unacceptable background conditions or other\ndeficiencies caused by offsite development within the defined study area. The following LOS\ntable (Table 1), using the most recent Level of Service methodology, shall be used when\ndetermining the adequacy of intersection/approach within the applicable impact areas of town:\nWhere an intersection/approach is located within more than one zoning district, the less\nrestrictive LOS shall apply to the entire intersection or approach for purposes of complying with\nthis ordinance.

Nonconforming uses of land or structures, and nonconforming structures that contain\nnonconforming uses, may continue only in accordance with the provisions of this Section, but this\nSection shall only apply to the extent said nonconformities fully and clearly meet the definition of\n\"non-conforming use\" in Chapter 2 of this Code.\nB.\nNormal structural repair and maintenance may be performed to allow the continuation of a\nnonconforming use. Also, a nonconforming use may be re-established in case of damage (to an\nextent of less than 60% of its assessed value) due to fire or other disaster event pursuant to the\nissuance of a Special Use Permit by the Planning Board. This shall include, as well, the repair or\nreconstruction of any structure or on-site utility, parking or street infrastructure in support of said\nnonconforming use. If said structure was also nonconforming, the reconstruction shall meet the\ncurrent setback requirements of the applicable district. An application must be filed for such Special\nUse Permit no later than 30 days after the use has been destroyed or damaged, otherwise the use\nwill not be allowed to be rebuilt.\nC. A nonconforming non-residential use shall not be expanded, changed or enlarged, nor shall such a\nnonconforming use be enlarged by additions to the structure in which the nonconforming use is\nlocated (either attached or detached). However, if a nonconforming non-residential use can expand\nwithin the existing structure, it may do so as long as the Zoning Administrator determines that the\ninterior expansion will not have a negative impact upon surrounding conforming uses. Any\noccupation of additional lands beyond the boundaries of the lot on which said nonconforming use is\nlocated is prohibited. An existing nonconforming residential use located in a non-residential district\nmay, however, be enlarged or altered. Any such enlargement or alteration shall be in compliance\nwith all yard requirements of such structures as required in the specific district.\nD. Once a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter be used for\nany nonconforming use.\nE.\nIf a nonconforming use is abandoned for 180 days or more, the use shall not be allowed to re-\nestablish. All new uses in said structure shall thereafter be conforming. If said use is located in a\nstructure which is destroyed (i.e. received damage to an extent of more than 60% of its assessed\nvalue at the time of destruction), a use may only be allowed to re-establish in accordance with the\nzoning regulations in effect in the district in which it is located.

Normal repair and maintenance may be performed to allow the continuation of nonconforming\nstructures.\nC. A nonconforming structure may not, under any circumstances, be enlarged or altered in a way\nwhich increases its nonconformity.\nD.\nIf a nonconforming non-residential structure is damaged to an extent greater than 60% of its\nassessed value for tax purposes it shall be rebuilt only after the issuance of a Special Use Permit. A\nbuilding permit for reconstruction of such structure must be secured no later than 180 days from\nthe date of its destruction.

No nonconforming accessory use or accessory structure shall continue after the principal use or\nstructure is terminated by abandonment, damage, or destruction unless such accessory use or\naccessory structure thereafter is made to conform to the standards for the zoning district in which it\nis located. No non-conforming accessory use or structure shall become or replace any terminated\nprincipal non-conforming use or structure.\nSECTION 15.5: NONCONFORMING LOTS\nA nonconforming vacant lot may be developed for any of the uses permitted by these regulations in the\nzoning district in which it is located, provided that the use meets all applicable yard and setback\nrequirements for the zoning district in which the lot is located.\nSECTION 15.6: NONCONFORMING SIGNS\nA. Except as herein provided, nonconforming signs that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of\nthis Code may be continued.\nB. No person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a\nnonconforming sign or causes a previously conforming sign to become nonconforming.\nC.

There are also circumstances in which a general district\ndesignation allowing such a use by right, would not be appropriate for a particular property even though\nthe use itself could, if properly planned, be appropriate for the property consistent with the objectives\nof these regulations, the adopted \"Land Use Plan\", and/or other adopted plans. The development of\nthese uses cannot be predetermined or controlled by general district standards.\nConditional Zoning Districts (CZ) may be utilized to accommodate such situations by reclassification of\nproperty into a Conditional Zoning district, subject to specific conditions, which ensure compatibility of\nthe use with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties. This Section establishes specific\ndevelopment standards for these uses, which allow for flexibility in development while protecting\nexisting developed areas.\nThe rezoning process will apply to uses that are enumerated as \"Conditional Zoning\" in the \"Table of\nUses\" in Section 5.4.2. Conditional Zoning shall be subject to the specific procedural rules of this\nchapter. Major Subdivisions that meet the eligibility standards of a Conditional Zoning District shall be\nreviewed and acted upon as part of the rezoning process specified within this Section of the ordinance.\n18.5.1: Procedures For Conditional Zoning\nConditional Zoning districts are subject to predetermined ordinance standards, and the rules,\nregulations, and conditions imposed as part of the legislative decision creating the CZ district and\napplying it to the particular property.\nA Conditional Zoning district is generally not intended for securing early zoning for a proposal, except\nwhen that proposal is consistent with an approved district or area plan or the proposal can demonstrate\nthat public infrastructure needed to serve the development will be made available in a reasonable time\nperiod.\nThe conditional zoning process typically includes the following:\n1. Community Meeting this is the first opportunity for public input. This meeting is hosted by the\ndeveloper.\n2. Project Presentation and Public Comment this is the second opportunity for public input and\nwill be during a regularly scheduled Town Board meeting.\n3.
