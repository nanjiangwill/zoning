Residential density can exceed five (5) units\nper acre but no more than ten (10) units per acre.\nE. MA, Medical Arts\nThe Medical Arts district is established where hospitals, clinics, professional offices for\nmedical doctors, and other related medical facilities may be mixed to facilitate the\ninteraction between doctor and patient while maintaining a healthy environment for\nneighboring residential areas.

Where a sign projects over a public walkway, the clearance shall be measured\nas the smallest vertical distance from the lowest edge of such sign to the finished\ngrade of the sidewalk. Clearance shall be at least eight (8) feet.\n2.\nSign height shall be measured as the distance from the highest point of the sign\nto the average finished grade of the street closest to the sign.

Variances\nThe variance process administered by the Board of Adjustment is intended to provide limited\nrelief from the requirements of this ordinance. Variances may be applied where strict\napplication of a particular requirement will create a practical difficulty or unnecessary\nhardship prohibiting the use of the land in a manner otherwise allowed under this ordinance.\nHowever, in no event shall the Board of Adjustment grant a variance that would conflict with\nany state code, would allow the establishment of use which is not otherwise allowed in a\nparticular zoning district, or which would change the zoning district classification or the\ndistrict boundary of the property in question.\n1. Application Procedure. An application for a variance may be filed by the owner of\nthe property or by an agent specifically authorized by the owner to file such an\napplication. Staff shall review an application for a variance to determine if it is\ncomplete.

The Board of Adjustment may also attach conditions\nin order to reduce or minimize any injurious effect of such variance upon other\nproperty in the neighborhood and to ensure compliance with other terms of this\nordinance. Such conditions and safeguards must be reasonably related to the\ncondition or circumstance that gives rise to the need for a variance.\nd.

Carrying out the strict letter of the Ordinance would result in unnecessary\nhardship. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the\nvariance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.\nb. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as\nlocation, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances,\nas well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the\nneighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance.\nA variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate to make a\nreasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a person with\na disability.\nC.

The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of this\nordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.\nC. Special Use Permits\nSpecial uses are land uses that are generally compatible with the land uses permitted by\nright in a zoning district, but require individual review of their location, design, and\nconfiguration SO as to evaluate the potential for adverse impacts on adjacent property and\nuses. Special uses ensure the appropriateness of the use at a particular location within a given\nzoning district.\n1. Application Procedure.

The vesting period for a\nnonconforming use of property expires if the use is intentionally and voluntarily\ndiscontinued for a period of not less than twenty-four (24) consecutive months.\nC.
