A nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that\nuse when it became nonconforming, except that a use that involves the removal of natural materials from\nthe lot (e.g., a quarry) may be expanded to the boundaries of the lot where the use was established at the\ntime it became nonconforming, if 10 percent (10%) or more of the earth products had already been\nremoved at such time that zoning was adopted at the same location.\nC. Where a nonconforming situation exists, the equipment or processes may be changed if these or similar\nchanges amount only to changes in degree or activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other\nArticles of this Ordinance occur.\nD.

Mining operations for\npurposes of this Section are defined as those in operation or for which an application for a mining\npermit has been made to the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources.\n11.8 Planned Unit Development\n11.8.1 Purpose\nIt is recognized that only through ingenuity, imagination, and high quality design can\nplanned unit developments be produced which are in keeping with the intent of this\nOrdinance while departing from the strict application of conventional use and\ndimensional requirements. This is done by allowing design flexibility and a mix of\nresidential and nonresidential uses, and/or varying types of both residential and\nnonresidential uses. Coordination of such development with adequacy of public\nfacilities while maintaining the rural and small town character of Harnett County is a\nnecessity in this type of development.\nThe constructed and natural landmarks, and social and economic surroundings, are what\ncause someone to identify with a particular place or community. Characteristics of a\nlocation that make it readily recognizable as being unique and different from its\nsurroundings, and providing a feeling of belonging to or being identified with that\nparticular place warrant consideration when developing a planned unit development.\nThe characteristics of different uses, activities, and/or designs allow them to both be\nlocated in proximity to and in harmony with one (1) another through compatibility.\nElements affecting compatibility include: height, scale, mass, and bulk of structures;\npedestrian and vehicular traffic; vehicular circulation and access; landscaping; lighting;\nand mitigation of noise, odor, and air pollution. Compatibility is not intended to mean\nidentical; rather, compatibility refers to the sensitivity of development proposals in\nmaintaining the character of existing development and harmony of the different uses\nwithin the proposal with one (1) another.\nThe intent of the planned unit development regulations of Harnett County is to provide\nfor minimum, conventional development regulations, while allowing a developer the\nflexibility to determine how to attain superior development through the criteria listed\nherein.\n11.8.2 Development Criteria\nUnless otherwise stated or outlined herein, all requirements of this Ordinance shall be\nmet.\nA.

The hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly\nviolates the Ordinance, or who purchases the property after January 1, 1994, and then comes\nto the Board for relief.\ne.\nThe hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property, rather than the result of conditions that\nare widespread.
