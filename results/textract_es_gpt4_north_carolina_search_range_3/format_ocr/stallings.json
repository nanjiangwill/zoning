The Town seeks to be adaptable to changes in demographics and the market\nby building a Town that can withstand downturns in the economy and has a\nbuilt environment (buildings and infrastructure) that will have a lifespan of\nmore than one generation. Being an adaptive community is about using land\nwisely to prevent future problems, planning for the growth of Stallings and\nits surrounding communities, and giving thoughtful attention to the location,\ntype, density, and timing of development.\n(B.) The Town's unique geography and proximity to other communities creates\nopportunity for local and regional collaboration on issues and topics that\ntranscend one jurisdiction. The desire for multi-jurisdictional and regional\ncollaboration will be a key guide for the Town as it grows and develops over\nthe next decades.\n(C.) Communities that are intentional about their development, focus on high\nquality growth at key activity centers, provide a diverse range of land uses,\nfocus on connectivity, walkability, and human scaled development, and make\nplacemaking a priority, become destinations that attract others from outside\ntheir borders. Stallings is dedicated to becoming a destination and\nencouraging development that will attract people to the town.\n(D.) Placemaking is a people-centered approach to the planning, design, and\nmanagement of public spaces that enhances community identity, economic\nand community development, and brings the community together. The Town\nvalues the creation of \"community\" by developing civic and public gathering\nspaces that foster a sense of identity and connectedness.\n(E.) The Town aspires to provide a full range of land uses for employment,\nservices, and residential, at a variety of densities. Creating a diverse portfolio\nof land uses will require increased densities at select locations, where a\nmixture of land uses creates a walkable, vibrant environment.\n(F.) The Town values an intentional growth pattern that focuses density at key\nlocations and uses design principles to create a coordinated approach to site\nand building development. Transportation infrastructure sets the framework\nfor the Town's future land use opportunities and with a finite amount of land\navailable for growth, the Town has placed value on identifying areas where\nStallings DevelopmentOrdinance -Article1-Page 4\n"}, {"page": "17", "text": "the future development will have a profound impact on Stallings.\n1.5\nRelationship to Land Use and Comprehensive Master Plans\nThe administration, enforcement, and amendment of the Stallings Development\nOrdinance shall be carried out consistently with the \"Comprehensive Land Use\nPlan\", adopted November 27, 2017, including subsequent amendments adopted by\nthe\nTown Council of the Town of Stallings.

Public policy makers, citizens and developers all have a stake in\nunderstanding and responding to additional demands on the transportation system.

TIA Determination - The Town shall determine the need for a TIA upon receipt of any\ndevelopment application (by-right or rezoning) accompanied by a sketch or schematic\nplan.\nTypes of development applications could include, but are not limited to, multi- family\ndevelopments, single family developments, commercial developments, or industrial\ndevelopments. If warranted, the transportation consultant assigned by the Town shall\nprepare the TIA. At the discretion of the North Carolina Department of Transportation\n(NCDOT) and the Town, a Transportation Technical Memorandum, in lieu of a full TIA report,\nmay be allowed for some developments. If proposed street connections are not consistent\nwith adopted plans, then an explanation or proposed transportation mitigation alternative\nthat is equal or better shall be discussed in the study. NCDOT and the Town will be\nresponsible for determining whether the alternative mitigation plan meets and/or exceeds\nthe performance standards of the proposed street connections in the adopted plans.\nB.\nMinimum Thresholds for TIAs - A TIA will be required to accompany the sketch/schematic\nplan when expected gross trip generation is 1000 total trips or more both entering and\nexiting the site in a 24-hour period, and/or 100 total trips both entering and exiting the\nsite during either the AM or PM peak hours (prior to any trip reductions applied - see\nSection G(10)). The gross trip generation will be calculated by the Town based on\ninformation (proposed project summary and development plan) provided by the\napplicant and the final determination for requiring the TIA will be made by the Town.\nThe Town may also determine the need for a TIA or Transportation Technical Memorandum\nbased on special circumstances associated with the development, even if the gross trips\nfalls below this threshold. This may be due to location, an intersection or thoroughfare nearby\nthat is at or above capacity, the nature of the use, or one of the following:\n1. Traffic generated from a non-residential development that could potentially\nsignificantly impact adjacent residential neighborhoods.\n2.\nTraffic operation issues for current and/or future years on nearby streets are\nexpected to be significantly worsened by traffic generated from the proposed new\ndevelopment.\n3. Major and minor thoroughfares near the site are experiencing\nsignificant/unacceptable delays.\n4. Traffic safety issues exist at the intersection or street that would serve the\nproposed new development.\n5. The proposed land use differs significantly from the adopted Small Area Plans\nfor the Town and/or the Comprehensive Land Use Plan.\n6.

During the scoping meeting, staff may reduce the radius due to conditions\nspecific to the site based on request by applicant and supported with valid\nreasoning. Should study area intersections outside of the Town be identified,\nadjacent municipalities will be notified. Unsignalized intersections between the\nrequired signalized intersections will be added to the scope as directed by the\nTown. To initially determine the impacts, the Town will maintain a database of\nrecent peak- hour intersection turning movement counts. The applicable\nintersection counts will be equated to current year baseline volumes. Based on\nthe proposed development program submitted by the applicant, a preliminary trip\ngeneration analysis, distribution and assignment will be performed within the\narea surrounding the site and compared to the current year base volumes.\nRelated impacts or current operational problems, may dictate that other\nintersections be included in the study area as determined by Town staff and/or\nNCDOT staff. A narrative describing the study area shall identify the location of\nthe proposed project in relation to the existing transportation system and list the\nspecific study intersections and/or segments. Any unique transportation plans or\npolicies applicable to the area (e.g., CATS bus service and small area plans) shall\nbe mentioned.

Existing Conditions - Shall include a narrative and map that represents AM and\nPM peak-hour turning-movement volumes for all intersections within the study\narea. Traffic volumes shall represent 15-minute interval weekday turning-\nmovement counts (Tuesday through Thursday), include heavy- vehicle,\npedestrian and bicycle counts, no more than twelve months old and shall be\ncollected during periods of the year when local schools are in session and during\nweeks that have no observed federal, state, or local holidays and periods. The\nrequired count timeframes are from 6:00-9:00AM and 14:00-7:00PM. Site-specific\nconditions may necessitate additional or different traffic counting hours and/or\ndays depending on the development program and location within the Town.\nThese unique circumstances will be determined and directed by the Town. The\nTown will determine if modified peak hours or weekend analyses shall be\nincluded in the TIA at the mandatory scoping meeting. For example, 12- or 16-\nhour turning movement counts shall be required to complete the analysis if a\ntraffic signal warrant analysis is required as part of the TIA. The source of existing\ntraffic volume information shall be explicitly stated (e.g., Town counts, new counts\ncollected by the applicant, NCDOT counts, etc.). If previous counts were\nobtained, only counts collected within the one year of the scoping meeting will be\ndeemed acceptable.

Specific analysis periods to include in\nthe study shall depend greatly upon the development program, proposed project\nphasing plan, and significant improvements programmed for the surrounding\ntransportation system. The approved offsite developments and transportation\nprojects to be included in the base future-year background conditions for the\ntransportation system within the study area shall be determined during the\nscoping meeting. Transportation improvements assumed in the future-year\nbackground conditions analysis may include those with an expected completion\ndate concurrent with that of the development and funded either by the Town,\nNCDOT, or indicated as a required condition of approval from another nearby\ndevelopment application. Only projects approved by the Town at the scoping\nmeeting may be included in the analysis as future existing infrastructure. Those\nimprovements committed by other projects must be clearly identified in the report\nas approved offsite development road improvements. Adjacent development\ntraffic information used in the development of the future year background traffic\nvolumes shall be included in the appendix of the TIA report. Unfunded, planned\ninfrastructure projects may be mentioned in the TIA, but the description shall\nspecifically identify that these projects are not included in the background\ncondition. Future year background traffic volumes shall be forecasted using\nhistorical growth rate information, regional models, and/or TIA reports for\ndevelopment approved by the Town but not yet built. A narrative and map shall\nbe prepared that presents turning movement volumes for each peak hour for all\nintersections identified within the study area. Future year base traffic volumes,\nother development volumes, and site traffic volumes shall be clearly separated\nand combined in the map.\n10. Trip Generation - Base trip generation for the proposed land use(s) shall be\ncalculated using data published in the latest version of the Institute of\nTransportation Engineers' (ITE) Trip Generation Manual. Data limitations, data\nage, choice of peak hour of adjacent street traffic, choice of independent variable,\nand choice of average rate versus equation shall be discussed at the mandatory\nscoping meeting. Local trip generation rates may be acceptable if appropriate\nvalidation is provided by the applicant to support them. Any deviation from ITE\ntrip generation rates shall be discussed in the mandatory scoping meeting and\ndocumented in the MOU if approved by the Town and NCDOT. The NCDOT\nMunicipal School Transportation Assistance (MSTA) calculator shall be used to\ncalculate projected trip generations for school sites.\na.\nInternal Capture - Base trip generation may be reduced by rate of internal\ncapture when two or more land uses are proposed using methodology\nrecommended in the most current Trip Generation Handbook published\nby the ITE, or research published by the National Cooperative Highway\nResearch Program (NCHRP) Transportation Research Board.\nReductions for internal capture shall be applied to multi- or mixed-use\nsites only. The internal capture reduction shall be applied before pass-by\ntrips are calculated.\nb. Pass-by Trips - Pass-by trips are those made as intermediate trips\nbetween an origin and primary destination (i.e., home to work, home to\nshopping, etc.). However, pass-by trips are not diverted from another\n6\n"}, {"page": "166", "text": "roadway. Base trip generation may be reduced by rate of pass-by capture\nusing methodology recommended in the most current Trip Generation\nHandbook published by the ITE. Pass-by trips associated with the\ndevelopment program may not exceed 10% of the peak-hour volume\nreported for the adjacent public street network. This network shall include\nthe streets that provide primary access to/from the site. For example, if a\nsite access drive that connects to a low-volume local street, which its\nprimary access is to a major collector road, the traffic on the major\ncollector shall be used as the adjacent street for pass-by calculation\npurposes. Evaluation of diverted trips may apply depending on the\nspecifics of each site. A trip generation table shall summarize all trip\ngeneration calculations for the project.\n11. Trip Distribution - External trip distribution shall be determined on a project- by-\nproject basis using one of several sources of information available to\ntransportation and land planning professionals. Potential sources for determining\nproject trip distribution may include the regional travel demand model, market\nanalysis, existing traffic patterns, or professional judgment. At the Town's\ndirection, multiple trip distributions may be required for differing land use types.\nRegardless of methodology, the procedures followed and logic for estimating trip\ndistribution percentages must be well- documented in the TIA. Trip distribution\npercentages proposed for the surrounding transportation network shall be\ndiscussed during the scoping meeting and shall be approved by the Town and\nNCDOT before proceeding with the TIA. A map showing the percentage of site\ntraffic on each street included in the study area shall be included in the TIA.\n12. Trip Assignment - Project traffic shall be distributed to the surrounding\ntransportation system based on the site's trip generation estimates and trip\ndistribution percentages. Future year build-out traffic forecasts (i.e., future year\nbackground traffic plus project traffic) shall be represented in graphic formats for\nAM and PM peak-hour conditions at all intersections included in the study area.\nIf the project will be built in phases, traffic assignments shall be reported for each\nphase. Pass-by traffic shall be included at the driveways and access points for\nevaluating driveway volumes. Multiple assignment analyses may be required if\nthe traffic control at the access drives varies (i.e., right-in/right-out VS. stop\ncontrolled VS. signalized).\n13. Operations Analysis - The TIA shall include multi-modal operations analyses\nincluding vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle, to allow for the safe and convenient\ntravel for all modes. Level-of-Service (LOS) and delay is the primary measures\nof effectiveness for impacts to the transportation system, and is defined by the\nmost current edition of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). Operations\nanalyses shall be performed for the existing and all future year scenarios, as\ndescribed in Section G (17)). Impacts from the proposed project shall be\nmeasured by comparing the future year background conditions to the future year\nbuild-out conditions. Requirements for mitigation are described in Section G (17).\na. Vehicular Capacity Analysis - Unless otherwise noted, Synchro LOS and\ndelay shall be reported for all signalized intersections and approaches\nidentified in the study area. Based on HCM, LOS for unsignalized\nintersections is not defined as a whole; instead, only the individual stop-\n7\n"}, {"page": "167", "text": "controlled or yield approaches shall be reported based on the HCM\nreports determined through the Synchro analysis. Existing signalized\nintersections shall be modeled based on existing signal timing plans\nprovided by either the Town or NCDOT. Existing signal timing plans shall\nbe included in the appendix of the TIA report. If a traffic signal is part of a\ncoordinated system it must be analyzed as such under all conditions.\nOther standard practices and default input values for evaluating\nsignalized intersections shall be consistent with the most recent\nguidelines published by the NCDOT, Traffic Engineering and Safety\nSystems Branch, Congestion Management Unit (\"Capacity Analysis\nGuidelines\"). The Town may also require safety, traffic simulation, gap\nand/or other analyses appropriate for evaluating a development\napplication. Additional analyses and/or traffic capacity or simulation tools\n(such as VISSIM or Transmodeler) required for the TIA shall be identified\nduring the scoping meeting. All TIA reports submitted to the Town shall\nuse Synchro, SimTraffic, VISSIM and/or Transmodeler analysis software\nfor signalized and unsignalized intersections, or Sidra Software for\nroundabouts, consistent with policies released by the NCDOT. A\nnarrative, table, and map shall be prepared that summarizes the\nmethodology and measured conditions at the intersections reported in\nLOS (LOS A - F), the intersection and approach signal delay for\nsignalized intersections, the approach delay for unsignalized\nintersections, and 95th percentile queue lengths for all movements.\nCapacity analysis worksheets and auxiliary turn-lane warrants for\nunsignalized intersections shall be included in the appendix of the TIA\nreport.\nb. Pedestrian Operations Analysis - Unless otherwise noted, methodology\nprovided in the latest edition of the Highway Capacity Manual shall be\nused to evaluate pedestrian LOS for the intersections identified in the\nstudy area. The current methodology is based on geometric data, demand\ndata, and signal control data including, but not limited to:\nNumber of lanes on the major street\nCrossing distance\nTraffic volumes\nMotorist yielding rates to pedestrians\nCycle Length\nWalk Time\nPresence of pedestrian phase\nC. Bicycle Operations Analysis - The bicycle LOS at intersections identified\nin the study area shall be evaluated using locally accepted methodology.\nThis current methodology assesses bicyclists' comfort based on\ngeometric and traffic signal features including, but not limited to:\nNumber of lanes crossed\nPresence of conflicting turning movements\nPresence of bike lanes\nUnder this methodology, intersection features are assigned points,\nwhere the LOS for each approach is calculated based on the\naccumulation of points for each geometric and traffic signal feature\nidentified in the worksheet.

Queuing Analysis - 95th percentile and simulation analysis of future year queues\nshall be consistent with NCDOT's Traffic Engineering and Safety Systems\nBranch, Congestion Management Unit current practices and published Capacity\nAnalysis Guidelines. Turn lanes and storage lengths for the major street\n(uncontrolled) approaches at unsignalized intersections shall be identified using\nvolume thresholds published in the NCDOT's Policy on Street and Driveway\nAccess to North Carolina Highways (see Warrant for Left- Right- Turn Lanes\nNomograph, pg. 80). Recommendations for left and right-turn lanes serving the\nsite shall be designed to account for both the NCDOT warrants described above\nand to meet future year capacity needs identified through the capacity analyses.\nFor projects that include drive-through facilities, pick- up/drop-off areas,\nor\nentrance gates, a queuing analysis may be required by the Town to ensure that\nvehicle stacking will not adversely impact the public transportation system. The\nqueuing analysis must be performed using accepted transportation engineering\nprocedures approved by the Town. If a TIA is required for a new school site, the\ninternal circulation and ingress/egress of the site shall be modeled using a\n\"dummy signal\" in the Synchro software as prescribed by NCDOT Municipal\nSchool Transportation Assistance (MSTA) department.\n15. Crash Analysis - A summary of crash data (type, number, and severity) for the\nmost recent 3-year period at each study location is required. Traffic Engineering\nAccident Analysis System reports will be provided by the Town and/or NCDOT\nand shall be included in the appendix of the TIA report. For locations with\nprevalent crash types and/or frequency, a discussion shall be included describing\nfactors that may be contributing to the incidents. At a minimum, the proposed\ndevelopment features shall not contribute to factors potentially involved in the\nexisting crash rates. If contributing factors are identified, recommendations to\neliminate or mitigate these features shall be included.\n16. Traffic Signal Warrants - Town staff and/or NCDOT may consider potential signal\nlocations at the scoping meeting. However, traffic flow progression is of\nparamount importance when considering a new traffic signal location. A new\ntraffic signal shall not cause an undesirable delay to the surrounding\ntransportation system. Installation of a traffic signal at a new location shall be\nbased on the application of warrants criteria contained in the most current edition\nof the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and engineering\njudgment. Traffic signal warrants shall be included in the appendix of the TIA\nreport. Additionally, spacing of traffic signals within the Town must adhere to\nNCDOT requirements. Pedestrian movements must be considered in the\nevaluation and adequate pedestrian clearance provided in the signal cycle split\nassumptions. If a signal warrant analysis is recommended in the TIA, the Town\nand/or NCDOT may decide to defer a signal warrant analysis until after the\ndevelopment has opened to allow use of actual turning movement counts at an\nintersection. The TIA recommendations must clearly state that this analysis shall\noccur at a specified date following the opening of the development. The applicant\nmust issue a bond or letter of credit in the name of the Town for the estimated\ncost of the signal warrant analysis and resulting signal prior to final approval\nof\nthe TIA. The cost shall be established based on an engineer's\n9\n"}, {"page": "169", "text": "estimate provided by t the consultant identified by the Town.\n17. Mitigation Measure Recommendations - This section of the TIA report shall\nprovide a description of the study's findings regarding impacts of the proposed\nproject on the existing and future transportation system and describe the location,\nnature, and extent of all mitigation measures recommended to the applicant to\nimprove and/or maintain the future year background level-of-service (LOS)\nconditions through phasing and ultimate build-out of the project. This mitigation\nwill be identified by measuring the impact between the future year background\nconditions and the future year build-out conditions. The applicant is required to\nmitigate transportation deficiencies caused solely by the projected impact of their\nproposed development, and not unacceptable background conditions or other\ndeficiencies caused by offsite development within the defined study area.\nThe applicant shall be required to identify mitigation improvements to the\ntransportation network if at least one of the following conditions exists when\ncomparing the multimodal operations analyses of future year background\nconditions to future year build-out conditions:\na. the total average delay at an intersection or individual approach increases\nby 25% or greater, while maintaining the same LOS,\nb. the LOS degrades by at least one level,\nC. or the LOS is at or below the LOS threshold dictated by the zoning (as\noutlined in Table 1) in background conditions and the proposed project\nshows a negative impact on the intersection or approach\nThe following LOS table (Table 1), using the most recent Level of Service\nmethodology, shall be used when determining the adequacy of\nintersection/approach within the applicable impact areas of the Town:\nWhere an intersection/approach is located within more than one zoning district\nand is not located within a small area plan boundary, the less restrictive LOS shall\napply to the entire intersection or approach for purposes of complying with this\nordinance.\nIf the background LOS (intersection or approach) is inadequate (i.e., at or below\nthe threshold), the applicant will be expected to mitigate only the impact caused\nby the proposed project.

Farmland is a\ndefining element of Stallings's traditional identity and the protection of these lands\naids in preserving the character of the Town. Listed uses are limited, with an\nemphasis on uses that are agricultural in nature.\nDevelopment density is very low to encourage preservation of agricultural lands\nwhile discouraging large lot residential development. The Agriculture District can\nalso be used to protect open spaces.\nThe Single-Family Residential Districts (SFR-1, SFR-2, SFR-3, and SFR-MH)\nprovide for the completion of existing residential neighborhoods and the\ndevelopment of new residential neighborhoods. Allowed building/lot types in the\nSingle-Family Districts are Detached House. Listed uses are restricted to single\nfamily homes and their accessory uses. Neighborhoods in these districts are the\ndominant land use in Stallings and are a major element in defining the character of\nthe community. Standards for the Single-Family Residential Districts promote that\nnew development maintains the character of the community. The Single-Family\nResidential Districts permit the completion and conformity of conventional\nresidential subdivisions already existing or approved in sketch plan form by the\nTown of Stallings prior to the effective date of these regulations.\nThe Multi-Family Residential Transitional District (MFT) provides for the\ncompletion of existing multi-family residential neighborhoods in the residential\narea(s). The intent of this district is to recognize that gradual transformation of\nexisting development to high quality mixed density residential development is\nneeded to support the central core of the Town. Higher density residential\ndevelopment allows a greater number of households to walk or bike, thus reducing\nthe parking demand and providing environmental and health benefits. Allowed\nbuilding/lot types in these districts are the Detached House, Attached House, and\nMulti-family Building. Streets in the Multi-Family Residential Transitional District\nshould be interconnected, with streets and sidewalks providing a connection from\nStallings's Town Center and other mixed-use districts to the Single-Family\nResidential districts surrounding these neighborhoods.

The development pattern seeks to integrate\nshops, restaurants, services, workplaces, civic, educational, religious facilities, and\nhigher density housing in a compact, pedestrian-oriented environment.\nThe Town Center District serves as the hub of the surrounding neighborhoods and\nof the broader community. The Town Center District may be expanded over time to\nmeet the needs of the growing community for downtown facilities and services.\nExpansion of the Town Center District shall be contiguous and not separated from\nthe primary district area.\nThe Civic District (CIV) provides a location for educational, medical, religious, and\nother public uses. Large developments in the Civic District are encouraged to\nprovide a master plan to the Town. Institutional uses in the Civic District are\nrequired to provide pedestrian connections on their campuses and, to the extent\npossible, develop an internal street system with structures fronting on the streets.\nParking should not be the dominant visible element of the campuses developed for\ninstitutional uses.

The Scenic Corridor Overlay District (SCO) is established to protect\nthe pastoral scenes and open spaces that provide a sense of arrival for\nresidents and visitors traveling the major entrance roads and gateways to the\nTown. The pastoral scenes and undeveloped property along the entrance\nroads and gateways contribute significantly to Stallings's community\ncharacter and sense of place. The Scenic Corridor Overlay District provides\ndevelopment options for the owners of the property abutting the entrance\nroads and gateways. The goal of this district is to protect the scenic value of\nthe corridors through a mix of incentives and development standards. These\nstandards will preserve the suburban character of the Town by maintaining\nthe sense of a suburban corridor in an urban environment; provide an\naesthetically appealing experience for those traveling the corridor; provide\nmulti-modal transportation options for travel; and promote a safe\ntransportation corridor for motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians.\n(B.) Types. Three (3) types of scenic corridors are hereby created:\n(1.) Suburban Scenic Corridor - A corridor along which development is limited,\nconsisting largely of fields, pastures, and scattered residential uses. The\nsuburban scenic corridor evokes a sense of traveling through an\nundeveloped area, with pastoral scenes and a sense of being removed from\nthe urban environment.\n(2.) Gateway Scenic Corridor - A corridor that serves as an entrance way to a\nplace that is unique and different from other communities in the area. The\ngateway corridor provides a sense of arrival to a place that is special and\ndifferent from the typical places.

to ensure that new\ndevelopment and construction is enduring and compatible with the character of the\nTown of Stallings, that it accomplishes the purposes of this Ordinance, and that it\nachieves the goals identified in the adopted Comprehensive Land Use Plan and\nother adopted and or approved plans.\n9.2\nDetached House Lot and Building Type\n9.2-1\nDescription. The detached house is the most prevalent building type in\nStallings. The detached house building type is generally found in residential\nneighborhoods, although it may coexist with other, similarly scaled buildings\nin commercial or mixed-use areas. Where possible, structures should be\ndesigned to maintain a harmonious image of the neighborhood when viewed\nfrom a distance. Where appropriate and possible, structures shall be designed\nto terminate vistas. For detached homes on large lots accessed by a private\ndrive, building placement and site planning shall be dictated by landscape\nfeatures and landscape preservation. Within the limits described below and\nunless the zoning district standards require greater measures, these\nregulations shall apply to all houses built in the Town of Stallings.\nThe photographs of detached single-family houses in the Carolinas below are\nexamples for illustration purposes only and not intended to regulate\nlot/building styles, patterns, or forms.\nStallings Development Ordinance - Article 9 - Page 191\n"}, {"page": "216", "text": "CELL (1, 1): \n9.2-2\nCELL (1, 2): \nDetached House Lot Type.\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \n(A.)

These buildings must\nbe designed to take their appropriate places within neighborhoods as integral\nparts of the community. It is expected that the scale and architectural\nsophistication of these buildings will match their civic importance. Civic\nstructures should be designed to serve as key focal points in the neighborhood.\nWhen located at intersections or other appropriate locations, Civic Buildings\nshall be designed to terminate vistas. The intention of buildings in all\nlocations must be to relate the principal facade to the sidewalk and public\nspace of the street. Civic buildings shall not be set back on the lot behind a\nstandard parking lot; however, a plaza may be used for occasional parking\nand/or passenger drop-off.
