Vested Rights\n30-1.I.1. Site-Specific Vesting Plan\nPursuant to North Carolina Gen Stats. 160D-108.1, the following applies to site-specific vesting plans:\na. Establishment of Vested Right. A vested right is established with respect to any property upon the valid\napproval, or conditional approval, of a site-specific vesting plan as provided in this Section. Such a vested\nright confers upon the landowner the right to undertake and complete the development and use of the\nproperty under the terms and conditions of the site-specific vesting plan, including any amendments\nthereto. At the time of approval of a site-specific vesting plan, the document that triggers the vesting shall\nbe so identified.\nb. Site-Specific Vesting Plan. A site-specific vesting plan consists of a plan submitted by the applicant in\nwhich the applicant requests vesting, describing with reasonable certainty on the plan the type and\nintensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of property. The plan may be in the form of, but not be\nlimited to, any of the following plans or approvals; a planned unit development plan, a subdivision plat, a\npreliminary or general development plan, a special use permit, or a conditional district zoning plan. The\nplan shall include the approximate boundaries of the site; significant topographical and other natural\nfeatures affecting development of the site, the approximate location on the site of the proposed buildings,\nstructures, and other improvements; the approximate dimensions, including height, of the proposed\nbuildings and other structures; and the approximate locaton of all existing and proposed infrastructure\non the site, including water, sewer, roads, and pedestrian walkways. A variance does not constitute a site-\nspecific vesting plan, and approval of a site-specific vesting plan with the condition that a variance be\nobtained does not confer a vested right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained. If a sketch\nplan or other document fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a\nspecified parcel or parcels of property, it may not constitute a site-specific vesting plan.\n1. Approval and Amendment of Site-Specific Vesting Plans. Pursuant to North Carolina Gen. Stats.\n160D-108.1(c), if a site-specific-vesting plan is based on the approval of a development application,\nthe City shall provide whatever notice and hearing is required for that underlying approval. A duration\nof the underlying approval that is less than two years does not affect the duration of the site-specific\nvesting plan. If the site-specific vesting plan is not based on such an approval, a legislative hearing\nwith notice shall be held.\n2.\nDuration and Termination of Vested Right. A vested right for a site-specific vesting plan remains vested\nfor a period of two years unless extended under the terms of North Carolina Gen. Stats.\n160D-108.1(e).\n(Ord. No. S2021-011, \u00a7 1, 05/10/2021)\n30-1.1.2. Development Permits and Permit Choice\nIn accordance with Section 160D-108(d) of the North Carolina General Statutes, the issuance of a\ndevelopment permit, as defined in North Carolina Gen. Stats. 143-755(e)(2), establishes a vested right to\ndevelopment authorized by the development permit so long as the permit remains valid and unexpired. In\naccordance with Section 143-755 of the North Carolina General Statutes, in the event of an amendment to\nany applicable development regulation, between the time the permit application was submitted and the\ntime a decision is made, the applicant may choose which adopted version of the rule or ordinance will apply\nto the permit and use of the building, structure, or land indicated on the permit application.

No. S2021-011, \u00a7 1, 05/10/2021)\n30-1.1.3. Vested Rights Certificate\nA vested right to development approval of a Minor Site Plan, Major Site Plan, Subdivision Plan, or Final Plat\nmay be established in accordance with Section 30-2.C.19, Vested Rights Certificate.\n(Ord. No. S2021-011, \u00a7 1, 05/10/2021)\n30-1.1.4 Multi-Phased Development\nAs provided in North Carolina Gen. Stats. 160D-108(f), a multi-phased development is vested for the entire\ndevelopment with the regulations then in place at the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial\nphase of the multi-phased development. A right which has been vested as provided for in this subsection\nremains vested for a period of seven years from the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase\nof the multi-phased development. As used in this Section, a multi-phased development is a development\ncontaining 25 acres or more that is both of the following:\na. Submitted for development permit approval to occur in more than one phase;\nb. Subject to a master development plan with committed elements showing the type and intensity of use of\neach phase.\n(Ord. No. S2021-011, \u00a7 1, 05/10/2021)\n30-1.J. Severability\nIt is the legislative intent of the City Council in adopting this Ordinance that all provisions shall regulate\ndevelopment in accordance with the existing and future needs of the City as established in this Ordinance\nand promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the land owners and residents of the City.

Purpose\nThe purpose of this section is to provide an administrative mechanism for allowing minor modifications,\nwhich are minimal variations, or adjustments, to certain numerical or other standards of the zoning\nprovisions based on very specific criteria, with the intent of providing relief where application of a\nstandard creates practical difficulties in allowing development that otherwise advances the purposes\nserved by the standards and is compatible with the area. Administrative Adjustments of numerical\nstandards shall not exceed ten percent unless explicitly provided for in this Chapter.\nb. Applicability\n1. Administrative Adjustments may be requested and granted for minor modifications to special use\npermits, development approvals, and conditional rezoning (conditional districts) as provided by\nNorth Carolina Gen. Stats. 160D-403(d), 160D-703(b), and 160D-705(c). Minor modifications allow\nfor deviations from numerical standards of up to ten percent in accordance with Section 30-2.C.16.e,\nAdministrative Adjustment Standards. Furthermore, this section is intended to provide for\nconsideration of alternative designs, solutions or plans to address unusual circumstances,\nadjustments needed to support critical utility emergency services, and to promote creative design in\nthe pursuit of excellence in development. As applied to utilities and provision of critical services\nduring emergencies, an Administrative Adjustment may be requested for such standards as outdoor\nstorage and other requirements impacting the ability to provide or restore service during\nemergencies; conditions to assure safe and attractive facilities relative to surrounding development\nmay be part of the approval. As applied to separation standards, except when a reduction in the\nseparation standard is explicitly precluded by Section 30-4.C, an administrative adjustment may be\nrequested to include up to a ten percent reduction in separation standards when natural or man-made\nelements achieve the same intent and effects of the required separation and the requested adjustment\nare in accordance with Section 30-2.C.16.e.\na. Reasonable Accommodations. Administrative Adjustments may include modifications necessary to\nprovide reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities. The purpose of a reasonable\naccommodation is to modify a specific development requirement to ensure an individual with a\ndisability has an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling, consistent with the Federal Fair\nHousing Act and Americans with Disabilities Act. Reasonable accommodation means providing\ndisabled persons flexibility in the application of regulations and procedures, or even waiving\ncertain requirements, when necessary to eliminate barriers to housing opportunities. Reasonable\naccommodation does not include an accommodation which would (1) impose an undue financial or\nadministrative burden on the City; or (2) require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the\nCity's land use and zoning program. Disabled person means a person with a physical or mental\nimpairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities; or with a record of such\n82 of 469\n6/1/2024, 7:21 PM\n"}, {"page": "83", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nimpairment ; or is regarded as having such an impairment.

Development Agreement\na. Purpose\nThe purpose of this section is to establish standards and procedures for the City entering into\nDevelopment Agreements for long-term, large-scale developments, in recognition of the following\nfindings and statements of intent:\n1. Large-Scale Development Projects and Long-Term Commitment of Resources\nLarge-scale development projects often occur in multiple phases extending over a period of years,\nrequiring a long-term commitment of both public and private resources.\n2. Potential Community Impacts\nSuch large-scale developments often create potential community impacts and potential opportunities\nthat are difficult or impossible to accommodate within traditional zoning processes.\n3. Careful Integration between Public Capital Facilities Planning, Financing, Schedules\nBecause of their scale and duration, such large-scale projects often require careful integration\nbetween public capital facilities planning, financing, and construction schedules and the phasing of the\nprivate development.\n4. Stable Development Standards\nBecause of their scale and duration, such large-scale projects involve substantial commitments of\nprivate capital by private developers, which private developers are unwilling to risk without sufficient\nassurances that development standards will remain stable through the extended period of the\ndevelopment.\n5. Nontraditional Development Types\nBecause of their size and duration, such developments often permit communities and developers to\nexperiment with different or nontraditional types of development concepts and standards, while still\nmanaging the impacts on the surrounding areas.\n6. Negotiating Flexibility\nTo better structure and manage development approvals for such large-scale developments and ensure\ntheir proper integration into local capital facilities programs, local governments need the flexibility in\nnegotiating such developments.\n7. Plan Consistency\nIn negotiating for such developments, it is the intent of the City to remain consistent with the adopted\nplans, policies, and goals of the City as they relate to land use and capital improvements.\nb. Authority\nThe City may enter into a Development Agreement with a developer, subject to the procedures and\nstandards of this section. In entering into such a Development Agreement, the City may not exercise any\nauthority or make any commitment not authorized by general or local act, and may not impose any tax or\nfee not authorized by otherwise applicable law. If more than one local government is made party to an\nagreement, the agreement must specify which local government is responsible for the overall\nadministration of the Development Agreement.\nC. Relationship to Prior Development Approvals\nAlthough an application for a Development Agreement generally is submitted and reviewed before, or in\nconjunction with, the first development approval required for the proposed development (e.g., Planned\nDevelopment), such an application may be submitted and decided at any stage of the development. If the\napplication is submitted after development approvals have been granted, either the Development\nAgreement should incorporate the terms and conditions of those prior approvals or any approval of the\nDevelopment Agreement shall be contingent upon any amendments to those prior approvals necessary\nto ensure conformance between the Development Agreement and applicable development approvals.\nd.

Organization of Base Zoning District Regulations\nSections 30-3.0 through 30-3.E set out the general purposes of each group of base zoning districts and\ncontain subsections that set out the specific purpose, bulk, and dimensional standards for each individual\nbase zoning district. These subsections have a common structure consisting of a purpose statement,\napplicable dimensional standards, a photograph showing a hypothetical preferred building form for the\ndistrict, a graphic depiction of hypothetical street layout and lot patterns, and a hypothetical graphic\ndepiction of the district's bulk and dimensional standards as applied to typical lot patterns and building\nforms. The building form photographs and lot pattern diagrams are for illustrative purposes only, and\nmay not be consistent with all the dimensional requirements. In these cases, the dimensional\nrequirements text of this Ordinance shall control. Article 30-4: Use Standards, includes Table 30-4.A, Use\nTable, a summary use table specifying permitted, special, and allowable uses for each of the base zoning\ndistricts and references any standards specific to individual uses.\n(Ord.

Zero Lot Line Applicability\nIn addition to traditional development, this Ordinance also allows zero lot line development in the\nagricultural, residential and business districts to provide flexibility in lot layout for greater development\nefficiency and density and/or in addressing site constraints. The zero lot line standards are allowed in the\ndistricts identified in Section 30-3.B.2.a, Applicability and subject to meeting certain conditions. Zero lot line\ndevelopment is subject to review and approval of a Major Site Plan (see Section 30-2.C.5). Zero lot line\ndevelopment on a tract or site smaller than three acres also requires a Special Use Permit (see Section\n30-2.C.7). Zero lot line development is subject to all applicable use standards (Article 30-4), subdivision\nrequirements (Article 30-6), and applicable design and development standards (Article 30-5).\na. Applicability\n1. Districts\nZero lot line development is allowed in the agricultural, residential and business (AR, SF-15, SF-10,\nSF-6, MR-5, OI, NC, LC, CC, MU, and BP, LI and HI) zoning districts subject to specific conditions noted\nbelow.\nb. Procedure\n1. Major Site Plan Required\nAll applications for zero lot line development shall be reviewed as a Major Site Plan in accordance\nwith the procedures and requirements in Section 30-2.C.5, Site Plan.\n2. Simultaneous Review\nThe review of the application for a Major Site Plan, Special Use Permit, Conditional Zoning or\nNeighborhood Compatibility Permit (if required), and Alternative Plans (landscaping or parking, as\nmay be applicable), or Administrative Adjustment, if requested, shall be conducted simultaneously, to\nthe maximum extent possible.\nC. Standards\n1. Density\nZero lot line development shall comply with the maximum allowable gross density and maximum\nheight requirements in the base zoning district where proposed, and the following standards:\n2. Required Setbacks\nExcept as otherwise provided in this subsection, lots and yard setbacks internal to a zero lot line\ndevelopment may deviate from the minimum yard and lot area requirements, but perimeter lots must\nmeet the front and corner side setbacks of the underlying zoning district. However, setbacks\n99 of 469\n6/1/2024, 7:21\n"}, {"page": "100", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nassociated with an overlay district or any applicable setbacks from natural resources shall apply to all\nlots within a zero lot line development.\n3. Compliance with Design Standards\nAll zero lot line development regardless of size (number of units) shall comply with all applicable\ndevelopment standards in Article 30-5: Development Standards, including the Single-Family, Multi-\nFamily, Commercial, Office, and Mixed-Use, Large Retail, and Transitional Standards in Article 30-5:\nDevelopment Standards, as applicable.\n4. Conditions for residential development:\na. Orientation: Except as provided below, all dwellings on the exterior of a ZLL development that\nadjoin an existing street shall be oriented so that the front fa\u00e7ade faces the adjoining street. In the\ncase of corner lots, the front fa\u00e7ade shall face the street from which the dwelling derives its street\naddress. A dwelling may be designed to have more than one \"front fa\u00e7ade.\"\nException (requires a Neighborhood Compatibility Permit for developments on a tract or site\nsmaller than three acres): When rear or side yards face the adjoining existing street(s), a Type 'A'\nProperty Perimeter Buffer (see Table 30-5.B.4.D.4.) shall be provided along the affected street(s).\nAny fences or walls installed shall be interior to this buffer and shall comply with the design\nstandards of Article 30-5 for fences and walls. Gates or openings in such fences and walls may be\nprovided for access purposes, including maintenance. Such buffers shall be shown on any final\nplans, plats or deeds, as applicable.\nb. Parking: Vehicle Use Areas on perimeter lots in single-family districts and small multifamily\nprojects shall not exceed 50 percent of the area between the street right-of-way and the front\nfa\u00e7ade of the structure(s).\nC. Neighborhood Context: When a ZLL development is proposed on a tract or site smaller than three\nacres along a street where the median platted lot size of the lots adjoining the street in the block in\nwhich the development is proposed is 200% or more than the minimum lot size of the underlying\nzoning district(s), a Neighborhood Compatibility Permit shall be required.\nd. Tiered Development: When a ZLL development is proposed with principal structures located\nbehind other principal structures that front on adjoining streets and such principal structures are\nnot \"shielded\" by the frontage structures for 25% or more than the length of the frontage, excluding\nthe width of drives or streets, a Neighborhood Compatibility Permit is required on a tract or site\nsmaller than three acres, except when the affected street or streets are four lanes or more in width.\nSee Figure 30-3.B.2 below.\nFigure 30-3.B.2\n100 of 469\n6/1/2024, PM\n"}, {"page": "101", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nDO\n25% or more\nShielded - No NCP Required\nNot Shielded - NCP Required\n(Ord.

No. S2012-024, \u00a7 4, 11-13-2012)\n30-3.F.2. Purpose\nThe rezoning of land to a conditional zoning district is intended to provide a landowner and the City an\nalternative to rezoning the land to a standard base zoning district, where the base zoning district allows\ncertain uses and development that may be appropriate but also allows uses and development that may not\nconform to City plans or would have adverse impacts on public facilities or surrounding lands.\nReclassification of land to a conditional zoning district allows a landowner to propose, and the City Council\nto consider, additional conditions or restrictions on the range of allowable uses, use standards, development\nintensities, development standards, and other regulations applicable in the parallel base zoning district.\nThis enables the City to tailor a zoning classification to accommodate desirable development while avoiding\nor addressing anticipated problems that may arise from development otherwise allowed by the base zoning\ndistrict.\n30-3.F.3. Classification of Conditional Zoning Districts\nLand shall be classified into a conditional zoning district only in accordance with the procedures and\nrequirements set forth in Section 30-2.C.4, Conditional Rezoning.\n30-3.F.4. Applicable Regulations\nDevelopment in a conditional zoning district shall be subject to all the use and development standards and\nrequirements that apply to development in the parallel base zoning district, plus the conditions imposed as\npart of the Conditional Rezoning approval, which may not be less restrictive than the regulations for the\nparallel base zoning district.\n30-3.F.5. Relationship to Overlay Zoning Districts\nRegulations governing development in an overlay zoning district shall apply in addition to the regulations\ngoverning development in the underlying conditional zoning district. If the standards governing a\nconditional zoning district expressly conflict with those governing an overlay zoning district, the standards\ngoverning the overlay district shall control.\n30-3.F.6. Applied to Entire Lot\nNo application for conditional rezoning (see Section 30-2.C.4) may split an existing site or lot of record into\na conditional zoning district and a base zoning district. Nothing in this subsection shall limit a conditional\nrezoning that splits a lot or site into two or more different conditional zoning district designations.\n30-3.G.

General Planned Development District Purposes\nThe Planned Development (PD) districts are established and intended to encourage innovative land\nplanning and site design concepts that support a high quality of life and achieve a high quality of\ndevelopment, environmental sensitivity, energy efficiency, and other City goals and objectives by:\n1. Reducing or diminishing the inflexibility or uniform design that sometimes results from strict\napplication of zoning and development standards designed primarily for individual lots;\n2. Allowing greater freedom in selecting the means of providing access, open space, and design\namenities;\n3. Allowing greater freedom in providing a well-integrated mix of residential and nonresidential land\nuses in the same development, including a mix of housing types, lot sizes, and densities;\n4. Providing for efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets and thereby\nlowering development and housing costs;\n5. Promoting quality design and environmentally sensitive development that respects surrounding\nestablished land use character and respects and takes advantage of a site's natural and man-made\nfeatures, such as trees, streams, hillsides, floodplains, and historic features; and\n6. Establishing a zoning district that corresponds to Cumberland County's Density Development\nConditional Use District within the City's Municipal Influence Areas.\nC. Classification of Planned Development Zoning Districts\nLand shall be classified into a planned development zoning district only in accordance with the\nprocedures and requirements set forth in Section 30-2.C.3, Planned Development, and this section.\nd. Relationship to PND District\nLands designated as Planned Neighborhood District (PND) on July 1, 2011 are subject to the standards\nand conditions included within the previously-adopted master plans and other requirements related to\ntheir approval. These developments may proceed subject to their original approvals in accordance with\nSection 30-1.H, Transitional Provisions. In the event the PND expires, or a modification to the district is\nproposed, an applicant may seek to establish a PD district in accordance with this section and Section\n30-2.C.3, Planned Development.\ne.\nOrganization of Planned Development Zoning District Regulations\nSection 30-3.G.2, General Standards for All Planned Development Districts, sets out general standards\napplicable to all types of Planned Development districts. Sections 30-3.G.3 to 30-3.G.5 set out the\npurpose statements and standards for each of the three specific types of Planned Development district.\nThese subsections have a common structure consisting of a purpose statement and applicable\ndevelopment standards. Some PD districts also include additional district-specific standards.

Identify for the entire PD district and each development area the acreage, types and mix of land uses,\nnumber of residential units (by use type), nonresidential floor area (by use type), residential density,\nand nonresidential intensity;\n5. Identify the general location, amount, and type (whether designated for active or passive recreation)\nof open space;\n6. Identify the location of environmentally sensitive lands, wildlife habitat, and stream corridors;\n7. Identify the on-site transportation circulation system, including the general location of all public and\nprivate streets, existing or projected transit corridors, pedestrian and bicycle pathways, and how they\nwill connect with existing and planned City systems;\n8. Identify the general location of on-site potable water and wastewater facilities, and how they will\nconnect to City systems;\n9. Identify the general location of on-site stormwater management facilities, and how they will connect\nto City systems; and\n10. Identify the general location of all other on-site public facilities serving the development, including\nbut not limited to schools, and facilities for fire protection, police protection, EMS, and solid waste\nmanagement.\nb. Consistency with City Plans\nThe PD zoning district designation, the Master Plan, and the Terms and Conditions document shall be\nconsistent with the 2030 Joint Growth Vision Plan, the 2010 Cumberland County Land Use Plan, and any\napplicable functional plans and small area plans adopted by the City.\nC. Compatibility with Surrounding Areas\nDevelopment along the perimeter of a PD district shall be compatible with adjacent existing or proposed\ndevelopment. Where there are issues of compatibility, the Master Plan shall provide for transition areas\nat the edges of the PD district that provide for appropriate buffering and/or ensure a complementary\ncharacter of uses. Determination of complementary character shall be based on densities/intensities, lot\nsize and dimensions, building height, building mass and scale, hours of operation, exterior lighting, siting\nof service areas, or other aspects identified by the City Council.\nd. Development Phasing Plan\nIf development in the PD district is proposed to be phased, the Master Plan shall include a development\nphasing plan that identifies the general sequence or phases in which the district is proposed to be\ndeveloped, including how residential and nonresidential development will be timed, how infrastructure\n(public and private) and open space will be provided and timed, and how development will be\ncoordinated with the City's capital improvements program.\n133 of 469\n6/1/2024, 7:21 PM\n"}, {"page": "134", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\ne.

Open Space Design\na. Open space in a PD-TN District should be designed in a hierarchy of formal and informal spaces and\nused to enhance community activity, identity, and civic pride. Formal open spaces consist of\nsquares, greens, common areas, or other park-like settings where residents of the neighborhood\nmay gather. Such areas are bounded by streets and/or buildings, and are typically located in or near\nthe geographic center of the neighborhood. Informal open spaces are typically located throughout\nthe development, and take the form of meandering walking paths, greenways, pocket parks, passive\nrecreation areas, and areas set aside for vegetation retention.\nb. Some portion of the open space provided within a PD-TN shall be located to serve as a central open\nspace or gathering area for the development.\n5. Building Configuration\na. Public Buildings and Uses\nPublic buildings and uses, including Government Facilities, Community Service uses, and\nEducational Facilities, serve as focal points and landmarks for the community within a PD-TN\ndistrict and should be located on prominent sites, such as terminal vistas at the end of streets and\non prominent street corners. The Master Plan shall designate the general location of publicly or\nprivately owned civic lots for civic buildings and uses, including public monuments or gateways\ninto an ensuing space, as the terminus of street vistas for all major internal streets. In addition,\npublic buildings and uses shall be located fronting on or adjacent to a square, plaza, or village green\nwhenever possible.\nb. Location and Relationship between Buildings\nIn a PD-TN district, buildings should be used to define the street edge and the distinction between\nthe public domain of the street and the private space of individual lots. To this end, buildings should\nhave a fairly consistent, narrow setback alignment along the street frontage.\nC. Relationship betweenBuilding Types\nBuildings in a PD-TN district should be built on a human scale and designed with a common,\nharmonious architectural vocabulary and landscaping to lend an intimate and personal feel to the\nstreetscape. The intent should not be to create a uniform appearance, but rather a distinct sense of\nplace.\n(Ord. No. S2012-025, \u00a7 16, 11-13-2012)\n30-3.H. Overlay Zoning Districts\n30-3.H.1. General\na. Purpose\nOverlay zoning districts are superimposed over portions of one or more underlying base zoning districts,\nconditional zoning districts, or planned development districts with the intent of supplementing generally\napplicable development regulations with additional development regulations that address special area-\nspecific conditions, features, or plans while maintaining the character and purposes of the underlying\nzoning district.\nb.

Except where specifically provided in this Ordinance, variances from the overlay\nzoning district standards shall not be granted.\nTable 30-3.H.1.b: Overlay Zoning Districts Established\n139 of 469\n6/1/2024,\n"}, {"page": "140", "text": "Firefox\nhtps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nC. Classification of Overlay Zoning Districts\nLand shall be classified or reclassified into an overlay zoning district only in accordance with the\nprocedures and requirements set forth in Section 30-2.C.1, Map Amendment (Rezoning).\nd. Relationship to Other Zoning Districts\n1. Overlay District Controls\nRegulations governing development in an overlay zoning district shall apply in addition to the\nregulations governing development in the underlying base zoning district, conditional zoning district,\nor planned development district. If the standards governing an overlay zoning district expressly\nconflict with those governing a base zoning district, conditional zoning district, or planned\ndevelopment district, the standards governing the overlay district shall control. Where land is\nclassified into multiple overlay zoning districts and the standards governing one overlay zoning\ndistrict expressly conflict with those governing another overlay district, the more restrictive standard\nshall apply.\n2. Structures undergoing design review\nStructures subject to design review pursuant to this Article by any official design review board\nestablished in this Article which are found to comply with the applicable design guidelines by the\napplicable design review board shall be exempt from the dimensional standards of the underlying\nzoning district, the general development standards, and the signage requirements established in this\nArticle to the extent that those requirements conflict with the applicable design guidelines. Such\nexemptions shall be explicitly noted in the action by the design review board.\n(Ord. No.S2012-025, \u00a7 16, 11-13-2012; Ord. No.S2013-002, \u00a7 4, 2-11-2013; Ord.

All nonconforming uses not carried on within a structure, except those which are specifically allowed\nas an accessory, ancillary or incidental to an allowed use subject to the provisions of this section,\nshall be discontinued within one calendar year from the effective date of this ordinance, regardless\nwhether or not the nonconforming use status applies to structure(s) and premises in combination\nwith the nonconforming outdoor use - any subsequent use of the land and structures placed thereon\nshall conform to the provisions of this section.\n2. A nonconforming use may not be changed or expanded, or resumed if the nonconforming use has\nceased for a period of 180 calendar days within the district.\n3. Any structure that is nonconforming due to noncompliance with dimensional requirements, but\nwhich houses an allowed use within the district may continue provided that its nonconformity is not\nincreased, except where specifically approved by the Zoning Commission, and provided that prior to\nany upgrades to any nonconforming structure housing an allowed use beyond permissible repairs,\nthe minimum landscaping and pedestrian improvements are implemented on the site.\n4. Owners of properties within the district shall not allow for the impermissible replacement of any\nnonconforming structure located inside the district unless specifically approved by the City Council.\n5. Existing, legal nonconforming uses may be expanded through the Special Use Permit process in\naccordance with Article 30-2.C.7 Special Use Permit.\n(Ord. No. S2014-011, \u00a7 1, 8-11-2014; Ord.

Types of Regional Activity Centers. Each Regional Activity Center is uniquely defined based upon its\nspecific economic contribution to the community. For example, Regional Activity Center that is defined by\na concentration of retail and restaurant uses would be designated in such a manner to support those\nuses as the dominant categories of land use within the activity center. Likewise, a Regional Activity\nCenter based around a large medical use would include a land use focus supportive of the medical use.\nC. Application. Prior to designating an area as a Regional Activity Center Overlay District, an analysis shall\nbe prepared to identify the defining land uses that make up the district, to identify land uses which are\ncompatible with or incompatible with the defining land uses, and to identify development characteristics,\nincluding scale of development and site design features, that complement or threaten the defining land\nuses. In establishing a Regional Activity Center Overlay District, City Council may establish limitations on\npermitted uses and special uses allowed in the underlying zoning district or districts within the Regional\nActivity Center. City Council may also establish standards with regard to development characteristics that\nsupport the defining uses of the Regional Activity Center, such as setbacks, location and amount of\nparking, access to and buffering of land uses proximate to the Regional Activity Center Overlay District,\nand similar standards intended to ensure that the Regional Activity Center is maintained as a discrete\ncontributor to the city's economic mission. Such use limitations and development standards shall be\nclearly set forth in the ordinance adopting the Regional Activity Center Overlay District.\nd. Designation of Specific Overlays. Each specific Regional Activity Center Overlay shall be entered as a\nnumbered subset of this enabling section and the overlay designated on the Official Zoning Map as RACO-\n[#].\n(Ord. No. S2014-018, \u00a7 1, 10-27-2014)\n30-3.H.13. Suburban Activity Center Overlay (SACO) District\na. Purpose\nThe purpose of this Suburban Activity Center Overlay (SACO) District is to facilitate infill development\nand redevelopment in key areas along arterial road corridors. The resulting concentrated mixture of\nuses in a walkable development pattern is intended to achieve a critical mass of predominantly mixed-\nuse development to:\n1. create centers of activity;\n2. enhance the viability of existing businesses;\n3. promote reinvestment and redevelopment;\n4. implement adopted plans;\n5. serve as a catalyst for future compatible development and redevelopment in the vicinity of the node;\n6. ensure reasonable access from flanking development to retail and neighborhood services; and\n7. increase the efficiency and utilization of transportation facilities and services.\nb. Applicability\nA district may be established along any arterial road corridor, provided it is no larger than 125 acres in\narea (equivalent to a 1/4 mile radius around the center of the node) and no closer than approximately two\nmiles from another SACO District, unless otherwise specified in an adopted corridor plan.\nWithin the SACO District, all development standards of Section 30-5 apply, unless specifically exempted\nherein or addressed by a different standard (for example, sidewalk width).\nEstablishment of the overlay district may be initiated by the City or by owners of property in the\nspecified area, in accordance with Sec. 30-2.C.1 Map Amendments. The standards would apply to\n159 of 469\n6/1/2024, 7:21 PM\n"}, {"page": "160", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\ndevelopment that involves the construction of new buildings or the expansion of an existing building\nequal to or greater than fifty percent of the gross floor area of the original structure.\nC.

Explanation of Use Table Structure\na. General\n1. Table 30-4.A, Use Table, lists land uses and indicates whether they are allowed by right, allowed as a\nspecial use, allowed in a planned development zoning district, or prohibited in each base zoning\ndistrict and planned development district. The use table also includes references to any additional\nrequirements or regulations applicable to the specific use type.\n2. The status of a use in a conditional zoning district shall be the same as in the parallel base zoning\ndistrict unless such status is modified by conditions imposed as part of the Conditional Rezoning\ndesignating the conditional zoning district.\nb. Organization of Uses\nThe use table organizes allowable uses by use classifications, use categories, and use types. The use table\nand Section 30-4.B, Use Classifications, Categories, and Use Types, together provide a systematic basis for\nidentifying and consolidating or distinguishing unidentified land uses to determine whether a particular\nland use is allowable in a particular zoning district and in addressing future land uses.\n1. Use Classifications\nThe use classifications identify broad general classifications of land use and include residential uses,\ninstitutional uses, agricultural uses, commercial uses, and industrial uses. Use classifications are\nfurther broken down into a series of general \"use categories\" and specific \"use types.\"\n2. Use Categories\nThe use categories describe the major sub-groups of the respective use classifications and are based\non common functional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity,\nthe type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site conditions.\nFor example, the Residential Use Classification is divided into the Household Living and Group Living\nuse categories. Use categories are further broken down into a series of individual use types.\n3. Use Types\nThe specific use types are included in the respective use category. They identify the specific principal\nuses that are considered to fall within characteristics identified in the use category. For example, live/\nwork dwellings, single-family detached dwellings, duplex dwellings, attached residential, multi-family\ndwellings, and manufactured homes are use types in the Household Living Use Category.\nC. Permitted Uses\nA \"P\" in a cell of the use table indicates that the corresponding use category or use type is allowed by\nright in the corresponding base zoning district or parallel conditional zoning district, subject to\ncompliance with the use-specific standards referenced in the final column of the use table (and\nconditions imposed as part of a Conditional Rezoning, if applicable). An \"MP\" is used in the columns for\nthe planned development districts, and specifies the allowable use types in a particular planned\ndevelopment district provided the use type is set out in an approved master plan. Permitted uses are\nsubject to all other applicable regulations of this Ordinance, including those set forth in Article 5:\nDevelopment Standards, and Article 6: Subdivisions.\nd. Special Uses\nAn \"S\" in a cell of the use table indicates that the corresponding use category or use type is allowed in the\ncorresponding base zoning district or parallel conditional zoning district, only upon approval of a Special\nUse Permit in accordance with Section 30-2.C.7, Special Use Permit, any use-specific standards\nreferenced in the final column of the use table, and any conditions imposed as part of a Conditional\nRezoning (if applicable). Uses subject to a Special Use Permit are subject to all other applicable\nregulations of this Ordinance, including those set forth in Article 30-5: Development Standards, and\nArticle 30-6: Subdivisions.\ne.

Use Classifications, Use Categories, and Use Types\n30-4.B.1. General\na. Purpose\nThis section is intended to provide a systematic framework for identifying, describing, categorizing, and\nconsolidating or distinguishing land uses in a way that makes it easier to determine how a particular\nland use activity, or combination of activities, is to be considered in applying the use table and other\nprovisions in this Ordinance. This section is also intended to provide support in identifying instances\nwhere a new or unanticipated land use not identified in the use table is of such a nature, function,\nor\nduration that the impact of allowing it in a particular zoning district is so similar to that of a use type\nalready identified in the use table as allowed in the zoning district that allowing the new or unanticipated\nland use should be interpreted as being consistent with the intent of the zoning district and the use\nregulations.\nb. Structure of this Section\n1. General\nThis section identifies each of the five use classifications in Table 30-4.A, Use Table, and includes a\nsection under each use classification identifying each use category. There are \"characteristics\" and\n\"examples\" subsections under each use category (individual use types are defined in Article 30-9:\nDefinitions).\n2. Principal Use Characteristics and Accessory Uses\nThe \"characteristics\" subsection describes common characteristics of each use category. Principal uses\nare assigned to the use category that most closely describes the nature of the principal use. Also listed\nare examples of common accessory uses that, unless otherwise stated in this Ordinance, are allowed in\nconjunction with a principal use.\n3. Examples\nThe \"examples\" subsection lists common examples of use types included in the respective use\ncategory. The names of these sample uses are generic. They are based on common meanings and not\non what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use that calls itself \"wholesale sales,\" but sells\nmostly to consumers, is included in the Retail Sales and Service Use Category rather than the\nWholesale Sales Use Category. This is because the activity on the site matches the characteristics of\nthe Retail Sales and Service Use Category.\nC. Developments with Multiple Principal Uses\nWhen all principal uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is assigned\nto that use category. A development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore, and bakery, for example,\nwould be classified in the Retail Sales and Service Use Category because all of the development's\nprincipal uses are in that use category. When the principal uses of a development fall within different use\ncategories, each principal use is classified in the applicable use category and each use is subject to\napplicable regulations for that use category. Developments with multiple principal uses, such as\nshopping centers, shall incorporate only those use types allowed in the applicable zoning district.\nd. Interpretation of Unlisted Uses\n1. Procedure for Interpreting Unlisted Uses as Permitted\na. Unless interpreted as a permitted use in accordance with (b) below, unlisted uses are prohibited.\nb. The City Manager may interpret a particular land use not expressly listed in the use table as\nallowed in a particular zoning district, in accordance with the procedure in Section 30-2.C.17,\nInterpretation, and based on the standards in Section 30-4.B.1.d.2, Standards for Approving\nUnlisted Uses as Permitted.\n2. Standards for Interpreting Unlisted Uses as Permitted\n175 of 469\n6/1/2024, 7:21 PM\n"}, {"page": "176", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nThe City Manager shall interpret an unlisted land use as permitted in a particular zoning district only\nafter determining that the nature, function, and duration of the use and the impact of allowing it in the\nzoning district are so similar to those of a use type or use category allowable in the zoning district that\nthe unlisted land use should be deemed allowable in the same manner as the similar use type or use\ncategory. In making such determination, the City Manager shall consider the purpose and intent\nstatements in this Ordinance concerning the zoning district, the character of use types allowable in\nthe district, and all relevant characteristics of the unlisted use, including but not limited to the\nfollowing:\na. The volume and type of sales, retail, wholesale, etc.;\nb. The size and type of items sold and nature of inventory on the premises;\nC. Any processing done on the premises, including assembly, manufacturing, warehousing, shipping,\ndistribution;\nd. Any dangerous, hazardous, toxic, or explosive materials used in the processing;\ne. The nature and location of storage and outdoor display of merchandise, whether enclosed, open,\ninside or outside the principal building; predominant types of items stored (such as business\nvehicles, work-in-process, inventory, and merchandise, construction materials, scrap and junk, and\nraw materials including liquids and powders);\nf. The type, size, and nature of buildings and structures;\ng. The number and density of employees and customers per unit area of site in relation to business\nhours and employment shifts;\nh. Transportation requirements, including the modal split for people and freight, by volume type and\ncharacteristic of traffic generation to and from the site;\ni. Trip purposes and whether trip purposes can be shared by other use types on the site;\nj. Parking requirements, turnover and generation, ratio of the number of spaces required per unit\narea or activity;\nk. The amount and nature of any nuisances generated on the premises, including but not limited to\nnoise, smoke, odor, glare, vibration, radiation, and fumes;\n1.\nAny special public utility requirements for serving the proposed use type, including but not limited\nto water supply, wastewater output, pre-treatment of wastes and emissions required or\nrecommended, and any significant power structures and communications towers or facilities; and\nm. The impact on adjacent lands created by the proposed use type, which should not be greater than\nthat of other use types allowed in the zoning district.\n3. Effect of Approval of Unlisted Use\na. After interpreting an unlisted land use as permitted in a particular zoning district, the City Manager\nshall determine whether the unlisted use is likely to be common or to recur frequently, or whether\nits omission from the use table is likely to lead to public uncertainty and confusion. On determining\nthat the unlisted use is likely to be common or would lead to confusion if unlisted, the City Manager\nshall initiate an application for a Text Amendment to list the use in the use table. Until final action is\ntaken on the Text Amendment application, the City Manager's interpretation shall be binding.\nb. If after interpreting an unlisted land use as permitted in a particular zoning district, the City\nManager determines that the unlisted use is of an unusual or transitory nature, and unlikely to\nrecur frequently, the interpretation shall be binding in accordance with Section 30-2.C.17.f, Effect of\nInterpretation, without further action or amendment of this Ordinance.\nC. Appeals of the City Manager's decision shall be submitted in accordance with the standards\nin\nSection 30-2.C.18, Appeal.\ne. Adaptive Reuse\n1. General description. Adaptive reuse is intended to promote infill development, community\ncompatibility, and economic development by allowing and providing incentives for adaptively reusing\n176 of 469\n6/1/2024, 7:21\n"}, {"page": "177", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nvaluable existing buildings after public review through the Neighborhood Compatibility Permit\nprocess. Fayetteville has a stock of fine older buildings that greatly contribute to the City's quality of\nlife and urban character. Due to design,location and/or condition, these buildings may become\nphysically or functionally obsolete for use under their current zoning. Adaptive reuse permits a wider\nrange of land uses to be available to these existing buildings for the purpose of extending their useful\nlife.\n2. Permitted Uses. Those uses allowed as permitted uses under the underlying zoning district.\nAdditionally:\na. In single-family residential districts, the following are permitted uses as noted below and subject to\nthe development and design standards provided in this section and any conditions established in\nthe Neighborhood Compatibility Permit process:\n1.

All uses listed in (a) above.\n2. Professional office uses.\nC. In the case of a conversion of a building from a hotel/motel use to multi-family residential use, the\nstructure is subject to the development and design standards provided in this section and condition\nestablished in the Neighborhood Compatibility Permit as well as the conditions and design\nstandards identified for multifamily residential developments.\n1. Hotel/motel conversions allowed in the Multi-Family Residential 5 (MR-5), Office/Institution\n(OI), Limited Commercial (LC), Community Commercial (CC), Mixed Use (MU), Downtown 1\n(DT-1), Downtown 2 (DT-2), and Business Park (BP) zoning districts.\n2. Conversion is only allowed for hotel/motels that have been in operation for over ten (10) years\nor are currently not operating but have operated in the past ten (10) years as a hotel/motel.\n3. Development and design standards.\na. Application. The provisions of adaptive reuse shall be limited to the reuse of existing principal and\naccessory structures and shall not apply to new construction of principal or accessory strnctures\nexceptas provided herein. Adaptive reuse strnctures shall have uniquecharacteristics that promote\nneighborhood or community character,are essential for economic development, or otherwise\ncontribute tothe surrounding area such that their preservation is justified underthe provisions of\nthis section.\nb. Multistory structures. For multistory strnctures in single-family landmulti-family zoning districts, at\nleast one story shall be devoted toresidential use.\nC. Reduction of required offs/reef parking. The Planning Commissionmay allow up to a 25-percent\nreduction in the minimum amount ofrequired off-street parking for adaptive reuse projects.\nd. Location of ojfstreet parking. Parking shall be located in the rearof the site and shall be screened\nwith vegetation from adjacentsingle-family uses. The vegetative screening shall consist of\ntheplanting required for a Type A buffer unless a more extensive bufferis required by the Planning\nCommission.

Accessory Use Standards\n30-4.D.1. Purpose\nThis section authorizes the establishment of accessory uses that are incidental and customarily subordinate\nto principal uses. The purpose of this section is to allow a broad range of accessory uses, so long as such\nuses are located on the same site as the principal use, and so long as they comply with the standards set\nforth in this section in order to reduce potentially adverse impacts on surrounding lands.\n30-4.D.2. General Standards and Limitations\na. Compliance with Ordinance Requirements\nAll accessory uses and accessory structures shall conform to the applicable requirements of this\nOrdinance, including the district standards in Article 30-3: Zoning Districts, and the use regulations in\nArticle 30-4: Use Standards, and the development standards in Article 30-5: Development Standards.\nThe provisions of this section establish additional standards and restrictions for particular accessory\nuses and structures.\nb. General Standards\nAll accessory uses and accessory structures shall meet the following standards:\n1. Directly serve the principal use or structure;\n2. Be customarily accessory and clearly incidental and subordinate to the principal use and structure;\n3. Be subordinate in area, extent, and purpose to the principal use or structure;\n4. Be owned or operated by the same person as the principal use or structure;\n5. Be located on the same lot as the principal use or structure;\n6. Together with the principal use or structure, not violate the bulk, density, parking, landscaping, or\nopen space standards of this Ordinance;\n7. Not be constructed or established prior to the time the principal use or structure is constructed or\nestablished; and\n8. Not constitute a combination use, which is the combination of two principal uses (combination uses\nwill not meet the above standards in terms of being subordinate or providing service to the principal\nuse).\nC. Approval of Accessory Uses and Structures\nUnless otherwise specified in this section, any accessory use or accessory structure shall be treated as a\npermitted use in the zoning district in which it is located. An accessory use or structure may be approved\nin conjunction with approval of the principal use or structure.\nd. Table of Permitted Accessory Uses\n1. Table as Guide\nTable 30-4.D, Table of Permitted Accessory Uses, is established as a guide to identify the\nappropriateness of the more common accessory uses in each zoning district.\n2. Listed Accessory Uses\nTable 30-4.D, Table of Permitted Accessory Uses, lists what types of accessory uses, structures, and\nactivities are allowed in each of the zoning districts. If a specific accessory use is allowed as a\npermitted use in a zoning district, the column underneath the zoning district is marked with a \"P.\" If a\nspecific accessory use is allowed subject to a Special Use Permit, the column underneath the zoning\ndistrict is marked with an \"S\". If the accessory use or structure is not allowed in a zoning district, the\ncolumn is blank or has a slash \"/\" mark. In the case of planned development districts, if an accessory\n225 of 469\n6/1/2024, 7:21 PM\n"}, {"page": "226", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nuse is allowable, it is marked with an \"MP\", and the accessory use must be set out in the approved\nmaster plan. If there is a reference contained in the column entitled \"Additional Requirements,\" refer\nto the cited section(s) for additional standards that apply to the specific accessory use.\n3. Interpretation of Unidentified Accessory Uses\nThe City Manager shall evaluate potential accessory uses that are not identified in Table 30-4.D, Table\nof Permitted Accessory Uses, on a case-by-case basis, as an Interpretation (Section 30-2.C.17). In\nmaking the interpretation, the City Manager shall apply the following standards.\na. The compatibility of the accessory use, including the structure in which it is housed, with other\nprincipal and accessory uses permitted in the zoning district.\nb. Any potential adverse impacts the accessory use may have on other lands in the area, compared\nwith other accessory uses permitted in the zoning district.\nC. The purpose and intent of the zoning district in which the accessory use is located (see Article\n30-3: Zoning Districts).\nd. The additional regulations for specific accessory uses established in Section 30-4.D.3, Specific\nStandards for Certain Accessory Uses.\ne. The definition of \"accessory use\" (see Article 30-9: Definitions.), and the general accessory use\nstandards established in Section 30-4.D.2, General Standards and Limitations.\n(Ord. No. S2014-002, 1)\ne. Table of Permitted Accessory Uses\nTable 30-4.D, Table of Permitted Accessory Uses, specifies types of accessory use and the zoning district\nwhere each type may be permitted.\nTable 30-4.D.2.E: Table

PreApplication Meeting and Tree Protection Plan\nIt is important to identify any characteristics of a site that make it special. Added value to the resulting\ndesign may be achieved by identifying and considering these attributes prior to the advancement of\nthe development plans.\nWooded sites provide distinct aesthetic, economic and environmental significance and value as a\nnatural resource of the City. Existing vegetation plays a critical role in maintaining aesthetics, water\nquality, minimizing erosion and downstream flooding, and increasing quality of life as well as reducing\nsite development cost to replant and restore a portion of what was unknowingly removed. Critical to\nthe satisfaction of this portion of the UDO is the identification of existing trees as a resource feature.\n1. Prior to plan development and submittal, the applicant shall meet with the City and provide the City\nwith a graphic depiction on an aerial map illustrating the existing tree canopy and potential areas\nfor preservation of existing healthy trees with good form. Knowing the location and size of\nsignificant trees on the development site facilitates a common understanding of what options and\nincentives are available to preserve trees and improve the appearance of the proposed development\nwhile meeting the development goals of the applicant.\n2. The applicant shall also provide information on the location and species of any trees having a DBH\nof 30 inches or greater which may currently exist on the site.

Tree preservation is to be determined in conjunction with the City's\ninput.\n3. Once determined, the applicant shall indicate the location of the tree protection zones on the\ndevelopment plans. Tree protection areas based on the trees' critical root zones shall be noted and\ndrawn to scale on demolition, grading and erosion control, and landscaping plans. The general type,\nsize and nature of the existing trees to be saved and credited toward landscaping requirements shall\nbe included as a table, as well as being graphically illustrated (see Section 30-5.B.6, Tree\nPreservation and Section 30-5.B.8, Tree Preservation During Construction).\n4. Tree save areas must be described by metes and bounds on the recorded plat, individual recorded\ndeeds, and all property association documents for land held in common.\nb. Landscape Plan\n1. To ensure compliance with the standards of this section, a landscape plan demonstrating how\nlandscaping will be planted on a development site shall be included as a part of any development\napplication.\n2. In the event of phased development, a landscape plan shall be required for each distinct phase of\nthe development, and shall depict landscaping associated with the particular phase of development.\n3. The landscape plan should be prepared by a professional, knowledgeable about plant material and\ndesign. Please refer to the City's landscaping guidelines for additional guidance on what is to be\nincluded on the landscape plan.\nC. Coordination with Stormwater Requirements\nWhen required stormwater management facilities are enhanced as a site amenity they may qualify as a\nportion of the required open space. Determination of credit shall be at the discretion of the city\nmanager in accordance with the provisions of Section 30-5.C.3.b.6.\nd. Coordination with Site Lighting\nCoordination is required so that site lighting is located an appropriate distance from trees to minimize\nfuture conflict (see Section 30-5.E.5.d).\ne. Planting Standards\n1. Existing Vegetation\nExisting healthy, well-formed canopy and/or understory trees as well as healthy shrubs may be\ncredited toward the requirements of this section, provided the vegetation meets or exceeds the\nminimum size standards and is protected before and during development of the site and maintained\nthereafter in a healthy growing condition (see Section 30-5.B.7, Tree Preservation Incentives).\na. The property owner must include in a tree survey (see Section 30-5.B.6.d, Tree Survey) all\nexisting trees four-inch caliper or greater proposed to be saved to satisfy a portion of the\nplanting requirements. A tree survey is otherwise not required.\nb.\nOnly healthy trees free of invasive species that have been protected during the entire\ndevelopment period, beginning prior to the commencement of site work and continuing through\nto issuance of the certificate of occupancy in accordance with approved tree protection\nrequirements may satisfy these planting requirements.\nC. Preserved vegetation is to be maintained thereafter in a healthy growing condition free of\ninvasive plant species.\nd. If the minimum protection standards are not met, or if trees are observed by the City to be\ninjured or threatened, the vegetation may be deemed ineligible for meeting these requirements.\ne. Where existing vegetation is used in buffer yards, supplemental plantings may be required, if the\nexisting vegetation does not provide the same effect that a planted buffer would after five years\nof normal growth.\n2. New Plantings\nThe City shall maintain and make available, a list of recommended plant material hardy to the\n268 of 469\n6/1/2024, 7:21 PM\n"}, {"page": "269", "text": "Firefox\nhtps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nFayetteville area and a plant list maintained by PWC for materials suitable for planting under power\nlines.

Continuous Visual Screen in Non-Residential Areas\nCommercial (non-residential) vehicular use areas shall be separated from adjoining commercial\nproperties with a minimum five foot wide landscape strip. When head-in parking adjacent to the\nproperty line includes wheel stops, the minimum width of the landscape strip is reduced to three\nfeet. The landscape strip shall be planted with a continuous visual screen of evergreen shrubs\nalong the property line, with a minimum height of 24 inches at the time of planting. Required\nsight clearances at driveways and near intersections shall not be subject to this requirement.\nWhen a parking lot will be consolidated with an adjacent parcel, the landscaping strip may be\neliminated (see Section 30-5.B.4c.4.c, below).\nb. Adjacent to Off-Street Surface Parking on Other Lots\nParking lots should be consolidated and circulation systematized when possible with more\ncreative and effective landscaping, pedestrian circulation, and lighting, rather than having a\nseries of smaller-sized parking lots divided by arbitrary lots lines with landscaped buffers. To\nthis end, the vehicular use area landscape strip may be eliminated when the proposed parking lot\nwill be combined with an existing or future adjoining parking lot. A recorded Cross Parking\nAgreement between the cooperating parties is required to provide non-exclusive access (for\nvehicles and pedestrians) to driveways, maneuvering areas, parking areas, and so on.\nC. Credit Towards Property Perimeter Landscape Buffer Requirements\nPerimeter landscape strips associated with a vehicular use area may be credited towards\nperimeter buffer standards (see Section 30-5.B.4.d, below), provided the minimum applicable\nbuffer standards are met, and provided the vehicular use area perimeter landscaping is within\nthe area to be occupied by the property perimeter landscape buffer.\nd. Parking Lot Entrance Aisles and Stacking Lanes\nDriveways into parking areas shall include a landscape strip at least ten feet wide along each side\nof the driveway. At a minimum, the driveway landscape strip shall include one canopy tree for\nevery 25 to 40 linear feet of drive or one understory tree for every 15 to 25 linear feet of drive. A\nminimum of one shrub shall be planted for every five linear feet of driveway entrance. Plant\nmaterial may be grouped as an entrance feature rather than planted as a linear border.\n277 of 469\n6/1/2024,\n"}, {"page": "278", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\n5. Street Yard Buffer\na. Purpose and Intent\nThe purpose of the street yard buffer is to enhance the streetscape and public environment by\nabating glare and moderating temperatures of impervious areas; filtering air of fumes and dust;\nproviding shade; attenuating noise; and reducing the visual impact of large expanses of\npavement through the provision of a visually modifying screen of plants. The intent is to provide\nat a minimum an opaque buffer at the ground level up to three feet, with open views available\nthrough and between taller plant material. Existing vegetation should be used to satisfy these\nplanting requirements where possible.\nb. Applicability\nA street yard buffer shall be required for all vehicular use areas that are established within 50\nfeet of any street right-of-way (including controlled access highways) unless separated by an\nintervening building. When buildings are moved up to the street, the street yard requirement is\neliminated.\nC.

Property Perimeter Landscape Buffers\n1. Purpose and Intent\nPerimeter landscape buffers are intended to mitigate potential negative effects of contiguous uses in\ndiffering zoning districts by protecting and preserving the appearance, character and value of\nproperty within the City. The objective is to exclude visual contact, create spatial separation and to\nminimize any adverse impacts on adjacent properties. Where topographical changes, the size and\nshape of existing lots of record, or other spatial considerations exist which would make adherence to\nthe basic requirement either impossible or ineffective in meeting the purpose of the buffer yard,\nalternate buffer yard plans will be considered or may be required.\n2. Applicability\nAll development shall provide a property perimeter landscape buffer at the edge of the development\nto separate it from differently-zoned adjacent property in accordance with Table 30-5.B.4.d.4, Buffer\nTypes, and Table 30-5.B.4.d.5, Buffer Type Application.\n3. Use of Existing Trees\nExisting healthy, well-formed trees located at the property perimeter shall remain undisturbed\n(except for the removal of dead wood and invasive vines) and may be credited toward the requirement\nof this section, in accordance with Section 30-5.B.7.a, Tree Preservation Credits.

Responsibility for Buffer Installation\na. Vacant Parcels\nWhere a developing parcel is adjacent to a vacant parcel and a perimeter buffer is required in\naccordance with this section, the developing parcel may reduce the planting schedule indicated\nin Table 30-5.B.4.d.4, Property Perimeter Buffer Types, by one-half.\nb. Existing Land Uses\nWhere a developing parcel is adjacent to an existing use and a perimeter buffer is required in\naccordance with this section, the developing parcel shall provide the full perimeter buffer\nrequired adjacent to the existing use in accordance with Table 30-5.B.4.d.4, Property Perimeter\nBuffer Types, and Table 30-5.B.4.d.5, Buffer Type Application, unless a portion or all of a\nperimeter buffer that complies with the standards of this section already exists between the lots.\nWhere part of a perimeter buffer exists, but the buffer does not fully comply with the standards\nof this section, the developing parcel may reduce the planting schedule indicated in Table\n30-5.B.4.d.4, Property Perimeter Buffer Types, by one-half.\n7. Location of Buffers\nPerimeter buffers required by this section shall be located along the outer perimeter of the parcel(s)\nunder development and shall extend to the parcel boundary line. In the case of parcel boundary\nlines along a public right-of-way, solid fencing in excess of 36 inches, if provided, shall not encroach\nbeyond the building setback line unless part of an approved Alternative Landscape Plan. A\nperimeter buffer may be located along shared access easements between parcels in nonresidential\ndevelopments. If a utility or drainage easement is needed along a property line where a buffer is\nrequired, the buffer will be repositioned to align with the outer edge of the easement, rather than\nthe property line, in order to accommodate both purposes without conflict. No trees are to be\nplanted within a drainage or utility easement except as allowed on a case by case basis by the\nappropriate authority.\n8. Development within Required Buffers\na. Unless permitted in this section, the required buffer shall not contain any development,\nimpervious surfaces, or site features that do not function to meet the standards of this section or\nthat require removal of existing vegetation.\nb. Sidewalks and trails may be placed in perimeter buffers if all required landscaping is provided\nand damage to existing vegetation is minimized according to Section 30-5.B.8, Tree Protection\nDuring Construction.\nC. Overhead and underground utilities may cross a perimeter buffer.\nd. If required landscaping material is damaged or removed due to utility activity, the landowner\nshall be responsible for replanting all damaged or removed vegetation necessary to ensure the\nbuffer meets the standards in this Article, unless otherwise provided for by the subject easement\nagreement.\ne. Screening\n1. General Requirements\nScreening shall be required to conceal specific areas of high visual or auditory impact or hazardous\nareas from both on-site and off-site views (see Figure 30-5.B.4.e, Screening Methods). Such areas\nshall be screened at all times, unless otherwise specified, regardless of adjacent uses, districts, or\nother proximate landscaping material.\n2. Items to Be Screened\nThe following areas shall be screened from off-site views in accordance with this section:\na. Large waste receptacles (dumpsters) and refuse collection points (including cardboard recycling\ncontainers);\nb. Loading and service areas;\n282 of 469\n6/1/2024, PM\n"}, {"page": "283", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nC.

Ground level mechanical units, from public streets only.\nFigure 30-5.B.4.e: Screening Methods\nStreet\nPrimary\nFacade\nTwo-Story\nBuilding\nMechanical\nEquipment\nLoading\nRefuse\nArea\nCollection\nVegetation can serve as an effective visual screen for service areas.\n3. Screening Methods\nThe following items are permitted for use as screening materials. Alternative screening materials\nthat are not listed may be used if it is determined they are comparable to these screening materials.\na. Vegetative materials that meet the minimum vegetative screening requirements for a Type D\nbuffer (see Table 30-5.B.4.d.4, Property Perimeter Buffer Types) and the size standards of\nSection 30-5.B.3.e.2, New Plantings;\nb. An earthen berm that is at least two feet in height, covered with grass, or planted with ground\ncover landscaping materials consistent with the function of and requirements for a Type D buffer\n(see Table 30-5.B.4.d.4, Property Perimeter Buffer Types)-provided, however, that a berm shall\nnot be used in the DT district or if it will replace existing trees of six inches in caliper or more;\nC. A solid fence constructed of treated or rot-resistant wood (such as cypress or redwood), or a\nplastic or vinyl fence, of a minimum height necessary to fully-screen the object being screened; or\nd. A masonry wall that is the minimum height necessary to fully-screen the object being screened,\nand that is constructed of brick, textured concrete masonry units, or stuccoed block.\ne. Use of chain link fencing with wooden or plastic slats does not qualify as a screen.\n283 of 469\n6/1/2024, 7:21 PM\n"}, {"page": "284", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/fayetteville-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nf. Alternative Landscape Plan\n1. General\nAlternative Landscape Plans, materials, or methods may be justified due to natural conditions, such\nas streams, natural rock formations, topography, and physical conditions related to the site. Lot\nconfiguration and utility easements may justify an alternative landscape plan, as well as impractical\nsituations that would result from application of Section 30-5.B, Landscaping and Tree Protection\nStandards, or when replacing a tree accidentally damaged in accordance with Section 30-5.B.8, Tree\nProtection During Construction.\n2. Preparation\nThe alternative landscape plan should be prepared by someone who is knowledgeable about plant\nmaterial.\n3. Allowable Deviations\nWith input from the TRC or the City Arborist, the city manager shall approve an Alternative\nLandscape Plan if it meets the purpose and intent of the landscaping standards in this section.\nAllowable deviations from the standards of this section include, but are not limited to the following:\na. Reduced Planting Rates due to Public Facilities\nAn adjustment to planting locations or reduction of up to 20 percent in the type or total number\nof plant material may be allowed at underground and/or above ground facilities operated and\nmaintained by a utility, unless specific written consent is provided by that utility. An adjustment\nor reduction may also be allowed where public easements or right-of-way, are located upon or in\nclose proximity to the parcel.\nb. Reduction in Standards due to Nature of Parcel\nA reduction in the count, spacing, or species diversity standards by up to 20 percent may be\nallowed where the reduction is desirable in terms of protection of existing natural resources,\nbetter consistency with the goals of the comprehensive plan, or a site design that exceeds the\nquality of what would otherwise result under a strict application of the standards in this Article.\nC. Redevelopment of Nonconforming Sites\nThe installation of required landscaping during redevelopment of existing nonconforming sites\nshall occur in accordance with Section 30-7.F, Nonconforming Sites.\nd. Location of Street Trees\n1. Deviations in the placement, on-center spacing, or tree type (understory VS. canopy) are\nallowable from the standards in Section 30-5.B.4.a, Street Trees, when the deviation is\nconsistent with existing street tree placement along the same or adjacent block faces.\n2. An applicant may request, or the City may require payment-in-lieu of street trees in cases\nwhere a development's frontage is subject to an approved streetscape plan.\n(Ord.

Credits shall be granted in accordance with the\nfollowing standards:\n1. Qualifying Attributes\nPreserved vegetation must be in good health and condition, and must be protected as described in\nSection 30-5.B.8, Tree Protection During Construction.\n2. Exempted Trees\nThe following trees, regardless of their size, shall be exempted from the requirements in this\nsection.\na. Southern Yellow Pine (to exclude Longleaf Pine);\nb. Bradford Pear;\nC. Mulberry; and\nd. Silver Maple.\nTable 30-5.B.7.a: Existing Tree Credits\n3. Tree Death\nIf a preserved tree dies within 24 months of the completion of the landscape project, it must be\nreplaced with the total number of trees which were credited to the existing tree, and the size of the\nnew tree must comply with the size requirements for new trees as established in this section.\nb. Credit Toward Open Space\nIf specimen trees or groves of three or more trees over four-inch caliper are preserved and protected\nduring development of the site (beyond those credited toward landscaping requirements), credit may\nbe applied toward the required open space acreage by calculating the area of the critical root zone\ncircumference and multiplying that square footage by three, deriving a 300 percent credit.

Reduction in the Minimum Number of Required Parking Spaces\nUp to a five percent reduction in the number of off-street parking spaces required on a development\nsite shall be allowed if the reduction in the amount of required pavement will preserve the root zones\nof existing healthy specimen trees. The amount of reduction can be determined only after taking into\nconsideration any unique site conditions and the impact of the reduction on parking needs for the use,\nand must be agreed upon by both the applicant and the City Manager. Alternative paving materials (see\nSection 30-5.A.8.i, Alternative Materials) may be required by the City Manager in cases where required\nparking areas encroach upon critical root zones.\n(Ord.

Critical Root Zone\nCritical to the tree's survival is protection of the critical root zone. The critical root zone is the\nminimum area beneath a tree that must be left undisturbed in order to preserve a sufficient root mass\nto give a tree a reasonable chance of survival. The critical root zone is generally 18 to 24 inches deep\nand typically represented by a concentric circle centering on the tree trunk with a radius of at least one\nfoot for every inch of trunk diameter taken at four and one-half feet above grade (DBH). Approximately\n50 percent of a tree's root system is in the top 12 inches of soil with 90-95 percent of the root system\nwithin the top three feet. For example, a ten-inch diameter tree requires a protective barrier with a\nminimum ten-foot radius. Proposed buildings shall not be located within ten feet of the critical root\nzone of any existing tree proposed to be preserved.\nFigure 30-5.B.8.b: Critical Root Zone and Minimum Tree Protection Fencing\nNo Building Zone (10'\nExisting Tree\nfrom Edge of CRZ)\nEdge of CRZ and\nMinimum Tree\nProtection Area\nCRZ\nCRZ= = Critical Root Zone\nBuildings must be\nOne lineal foot for every inch\nlocated greater than 1\nof trunk diameter at DBH.\nfrom the CRZ.\nC. Tree Protection Fencing\nWithout protection, trees will be damaged and killed by construction activity; however, such damage is\nnot immediately evident. The protective fencing indicates the areas that are off limits to any land\ndisturbing activity, and storage of equipment, building material, soil, and other debris.\n1. When and Where Required\nAll trees designated for preservation must be protected by barrier before demolition, grading, or\nany other land disturbing activity begins. Protective barriers shall be installed when the critical root\nzone of any trees to be preserved are within 50 feet of any proposed grading or construction\nactivity.\n2.

Failure to have tree protection measures\nin place prior to the start of demolition and land clearing activity is a violation of this Article.\nProtective tree barriers shall be maintained until after the final site inspection.\nd. Encroachments into Tree Protection Zones\nNo credit will be allowed for any tree proposed to be retained, if there is any encroachment within the\ntree protection zone, except as noted herein. For the purpose of this section, an encroachment is\ndefined as any change in the natural grade, construction of impervious surfaces, trenching or\nexcavation, storage of equipment, chemicals, materials or earth and the temporary or permanent\nparking or circulation of vehicles or equipment. Encroachments into tree protection zones shall occur\nonly when no other alternative exists. If such an encroachment is anticipated, a written request must\nbe made to the City Manager for allowance of encroachment. Request must detail preventative\nmeasures to be taken.\n1. Soil Compaction\nWhere compaction might occur due to construction traffic or materials delivery through a tree\nprotection zone, the area must first be mulched with a minimum four-inch layer of wood chips.\nEquipment or materials storage shall not be allowed within a tree save area.\n2. Fill\nNo fill shall be placed within a tree protection zone without appropriate horticultural measures to\nallow air and water to reach the roots.\n3. Paving Limitations\nConstruction of sidewalks or permeable parking or driveway access points may encroach into tree\nprotection zones, so long as such areas are approved by the City Manager and the following\nconditions are met:\na. No more than ten percent of the protected ground area (including any additional landscape\nplanting area) may be covered by sidewalks, up to 20 percent of this area may be covered by\npermeable parking areas or driveway access points or a combination of sidewalks and\npermeable parking or driveway access areas;\nb. Sidewalks shall be raised to avoid root damage; private sidewalks may be constructed with\nasphalt if a concrete or brick sidewalk would damage the tree's roots; and\nC.

Measurement of Height: Fence and wall height shall be measured taking into account the purpose for the fence or wall. For\nexample, a buffer fence erected on the top of a retaining wall shall have its height measured from the adjoining property, not the\nbase of the retaining wall. Similarly, a fence or wall erected as a buffer between the property being developed at a lower elevation\nfrom the property being buffered shall have its height measured from the property being buffered, not the lower property being\ndeveloped. Fences erected for security purposes shall have that purpose taken into account when determining how they are\nmeasured. Nothing herein, however, shall allow or require the erection of a buffer fence or wall taller than twelve feet as\nmeasured from the lower property side, unless erected on a retaining wall. Safety fencing required by the North Carolina building\ncode is not regulated by these height provisions.\n2. Only allowed as part of an approved tennis court, athletic field, or similar recreational amenity.\n3. Reserved for future use.\n4.

For single-family (attached or detached) and two- to four-family dwellings, the following fence and wall materials are allowed\nfor fences erected in the front yard:\na. Wrought iron or similar open-style metal fence (for these fences, the front yard height may be increased to five feet);\nb. Picket, shadow box or other partially open fences (50% or more open); or\nC. Solid fences or walls (less than 50% open) containing a minimum of three horizontal elements and two vertical\nelements if made of wood or a minimum of two vertical and horizontal elements if of masonry construction.\nd. Chain link or other wire fences with or without slats or screens are not allowed.\n6. For all properties having road frontage, a garden wall (Sec. 30-5.B.4(c)(5) d.) may be substituted for a fence or wall allowed in\nthis section.\n7. Where property lines extend into the right-of-way, the setback for fences and walls in front and corner side yards shall be\nmeasured from the edge of the sidewalk (if any) or 10 feet from the edge of the pavement, as applicable.\n8. For development other than single-family, wrought iron or similar open-style fence, the height may be increased to five feet.\nb. Exemption for Safety\nMajor utilities, wireless communication towers, government facilities, and other public safety uses\nshall be allowed to increase maximum fence heights to eight feet in front, side, and rear yards, unless\nfurther increased through an approved Security Plan (see Section 30-5.D.5 Exemptions).\n(Ord.

Perimeter fence or wall\nNo electric fence shall be installed or used unless it is completely surrounded by a nonelectrical\nfence or wall that is not less than six feet in height. When wrought iron or similar open-style metal\nfence is utilized, nonelectrified fencing in the front yard setback may be increased to six feet in\nheight when installed in conjunction with an approved electrified fence. Otherwise, the\nnonelectrical fence or wall shall not exceed the maximum height allowed in the underlying zoning\ndistrict. In no case shall the electrical fence be taller than two feet higher than the nonelectrical\nfence.\n3. Location\nElectric fences shall be restricted in location to the same areas where other fences are allowed\nin the underlying zoning district.\n4. Warning signs\nElectric fences shall be clearly identified with warning signs that are spaced 60 feet apart. Such\nsigns shall not exceed one square foot in area.\n5. Accessibility\nIf required by the Fire Department, a Knox box shall be required and installed to support\nemergency access to properties contained within electric fences.\n6. Monitoring\nElectric fences shall be equipped with a monitoring alarm system activated simultaneously with\nthe electrification of the fence.\n7.

Figure\n30-5.F.4.f.2, Street Connectivity Index, provides an example of how to calculate the connectivity\nindex. Nodes (stars) exist at street intersections and cul-de-sac heads within the development.\nLinks (circles) are stretches of road that connect nodes. Street stub-outs are considered as links,\nbut temporary dead-end streets internal to a development or alleys are not counted as links. One\nlink beyond every node that exists in the development and provides access to the street system\noutside the development shall be included in the index calculation. In the diagram, there are 36\nlinks (circles) and 21 nodes (stars); therefore the connectivity index is 1.71 (36/21 = 1.71).\nb. Mid-block pedestrian access, required in accordance with Section 30-5.F.5.c, Mid-Block Access,\nwill also be considered as a connection for the purposes of calculating the connectivity index.\n3. Reduction in Minimum Index Score\nThe minimum connectivity index score may be reduced if the owner/developer demonstrates it is\nimpossible to achieve due to topographic conditions, natural features, existing road configurations,\nor adjacent existing development patterns.\n4. Pedestrian Connections Required\na.

Review Criteria\nThe Technical Review Committee shall base its decision regarding the type, location, and\nconfiguration of required new street connections on the following criteria:\na. The Site Plan or Subdivision Plan's consistency with subdivision access standards in Table\n30-5.F.6;\nb. The impact on travel distance and response time for emergency service providers resulting from\nnew street connections;\nC. The need for and potential to disperse traffic and reduce congestion at intersections from new\nstreet connections;\nd. The ability to reduce travel time for residents from the inclusion of new street connections;\ne. The potential of a new street connection to reduce negative impacts on air quality (by reducing\nvehicles miles travelled or driving time);\nf. The potential impact on existing development patterns, compatibility, or safety from new street\nconnections; and\ng. The potential impact on natural areas or natural features from new street connections.\nIn no instance shall a new street connection result in a reclassification of an existing street to a new\nstreet classification higher than a collector street, nor shall a new street connection be approved if it\nresults in a reduction in existing level of service by two categories or more for any existing street or\nintersection serving the new development.\n4.

In cases where a site's acreage allows a gross density that exceeds a whole number by 0.6 or more, the\ntotal density may be rounded upwards to the next whole number, thus allowing an additional dwelling\nunit to be located on a site.\ne. Lot Coverage\nLot coverage (the portion of a site covered by principal and accessory buildings) is determined by\ncalculating the percentage of the total area of land within the boundaries of a lot covered by the sum of\nthe surface areas covered by each principal and accessory building on the lot, measured from their\nexterior walls at ground level.\nFigure 30-9.B.1.e: Lot Coverage\nArea Included In Building Coverage Calculation\nArea Excluded From Building Coverage Calculation\nAccessory\nStructure\nOutdoor\nStorage\nPatio\nDeck\nDriveway\nPrincipal Building\nPorch\nPaved Walkway\nStreet\nf.
