Planned Development is generally larger scale projects to ensure sufficient open space can be\nincorporated into the development design. The Planned Development option provides increased design flexibility with varied development and\nhousing types, provided certain enhancements are incorporated into the design of the project.\nB. Conventional Development\nConventional development is a pattern of development that conforms with standard dimensional requirements and typically provides a majority\nof property owners with substantial area on their own property.\nDEVELOPMENT TYPES\nCONVENTIONAL\nPLANNED DEVELOPMENT\nExample Lot Yield: 308 Lots\nExample Lot Yield: 308 Lots\n4.3.1. Planned Development\nA. Intent\nThe intent of a Planned Development (PD) is to promote quality development by providing flexibility in the mixture of uses and in meeting\ndimensional and other requirements of this Ordinance. A PD utilizes exceptional design and best management practices that result in\ndevelopment that is aesthetically pleasing, promotes environmental sensitivity and makes more efficient use of the land, resulting in increased\nopen space.\nB. Planned Development Approval\nPlanned Development projects shall be approved in accordance with the Planned Development approval process found in Section 3.3.3 and the\nsite plan requirements as outlined in Article 3.\nC. Development Intensity\nThe building area coverage and number of dwelling units in a project utilizing the PD development standards shall be calculated as follows:\n1. The building area coverage shall be the dimensional standards of the applicable zoning District (i.e., R-7500, C-LD, etc.). However, the\ndeveloped area may be increased as a result of utilizing exceptional design and/or best management practices as provided in Section 6.1,\nDesign Flexibility. The extent of the allowable increase will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Planning Director (minor site plans)\nor the Planning Board (major site plans) in relation to the extent of the successful use of exceptional design and best management practices\nin the project site plan.\n2. The allowable number of dwelling units in a project shall be determined by dividing the gross site area of the development project by the\nnumber of dwelling units (density) permitted in the underlying district.\nCommentary: For example, the density for R-6000 with water and sewer is 7.3. The allowable number of units for a PD project with 20 acres\nwith an underlying R-6000 district would be up to 143 units, provided all other requirements were satisfied.\n3. Increases in the number of dwelling units permitted in a project may be considered through the density bonus provisions in this article.\nCommentary: There is no guarantee that the maximum density can be achieved on a particular site due to consideration such as required\nopen space, site area devoted to easements or roadways, and other site specific issues.\nD. Uses Permitted within Planned Developments\nUses permitted in the underlying district are permitted in Planned Developments. For residential development, the type of dwellings proposed\n(e.g., single family, multi-family, cottage style, cluster, etc.) shall be approved in conjunction with the PD approval. Mixed use projects are\nencouraged within residential and commercial Planned Developments to reduce travel and maximize the use of land. In residential districts,\n43 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n"}, {"page": "44", "text": "Brunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nnon-residential uses are allowed in approved Planned Developments as follows:\n1. Commercial and other non-residential uses within a residentially zoned PD shall be the same as those uses in the Commercial Low Density\n(C-LD) and Neighborhood Commercial (NC) Zoning Districts per Section 5.2.\n2. Business Park uses may be permitted within a PD per Section 5.2 subject to approval by the Planning Board of the specific uses. Decisions by\nthe Planning Board regarding the inclusion of Business Park uses in a PD shall be based on considerations including, but not limited to, the\ntype of proposed uses, size of the proposed operations in relation to the overall development, the character and nature of surrounding area.\n3. No more than twenty percent of the total acreage within a residentially zoned PD may be designated for non-residential, excluding golf\ncourses and other similar facilities.\n4. Non-residential uses within residentially zoned PDs shall be designed and located to be easily accessible to residents of the development. It\nis expected that such uses will also serve patrons from outside the development.\n5. Such use shall, at minimum, have one internal access to the development.\n6. Within non-residentially zoned PDs, the uses shall be the same as those uses in the underlying district along with uses in the C-LD and NC\ndistricts, including residential uses. Business Park uses may be permitted within a non-residentially zoned PDs subject to approval by the\nPlanning Board of the specific uses; provided however such specific approval of uses shall not be required for property zoned C-I or I-G.\nE. Planned Development Requirements\nPlanned Developments are subject to the site plan and improvement requirements of Article 6. Design and Performance Standards. Additionally,\nPDs are also subject to the following general requirements:\n1. Recreation Area\nOpen space and recreation area shall be provided as required in the subject district (per the PD dimensional table). See Section 6.4.4.B.\n2. Water and Wastewater\nGenerally, public or community water and wastewater service shall be required in all PD. However, the Planning Board may waive this\nrequirement during the PD approval process.\n3. Ownership of Development Site\nThe development site to be subdivided may be held in single ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, the site shall\nbe developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.\n4. PD Perimeter Compatibility\nCommentary: Generally, the perimeter buffer is required along all exterior boundaries, even if the adjacent property is vacant. This is intended\nto provide visual protection for residents of the PD and any development which may occur on adjacent properties.\nF. Buffers\n1. It is preferable that all buffers shall be a natural, undisturbed wooded area where possible, and shall count towards the provision of open\nspace for the development. See Section 6.3, Required Buffers.\n2. A project boundary buffer with a minimum opacity of 0.6 shall be required along all boundaries of a PD except portions of the project\nlocated adjoining a street or roadway. Adjustments to the buffering requirements may be allowed by the Planning Director for minor\nPlanned Developments and by the Planning board for major Planned Developments.\n3. A street buffer shall be required along all boundaries of a PD fronting on a street or roadway.\n4. Additional landscaping and buffering requirements may apply. See Section 6.2, Landscaping and Buffering.\nG. Private Utilities\n1. Provision of all utility services, including, but not limited to: gas, water, sewer, electric, cable, and telephone, shall be underground.\n2.\nAdequate easements and rights-of-way for ingress and egress for maintenance shall be provided.\nH. Street/Internal Trafficways\n1. Creative design of circulation routes and trafficways is encouraged. A base characteristic of a PUD is that the internal circulation routes or\nstreets do not follow fixed linear geometric lines as do most streets. Instead, circulation routes are curvilinear and of meandering character,\nto preserve tree and landscape features. Generous use of design elements such as curved streets, private restrictions for extremely low\nspeeds and other features to achieve slower-paced traffic movements are strongly encouraged.\n2. A minimum right-of-way of at least 35 feet in width shall be required for all internal roadways. Additionally right-of-way may be required to\naccommodate wider roads or utilities.\n3. A minimum paved street width of 20 feet shall be required for all internal two-way roadways. One-way roadways shall require a minimum\npaved street width of 14 feet.\n44 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n"}, {"page": "45", "text": "Brunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\n4. Pedestrian-oriented communities also are encouraged to enhance the quantity of pedestrian activity and to improve the quality of the\npedestrian experience. Planned subdivisions must adhere to the design standards for drainage and paving found in Section 6.11.5, Streets.\n5. Where the development is bound by two or more NC DOT on-system roads, at minimum access to each road shall be provided. Siren\nactivated gate systems shall be required for all unattended gates.\n6. Adequately constructed and maintained bike and/or hiking trails shall be counted toward the open space requirement. Bicycle lanes and\nmulti-use pathways that extend the minimum right-of-way width shall be designed in accordance with the North Carolina Bicycle Facilities\nPlanning and Design Guidelines Manual.\nI. Modifications of Standards Using Planned Development\nModification of the base dimensional standards shall require approval by the Planning Director (minor site plan) or the Planning Board (major\nsite plan) in conjunction with the Planned Development approval process found in Section 3.3.3.\nJ. Limits on Modification of Standards\n1. Modification of the maximum development density or minimum open space requirement shall not be permitted, except as allowed through\na density bonus program (see Section 4.3.2 below) or as provided in Section 6.1, Design Flexibility.\n2. The minimum lot width and minimum yard requirements may be modified by the Planning Director or Planning Board through the PD\nprocess. However, the minimum distance between structures shall be as required by North Carolina Building Codes.\n(Ord. No. UDO-16-02, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8, 3-7-16; Ord. of UDO-17-01, \u00a7 4; Ord.

Development in this District should rely predominantly on individual wells and septic tank systems for\ndomestic water supply and sewage disposal, respectively, although clustered residential development served by public water and wastewater\nsystems may be allowed.\nB. R-7500, R-6000, and SBR-6000\nThe R-7500, R-6000, and SBR-6000 districts are established to provide for orderly suburban residential development. A limited number of\ncommercial and civic uses are allowed, subject to the restrictions necessary to preserve and protect the residential character of the\nneighborhood. A special permit process for higher intensity development is also allowed, using discretion to balance issues of higher density\nwith improved amenities. Due to the higher intensity developments contained in this district, it is intended to be applied to properties served by\npublic sewer and water systems.\nC. MR-3200\nThis district is established as an area in which the principal use of the land is for high density residential purposes, not to exceed fourteen\ndwelling units per acre. The district also provides for the development of less intensive residential uses, as well as for compatible supporting\nnon-residential uses. Due to the higher intensity developments contained in this district, it is intended to be applied only to properties served by\npublic sewer and water systems.\n4.4.2. Permitted Uses\nOnly uses specifically listed in the use table in Section 5.2 as a permitted (\"P\"), permitted subject to limited use standards (\"L\"), or permitted subject\nto special use permit (\"SUP\") shall be permitted in Residential districts.\n4.4.3.

Districts\nA. C-LD: Commercial-Low Density\nThis District is intended primarily to be used in outlying areas, adjacent to major thoroughfares, with yards and other provisions for reducing\nconflicts with adjacent residential uses, and with substantial setbacks to reduce marginal friction on adjacent major thoroughfares. Commercial\nuses in this District will serve the needs of residential neighborhoods for auto-dependent commercial facilities; and serve the needs of highway\noriented tourist business.\nB. N-C: Neighborhood-Commercial\nThe N-C, Neighborhood-Commercial District is primarily intended to accommodate very low intensity office, retail and personal service uses\nwithin and adjoining residential areas. The district is established to provide convenient locations for businesses which serve the needs of\nsurrounding residents, including low intensity office, retail, and personal service uses, without disrupting the character of the neighborhood.\nCompatibility with nearby residences is reflected in design standards for both site layout and buildings. In addition, uses in the N-C District will\nhave minimal infrastructure demands.\nC. C-I: Commercial-Intensive\nThe C-I District is intended for uses which require close access to major highways. Anticipated uses include those which are necessary to service\nmore intensive commercial and industrial districts, such as warehousing, storage, moving, service and repair, distribution, wholesaling,\nmarketing of specialty goods and light manufacturing plants.\n4.5.2.

Development Guidelines\nIn order to reduce the impact of development on the existing natural environment, the following guidelines apply to all activities within a CP\ndistrict. As guidelines, they provide an increased degree of flexibility.\ni. If development is anticipated to occur, the plan for such development should prioritize the preservation of natural habitat and sensitive\nenvironmental features such as large stands of trees, wetlands, Carolina Bays, pocosins, watercourses, marshes, and tidal areas.\nii. The use of Low Impact Design, stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) and other alternative construction principles is strongly\nencouraged.\niii. All site clearing and preparation, and construction activities should avoid removing existing trees and disturbing existing vegetation to\nthe extent possible.\niv. Although fencing is allowed, such fencing should be designed to allow for easy movement of wildlife. If more impervious fencing is\ndesired, it is recommended that such fencing be limited to the areas around inhabited or occupied structures so that remaining portions\nof the property allow easy movement of wildlife.\n(Ord.

The purpose of the Military Installation District (MI) is to recognize the location of major single use and multiple use military facilities in\nBrunswick County.\n2. While federal government areas are not subject to local zoning and other codes, they occupy large land areas in the County. These areas\ntherefore are identified on the zoning map as a Special Purpose District to differentiate them from other areas that are covered by the\nregulations in this Ordinance.\n3. The main objective of this District is to identify specific resources not otherwise identified where protection can be considered in the public's\ninterest; identify interests relating to land use planning that impact County policy on industry, the environment and residential land uses in\ngeneral; minimize substantial development impacts of these facilities; and develop a coordinated, planning/zoning process to include all\nfederal entities.\nB. Permitted Principal Uses and Structures\nThe uses specified as permitted uses include any uses authorized by, and located in, official Military Installations of the U.S. Government.\nC. Development Coordination Required/Encouraged\n1. Notification Required\nWhen an ordinance amendment or modification would result in a rezoning or change or affect the list of permitted uses within five miles of a\nmilitary base, comments and analysis of the base commander shall be included in the consideration before making a final determination\n(N.C.G.S. 160D-601). Mailed notification shall be provided prior to any such action as specified in Section 9.1.B.3.iv.\n2. Coordination Encouraged\nIn areas of MI Districts not affected by military security in areas where commercial, residential, or mixed use developments are proposed,\nand in areas where joint public/private development may be explored, the federal government and Brunswick County is encouraged to\nestablish a coordinated planning process to achieve both federal and local benefits, to minimize development impacts, and to help meet the\nobjectives and policies of the Land Use Plan of Brunswick County\nOrd.

Brunswick County has numerous waterways, marshes, Carolina Bays, pocosins, and other water courses that contribute to the County's\nscenic character and serve as a reminder of the important place these water courses hold in the County's history.\n2. The water courses are also an important natural resource and amenity to residents of and visitors to Brunswick County, and the scenic views\nassociated with these watercourses are an important attraction to residents and visitors to Brunswick County, which in large part is\neconomically dependent upon tourism.\n3.\nThe intent of the Viewshed Protection Overlay is to protect and enhance the scenic character of Brunswick County's riparian areas and water\ncourses, with the broader goal of ensuring the preservation of views from within these scenic areas as well as views of these areas from\nadjacent lands.\nB. Designation of Viewshed Protection Overlay\n1. A Viewshed Protection Overlay may only be established as a zoning map change in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.8,\nRezoning.\n2. The ordinance adopting the overlay district shall clearly designate the name and geographic limits of the watercourse to be protected (i.e.\ncan't just say Intercoastal Waterway, it must specify the extents of the district along the length of the watercourse).\n3. The following watercourses are designated (VS) Viewshed Protection Overlays:\nC. Applicability\n1. Generally, the requirements of this Viewshed Protection Overlay District apply to all structures within 300 feet of the normal high water line\nof a designated watercourse.\n2. However, the Planning Director may waive these requirements for structures related to an industrial use that is located in the RU-I or I-G\nzoning districts.\n3. These requirements shall not apply to water oriented commercial uses (see Section 5.1.4.)).\nD. Development Standards\n1. Portions of structures facing a protected watercourse that exceed 50 feet in height shall be set back a minimum of two feet for each\nadditional one foot in height above 50 feet. The Planning Director shall have the authority to determine which portions of a structure are\nconsidered to be \"facing\" the protected watercourse for the purposes of these regulations.\n2. With the exception of Water Oriented Commercial Uses (see Section 5.1.4.J), and permitted height obstructions (see Section 5.4.13.C) the\nmaximum height of any structure may not exceed 75 feet.\n4.8.8. WQP: Water Quality Protection\nA. Purpose and Intent\n1. It is the intent of Brunswick County to bolster those regulations of state and federal government as to the unique quality of the water of the\nLockwood Folly River associated with naturally occurring shellfish beds.\n2. The quality of these defined waters has been affected by such activities as forestry, farming, construction of roads, growth of towns, and\nrural and suburban residential development, as well as industrial processes associated with the fishing industry.\n3. Numerous types of water pollutants have been identified by state studies. No one or even several types or causes of such degradation have\nbeen determined as having more impact than any other.\n59 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\nCELL (1, 1): \nWatercourse\nCELL (1, 2): \nFrom\nCELL (1, 3): \nTo\nCELL (2, 1): \nName\nCELL (2, 2): \nLocation\nCELL (2, 3): \nLocation\nCELL (3, 1): \nIntracoastal Waterway (IWW)\nCELL (3, 2): \nBorder with New Hanover County\nCELL (3, 3): \nSouth Carolina State Line\nCELL (4, 1): \nLockwood Folly River\nCELL (4, 2): \nGenoes Point to Mullet Creek\nCELL (4, 3): \nTo and across the Intracoastal Water to\nSheep Island\nCELL (5, 1): \nTown Creek\nCELL (5, 2): \nUS Hwy 17\nCELL (5, 3): \nNC 133\nCELL (6, 1): \nShallotte River\nCELL (6, 2): \nUnincorporated Areas of Brunswick County\nCELL (6, 3): \n"}, {"page": "60", "text": "Brunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n4. The intent of this Water Quality Protection District is to apply a set of regulations for water quality protection, to specifically described areas\nof land abutting a specifically described water area; which is encompassed by a line drawn to extend across the Lockwood Folly River from\nGenoe's Point to Mullet Creek, southly to and across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway.\nB. Applicability\n1. The requirements and standards of the WQP- Water Quality Protection Overlay shall apply to all lands shown on a special Zoning Overlay\nMap made a part of this District, whereby all land parcels of public record included are clearly shown. This District includes an area extending\n575' landward of the mean high water line, with any lot or parcel falling within such distance being included entirely within this overlay zone.\n2. Parcels smaller than one acre in size shall be exempt from the requirements of this Section.\n3. Such waters have been defined by the State as being those waters south from a line extending from Genoes Point to Mullet Creek, to and\nacross the Intracoastal Water to Sheep Island.\nC. Incorporation of Studies by Reference\n1. Among the specific studies establishing the WQP District have been the March, 1989 publication entitled \"Report on Coastal Resource Waters\n- Intensive Study,\" by the Division of Environmental Management, N.C. Department of Natural Resources and Community Development, and\nthe August, 1989, publication entitled \"Lockwood Folly River Basin Water Quality Evaluation Report.\" Those studies are included by reference.\n2. The State of North Carolina has concluded the quality of the waters within the boundaries of the District had so declined there could be no\nassurance the proposed regulations would result in the goal of these waters being open full seasons for shell fishing. The Environmental\nManagement Commission did, under N.C. Administrative Code, Subordinance 2B, Surface Water Standards, Monitoring, Section .0219, Water\nQuality Management Plans, sub-section (b) establish a defined area of the mouth of this river, as above described, to be protected by a\nWater Quality Management Plan with specific actions which became effective January 1, 1990, included herein by reference.\nD. Application Requirements\nApplications for all development meeting the applicability requirements in the paragraph above shall require an approved Sedimentation\nErosion Control Plan be filed.\nE. Development Standards\nAll development within a WQP- Water Quality Protection Overlay shall:\n1. Limit the built upon impervious area to no more than 25% of the lot;\n2. Provide a buffer zone of at least 30' from any wetland or water line;\n3. Limit any structures to being at least 75' from the mean high water line; and\n4. Comply with any additional standards imposed by State or Federal regulations.\n4.9 VOLUNTARY AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT PROGRAM\nCommentary: The Voluntary Agricultural District is not an overlay zoning district, and is not implemented in the same was as a zoning district would\nbe.\n4.9.1.

Lot Line Equivalent\nThe following provisions shall apply in the determination of a lot line equivalent.\n1. A front lot line equivalent is a straight line joining the foremost points of the side lot lines. In the case of rounded property corners at street\nintersections, the foremost point of a side lot line shall be assumed to be the point at which the side and the front lot line would have met\nwithout such rounding.\n2. In the case of \"through lots\" (also referred to as \"double frontage lots\"), the lot shall be considered to have two front lot lines on each street\nfrontage.\n3. A rear lot line equivalent is a straight line joining the rearmost points of the side lot lines.\n4. A side lot line equivalent is a straight line joining the ends of the front yard line and the rear yard line on the same side of the zone lot.\n5. Flag lots shall be allowed in limited circumstances in conformance with Section 4.14.D.\nI. Lot Width\n1. Lot width shall be measured by the distance between the side lot lines (generally running perpendicular to a street), measured at the point\nof the front yard along a straight line parallel to the front of the property line or to the chord of the front property line.\n2. Except for cul-de-sacs, lot width (where they intersect with street line) may not be less than 80% of the minimum required width for the\ndistrict. In the case of lots on the turning circle of cul-de-sacs, lot widths may be 50% of district requirements.\nCommentary: In the graphic below, the measurement for lot width is indicated by the \"W\".\n\"W\"\nSide Lot\nLine\n\"W\"\nStreet Yard\nLine\nPoint of Tangency\nJ. Lot Depth\nDepth of a lot shall be considered to be the distance between the midpoints of straight lines connecting the foremost points of the side lot lines\nin the front and the rear. On corner lots, the street side lot line is considered to extend to the point of tangency with the front lot line. On lots\nlocated on the interior of a cul-de-sac, the front most measurement point is assumed to be the midpoint of the curve between the side lot lines.\n68 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n"}, {"page": "69", "text": "Brunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nSide Lot\nLine\nFront Lot Line\nPoint of Tangency\nEquivalent\nMidpoint of\nCurve\nCommentary: In the graphic above, the measurement for lot depth is indicated by the \"D\".\n4.14.2.

The minimum development area requirements\nmay require a lot larger than the minimum lot area required.\nB. Minimum lot area shall be exclusive of public right-of-way or private streets.\nC. In a residential development project, a single remaining lot of record (not allocated to any other dwellings) may be built upon if all other\ndimensional requirements can be satisfied on the lot. Lots created after May 1, 2007 that do not satisfy the minimum lot area requirements may\nnot be built upon.\nREAR SETBACK\nFRONT SETBACK\nFLAG\nSIDE SETBACK\nPOLE Minimum Width 30 feet\nSTREET\nFlag Lot\nD. Flag Lots\nWhen there are no other means of access to a parcel, the Planning Director may approve the creation of a flag lot, subject to the following\nprovisions:\n1.\nAccess shall be provided to the flag lot by means of an easement with a minimum width of 30 feet along the \"pole.\"\n2. The maximum length of the \"pole\" may not exceed 500 feet.\n3. The area inside the \"flag\" portion of the lot must satisfy the minimum lot area requirements for a conventional development within the\nunderlying zoning district.\n4. The flag portion of the flag lot must satisfy the minimum yard requirements of the zoning district.\n5. Where applicable, a driveway permit may be required from NCDOT. Failure to obtain a driveway permit shall result in denial of the flag lot.\n6. No more than four flag lots may be created from one parent parcel.\n7. Up to two flag lots may use the same access \"pole\" provided a shared access agreement has been recorded on the plat filed with Brunswick\nCounty.\n4.14.3. Density\nCommentary: This includes residential development in nonresidential districts and mixed-use projects.\nA. Definition\n\"Density\" refers to the number of dwelling units per unit of land area. For residential development utilizing the Conventional Development\nstandards (see Section 4.3.3), density is determined by dividing the total area (in acres) of the zone lot by the \"development area per dwelling or\nrooming unit\". The entirety of a lot is included in the calculation including, but not limited to, wetlands, ponds and marsh. The maximum density\nestablished for a district is not a guarantee that such densities may be obtained, nor, shall the inability of a development to achieve the stated\nmaximum density be considered sufficient justification for varying or otherwise adjusting other density or dimensional requirements.\nB. Density Transfer\nIn any instance where a particular development is located in more than one district the density shall be separately computed for each district\n69 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n"}, {"page": "70", "text": "Brunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blar\nand no density may be transferred between districts.\n4.14.4.

Yards or lots in existence prior to May 1, 2007 may not be reduced below the minimum dimensions required by this Ordinance unless\nspecifically exempted by Article 10, Nonconformities.\nB. Types of Yards\n1. There are three types of yards-front, side, and rear.\n2. On a corner lot, the side yard adjoining a street shall meet the street side yard dimensional requirement. In general, the street side yard shall\nbe the yard on the street with a lower classification. This is not necessarily the street that determines the address of the parcel.\n3. On a through lot (or double frontage lot), the lot shall have two front yards instead of one front and one rear yard. A front yard shall exist on\neach portion of the lot fronting on a street.\nC. Measurement of Yards\n1. The depth of a required yard shall be measured at right angles to a straight line joining the foremost points of the side lot lines. The\nforemost point of the side lot lines, in the case of rounded property corners at street intersections, shall be the point of tangency of the lot\nlines.\n2. The inner edge of the required side yard is parallel to the side lot line.\n3. The inner edge of the required rear yard is parallel to the rear lot line.\nRear Yard\nSide Yard\nSetback Line\nSetback Line\nSide Lot\nLine\nFront Yard\nSetback Line\nLot Line\nEquivalent\nPoint of Tangency\nD.

Where such similar\npermitted individual use or permitted group of uses is subject to a limited use standard contained in this Article or special use permit review, the\nproposed use shall also be subject to such standard or approval.

However, where the separate legal parcel is an outparcel, the application shall\ndescribe the relationship of the outparcel to the remaining site.\nCommentary: For example, where a vehicle repair shop in a C-LD District (subject to special use review) is an outparcel within a larger retail\ndevelopment, the special use shall review the outparcel only - not the entire development. However, where a special use is proposed in a\nbuilding that contains a variety of other uses, the entire building and its associated parcel(s) of land shall require special use review.\nE.

This Article provides the requirements associated with site design, appearance, infrastructure and other project elements\nfor major and minor developments outlined in Article 3, Review and Approved Procedures.\nThis Article is organized as follows:\nSite Design\nDesign Flexibility\nTrees and Landscaping\nBuffering\nScreening\nOpen Space and Recreation Areas\nHistoric Resources\nSuitability (wetlands, floodways, etc.)\nAppearance\nBuilding Facade\n158 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n"}, {"page": "159", "text": "Brunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nLarge Scale Development\nOutdoor Lighting\nFences and Walls\nVehicular\nStreets\nOff-Street Parking and Loading\nAccess\nEmergency Management Standards\nSite Triangles\nTraffic Impact Analysis\nInfrastructure\nRoadways\nWater and Sewer\nPrivate Utilities (electric, etc.)\nStormwater\nEasements\nMiscellaneous\nUtility, Dumpster, Recycling and Trash Handling\nName duplication\nAddressing\nOutdoor Display and Storage\n6.1 SITE DESIGN\n6.1.1. Design Flexibility\nFlexibility is provided in this Ordinance to promote quality development through the use of exceptional design principles and best management\npractices. The intent is to promote the use of exceptional design methods to achieve quality development without imposing financial or regulatory\nburdens on projects.\nLow Impact Development (LID) and other best management practices improve the environmental quality and sustainability of development. Many\nare very cost effective and can result in short and/or long-term cost savings. Use of these practices is strongly encouraged in the planning and\ndesign of projects.\nCredit toward meeting the buffer, recreation, open space, stormwater and other requirements of this Ordinance for residential and non-residential\nprojects may be obtained by utilizing best management practices, exceptional site and structure design, tree resource management, historic\nresource protection and other similar design practices. Examples of these techniques include the following:\nA. Site and/or structure design that reflects exceptional aesthetic elements and is consistent with the character and context of the community;\nB. Naturally shaped landscaped stormwater ponds with recreational features such as trails, bridges, gazebos, etc.;\nC. Tree resource management such as protecting large contiguous areas of heritage trees;\nD. Stormwater management utilizing LID methods such as bioretention;\nE. Connecting recreational elements with established greenways, trails, parks, etc.; and\nF. Green Growth techniques to conserve and connect highly sensitive areas.\nCommentary: Information and references regarding selected best management practices is provided in Appendix E.\n159 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n"}, {"page": "160", "text": "Brunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nAlternative design using exceptional methods that result in equivalent or superior compliance with the purpose and intent of this Ordinance may be\napproved by the Planning Director, in consultation with other County departments and/or outside agencies as deemed necessary.\n(Ord. No. UDO-16-02, \u00a7 25, 3-7-16)\n6.1.2. Trees and Landscaping\nA. Landscape Plan Required\n1. A landscape plan shall be submitted in conjunction with a required site plan. For minor site plan applications, the landscaping may be shown\non the site plan, as opposed to a separate landscape plan.\n2. Landscaping requirements for Parking Lots is provided in Section 6.12.10 Vehicular Use Area Landscaping.\n3. A Landscape Architect or other person with landscape design knowledge (this could include the land owner) shall prepare all landscape\nplans, except where expressly exempted by the Planning Director. The landscape plan shall adequately detail the requirements of this\nSection.\n4. As much as possible, landscape designs should incorporate as much contiguous undeveloped areas into their plans. Whether left\nundisturbed during development or planted during site development, the purpose is to create suitable wildlife habitat and corridors that\nfacilitate movement to adjoining forestland.\n5. Approved planting materials are provided in the standard plant list (see Appendix B for approved lists of Canopy Trees, Understory Trees\nand Shrubs). Alternative plant materials may be substituted if a letter of approval is provided from the N.C. Cooperative Extension. The\nplants approved for substitution shall be added to the standard plant list.\n6. Use of known invasive or problem plants is strongly discouraged (see Appendix B for plant listings and more detailed information).\n6.1.3. Tree Survey Required\nThe primary objective of tree survey requirements is to provide better information about the presence and location of heritage trees (see Section\n6.1.4.B) on sites proposed for development. This information is needed before plans for development are so far advanced that it is unreasonable\nand impractical to modify the plans to protect the trees identified on the tree survey. Tree survey requirements do not obligate a property owner or\ndeveloper to save trees by modifying a plan for development. However, knowing the location and size of heritage trees helps the staff evaluate\npossible modifications to the proposed plans to preserve heritage trees and improve the appearance of proposed development. Canopy trees\nshould be retained or installed to cover a minimum of 15% of the site. Coverage can be estimated by visual estimates, aerial photography or by land\nsurvey methods.\nA. Heritage Tree Survey\n1. A heritage tree survey shall be required for any multifamily development, nonresidential development, major subdivisions or planned\ndevelopment, with applications for site plan, preliminary plat, development plan, or special use permit. The heritage tree survey shall show\nthe general location, species and size of trees listed below. However, a heritage tree survey shall not be required for land in the floodway\n(unless filled or developed in accordance), preserved wetlands and wetland buffers, steep slope areas, and stream buffers.\n2. For purposes of this Ordinance, a heritage tree shall be defined as follows:\ni.\nA flowering Dogwood, Live Oak, Long Leaf Pine, Redbay, Black Tupelo or Laurel Oak with a trunk diameter measurement of 4\" or greater\nmeasured at 4.5 feet above ground;\nii. Any tree species included in the planting table (See Section 6.1.5.C) with a trunk calipen measurement of 18\" or greater measured at 4.5\nfeet above ground;\n3. For development plans where specific building locations are not shown, a more generalized survey of vegetation may be provided in lieu of a\nheritage tree survey. This survey shall describe existing forest stands, indicating the average species and size of trees on the tract. A more\nspecific survey should be provided in conjunction with preparation of specific development plans.\n4. Having better information about the location of heritage trees is not especially useful where plans call for the preservation of large areas in\nundisturbed vegetation. An example is the pervious portions of developments in watershed protection districts. Producing such information\nadds to the project's cost without providing information that could result in project redesign. Where unique site conditions or a proposed\ndevelopment arrangement indicate that the required heritage tree survey would produce little useful information, the Planning Director shall\nhave the authority to waive the requirements for a heritage tree survey for all or a portion of the tract.\n6.1.4. Credit for Existing Vegetation\nA. General\nThe retention of \"existing vegetation\" shall be maximized within the proposed landscaping, parking and buffer areas. When retaining existing\nvegetation within the buffer area, only clearing methods that do not disturb the root structure shall be allowed within the dripline of tree\ncanopies. Existing native habitat or plant material located within the proposed landscaping or buffer area that meets the percent opacity\nrequirements (See Section 6.3.9.A.4, Buffer Alternatives Table [Required Opacity]) of these regulations may be counted toward the total buffer\n160 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n"}, {"page": "161", "text": "Brunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nrequired between adjoining land uses, or toward total landscaping requirements. If the existing vegetation has been counted toward the total\nrequired buffer or landscaping and is subsequently removed or dies, it shall be replaced with the appropriate buffer or landscaping material.\nB. Heritage Trees\n1. With the exception of clearing required for required driveways or street connections, the retention of heritage trees within a proposed\nlandscaping or buffer area shall be required. The Planning Director shall have the authority to permit the selective removal of heritage trees\non a case by case basis.\n2. The preservation of heritage trees located on the interior of the lot is encouraged, but shall not be required.\nC. Credit for Existing Vegetation\nIn order to encourage the preservation of established vegetation, credit shall be given for preservation within the proposed buffer or other\nrequired landscaping areas on a one-for-one basis. In limited cases, the Planning Director may allow the applicant to count established\nvegetation located outside of the required planting area towards the landscaping requirement.\nD. Clear-Cutting\n1. With Forestry Activities\nProperties should not be clear-cut during the conduct of forestry or silvicultural activities. To maintain the visual character of the site from\nadjoining properties and right-of-way, a vegetated perimeter buffer shall be maintained while tree harvesting for forestry occurs. All existing\nvegetation located in a required side or rear yard shall be maintained, exclusive of areas required for access to the site or connection to\nadjoining sites. Along public rights-of-way, all existing vegetation located in a required street yard shall be maintained, exclusive of areas\nrequired for access to the site.\n2. Prior to Development\nProperties shall not be clear-cut prior to undertaking development activities. Along public rights-of-way, a buffer consisting of all existing\nvegetation located in a required street yard shall be maintained, exclusive of areas required for access to the site. Applications proposing\ndevelopment of properties that failed to maintain such a buffer prior to development may be denied for a period of up to five years from the\ndate of clearing in conformance with N.C.G.S. \u00a7 160D-921(c).\n3. During Development\nProperties shall not be clear cut while undertaking development activities. The preservation of the maximum amount of existing vegetation\nand selective removal of existing trees throughout the site is strongly encouraged during project design and construction. In order to\nencourage such preservation, the Planning Director may count established vegetation preserved during development towards the\nlandscaping requirement (see paragraph C, above) where the percent opacity requirement is met (See Section 6.3.9.A.4, Buffer Alternatives\nTable [Required Opacity]).\nCommentary: Clear-cutting trees should be avoided especially areas along roadways. Trees and plantings along roadways are desirable and\nprovides a better visual appearance for the traveling public. Additional benefits include decreasing stormwater runoff, reduction of site\nerosion and potentially favorable tax implications. Contact with the NC Forestry Service for forestry management guidance is strongly\nencouraged prior to undertaking clearing activity.\n(Ord. of UDO-17-01, \u00a7 19; Ord. No. UDO-21-01, 31, 5-17-21)\n6.1.5. Design of Landscaping and Buffers\nA. Design, Installation and Establishment Standards\nLocation of plants and design of landscaping, including maintenance, shall be according to sound landscape and horticultural principles. The use\nof native vegetation and other lower maintenance landscape materials is desired to promote environmental protection, energy efficiency, and\nwater conservation.\n1. Landscape plans submitted for approval for the purposes of satisfying the requirements of this Section shall clearly indicate the name,\nlocation, and size of vegetation to be installed as well as trees to be preserved.\n2. Plant material should be chosen from the lists of recommended plant species contained in Appendix and shall adhere to the minimum\nspecifications therein. Plant materials shall be reviewed for variety and suitability with regard to the eventual size and spread, susceptibility\nto diseases and pests, and appropriateness to existing soil, climate and site conditions.\n3. The height and canopy size at maturity of trees and other plantings should be considered with regard to potential conflicts with overhead\nlighting, utilities, etc.\nB. Issuance of Certificate of Occupancy\nA permanent certificate of occupancy shall not be issued, until all seeding, trees, and plant material have been placed in accordance with the\n161 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n"}, {"page": "162", "text": "Brunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\napproved site plan and requirements of this section. A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued for a period of 120 days under\ncircumstances that would affect the seeding and planting of the site, or until the proper planting season (generally early spring or early fall) is\nreached to complete the landscaping requirements, and may be extended up to 90 days upon request to the Planning Director.\nC. Plant Material and Minimum Plant Size\nThe following list shall be used as a guide in identifying and categorizing the different acceptable types and minimum sizes for any required\nplant. Although the lists may be expanded, they are intended to provide guidance in selecting predominately hardy natural species. All materials\nshall be of high-quality nursery grade.\n1. Trees\ni. Canopy Trees (see Approved Canopy Tree List in Appendix B) At the time of planting, the tree shall have a minimum caliper of two inches\nmeasured at 4.5 feet above ground.\nCommentary: At maturity, canopy trees shall be of a species having an average minimum height of 15 feet and a minimum mature crown\nspread of 20 feet.\nii. Understory Trees (see Approved Understory Tree list in Appendix B) At the time of planting, the tree shall have a minimum caliper of two\ninches measured at 4.5 feet above ground.\nCommentary: At maturity, understory trees shall be of a species having an average minimum height of eight feet and a minimum mature\ncrown spread of 12 feet.\n2. Shrubs (see Approved Shrub list in Appendix B)\nShrubs shall have a minimum mature height of 24 inches.\nD. Minimum Planting Areas\n1. Canopy trees shall have a planting diameter no less than 8 feet wide.\n2. Understory trees shall have a planting diameter no less than eight feet wide.\n3. When planted as a hedge, the maximum spacing for 20-inch high shrubs shall be 40 inches on center.\n4.\nThese minimum planting areas may be reduced administratively by the Planning Director.\nE. Mulch\nPlants shall be mulched to provide ground cover and prevent water loss due to evaporation. Where selected plant material is not tolerant of\ndeep mulch, a specific note regarding shallower mulch shall be set forth on the final landscape plan and approved by the County as part of the\nlandscape plan. Mulch shall be kept away from tree trunks.\n6.1.6. Requirements for Maintaining Planted Areas\nA. Responsibility\nThe responsibility for maintenance of a required buffer or other landscaping shall remain with the owner of the property, his or her successors,\nheirs, assignees or any consenting grantee. Maintenance is required in order to ensure the proper functioning of the plantings as a landscaped\narea which reduces or eliminates nuisance and/or conflict.\nB. Maintenance\n1. All plantings shall be maintained in an attractive and healthy condition. Maintenance shall include, but not be limited to, watering, mulching,\nfertilizing and pest management, mowing, weeding, removal of litter and dead plant material, and necessary pruning and trimming.\n2. Necessary pruning and trimming shall be in accordance with the American National Standards for Tree Care Operations: Tree Shrub and\nOther Woody Plant Maintenance - Standards Practices (Pruning), and shall not be interpreted to include topping of trees through removal of\ncrown material or the central leader, or any other similarly severe procedures such as lollipopping or meatballing that cause irreparable\nharm to the natural form of the tree, except where such procedures are necessary to maintain public overhead utilities. Any such activity\nshall be a violation of these zoning regulations.\n3. Dead or diseased plantings shall be removed. Unless specifically exempted (such as Understory Trees shaded by Canopy Trees), replacement\nplantings shall be provided for any required plants which die or are removed for any reason and shall meet all minimum standards and\nconform to these regulations.\n4. Natural water courses within a buffer shall be maintained in a natural condition consistent with any applicable regulations.\n5. A water source shall be supplied within 100 feet of any planting requiring continuing watering. Where non-native or non-drought tolerant\nnative vegetation is incorporated in the buffer, an irrigation system shall be required.\n6.\nLandscape structural features such as walls, fences, berms or water features shall be maintained in a structurally safe and attractive\ncondition.\n162 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n"}, {"page": "163", "text": "Brunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n7. Where other uses, including pedestrian, bike or other trails, are allowed within a buffer, these uses shall be maintained to provide for their\nsafe use.\nC. Failure to Maintain\nIn the event that any owner of a buffer area or vehicular use landscaping area fails to maintain same according to the standards of these\nregulations, these regulations shall be enforceable by the County with the right to recover the cost of enforcement, including reasonable\nattorney fees. The County may also, following reasonable notice and a demand that deficiency of maintenance be corrected, enter the buffer\narea to maintain same. The cost of such maintenance shall be charged to those persons having the primary responsibility for maintenance of\nthe buffer area.\n6.2 BUFFERING\n6.2.1. Intent\nBuffers are designed to protect adjoininglanduses,particularly residential,from the noise,heat,dust, lights, and aesthetic impacts from more\nintense land uses. There are three basic types of landscaping that may be required for any project. They include (1) project boundary buffers, (2)\nstreet buffers (which may include project boundary buffers or vehicular use area landscaping) and (3) vehicular use area landscaping. The project\nboundary and street buffers are described further in this section. The vehicular use area landscaping is described in Section 6.12.10 of this Article.\nThe more intense land use shall be required to provide the buffer as part of its yard requirements. The following requirements shall be met for\nbuffers and the yards in which buffers are required:\n6.2.2. Applicability\nThe landscaping and buffering requirements found in this Section shall apply to all development within Brunswick County with the exception of\nbona fide farming activities and the construction of one or two single-family or two-family households.\n1. Street buffer averaging consistent with Section 6.3.8, Street Buffers - Measurements of the UDO may be used to vary the project design.\n2. See Section 6.3.8, Street Buffers of the UDO.\n3. See Section 6.3.9, Project Boundary Buffers of the UDO. Buffer opacity is based upon the adjacent Zoning District and whether the\nadjacent parcel is vacant or developed. Alternatives for reductions in buffer depths are available in some instances.\n4. See Section 6.12.10, Vehicular Use Area Landscaping of the UDO for more information.\nCommentary: Credit for existing vegetation is possible. See Section 6.1.4 for more information.\n1. Plant material in buffer areas may be counted on a one-to-one basis toward the requirements for other required landscaping areas (e.g. vehicle\nuse area landscaping and screening) when located appropriately to serve both functions.

Buffer Defined\nA buffer is a specified land area, located parallel to and within the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel and extending to the lot or parcel boundary line,\ntogether with the planting and landscaping required on the land. A buffer may also contain, or be required to contain, a barrier such as a berm,\nfence or wall, or combination thereof, where such additional screening is necessary to achieve the desired level of buffering between various land\nuse activities. A buffer is not the same as the term \"yard\" or the term \"stormwater management area.\"\n6.3.2. Types of Required Buffers\nThere are two types of required buffers that may occur on any given development site, as follows.\nA. Street buffers; and\nCommentary: Generally, a street buffer is located along the street(s) that border a development. The buffer requires a modest amount of\nlandscaping, enhancing the \"public\" environment.\nB. Project boundary buffers.\nCommentary: Generally, a project boundary buffer is located around the sides and rear of a development. This buffer ensures an appropriate\ntransition between uses.\nA buffer located around the perimeter of a nonresidential use is intended to protect adjoining land uses from noise, heat, dust, lights, and\naesthetic impacts from more intense land uses.\n6.3.3. Location\nA. Buffers shall be located within the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, parallel to and extending to the lot or parcel boundary line. Buffers shall\nnot be located on any portion of an existing, dedicated or reserved public or private street or right-of-way.\nB. Buffers may be located and constructed within any required yard.\n6.3.4. Permitted Use of Buffer Area\nA. A buffer may be used for passive recreation and picnic facilities; and it may contain pedestrian, bike, or equestrian trails, provided that:\n1. Minimal existing plant material is eliminated;\n164 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n"}, {"page": "165", "text": "Brunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\n2. The total depth of the buffer is maintained; and\n3. All other requirements of these regulations are met.\nB. Other appurtenances which require high visibility and easy access, such as fire hydrants, public and emergency telephones, mail boxes, and\nschool bus or other bus shelters or benches, are also permitted in a buffer. No screening of such appurtenances is required.\nC. A required buffer is encouraged to retain areas of native habitat and may incorporate water resources including stormwater detention/retention\nfacilities designed as a natural-appearing amenity However a minimum 10-foot contiguous width of the buffer shall be preserved as a planting\narea without stormwater facilities.\nD. Ingress and egress to the proposeduse,andutility lines andappurtenances,may cross the buffer provided they minimize the amount of buffer\ntaken.\nE. The buffer area may be included as part of the calculation of any required open space.\nF. Identification signs may be located within a buffer as specifically permitted in the Sign Ordinance. The landscape buffer shall be designed to\naddress visibility of permitted ground signs.\nG. Lighting may be located within a buffer as specifically permitted in Section 6.9, Outdoor Lighting.\nH. Other activities and development required by this Ordinance or expressly authorized by the Planning Director.\n6.3.5. Prohibited use of Buffer Area\nA buffer area shall not be used for any building or use, accessory building or use, parking or loading area, storage area, or other principal or\naccessory uses except as specifically permitted in this Ordinance.\n6.3.6. Planting in Easements\nA. Where required plantings are located in easements, the property owner shall be responsible for replacement of such required vegetation if\nmaintenance or other utility requirements require their removal.\nB.\nNo trees shall be planted in wet retention ponds, drainage maintenance easement, or any utility maintenance easements.\nC. Shrubs may be planted within easements, provided they are only within the outer three feet of the easement. No new trees may be planted in\nan easement.\nD. Existing trees may remain in dry retention ponds provided that the natural grade is undisturbed to the tree line, they are a species adapted to\nseasonal flooding and the pond is adequately maintained.\n6.3.7. Determination of Buffer Requirements\nTo determine the type of buffer required between two adjoining lots or parcels, or between a lot or parcel and a street, the following procedure\nshall be followed:\nA. Street Buffers\nDetermine the appropriate street buffer based on Section 6.3.8.\nB. Project Boundary Buffers\nIdentify the zoning districts of the subject parcel and all adjoining properties. Determine the buffer opacity class required on each boundary (or\nsegment thereof) of the subject parcel. Refer to the minimum project boundary buffer table in Section 6.3.9.\nCommentary: Landscape plans should depict the basis for meeting planting requirements in 100 foot intervals.\n6.3.8. Street Buffers\nStreet buffers shall be required and existing vegetation should be used to satisfy these planting requirements where possible (see Section 6.1.4,\nExisting Vegetation). No vegetation or fence shall interfere with a required clear sight triangle at a driveway or intersection (See Section 6.15). Berms\nconstructed in accordance with Section 6.3.10.C, Berms with Vegetation, are encouraged as a component of any street buffer and the Planning\nDirector may allow up to 25% reduction in the required buffer depth with a berm.\nA. Measurements\n1. Street buffers shall be measured along a perpendicular line from the future right-of-way line determined during site and development plan\nreview. Buffer depth averaging may be used in conformance with paragraph 5, below.\n2. Required driveways may penetrate required street buffers.\n3. Driveway widths (measured at the inside edge of the buffer) shall not be counted in the calculation of the plant material required.\n4. Vehicular access easements shall not be treated as a street, but shall be buffered as a project boundary buffer outside the easement area.\nThe buffer may be provided on either side of the easement.\n5. While the buffer depth is normally calculated as parallel to the property line, design variations are allowed and are calculated on the average\n165 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n"}, {"page": "166", "text": "Brunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\ndepth of the buffer per 100 feet of linear width measured along the property line. Minimum depth of buffer in any case shall not be less than\n50% the required depth of the buffer chosen. Maximum depth shall not be more than 150% the required depth of the buffer chosen.\nMAXIMUM\nAVERAGE\nMINIMUM\nSTREET\nB. Collector or Thoroughfare Street Buffers\nAll development located along either a collector or thoroughfare street shall be required to provide one of the following buffers along the entire\nstreet frontage.\n1. One canopy tree per 100 linear feet of property frontage, located within a twenty-foot landscape buffer; OR\n2. Two understory trees per 100 linear feet of property frontage, located within a twenty-foot landscape buffer; OR\n3. Under utility lines only, two understory trees per 100 linear feet of property frontage, located within a 20-foot landscape buffer. No trees\nunder utility lines shall have a natural height over 25 feet.\nC. Local Street Buffers\nWith the exception of one- or two-family dwellings on a single lot or parcel, all development across a local street from a Residential district or\nuse shall require a buffer with a minimum opacity of .2 (see Section 6.3.9.A.2, Measurements) and a depth of 15 feet.\n6.3.9. Project Boundary Buffers\nCommentary: Project Boundary Buffers ensure a landscaped transition between different types of uses and/or zoning districts. At first glance, the\nfollowing method may seem complicated. In reality, this is a fairly easy approach to implement. A few simple steps will provide the total amount of\nplants that are required to be in a buffer as well as the buffer depth.\nThis approach also addresses the following criticisms that are raised when the County requires buffers and landscaping.\n1. What about unusual site circumstances? The table provides a number of alternative approaches to achieving the requirements.\n2. Why do I have to put all the plants in the lot next to me is vacant? This approach anticipates this type of situation. The initial developer will have a\nreduced buffer requirement.\n3. What if I want to put in a narrower buffer? The developer may select Alternative 3, Canopy and Wall or may install a berm. This will allow the\ndeveloper to reduce the buffer depth while still providing appropriate screening.\n4. There are already plants there - why do I have to put in new plants? Credit is given for existing plants (that meet a minimum size requirement) on\na one-for-one basis.\nA. Required Project Boundary Buffer Table\n1. Description\ni. The buffer standards in the table below address the opacity of the buffer that is required on the property boundary between zoning\ndistricts, and in some instances within a zoning district.\nii. An opacity of 0.2 screens 20% of an object, and an opacity of 1.0 would fully screen the adjoining development during summer months\nafter five years of growth.\n2. Measurements\nProject boundary buffers shall be measured along a perpendicular line from the lot line.\n3. How to Read the Buffer Table\ni. The required opacity of project boundary buffers is represented in the Table below by two numbers (for example, .2/.6).\nii. The second number represents the total required buffer opacity between any two properties.\niii. Where the proposed project adjoins vacant property, the first number represents the applicant's required buffer opacity.\niv. Where the adjoining property is already developed with no buffer, the proposed project is responsible for providing the total required\nopacity (the second number).\n[See Buffer Alternatives Table]\nV. Where the adjoining property is already developed with a partial buffer, the proposed project is responsible for providing the remaining\nopacity required.\nvi. A zero means no project boundary buffer is required.\n166 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\nCELL (1, 1): \nZONING DISTRICT of SUBJECT PROPERTY\nCELL (1, 2): \nZONING DISTRICT of ADJOINING PROPERTY\n"}, {"page": "167", "text": "Brunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n1 Non-residential uses locating next to vacant property shall be required to provide a 0.2 buffer.\n2\nWhen locating a non-residential use in a Rural Residential, R-7500, R-6000, SBR-6000, MR-3200, NC, C-LD, or RU-I Zoning District next to\nan existing residential developed property, a 0.4 buffer shall be required. Non-residential uses locating next to other non-residential uses\nare not required to provide a buffer.\nCommentary: A .2/.4 requires a 20% opaque buffer for property adjacent to vacant land or a 40% opaque buffer when adjacent to existing\ndevelopment. A .4/.4 requires a 40 percent opaque buffer property adjacent to either vacant or developed land.

Large Scale Commercial\nA. General Purpose and Intent\nB. The purpose of this Section is to supplement development standards elsewhere in these zoning regulations with specific criteria that apply to\nthe design of certain commercial buildings and projects.\nC. The County's goal is to create and maintain a positive ambiance and community image and identity by providing for architectural and site design\ntreatments that will enhance the visual appearance of certain commercial development and the quality of life.\nD. The applicable commercial development depends on high visibility from public streets. In turn, design of certain commercial buildings and sites\ndetermines much of the image and attractiveness of the streetscapes and character of the community. Massive, duplicative or generic projects\nthat do not contribute to, or integrate with, the community in a positive manner can be detrimental to a community's image and sense of place.\nE. This Section incorporates a basic level of architectural design which, in conjunction with site design, landscaping, lighting and sign treatments\nlocated elsewhere in this Ordinance, is intended to result in a comprehensive scheme for building design and site development. However, this\nSection is not intended to require any specific style of architecture.\nF. This Section is also intended to:\n1. Promote high standards in architectural design and the construction of creative, innovative, aesthetically pleasing structures;\n2. Encourage landowners, designers and developers to look closely at local conditions and the development site, and produce new\ndevelopment that enhances and complements both the built and natural environment;\n3. Ensure that development and building design is sensitive to the specific site, consistent with the existing and proposed character of the area,\nincluding residential and nonresidential uses in the surrounding area, and does not detract from the positive elements existing\nneighborhood characteristics.\n6.7.2. Large Scale Commercial Defined\nLarge scale commercial developments are considered to be any structure or group of structures that share common walls that have an enclosed\ngross floor area of 75,000 square feet or more.\n6.7.3. Applicability\nThe requirements of this section shall apply in the following circumstances:\nA. Where compliance with these standards is explicitly required in other portions of this Ordinance.\nB.\nConstruction of any new use classified as Commercial or Office (see Section 5.1, Use Interpretation).\nC. Construction of any new use classified as Industrial when located within 100 feet of a public roadway.\nD. Expansion or modification of an existing commercial or office use that increases the total enclosed floor area by at least 50% or 5,000 square\nfeet, whichever is greater.\n6.7.4.

Street Classification\nA. In all new subdivisions, streets that are dedicated to public use shall be classified as provided in this Section.\n1. The classification shall be based upon the projected volume of traffic to be carried by the street, stated in terms of the number of trips per\nday;\n2. The number of dwelling units to be served by the street may be used as a useful indicator of the number of trips but is not conclusive;\n3. Whenever a subdivision street continues an existing street that formerly terminated outside the subdivision or it is expected that a\nsubdivision street will be continued beyond the subdivision at some future time, the classification of the street will be based upon the street\nin its entirety, both within and outside of the subdivision.\nB. The classification of streets shall be as follows:\n1. Alley. A vehicular way used for providing service access along rear or side property lines of lots which are also served by one of the other\nlisted street types. Alleys are not intended to accommodate through traffic.\n2. Minor. A street whose sole function is to provide access to abutting properties. It serves or is designed to serve not more than nine dwelling\nunits or expected to or does handle up to 75 trips per day.\n3. Local. A street whose sole function is to provide access to abutting properties. It serves or is designed to serve at least 10 but no more than\n25 dwelling units or expected to or does handle between 75 and 200 trips per day.\n4. Cul-de-sac. A street that terminates in a vehicular turnaround.\n5. Subcollector. A street whose principal function is to provide access to abutting properties but is also designed to be used or is used to\nconnect minor and local streets with collector or arterial streets. Including residences indirectly served through connecting streets, it serves\nor is designed to serve at least 26 but not more than 100 dwelling units and is expected to or does handle between 200 and 800 trips per\nday.\n6.\nCollector. A street whose principal function is to carry traffic between minor, local, and subcollector streets and arterial streets but that may\nalso provide direct access to abutting properties. It serves or is designed to serve, directly or indirectly, more than 100 dwelling units and is\ndesigned to be used or is used to carry more than 800 trips per day.\n7. Arterial. A major street in the county's street system that serves as an avenue for the circulation of traffic into, out, or around the county and\ncarries high volumes of traffic.\n8. Marginal Access Street. A street that is parallel to and adjacent to an arterial street and that is designed to provide access to abutting\nproperties so that these properties are somewhat sheltered and so that the flow of traffic on the arterial street is not impeded by direct\ndriveway access from a large number of abutting properties.\n9. Thoroughfare. A street serving the principal network for high volumes of traffic or high speed traffic as shown on the County Transportation\nPlan. This street type consists of at least two travel lanes in each direction. A thoroughfare shall be designated where the anticipated average\ndaily volume exceeds 5,000 vehicles. Residences should not front on a major thoroughfare.\n6.11.2. General Standards\nA. Road widening and right-of-way dedication shall be consistent with the recommendations of the adopted County or NCDOT Transportation Plan.\nB. The proposed street layout in new development shall be coordinated with the existing street system with connections made at all future\nconnections. Where no full connection can be made as a result of the topography of the site being developed, the developer may install a cul-de-\nsac bulb or other turnaround facility.\nC. Creative design of circulation routes and trafficways is encouraged. A base characteristic in Planned Developments is that the internal circulation\nroutes or streets do not follow fixed linear geometric lines as do most streets. Instead, circulation routes are curvilinear and of meandering\ncharacter, to preserve tree and landscape features. Slower-paced traffic movements, private restrictions for extremely low speed limits.\nD. Where a tract of land to be subdivided adjoins a principal arterial street, the subdivider may be required to provide a marginal access street\nparallel to the arterial street or reverse frontage on a minor street for the lots to be developed adjacent to the arterial. Where reverse frontage is\nestablished, private driveways shall be prevented from having direct access to the principal arterial.\nE. Where, in the opinion of the Planning Director, or Planning Board, it is necessary to provide for street access to an adjoining property, proposed\nstreets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such property and a temporary turn-around provided.\nF. All public streets shall be built to the standards of this Ordinance and all other applicable standards of the County and the NCDOT.\nG. Streets which are not eligible to be put on the State Highway System because there are too few lots or residences shall, nevertheless, be\nconstructed in accordance with the standards in this Ordinance or the standards necessary to be put on the State Highway System, so as to be\neligible to be put on the system at a later date. A written road maintenance agreement with provisions for maintenance of the street until it is\nput on the State system shall be included in the final plat (see paragraph H, below).\n179 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n"}, {"page": "180", "text": "Brunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nH.

All roads that are not maintained by NCDOT (including those approved for dedication but not yet incorporated into the state road system) shall\nbe dedicated to a property owners association, and comply with the following, prior to approval of the final plat:\n1. The association shall be responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the street or road.\n2. The property owners association shall be established before the lots are sold.\n3. Membership in the association shall be mandatory for each lot buyer and all successive buyers.\n4. Any sums levied by the association that remain unpaid shall become a lien on the individual owner's property which shall be subordinate to\ntax and mortgagee liens.\n5. Owners of each lot shall have voting rights in the association.\n6. The following information shall also be provided:\ni. The name and address of the association.\nii. The manner in which directors of the association are to be selected.\niii. The post office address of the initial registered office.\niv.

Connectivity Defined\nConnectivity shall be defined by the ratio of links to nodes in any subdivision.\n1.\nThe connectivity ratio shall be the number of street links divided by the number of nodes or end links, including cul-de-sac heads.\n2. A link shall be any portion of a street, other than an alley, defined by a node at either end. Future connections to adjoining property shall be\nconsidered links. For the purpose of determining the number of links in a development, boulevards, median-divided roadways, and divided\nentrances shall be treated the same as conventional two-way roadways.\n3. A node shall be the terminus of a street or the intersection of two or more streets.\ni. Any curve or bend of a street that exceeds 75 degrees shall receive credit as a node. Any curve or bend of a street that does not exceed\n75 degrees shall not be considered a node.\nii. The Planning Director may allow a divided entrance to count as two separate links provided the median dividing the entrance extends at\nminimum to the first internal intersection of the subdivision.\nB. Required Ratio\n1. Street Network\ni. The street network for any subdivision with internal roads or access to any public road shall achieve a connectivity ratio of not less than\n1.3 in all tiers except the Rural Low Density Residential Zoning Districts, measured within the subdivision.\nii. Within the Rural Low Density Residential Zoning Districts, the street network for any subdivision with internal roads or access to any\npublic road shall achieve a connectivity ratio of not less than 1.15, measured within the subdivision.\n2. Street links and nodes along a marginal access street providing access to a proposed subdivision shall not be considered in computing the\nconnectivity ratio.\n3. Future connections that cannot be constructed pursuant to Sec. 6.11.3.E, Future Connections, shall be considered as being present as a link\nat the ratio of one link per side as provided in Sec. 6.11.3.E, Future Connections, for purposes of determining if the required ratio has been\nmet.\n180 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n"}, {"page": "181", "text": "Brunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nEXAMPLE I: Does not meet ratio\nEXAMPLE 2: Modified to meet ratio\n(13 links/ I nodes = 1.18)\n(15 links/ I nodes = 1.36)\n4\n(4)\n9\n5\n10\n12\n13\n10\n11\n(11)\n(12)\n(15)\nNew External\nConnection\n13\n8\n6\n14\n-New Internal\n7\n(8)\n(7)\nConnection\nNumber = Link\n= Node\nC.

Required points of access may provide access restrictions in the form of an electronically-controlled gate that may be opened by\nemergency responders via siren activation or other approved method. During times of emergency evacuation (such as a natural\ndisaster), gates may be required to be opened to provide alternative evacuation routes.\n2. The Planning Director may allow a divided entrance to count as two separate links provided the median dividing the entrance extends at\nminimum to the first internal intersection of the subdivision.\n3. The Planning Board may approve variations in the requirements of this section when additional access points cannot be provided due to the\nfollowing circumstances:\ni. If the only additional access points available would require crossing floodplains, steep slopes, or other similar natural features; or,\nii. When the existing development pattern precludes additional access points and fewer units than would otherwise be allowed would be\nout of character with the surrounding development.\nD. Connections to Adjoining Properties\n1. Street connections or future connections to adjoining properties may be required. See Section 6.11.3.E, Future Connections, for standards.\n2. Connections may provide access restrictions in the form of an electronically-controlled gate that may be opened by emergency responders\nvia siren activation or other approved method. During times of emergency evacuation (such as a natural disaster), gates may be required to\nbe opened to provide alternative evacuation routes.\nE. Future Connections\n1. Unless exempted below, future connections are required on each side (as defined by each of the cardinal directions) of a development as\nfollows:\ni. Rural Low Density Residential Zoning Districts\nAt\nleast one future connection for every 2,800 linear feet on any single side of the proposed development.\nii. All other Zoning Districts\nAt least one future connection for every 1,400 linear feet on any single side of the proposed development.\n2. Exemptions\ni. Future connections are not required adjoining existing development that has not made any accommodation for such connections or to\nadjoining sites that are permanently protected from development through conservation easements or ownership that precludes\ndevelopment.\n181 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n"}, {"page": "182", "text": "Brunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nii.

When street lights are installed, they must be in accordance with the\nprovisions of Section 6.9.7, Excessive Illumination and the minimum spacing and other standards of the appropriate utility company.\n6.12 - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING\n6.12.1. Statement of Intent\nA. Vehicles require adequate space in safe operating and parking conditions for all land uses, public and private. Yet Brunswick County has a\nunique and sensitive environment whereby space for vehicle parking and loading should have the least necessary impervious surface, should\nnot drain directly into the waters of the county, and should be adequately designed for either on-site absorption of or disposal of such vehicular\nwastes such as oils.\nB. Brunswick County is dependent upon its tourists and seasonal visitors for sustenance of the economy. In keeping with a tourist economy is the\nneed for presentation of a harmonious image. Landscape features to buffer large areas for parking and loading are required for such economic\nprotection of the county, and for relief from heat build-up of large surface areas.\nC. Exception Design in parking lot landscaping, stormwater management, lighting, circulation, directional elements, etc. may be eligible for credit\ntoward buffer, landscaping or other requirements.\n6.12.2. Applicability\nA. No Building Permit, Certificate of Zoning Compliance, or Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued for uses of land, structures, and buildings,\neither initially or for a change in use or expansion of an existing use, unless the off-street parking and loading requirements of this Article are\nsatisfied.\nB. Applicants proposing to construct large-scale parking facilities may be required to obtain a Transportation Facility Permit from the North\nCarolina Division of Air Quality prior to initiation of construction in conformance with 15A NCAC 02D .0800. Consult with the Planning Director\nfor more information.\nCommentary: Generally, a large scale parking facility is a surface parking lot with at least 1,500 spaces, a parking deck with at least 750 spaces, or a\ncombination of surface and structured parking that has at least 1,000 spaces. See 15A NCAC 02D .0805: Parking Facilities for specific applicability\nstandards.\n6.12.3. Activities Exempt\nCommentary: In order to accommodate renovation and investment in commercial properties or very small scale construction of single-family\nhomes, ordinances often provide an exemption from parking requirements for certain activities.\nA. A change in use or expansion of an existing use meeting either of the following criteria shall be exempt from the requirements of this Article:\n1. Expansions of less than 1,500 square feet or 10% of the total enclosed floor area (whichever is greater); or\n2. The new use has the same parking requirement or a lesser requirement than the previous one.\nB. Restriping of a parking area or other vehicular use area which does not result in reconfiguration of the parking spaces shall be exempt from the\nrequirements of this Article.\nC. Construction or modification of an individual single-family or two-family residence by the owner shall be exempt from the requirements of this\nArticle.\nCommentary: Construction of an entire subdivision, however, is not exempt.\n6.12.4. Plans Required\nApplications for permits and/or certificates shall include information as to location and dimension of off-street parking, and means of ingress and\negress to such space, a copy of the Sedimentation and Erosion Control Plan prepared and filed under N.C. Statute for same, and a showing of\nshrubbery areas, trees to be saved or added, berms, proposed fences or walls, proposed surface materials, proposed lighting, and written\nassurance the N.C. Statute on handicapped parking will be satisfied.\n6.12.5. Design Standards\nA. General Requirements\n1. Parking areas shall be designed to allow unobstructed movement into and out of each parking space without interfering with fixed objects\nsuch as lighting fixtures, dumpsters, signage, or vehicles.\n2. Each parking space within the parking area must be delineated by striping, curbs (each space signed or appropriately marked), wheel stops\nor other similar alternative devices. Railroad ties and landscape timbers are not considered acceptable alternative devices.\n3. All parking areas shall be designed to provide for internal circulation such that each parking space is accessible to all other parking spaces\nwithout necessitating the use of a public street or alley.\n185 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n"}, {"page": "186", "text": "Brunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n4. Cross access drives between adjoining uses and properties shall be encouraged.\n5. Off street parking or loading areas may not be located within any required buffer (see Section 6.3).\n6. Modifications to off-street parking and loading to allow stormwater best management practices consistent with an approved stormwater\nplan may be considered.\nB. Paving\n1. Where an existing tree is adjacent to a parking area, paver bricks, tree grates, or other pervious surface shall be used within the dripline of\nthe tree.\n2. Unless alternative surfaces are specified elsewhere in this document, or are approved by the Planning Director, in consultation with the\nDirector of Engineering Services, all required parking and loading spaces, except for those associated with single-family dwellings, shall be\nsurfaced with asphalt bituminous, concrete or dustless material and shall be maintained in a smooth, well-graded condition.\nCommentary: Approved alternative surfaces are gravel, slate, and recycled asphalt.\n3. Within the Rural Low Density Residential districts, required off-street parking and loading spaces may be covered with an all-weather surface\ndesigned to support anticipated loads. Loose material surfaces shall be contained with a permanent edging. The surface shall be maintained\nso that traffic may move safely in and out of the parking area.\n4. Alternative Parking Surfaces\ni. Pervious pavers or concrete, stabilized grass lawn, or other pervious parking surfaces may be permitted for specific uses as set forth\nbelow, provided they are approved by the Planning Director, in consultation with the Director of Engineering Services. Where provided,\nsuch alternative parking surfaces shall be maintained in a smooth, well-graded condition. If parking demand is such that the grass or\nlawn is caused to be damaged or destroyed to the extent that it ceases to grow, then paving of the area in accordance with this section\nmay be required.\nii. All driveways, access aisles and parking spaces (excluding handicapped) may be surfaced with grass lawn or other pervious parking\nsurface for the following:\n(a) Uses which require parking on an average of less than five days per week during a month;\n(b) Parks, playgrounds, ballfields, football and baseball stadiums, fairgrounds, and other similar outdoor recreation areas; and\n(c) Surplus parking areas above the required number of parking spaces (see Section 6.12.6, Required Parking).\nC.

Landscaping Required Prior to Occupancy Permit\nCompletion of landscape improvements in off-street vehicular facilities is required prior to issuing any final certificate of occupancy for\nconstruction subject to this Section. In cases where planting is delayed until the appropriate planting season the applicant may pursue the\nfollowing actions:\ni. A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued by the Zoning Administrator. However, no temporary certificate may be issued for a\nperiod in excess of six months, unless extended by the Zoning Administrator; and\nii. The applicant must post a financial guarantee or letter of credit equal to 125% of the value of the required improvements.\n3. Required Interior Landscaping\nEach off-street facility for parking or any other vehicular uses shall be constructed so that interior portions of off-street vehicular facilities\nnot utilized specifically as a parking space or maneuvering or other vehicular use area shall not be paved, but shall be landscaped in\naccordance with this Section.\ni. Each off-street parking facility with 20 spaces or more shall provide one landscaped island for each twenty 20 spaces or fraction thereof.\nii. For off-street parking facilities with 20 or more parking spaces at least one landscaped island must be located within 150 feet of every\nparking space.\niii.

No tree or shrub more than two feet in height shall be planted within two feet of the\nedge of the landscape island.\nii. Curbs shall be installed to prevent vehicles from overhanging on or into adjoining property, or landscaped areas. Where vehicles will\noverhang over medians or islands, shrubs and trees shall be planted a minimum of two feet from back of the curb. Where alternative\nparking surfaces are provided the Zoning Administrator may allow wheel stops in place of curbs.\niii. The front of a vehicle may not encroach within any project boundary or street buffer area.\niv. If no curb is provided, parking bumpers shall be provided to achieve the same effect.\n5. Relocation of Required Landscaping\nIn some vehicular use areas, the strict application of this subsection would seriously limit the function of the area, such as vehicle\nstorage/display areas and grass parking areas. In such areas, the Zoning Administrator may approve the relocation of the square footage of\nrequired landscape islands and medians, along with the required trees to the perimeter of the parking area.\nF.

Improvements to provide required access must be installed and approved by the County or, where applicable, NCDOT, prior to final plat or final\nmaster plan approval. No certificate of occupancy will be issued prior to the installation of the required access improvements, except for\nconstruction of model units as provided in Section 9.4.\nC. In general, the minimum required width is equal to a 20-foot-wide public access easement, although this may be reduced by the Planning\nDirector if access sufficient to satisfy paragraph A. above is provided. Additional width access easements may also be required to accommodate\ndriveways or roadways serving large developments.\nD. Cross access connections between adjoining uses may be required (see Section 6.13.5).\n6.13.2. Driveway Permit Required\nAn NCDOT driveway permit may be required for driveways serving any new use or change from an existing that accesses a state maintained road.\nConsult the Planning Department for more information.\n6.13.3. Driveway Design\nA. In general, driveways shall meet minimum NCDOT driveway standards.\nB. All driveways shall conform to the site triangle requirements of Section 6.15.\nC. Parking in driveways shall not be permitted unless it is determined by the Planning Director, in consultation with the Fire Marshall that\nemergency access shall not be impaired.\nCommentary: Chapter 7, Section J. \"Control Dimensions\" of the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) Policy on Street and Driveway\nAccess to North Carolina Highways dated July 2003 states \"A driveway with two-way operations shall have a minimum 20 foot and a maximum 36\nfoot width.

When a lot or development borders on or contains an existing or proposed thoroughfare as delineated by a County or NCDOT Transportation\nPlan access to the thoroughfare may be limited by one or more of the following means:\n1. A separation of 400 feet is required from the nearest centerline of any other proposed or existing driveway access along the same side of the\nthoroughfare. Reduced separation may be authorized only by review and recommendation of the Zoning Administrator and NCDOT.\n2. Lots shall be subdivided so as to provide access onto a frontage road or reverse frontage road. The centerline of the frontage or reverse\nfrontage road where it intersects the thoroughfare shall be no closer than 800 feet to the centerline of the nearest proposed or existing\ndriveway access or road.\n3. Driveway access closure may be required for any change in use of a lot based upon review and recommendation of the Zoning Administrator\nand NCDOT.\n4. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, access provisions may be reduced when:\ni. The effect of such application would be to deprive the lot of reasonable access; or\nii. The size of the tract being subdivided, or lack of frontage on the thoroughfare makes the alternatives above not feasible.\n(Ord. No. UDO-19-02, 9, 9-19-19)\n6.13.5. Cross-Access Corridors\nA. Description\nIn order to reduce the traffic burden created by vehicles traveling short distances on the public roadway, cross-access corridors are driveways\nconstructed between adjoining properties to provide an alternative passageway to access adjoining developments without entering and exiting\nthe roadway. These cross-access corridors are intended to link parking areas on neighboring developments.\nB. Applicability\n1. Cross-access corridors(s) shall be required for all nonresidential sites within a related project (as evidenced by a common development plan\nor site plan); even if the properties are subdivided.\n2. Cross-access corridor(s) are encouraged for all other developments.\n3.

At\nthese meetings, the community has an opportunity to review the proposal and may offer suggestions. Community suggestions are not binding but\nthe meeting can result in a better final project.\nWhile the meeting is not a requirement for new projects, it is good planning practice and it is our experience that most in the development\ncommunity are already holding meetings like this. These guidelines are intended to provide a framework for applicants who are not familiar with the\nprocess.\nA neighborhood meeting is required for all modifications to an approved or existing Planned Development or Major Subdivision.\nAn example of the benefit of these meetings is the preservation of a pedestrian trail to a nearby school. Although children had been using the path\nfor years, it didn't show up on any property maps or aerial photos and the developer wasn't aware of it. The developer agreed to preserve the trail\nand the community actually advocated for the project at the public hearing because the project improved child safety. Other examples of when a\nneighborhood meeting would be required are when open space is proposed to be converted to another land use such as single-family residential or\nwhen a single-family residential use is proposed to be converted to a multi-family residential use.\nA. After the project planning session, the applicant is encouraged to hold a neighborhood meeting prior to submitting an application for any of the\nfollowing approvals:\n1. Rezoning (Section 3.8);\n2. Planned Development review (Section 3.3.3); and\n3. Special Use Permit (Section 3.5).\nB. A neighborhood meeting is required (MANDATORY) for Conditional Zoning, all modifications to an existing Planned Development or an existing\nMajor Subdivision, except in situations where the Planning Director is authorized to approve the modification administratively.\nCommentary: Examples of situations where a neighborhood meeting is required include a change in land use from open space to single-family\nor single-family to multi-family.\nC. The purpose of the neighborhood meeting is to inform the neighborhood of the nature of the proposed land use and development features,\nexplain the plan (if any), and receive comments. Comments from the neighborhood are not binding on the applicant. However, the applicant\nmay elect to revise elements of the project to incorporate suggestions.\nD. When a neighborhood meeting is required, a neighborhood meeting verification form shall be obtained from the Planning Department prior to\nholding said meeting.\nE. At the meeting, the applicant should present a concept plan and provide a narrative description of the proposed project. This meeting may be\nconducted in multiple formats, including:\n1. A single presentation or workshop before the attendees;\n2. An open house where individuals may receive information on the proposal and offer comments. If this option is used, the open house\nshould be available multiple days including at least one weekend day; or\n3. Other format deemed appropriate with consultation of the Planning Director.\nF. When a neighborhood meeting is held, the meeting must occur at least ten days prior to the first public hearing where the application is to be\nconsidered.\n239 of 293\n3/10/24, 20:38\n"}, {"page": "240", "text": "Brunswick County, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blan\nG.
