Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide standards for the use of solar energy\nequipment as accessory uses within the Town of Kure Beach. This section seeks to protect\nproperties from incompatible uses and to conserve and enhance property values, while\npromoting the use of alternative energy sources, where appropriate. This section provides a\nprocess to facilitate the use of solar power in a manner that minimizes visual impacts of solar\nenergy equipment and the potential for nuisance.\nB. Definition. \"Solar energy equipment\" is defined as a solar photovoltaic panel, solar hot air or\nhot water panel collector device, or other type of energy system which relies upon solar\nradiation as a source for the generation of electricity or transfer of stored heat which is\nlocated on the power beneficiary's premises; is designed and intended primarily to offset up\nto one hundred fifty (150) percent of the beneficiary's requirements for energy consumption\non-site as documented through the submission of power company electricity usage bills or\nanother form of documentation acceptable to the Town of Kure Beach Zoning Officer; and is\nsecondary to the beneficiary's use of the premises for other lawful purposes. Systems that\noffset over one hundred fifty (150) percent of the beneficiary's requirements for energy\nconsumption on-site are classified as commercial systems and are prohibited.\nC. Accessory use. Solar energy equipment shall be permitted as an accessory use in any\nzoning district upon receipt of a permit from the building inspector.\nD. Exclusions from building permit requirement.\n1. The installation of one (1) solar panel with total area of less than four (4) square feet.\n2. Repair and replacement of existing solar energy equipment, provided that there is no\nexpansion of the size or coverage area of the solar energy equipment.\n3. Nonconforming solar energy equipment installed prior to the adoption of Ord. of\n5-15-12 shall be excluded from permit requirement. Solar energy system equipment\nthat replaces fifty (50) percent or more of existing solar energy system equipment\ninstalled prior to the adoption of Ord. of 5-15-12 needs to conform to Ord. of 5-15-12.\nE. Application for building permit.\n1. An applicant who seeks to install solar energy equipment shall submit an application\nfor a zoning permit, as provided by the Town of Kure Beach. The application shall\ninclude photographs of the existing conditions of the property as well as renderings of\nthe proposed solar energy equipment from front street level.\n2. Review of application: Upon receipt of a completed application for the installation of\nsolar energy equipment, the building inspector shall have the authority to impose\nreasonable conditions to safeguard the public health, safety and welfare.\nF. Regulations and requirements.\n1. Solar energy equipment shall be located in the least visibly obtrusive location where\npanels would be functional;\n2. Solar energy equipment must comply with all setback and height requirements for the\nzoning district in which the property is located.\n68 of 109\n5/10/2024, 9:37 AM\n"}, {"page": "69", "text": "Print Preview\nhttps://kurebeach.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordinanc.\nG.\nRoof-mounted systems. All roof-mounted systems must have an engineer's letter outlining\nsuggested attachment. Roof-mounted systems refers to systems mounted on the primary\nresidential or commercial mounted systems.\n1. It is encouraged that roof-mounted solar energy equipment shall be installed in the\nplane of the roof (flush-mounted) or made a part of the roof design (capping or\nframing is compatible with the color of the roof or structure). Mounting brackets shall\nbe permitted if the applicant can demonstrate that the existing pitch of the roof would\nrender the solar energy equipment ineffective or would be impossible. A roof-mounted\nsolar energy facility or structure that is to be mounted on a flat roof may be angled to\nachieve maximum sun exposure but shall not exceed five (5) feet above the roof.\n2. Solar energy equipment shall be located on a rear- or side-facing roof, as seen from\nthe fronting street, unless the applicant can demonstrate that such installation would\nbe ineffective or is impossible.\n3. Solar energy equipment shall not project vertically above twelve (12) inches below the\npeak of the roof to which it is attached, or project more than five (5) feet above a flat\nroof.\n4. The solar energy equipment shall not be within twelve (12) inches from the leaves of\nthe roof or within twelve (12) inches from the overhang of the roof.\n5. All exterior electrical and/or plumbing lines must be painted in a color scheme that\nmatches as closely as reasonably possible the color of the structure and the materials\nadjacent to the lines.\n6. No roof-mounted solar energy equipment shall be installed on a nonconforming\nstructure that would create more nonconformity.\n7. An external disconnect switch shall be provided, and the owner must file a map with\nthe fire and police departments clearly showing where the disconnect switch is\nlocated.\n8. At no point shall any solar equipment exceed thirty-five (35) feet in height.\n9. The Town of Kure Beach recognizes that there are continuous improvements in solar\nequipment technology. Nonreflective solar cells that are completely integrated\ninto\nnormal building material such as roof tiles may be exempt from subparagraphs G,3\nand G,4. The building inspector will determine if the proposed system is sufficiently\nintegrated into the building material to qualify for this exemption.\nH. Ground-mounted systems.\n1. The ground-mounting of solar energy equipment is not allowed with the following\nexceptions:\na. Small, incidental systems used for solar lights and landscaping, not to exceed\none (1) square foot per system.\nb. The total combined square footage for ground-mounted solar energy\nequipment cannot exceed four (4) square feet per property.\nC.

Only those signs that are permitted shall be erected\nwithin the jurisdictional areas of this article. See the table on file in the town clerk's office for list of\nsigns that are prohibited by zone.\nA. Computation of area of individual signs. The area or \"surface area\" of a sign is defined by the\nsmallest perimeter (formed by a rectangle) fully enclosing the total surface devoted to the\nsign's message, together with any ornamentation, embellishment, and associated\nbackground, excluding any necessary supports or uprights on which the message is placed\nand excluding any architectural ornamentation. As an aid to interpreting this formulation, the\nfollowing is to be employed:\n1. If the message is on a surface, structure or frame specifically employed for holding\nsignage, the entire surface area within the frame's border is counted;\n2. If the message is on a door, wall or other structural part of a building, only that portion\nof the door, wall or structure actually devoted to the message and associated symbols\nand background, if any, is counted.\n3. If a sign has two (2) or more faces, the area of all faces shall be included in\ndetermining the area of the sign and the area of the sign shall be taken as the area of\none (1) face if the two (2) faces are of equal area, or the area of the larger face if the\ntwo (2) faces are of unequal area.\nB. Total sign area allowed for permanent nonresidential signs. Each commercial and business\nproperty is allowed a total aggregate surface area not to exceed one and one-half (11/2)\nsquare feet for each linear foot of building frontage. Buildings located on corner lots (fronting\nupon two (2) public commercial street rights-of-way, excluding alleys, walkways, side streets\nand residential streets) and multi-story buildings with upper-floor, nonresidential occupants or\ntenants are allowed a maximum sign surface not to exceed one and one-half (11/2) square\nfeet for every linear foot of building frontage. Suspended and projecting signs shall be\ncalculated separately from other wall signs.\nC. Signs not included in total area allowance. All permanent signs permitted and regulated\nthrough the ordinance shall count as part of the property's total allowed signage except:\nbuilding markers, flags and flagpoles, identification, incidental, wall-mounted directory of no\nlarger than three (3) square feet, shingle/suspended signs of no larger than two (2) square\nfeet in total area. In addition, signs specifically associated with sidewalk cafes, sandwich\nboards and street furniture shall not be calculated as part of the establishment's total sign\narea.\n(Ord. of 3-15-11, 2)\nHISTORY\nAmended by Ord.
