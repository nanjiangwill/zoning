Subject to subsection b below, the Planning Director is authorized to interpret the\nboundaries of the Watershed Overlay districts in accordance with Section 1.7.C,\nInterpretation of Zoning Map Boundaries.\nb. The Planning and Zoning Commission may, in carrying out its plan review authority under\nthis Ordinance, adjust the boundary of any Watershed Overlay District to fit existing or\nproposed streets, lot lines or other features provided that such adjustments are agreed to by\nthe landowner(s) involved and provided that any such adjustment is made with no loss of\ntotal area in the affected Critical Area of the Watershed Overlay District.\n(5) ADJUSTMENT OF BOUNDARIES\na. A landowner may request that the Planning and Zoning Commission make a determination\nas to whether a property or portion of a property that is shown on the Zoning Map as lying\nwithin a Watershed Overlay District actually lies outside the drainage area of the applicable\nwatershed. After receiving such a request, the commssion shall make a determination as to\nwhether the property or portion of property identified in the request lies outside the\ndrainage area of the applicable watershed. The commission's determination shall be based\non actual field conditions of the property as determined by topographical conditions. In\nmaking its determination, the commission may require the landowner to produce relevant\nexpert testimony and exhibits.\nb. If the Planning and Zoning Commission determines that all or a portion of a property\nactually lies outside the drainage area of the applicable watershed in accordance with\nsubsection a above, the commission shall transmit its determination to the Planning\nDirector, who shall intiate a Zoning Map amendment in accordance with Section 2.5.A(2),\nZoning Map Amendment, to amend the MPO district boundaries consistent with the\ncommission's determination. All proposed modifications of the Watershed Overlay District\nboundary shall be approved by the Environmental Management Commission or its designee\nprior to approval of the admended boundary by the Planning and Zoning Commission.\n(6) GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL WATERSHED OVERLAY DISTRICTS\nThe following provisions apply to all Watershed Overlay Districts. These provisions and the\nprovisions contained in the Individual Watershed Overlay Districts are designed to protect the\nwater quality of the Water Supply Watersheds that lie within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance\nand to implement the rules adopted by the North Carolina Environmental Management\nCommission (the \"EMC\") for the classified watersheds in accordance with state law.\na. DENSITY AVERAGING\nWhen all of the following conditions are met, two noncontiguous lots, neither of which is\npublicly held land, may be treated together for compliance with the maximum development\nintensity of Table 3.8.1(8). Publicly held land includes but is not limited to dedicated drainage\nand open space, parkland, or other land obtained for watershed protection by a public\nagency, or land otherwise protected from development.\n1.

USE CLASSIFICATIONS\nUse Classifications are very broad and general (e.g., Residential Uses, Civic/Institutional Uses,\nCommercial Uses, and Industrial Uses).\nb. USE CATEGORIES\nUse Categories represent major subgroups of the use classifications that have common\nfunctional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, type\nof occupants or users/customers, or operational characteristics. For example, the\nCommercial Uses classification is divided into multiple use categories, like\nRecreation/Entertainment and Retail Sales and Services.

USE TYPES\nUse Types identify specific principal land uses whose characteristics are considered to fall\nwithin the various use categories. For example, self-service laundry and personal grooming\nor well-being services are use types within the Personal Services category. Use types are\ndefined in Article 10: Definitions (listed alphabetically with other defined terms).\n(3) AGRICULTURAL/RURAL USES\nThe Agriculture/Rural Uses category includes use types related to the production of field crops,\nfruits, vegetables, ornamental and flowering plants, and the breeding, raising, or keeping of\nlivestock, poultry, swine, bees, or other animals for food or other marketable products. This\ncategory also includes use types that provide support and services to agricultural uses or are\notherwise closely related to agricultural production and/or rural character in their form and\nfunction. This use category does not include the processing of animal or plant products for\nwholesale or retail sale purposes off the site of where the agricultural product is grown or\nraised, which is generally considered an industrial use. Accessory uses may include offices,\nstorage areas, barns, irrigation systems, and repair facilities related to the agricultural or forestry\nactivities.\n(4) RESIDENTIAL USES\na. HOUSEHOLD LIVING USES\nThe Household Living category includes use types providing for the residential occupancy\nof\na dwelling unit by a single family. Tenancy is generally arranged on a month-to-month or\nlonger basis. Use types include duplexes, live-work units, manufactured homes, multifamily\ndwellings, pocket neighborhood developments, single-family detached dwellings, tiny house\nneighborhood developments, townhouses, and triplexes. This use category does not include\nresidential use types that generally involve some level of managed personal care for a larger\nnumber of residents (e.g., boarding house), which are categorized as the Group Living\ncategory. Accessory uses common to Household Living Uses include recreational activities,\nraising of domestic pets, gardens, swimming pools, and parking of the occupants' vehicles.\nSome accessory uses (e.g., accessory dwelling units, home occupations) are subject to\nadditional regulations (see Section 4.3, Accessory Uses and Structures)\nb. GROUP LIVING USES\nThe Group Living category includes use types providing for the residential occupancy of a\ngroup of living units by people who sometimes (but not always) do not constitute a single\nfamily or housekeeping unit and may receive some level of personal care. Individual living\nunits often consist of a single room or group of rooms without cooking and eating facilities\n(even though some do have such facilities), but unlike a hotel, motel, or short-term rental,\nare generally occupied on a monthly or longer basis. Use types include boarding houses,\ncooperative houses, dormitories, family care homes, and residential care facilities. Although\nfamily care homes include household living and health care components, they are\ncategorized as a group living use because of their focus on the present or future provision\nof personal care to people and their integration of various uses as single cohesive\ndevelopment. This category does not include use types where persons generally occupy\n4-12\nThe Kannapolis Development Ordinance Effective July 1, 2022\n"}, {"page": "221", "text": "Article 4.

Experience in this City as well as in cities and counties within and outside of\nNorth Carolina including the County of Los Angeles, the City of Garden Grove\nand the cities of Renton, Washington; Seattle, Washington; Detroit, Michigan;\nAustin, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Phoenix Arizona; have demonstrated that\nsuch uses have objectionable secondary effects upon immediately adjacent\nresidential and commercial areas. The City recognizes and relies upon the\nexperience of these other cities and counties in adopting sexually oriented\nbusiness regulations including the County of Los Angeles (as discussed in Smith\nV. County of Los Angeles 211 Cal. App. 3d 188 (1989)); City of Renton, Washington\n(as discussed in City of Renton V.

The City also recognizes and\nrelies upon the studies done by: (1) the 1979 Adult Use Study by the Phoenix\nPlanning Department; (2) Tucson, Arizona (1990); (3) the 1991 report to the City\nof Garden Grove by Drs.

The City Council believes the following statements are true, in part based upon\nits understanding of the experiences of the various jurisdictions identified.\na. Crime rates tend to be higher in residential areas surrounding sexually\noriented businesses than in industrial areas surrounding sexually oriented\nbusinesses;\nb. Areas within close walking distance of single and multiple family dwellings\nshould be free of sexually oriented businesses;\nC. Sexually oriented businesses should be located in specific areas of the City\nwhich are a specified distance from sensitive uses such as residences, parks,\nreligious institutions and schools, irrespective of whether physical barriers are\npresent. This necessary to (1) ensure that the impact on such sensitive uses\nby adverse secondary effects caused by sexually oriented businesses are\nmitigated to the maximum extent possible; (2) to prevent ad hoc decisions\nwith respect to a potential sexually oriented business site which does not\nmeet the criteria set forth herein; and (3) to provide certainty to the residents\nof the City and sexually oriented business operators with respect to potential\nadult use sites.\nd. The image of the City as an attractive place to reside will be adversely\naffected by the presence of sexually oriented businesses in close proximity to\nresidential uses, schools, religious institutions and parks;\ne. The existence of sexually oriented businesses in close proximity to residential\nareas has been shown in some cities to reduce the property values in those\nresidential areas;\nf. A reasonable regulation of the location of sexually oriented businesses\nprotects the image of the community and its property values and protects its\nresidents from the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses\nwhile providing those who desire to patronize sexually oriented businesses\nan opportunity to do so in appropriate areas in the City; and\ng. There is substantial evidence that an increase in crime tends to accompany,\nconcentrate around, and be aggravated by sexually oriented businesses,\nincluding but not limited to an increase in the crimes of narcotics distribution\nand use, prostitution, pandering, and violence against persons and property.\nThe studies from other cities establish convincing evidence that sexually\noriented businesses which are not regulated as to permissible locations often\nhave a deleterious effect on nearby businesses in residential areas, causing,\namong other adverse secondary effects, an increase in crime and a decrease\nin property values. Regulations for sexually oriented businesses should be\ndeveloped to prevent deterioration and/or degradation of the vitality of the\ncommunity before the problem exists, rather than waiting for problems to be\ncreated.\nThe Kannapolis Development Ordinance Effective July 1, 2022\n4-43\n"}, {"page": "252", "text": "Article 4. Use Regulations\nSection 4.2. Principal Uses\nSection 4.2.D. Standards Specific To Principal Uses\n4. The City Council recognizes and relies on the findings set forth in the 1986 N.C.\nAttorney General's Report on Pornography in support of this Ordinance\nincluding, but not limited to its recommendations that local governments ban\ncertain features of video booths that facilitate carnal sexual encounters.\n5. The City Council finds the following, in part based upon its understanding of the\ndocuments and judicial decisions in the public record:\na. Evidence indicates that some dancers, models and other persons who\npublicly perform specified sexual activities or publicly display specified\nanatomical parts in sexually oriented businesses (collectively referred to as\n\"performers\") have been found to engage in sexual activities with patrons of\nsexually oriented businesses on the site of the sexually oriented business;\nb. Evidence has demonstrated that performers employed by sexually oriented\nbusinesses have been found to offer and provide private shows to patrons\nwho, for a price, are permitted to observe and participate with the performers\nin live sex shows;\nC.\nEvidence indicates that performers at sexually oriented businesses have been\nfound to engage in acts of prostitution with patrons of the establishment;\nand\nd. As a result of the above, and the increase in incidents of AIDS and Hepatitis\nB, which are both sexually transmitted diseases, the City has a substantial\ninterest in adopting regulations which will reduce, to the greatest extent\npossible, the possibility for the occurrence of prostitution and casual sex acts\nat sexually oriented businesses.\n6. The City Council has determined that the establishment of a sexually oriented\nbusiness development permit process is a legitimate and reasonable means of\nensuring that:\na. Operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with the reasonable\nregulations of this Ordinance;\nb. The recognized secondary impacts of a proposed sexually oriented business\nin a specific location are mitigated; and\nC. Operators of sexually oriented businesses have specific guidelines with\nrespect to where they can establish or operate a sexually oriented business.\n7. It is not the intent of the City Council in adopting this Ordinance to suppress any\nactivities protected by the First Amendment, but rather to enact a content neutral\nordinance which addresses the secondary effects that sexually oriented\nbusinesses have on the City.\n8. The City Council desires to protect the rights conferred by the United States\nConstitution to sexually oriented businesses in a manner that ensures the\ncontinued and orderly development of property within the City and diminishes\nthose undesirable negative secondary effects the previously mentioned studies\nhave shown to be associated with the development and operation of sexually\noriented businesses.\n4-44\nThe Kannapolis Development Ordinance Effective July 1, 2022\n"}, {"page": "253", "text": "Article 4.

FINDINGS\n(1) The Kannapolis City Council makes the following findings:\na. Development and redevelopment have the following impacts:\n1. Alteration of the hydrologic response of local watersheds;\n2. Increase in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil erosion, stream channel\nerosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and sediment transport and deposition;\nand\n3. Reduction of groundwater recharge;\nb. These changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of water-borne\npollutants and alterations in hydrology which are harmful to public health and safety as well\nas to the natural environment;\nC. These effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and well-planned\ncontrols to manage stormwater runoff from development sites; and\nd. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (\"Clean Water Act\") and federal Phase Il\nStormwater Rules promulgated under it, as well as rules of the North Carolina Environmental\nManagement Commission promulgated in response to federal Phase II requirements, require\nthe City to adopt the minimum stormwater controls in this section.\n(2)\nTherefore, the Kannapolis City Council hereby adopts the water quality and quantity regulations\nset forth in this section to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of\nstormwater runoff and discharge.\nB. PURPOSE AND INTENT\nThe purpose of this section is to protect, maintain, and enhance the public health, safety,\nenvironment, and general welfare by establishing minimum standards to control the adverse effects\nof increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution, and to\ncontrol illicit discharges into municipal stormwater systems. The standards in this section are\nintended to ensure proper management of construction-related and post- development stormwater\nrunoff in order to minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, protect water\nand aquatic resources, and safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare. The provisions in\nthis section are intended to achieve the purpose of this section specifically by:\n(1) Establishing decision-making processes for development that protects the integrity of\nwatersheds and preserves the health of water resources;\nThe Kannapolis Development Ordinance Effective July 1, 2022\n5-121\n"}, {"page": "414", "text": "Article 5.
