Types of zoning districts.\nThe Village zoning jurisdiction is divided into zoning districts within which the use of land is\nregulated as herein provided. The four categories of zoning districts are as follows:\n(A)\nGeneral use zoning districts. Each general use district (R-40, R-10, ML, etc.) serves a\ndifferent purpose and imposes a set of requirements and restrictions on the use of land in\n27\n"}, {"page": "32", "text": "addition to the general requirements and restrictions of this ordinance that are imposed on\nall land or uses within the zoning jurisdiction.\n(B)\nConditional zoning districts (CD).\n(1)\nThe Village has established parallel or counterpart conditional districts to a\nnumber of general use districts. In such cases, references in this ordinance to the\ngeneral use district shall be construed to include the counterpart conditional\ndistrict. While general use districts are established by this ordinance, site specific\nconditional districts are established by a rezoning process as provided in Article\nXVI.\n(2)\nA conditional district is intended to accomplish the purposes of the counterpart\ngeneral use district through the development of site plans and additional\nconditions at a specific location in accordance with Article XVI. All regulations\nand uses that apply to a general use district shall also apply to the counterpart\nconditional district and no use shall be allowed in the conditional district that is\nnot allowed in its counterpart general use district.\n(3)\nConditions that are suggested by the applicant for conditional rezoning shall be\nbinding upon property within that conditional district in perpetuity or until the\nproperty is rezoned by the Village Council. Such conditions may include\nincreased buffers, architectural features, access, parking, hours of operation, or\nany other feature of the development that is integral to meeting the spirit and\nintent of this ordinance and that serves to mitigate the impacts of the development\non adjacent property or the community at large. These conditions must be agreed\nto and enforceable by the Village Council.\n(4)\nThis is a voluntary procedure that must be initiated by all of the property owners\nwithin the area to be rezoned that is intended for firm development proposals that\nmust be commenced within a specific time period.\n(C)\nOverlay districts. Overlay districts are established by a rezoning process to provide for\ncertain additional requirements, to permit uses not otherwise permitted in the underlying\ndistrict, to prohibit uses allowed in the underlying district, or to establish special\ndevelopment requirements for uses permitted. Where an overlay district is established\nand there is a conflict between the requirements or uses specified for the overlay district\nand the underlying district, the requirements and uses of the overlay district shall prevail.\nOverlay rezoning may be initiated by the Village Council or by a property owner in\naccordance with Article XVI and may overlay conditional districts and general use\ndistricts. One example of an overlay district would be a floodplain overlay district where\nthe floodplain lies within several general use districts. Certain uses and structures might\nbe restricted or prohibited within the floodplain overlay district. Another example would\nbe a historic overlay district.\n28\n"}, {"page": "33", "text": "(D)\nConditional overlay districts. Two types of conditional overlay districts are specifically\nestablished by this ordinance as specified in Section 814 and Section 815, Residential\nPlanned Unit Development conditional overlay districts and Commercial Planned Unit\nDevelopment conditional overlay districts, although other types of conditional overlay\ndistricts are possible. Conditional overlay districts are subject to a rezoning process\nunder Article XVI. Conditional overlay districts are like conditional districts in that the\napplicant must initiate an application for the rezoning and that conditions suggested by\nthe applicant and agreed to by the Village Council as part of the rezoning process are\nbinding on the property. These districts are also like overlay districts in that uses not\notherwise permitted in the underlying district may be permitted, such as the uses that are\nspecified in Section 814 and Section 815.\nSection 701.
