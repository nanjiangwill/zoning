The BOA, in considering special use permit applications, acts in a quasi-judicial capacity and, accordingly, is required to observe\nquasi-judicial procedures, including requiring a simple majority vote to issue a special use permit. For purposes of this section, vacant positions on the BOA\nand members who have been disqualified from voting on a quasi-judicial matter shall not be considered \"members of the Board\" for calculation of the\nrequisite majority.\n(2) In considering whether to approve an application for a special use permit, the BOA shall proceed according to the following format.\n(a) The BOA shall consider whether the application is complete. If the BOA concludes that the application is incomplete and the applicant refuses to\nprovide the necessary information, the application shall be denied. A motion to this effect shall specify either the particular type of information lacking or the\nparticular requirement with respect to which the application is incomplete. A motion to this effect, concurred in by a simple majority vote of the BOA, shall\nconstitute the BOA's finding on this issue. If a motion to this effect is not made and concurred in by a simple majority vote, this shall be taken as an affirmative\nfinding by the BOA that the application is complete.\n(b) The BOA shall consider whether the application complies with all of the applicable requirements of the UDO. If a motion to this effect passes by the\nnecessary majority vote, the BOA need not make further findings concerning those requirements.\n(c) If such a motion fails to receive the necessary majority vote or is not made, then a motion shall be made that the application be found not in\ncompliance with one or more requirements of the UDO.

Nontraditional\nresidential lot development encourages innovative land planning and design concepts by:\n(a) Reducing or eliminating the inflexibility that sometimes results from strict application of zoning and development standards that were designed\nprimarily for individual lots;\n(b) Allowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access, light, open space and design amenities;\n(c) Allowing greater freedom in providing a mix of land uses in the same development, including a mix of housing types, housing prices, lot sizes,\ndensities and nonresidential uses;\n(d) Promoting quality urban design and environmentally sensitive development by allowing development to take advantage of special site\ncharacteristics, locations and land uses; and\n(e) Encouraging quality urban design and environmentally sensitive development by allowing increases in base densities when the increases can be\njustified by superior design or the provision of additional amenities such as public and/or private open space.\n(2) In return for greater flexibility in site design requirements, nontraditional residential lot developments are expected to: deliver exceptional quality\ncommunity designs that preserve critical environmental resources; provide above-average open space amenities; incorporate creative design in the layout of\nbuildings, open space and circulation; coordinate and unify design elements of the project, including building materials, signage and architectural\ncompatibility; assure compatibility with surrounding land uses and neighborhood character; and, provide greater efficiency in the layout and provision of\nroads, utilities and other infrastructure. The Conditional Zoning District process shall not be used as a means of circumventing the city's adopted zoning and\ndevelopment regulations for routine developments.\n(B) Nontraditional residential lot development defined.\n(1) Nontraditional residential lot development is an area of land under unified control, to be developed as a single entity for a number and variety of\ndwelling units, according to a Master Plan which is approved at the time of rezoning. Lands rezoned to a Conditional Zoning District for nontraditional\nresidential lot development may incorporate up to 15% of the total project area to limited convenience commercial buildings or services to serve the\nresidences of the project. Lands rezoned to a Conditional Zoning District for nontraditional residential lot development shall meet the use and development\nrequirements of division (D) below.\n(2) Nontraditional residential lot developments such as mixed use (upper story attached dwellings) requested within traditional commercial zoning\ndistricts such as Highway Commercial (HC), and Office and Institutional (O&I) shall incorporate a minimum of 15% of the total project area to commercial\nbuildings or services. The development of neighborhood, community or regional commercial centers shall be in scale with surrounding market areas at\nlocations recommended in the City Comprehensive Land Use Plan. The development is intended to permit the establishment of the projects only where\nplanned centers with carefully organized buildings, service areas, parking areas and landscaped open spaces will clearly serve demonstrated public need,\nreduce marginal traffic friction below that which would result from strip commercial development along highways, and protect property values in surrounding\nneighborhoods. Lands rezoned for these developments to a Conditional Zoning District shall meet the size requirements of division (E) below.\n(C) Nontraditional residential lot development; general use and development standards.\n(1)\nUses allowed. A nontraditional residential lot development may contain any or all of the uses specified in the approved development Master Plan,\nprovided the uses are consistent with the City Comprehensive Land Use Plan. A wide range of uses is possible in a nontraditional residential lot development,\nand the specific uses allowed may be different in each development approved through the Conditional Zoning District (CD) process. All uses that are set out\nin an approved Master Plan shall be treated as permitted uses within the development, except that uses which are prohibited in \u00a7 154.03(D) of this chapter\nshall not be permitted within the development.\n(2) Certain mixed uses allowed.\n(a) Mixed use developments are encouraged and allowed in Nontraditional Residential Lot Developments through the Conditional Zoning District\nprocess only as specified in this chapter. Mixed use development may occur by having retail or commercial uses located in the same building (e.g., retail or\noffice space on ground floor, and residential above) or by having nonresidential uses located in different buildings sited on the same lot or parcel (e.g., office\nbuilding located on the same parcel as a freestanding residential structure).\n(b) Mixed use developments shall be designed, located and oriented on the site so that nonresidential uses are directly accessible to residents of the\ndevelopment. For the purposes of this section, DIRECTLY ACCESSIBLE shall mean pedestrian and vehicular access by way of improved sidewalks or paths\nand streets that do not involve leaving the development or using a major thoroughfare. DIRECTLY ACCESSIBLE does not necessarily mean that\nnonresidential uses need to be located in a particular location, but that the siting of the uses considers the accessibility of the residential component of the\ndevelopment to the nonresidential use.\n(3) Applicable standards.\n(a) Nontraditional residential development approved through a Conditional Zoning District shall be subject to all applicable overlay district regulations in\nChapter 154, all applicable use regulations set forth inChapter 155, all applicable environmental regulations ofChapters 50 through 54 in the city code of\nordinances, and Chapter 156, and all applicable general regulations set forth inChapter 157, unless otherwise waived or modified by the city in the terms of\nthe approved master plan. In case of any conflict between a specific regulation set forth in this \u00a7 154.03 and any regulation set forth inChapters 154 through\n157, the regulation in this section shall apply unless otherwise expressly allowed.\n(b) Notwithstanding division (C)(3)(a) above, in no case shall the Board of Commissioners waive or modify the following standards for a proposed\nnontraditional residential development:\n1.\nAll AICUZ Overlay District requirements and standards (\u00a7154.07), including permitted use restrictions and noise level reduction requirements;\n2. Ownership requirements for any open space, buffers or streetscapes unless otherwise permitted within the UDO;\n3. Stormwater control and erosion and sedimentation control requirements ofChapter 156; and\n4. Setback reduction below the minimum required by division (C)(3)(c) below.\n(c) Dimensional standards for nontraditional residential developments are provided for inChapter 155 and shall be stated on the Master Plan and/or\nthe associated site plan. A building setback of less than three feet is permitted only where firewalls are provided in accordance with all applicable Building\nCode requirements.\n(4) Emergency access. Any building established as a part of a nontraditional residential development which cannot properly be served by emergency or\nservice vehicles from an abutting street shall be made accessible to the vehicles by a paved driveway having a roadbed width of not less than 20 feet,\nexclusive of parking spaces.\n(5) Transportation and circulation system. The development's Master Plan shall demonstrate a logical, adequate, safe and convenient on-site\ntransportation system that addresses vehicular, bicycle, pedestrian and transit circulation that connects all residential areas with pedestrian destinations on\nand off-site, such as schools, churches, shopping areas and recreational areas. All elements of the on-site transportation system shall be integrated with all\noff-site transportation circulation systems, with particular attention to minimizing pedestrian/automobile contact.\n"}, {"page": "21", "text": "(6) Off-street parking and loading. The development's Master Plan shall comply with the off-street parking and loading requirements ofChapter 157,\nexcept that variations from these standards may be permitted if a comprehensive parking and loading plan for the development is submitted as part of the\nMaster Plan that is suitable for the development and consistent with the intent and purpose of the off-street parking and loading standards of the UDO.\n(7) Landscaping. Landscaping shall comply with the standards ofChapter 157, except that variations from these standards may be permitted where it\nis\ndemonstrated that the proposed landscaping sufficiently buffers uses from each other, ensures compatibility with land uses on surrounding properties,\ncreates attractive streetscapes and parking areas, and is consistent with the urban design objectives and/or character of the area.\n(8) Utilities.\n(a) Nontraditional residential lot development projects shall provide for underground installation of utilities, including telephone and power in both\npublic and private rights-of-way, except when conditions not reasonably within the control of the developer make this requirement unpractical.\n(b) Every residential and nonresidential lot shall be served by a water supply system and a sewage disposal system that: is adequate to accommodate\nthe reasonable needs of the proposed use; and complies with all applicable City and County Health Department regulations, as specified in Chapter 150.\n(9) Areas to be preserved. In all nontraditional residential lot development projects, efforts shall be made to preserve historic sites, scenic points, large\ntrees and other desirable natural growths, watercourses and other water areas, and other features worthy of preservation, either as portions of public sites\nand open spaces, or in the other form as to provide amenities to the neighborhood. Trees or other desirable natural growth located in public or private rights-\nof-way or public or private easements shall not be removed unless the removal is necessary for the installation of utilities or drainage structures or for other\npurposes in the public interest. The removal may be prohibited if the amenity of adjacent property, or the amenity of the general neighborhood, is adversely\naffected.\n(10) Conditions in the Master Plan. In some cases, the ability to implement or strictly follow the approved Master Plan conditions can be problematic\n(i.e., conditions requiring specimen trees to be preserved, but the trees have subsequently died due to natural causes following the approval). In those\ncases, the Planning Director shall implement the condition in a way that most closely meets its original intent. These situations include, but are not limited to:\n(a) Undisturbed buffers/streetscapes required by the Master Plan which may be beyond the city's ability to implement due to road widening, utility\nrelocation, driveways and/or clear sight distance areas; and\n(b) Specimen or champion trees required by the Master Plan to be preserved, but which have been removed due to natural consequences or\ninfrastructure relocation. The Director may decide to permit re-vegetation when the conditions exist depending upon the extent of the disturbance, the size\nand quality of the existing vegetation remaining and the long term viability/benefit of retaining the existing vegetation.\n(D) Nontraditional residential lot development; use and development standards.\n(1) Permitted uses.\n(a) All low, medium and high density residential uses and their accessory uses as listed inTable 155-8, except those listed in division (D)(2) below.\n(b) Family care homes (as required by G.S. \u00a7 160D-907).\n(c) Temporary uses intended to serve principally the residents of the proposed development.\n(d) Convenience retail and personal services intended to serve principally the residents of the proposed development.\n(2) Uses not permitted.\n(a) Residential:\n1. Manufactured homes on individual lots, and manufactured home parks; and\n2. Other group residential uses besides family care homes.\n(b)\nAny retail or service use not intended for the convenient use of, or intended to principally serve, the residents of the proposed development;\n(c) All manufacturing, industrial, wholesale trade uses; and\n(d) All business repair and construction services, and all resource production and extraction uses, except pet grooming and veterinary clinics.\n(3) Development standards.\n(a) Except as provided in divisions (D)(3)(b) and (c) below, the development Master Plan shall comply with the development standards and other\nrequirements for development as provided in \u00a7 155.0703, except that variations from these standards may be permitted if submitted as part of the Master\nPlan that is suitable for the development and consistent with the intent and purpose of \u00a7 155.0703.\n(b) Recreation and open space requirements:\n1. Dedication of recreation land. Each nontraditional residential lot development (or residential portion of a mixed use development) shall dedicate\nrecreational open space consistent with the requirements in Chapter 157;\n2. Common open space.

Total Building Area divided by Total Lot Area. Example: A maximum FAR of 0.28 would yield a\nmaximum building area of 7,000 sq. ft. on a 25,000 sq. foot lot (25,000 X 0.28 = 7,000)\ndu/ac = Dwelling units per acre\nSources: AICUZ Program Procedures and Guidelines for the Department of the Navy Air Installations, OPNAV Instruction\n11010.36B, Department of the Navy, 2002\nStandard Land Use Coding Manual: A Standard System for Identifying and Coding Land Use Activities, Urban Renewal\nAdministration, Housing and Home Finance Agency and Federal Highway Administration, Bureau of Public Roads,\nDepartment of Commerce, 1965\nNotes to Table 154-4\n1. This table delineates allowable use within APZs by general land use classification. The land use classifications are based upon the Standard Land Use\nCoding Manual (SLUCM) classifications but have been modified to accommodate the specific zoning and land use regulatory needs of the city. Whenever\na\nland use is proposed, it will be assigned to the SLUCM classification that, in the opinion of the zoning administrator, most closely reflects the characteristics\nof the proposed use. The general use classification, as delineated in this table, shall be utilized to determine whether or not the proposed use is permissible\nwithin the APZ in which it is proposed to be located. For example, if a proposed use is assigned SLUCM classification number 5995, the use would fall under\nthe 5900 general classification and be permissible in accordance with the specified intensity standard. Whenever a proposed land use has characteristics of\ntwo or more individual land uses, that use shall be evaluated, on a case-by-case basis, to determine if one or more of the use characteristics creates an\noverwhelming incompatibility with the purposes and objectives of the APZ within which the use is proposed to be located. If, in the opinion of the zoning\nadministrator, one or more of the proposed use's characteristics creates such an incompatibility, the use shall not be permitted as proposed.\n2. Other use factors that will be considered in determining allowable nonresidential uses include labor intensity, structural coverage, explosive\ncharacteristics, air pollution, electronic interference with aircraft, height of structures and potential glare to pilots.\n3. Passenger terminals, major above ground transmission lines, broadcast studios and communication towers are not permitted in APZ-I.\n4. Low intensity office uses only. Accessory uses such as meeting places, auditoriums and the like are not permitted.\n5. Chapels are not allowed within APZ-I or APZ-II.\n6.\nFacilities shall be low intensity and include no tot lots and the like. Facilities such as club houses, meeting places, auditoriums, large classrooms and the\nlike are not permitted.\n7. Resource production and extraction uses that produce smoke, glare, electronic interference or which involve explosives are not permitted.\n8. Uses and activities that attract concentrations of birds that would create a hazard to aircraft operations are not permitted.\n9. Naturally occurring water features (e.g., rivers, lakes, streams, wetlands) are permitted.\n10. A combination single-family dwelling unit and nonresidential use (live/work use) may be permitted in APZ-II provided that: the density of the residential\nportion does not exceed the maximum density for single-family detached dwellings (SLUCM # 1100.1); and the nonresidential portion is an allowable use\nwithin the APZ-II and it does not exceed the specified maximum FAR for its assigned use classification.\n11. Mixed uses on a single lot or within a single structure are allowable, provided that each proposed individual use comprising the mixed use is allowable\nwithin the APZ in which proposed to be located; and that each proposed individual use comprising the mixed use complies with the specified maximum FAR\nfor its assigned use classification.\n12. Uses that produce or generate VOCs (Volatile Organic Chemicals) are not permitted.\n13. No structure shall exceed 10,000 square feet in size.\n14. Manufactured or mobile homes either within or outside of a mobile home park are exempt from the AICUZ Overlay District.\nTable 154-5 Permitted Uses and Required Noise Level Reduction by Noise Contour

Administration, Bureau of Public\nRoads, Department of Commerce, 1965\nNotes to Table 154-5\n1. This table delineates allowable use within noise contour zones by general land use classification. The land use classifications are based upon the\nStandard Land Use Coding Manual (SLUCM) classifications but have been modified to accommodate the specific zoning and land use regulatory needs of\nthe city. Whenever a land use is proposed, it will be assigned to the SLUCM classification that, in the opinion of the zoning administrator, most closely reflects\nthe characteristics of the proposed use. The general use classification, as delineated in this table, shall be utilized to determine whether or not the proposed\nuse is permitted within the noise contour zone in which it is proposed to be located. For example, if a proposed use is assigned SLUCM classification number\n5995, the use would fall under the 5900 general classification.\nColumns a, C, e and g indicate whether or not a particular use is allowed within the applicable noise contour zone (DNL 65, 60, 75 or 80).

SLUCM numbers are used to refer to land use classifications. Entries with \"0\" in the Reference SLUCM column\ndo not correspond to any classification in the SLUCM.\n(2) The SLUCM, as used for the Permitted Use Table, was last used in 1967 by the U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis to classify\nland uses, but is currently not in active use. Other variations of SLUCM are currently in active use by some federal agencies. An archive manual showing the\ncomplete SLUCM classification system was retrieved from the American Planning Association Research web site, under the name, \"RClassSysSLUCM\"\nWhen a use is not listed in the Permitted Use Table, the Zoning Administrator shall classify it with that use in the above named SLUCM most similar to it. This\nSLUCM shall serve as a guide in classifying any unlisted use. If the Zoning Administrator should determine that a use is not listed and is not similar to a use\nin the Permitted Use Table, then the use is prohibited.\n(3) Rental and leasing of any commodity shall be permitted under the same classification and in the same districts, as are sales of that commodity,\nunless rental or leasing of that commodity is listed separately in the Permitted Use Table.\n(C) Change in use.\n(1) A substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character or nature of the activity conducted on a lot changes. This occurs\nwhenever:\n(a) The change involves a change from one principal use category to another;\n(b) If the original use is a combination use, the relative proportion of space devoted to the individual principal uses that comprise the combination use\nchanges to such an extent that the parking requirements for the overall use are altered;\n(c)\nIf the original use is a combination use, the mixture of types of individual principal uses that comprise the combination use changes; or\n(d) If there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot (regardless of whether that business or enterprise consists of one individual\nprincipal use or a combination use), that business or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in (even though the new business or\nenterprise may be classified under the same principal use or combination use category as the previous type of business). For example, if there is only one\nbuilding on a lot and an office, that is the sole tenant of that building moves out and is replaced by a clothing store, that constitutes a change in use. However,\nif the office were replaced by another office, that would not constitute a change in use since the type of business or enterprise would not have changed.\nMoreover, if a floral shop moved out of a rented space in a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store, that would not constitute a change in use\nsince there is more than one business on the lot and the essential character of the activity conducted on that lot (shopping center-combination use) has not\nchanged.\n1.\nA mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice-versa does not constitute a change in use. Whether a change in use\noccurs shall be determined by comparing the two active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during which the property may have\nbeen unoccupied, unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than 180 consecutive days or has been abandoned.\n2. A mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in the name shall not be regarded as a change in use.\n(D) Combination uses. When a combination use comprises two or more principal uses that require different types of permits (zoning, special use and\nconditional zoning district), then the permit authorizing the combination use shall be:\n(1) A special use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a special use permit;\n(2) A conditional zoning district request if the development site requires a conditional zoning district for the proposed uses; or\n(3) A zoning permit in all other cases.\n(E) Mixed uses. A mixed use is one in which a residential use and a commercial use may exist in the same unit. This definition does not exempt permitted\nmixed uses from complying with the State Building Code.\n(F) Accessory uses.\n(1) Whenever an activity is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former use: constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of\nthe total activity that takes place on a lot; or is customarily associated with the principal use and integrally related to it, then the former use may be regarded\nas accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use.\n(2) For purposes of interpreting division (F)(1) above:\n(a) A use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial in and of itself or in relation to the principal use; and\n(b) To be \"customarily associated\" with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory use to be connected with the principal use more times than\nnot, but only that the association of the accessory use with the principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common acceptance of their\nrelatedness.\n(3) Table 155-8, Table of Permitted Uses, outlines the zoning districts in which specific accessory uses are allowed. See also 155.02 for dimensional\nstandards for accessory structures.\n(G) Temporary uses. Temporary uses are established for a limited duration not to exceed 180 days, with the intent to discontinue the use upon the\nexpiration of the time period. Table 155-8, Table of Permitted Uses outlines the zoning districts in which temporary uses are allowed. See also \u00a7 55.0704 for\nspecific standards and requirements for certain temporary uses.\n(H) Prohibited uses. Within certain overlay districts some uses are specifically prohibited. In addition to those uses listed inChapter 154, the following\nuses are prohibited or restricted in the districts as listed. Open storage in Business and Manufacturing Zoning Districts: in the N-B, H-C and O&I zoning\ndistricts, open storage is not permitted.

Manufactured homes shall not be used as an accessory building for storage\npurposes or any other use other than a single-family dwelling unit or temporary security residence pursuant to \u00a7 155.0713(H).\n(5) Parking of recreational vehicles in residential areas.\n(a) The parking of recreational vehicles (RVs) in the driveways of residential dwellings shall be considered an accessory use. RVs shall not be\noccupied as temporary or permanent dwellings.\n(b) RVs shall not be used for living, sleeping or housekeeping purposes when parked or stored on a residential lot, or on any lot not approved for the\nuse, except that the vehicle may be used to house out-of-town guests, on a non-fee basis, for a period not to exceed 14 continuous days.

The enactment of this ordinance shall not affect any action, suit or\nproceeding instituted or pending. All provisions of the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance of the City of Havelock enacted on May 4, 1987, as amended,\nwhich are not reenacted herein are repealed.\nThe date of the initial Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance for Craven County is May 4, 1987.\n(2) Effect upon outstanding floodplain development permits. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans, construction, size, or\ndesignated use of any development or any part thereof for which a floodplain development permit has been granted by the Floodplain Administrator or his\nor\nher authorized agents before the time of passage of this ordinance; provided, however, that when construction is not begun under such outstanding permit\nwithin a period of six months subsequent to the date of issuance of the outstanding permit, construction or use shall be in conformity with the provisions of\nthis ordinance.\n(Ord. 20-O-03, passed 6-1-2020; Ord. 21-O-04, passed 6-28-2021; Ord. 22-O-01, passed 1-24-2022; Ord. 23-O-07, passed 4-10-2023)\n\u00a7 156.03 SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.\n(A) Statement of purpose.\n(1) Regulating certain land-disturbing activities to control accelerated erosion and sedimentation in order that water pollution from sedimentation may be\ncontrolled, and that the accelerated erosion and sedimentation of lakes and natural watercourses and damage to public and private property by\nsedimentation be inhibited; and\n(2) Establishing procedures through which these purposes can be fulfilled.\n(B) Scope and exclusions of section. This section shall apply to land-disturbing activities undertaken by any person, with the following exclusions.\n(1) Those undertaken on agricultural land for the production of plants and animals useful to humans, including, but not limited to: forage and sod crops,\ngrain and feed crops, tobacco, cotton and peanuts; dairy animals and dairy products; poultry and poultry products; livestock, including beef cattle, sheep,\nswine, horses, ponies, mules or goats, including the breeding and grading of any or all those animals; bees and apiary products; and fur animals;\n(2) Those undertaken on forest land for the production and harvesting of timber and timber products;\n(3) Activities undertaken by persons as defined in G.S. \u00a7 113A-52(7) who are otherwise regulated by the provisions of the Mining Act of 1971, G.S. \u00a7\u00a7\n74-46 through 74-68; and\n(4) Those land-disturbing activities over which the state, by statute, has exclusive regulatory jurisdiction, which are activities:\n(a) Conducted by the state;\n(b) Conducted by the United States;\n(c) Conducted by persons having the power of eminent domain;\n(d) Conducted by local governments;\n(e) Licensed by the state or the United States; and\n(f) Funded in whole or in part by the state or the United States.\n(C) General requirements. Persons engaged in land-disturbing activities shall take all reasonable measures to protect all public and private property from\ndamage by those activities.\n(D) Basic control objectives. The basic control objectives which are to be considered in developing and implementing an erosion and sedimentation\ncontrol plan are to:\n(1) Identify critical areas. On-site areas which are subject to severe erosion, and off-site areas which are especially vulnerable to damage from erosion\nor sedimentation, are to be identified and receive special attention;\n(2) Limit time of exposure. All land-disturbing activities are to be planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time;\n(3) Limit exposed areas. All land-disturbing activities are to be planned and conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one time;\n(4) Control surface water. Surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas shall be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during the\nperiod of exposure;\n(5) Control sedimentation. All land-disturbing activities are to be planned and conducted so as to prevent off-site sedimentation damage; and\n(6) Manage stormwater runoff. When the increase in the velocity of storm water runoff resulting from a land-disturbing activity is sufficient to cause\naccelerated erosion of the receiving watercourse, plans are to include measures to control the velocity at the point of discharge so as to minimize\naccelerated erosion of the site and increased sedimentation of the stream.\n(E) Standards for land-disturbing activity.\n(1) Specifically. Land-disturbing activities subject to the control of this section shall be undertaken except in accordance with the following standards.\n(a) Buffer zone. Land-disturbing activity shall not be permitted in proximity to a lake or natural watercourse unless a buffer zone is provided along the\nmargin of the watercourse of sufficient width to confine visible siltation within the 25% of the buffer zone nearer the land-disturbing activity; provided, that this\ndivision (E) shall not apply to a land-disturbing activity in connection with the construction of facilities to be located on, over or under a lake or natural\nwatercourse.\n"}, {"page": "89", "text": "(b) Graded slopes and fills. The angle for graded slopes and fills shall be no greater than the angle which can be retained by vegetative cover or other\nadequate erosion control devices or structures. In any event, slopes left exposed will, within 30 working days of completion of any phase of grading, be\nplanted or otherwise provided with ground cover, devices or structures sufficient to restrain erosion.\n(c) Ground cover. Whenever land-disturbing activity is undertaken on a tract comprising more than one acre, if more than one contiguous acre\nis\nuncovered, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install the sedimentation and erosion-control devices and practices as are sufficient to\nretain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of the tract during construction upon and development of the tract, and\nshall plant or otherwise provide a permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion after completion of construction or development within 30 working\ndays or 120 calendar days following completion, whichever period is shorter.\n(d) Design and performance standard. Erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures and devices shall be so planned, designed and\nconstructed as to provide control from the calculated peak rates of runoff from a ten-year storm. Runoff rates shall be calculated using the procedures in the\nUSDA, Soil Conservation Services' National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices, or other acceptable calculation procedures.\n(F) Permanent downstream protection of stream banks and channels.\n(1) Generally. Provision shall be made for the permanent protection of off-site stream banks and channels from the erosive effects of increased velocity\nand volume of stormwater runoff resulting from certain land-disturbing activities.\n(2) Intent. Stream banks and channels downstream from any land-disturbing activity shall be protected from increased degradation by accelerated\nerosion caused by increased velocity of runoff from the land-disturbing activity. The provisions of this rule will be publicly and periodically reviewed by the\nBoard of Commissioners.\n(3) Performance standard.\n(a) The land-disturbing activity shall be planned and conducted so that the velocity of stormwater runoff in the receiving watercourse at the point of\ndischarge resulting from a ten-year storm after development shall not exceed the greater of:\n1. The velocity as determined from the table in division (F)(6) below; or\n2. The velocity in the receiving watercourse determined for the ten-year storm prior to development.\n(b) If divisions (F)(3)(a)1. or (3)(a)2. above cannot be met, the channel below the discharge point shall be designed and constructed to withstand the\nexpected velocity.\n(4) Acceptable management measures. Measures applied alone or in combination to satisfy the intent of this section are acceptable if there are no\nobjectionable secondary consequences. The Commission recognizes that the management of stormwater runoff to minimize or control downstream channel\nand bank erosion is a developing technology. Innovative techniques and ideas will be considered and may be used when shown to have the potential to\nproduce successful results. Some alternatives are to:\n(a) Avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including measures to promote infiltration to compensate for increased runoff from areas\nrendered impervious;\n(b) Avoid increases in stormwater discharge velocities by using vegetated or roughened swales and waterways in lieu of closed drains and high\nvelocity paved sections;\n(c) Provide energy dissipaters at outlets of storm drainage facilities to reduce flow velocities at the point of discharge. These may range from single rip-\nrapped sections to complex structures; and/or\n(d) Protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving cross-sections or providing erosion-resistant lining.\n(5) Exceptions. This rule shall not apply where it can be demonstrated that stormwater discharge velocities will not create an erosion problem in the\nreceiving watercourse.\n(6)\nMaximum permissible velocity. The following Table 156-1 provides the maximum permissible velocities for stormwater discharges:\nTable 156-1\nMaximum Permissible Velocities For:\nMaterial\nFeet per Second\nMiles per Second\nSource:\nAdapted from recommendations by Special Committee on Irrigation Research, American Society\nof Civil Engineers, 1926, for channels with straight alignment. For sinuous channels, multiply\nallowable velocity by 0.95 for slightly sinuous channels, by 0.9 for moderately sinuous channels,\nand by 0.8 for highly sinuous channels.\n(G) Borrow and waste areas.

These guidelines are intended to allow for creativity and diversity, and avoid monotony in design. Unless otherwise specifically provided,\nor\nunless clearly required by the context, the words and phrases used in this chapter shall have the meanings defined in Chapter 163.\n(A) Applicability.\n(1) The standards and guidelines contained in 157.01 shall apply to all new nonresidential structures and to expansions or alterations of any such\nexisting building where the expansion or alteration exceeds 50% of the building value as assessed for real property taxes.\n(2) All development subject to this chapter shall utilize a design that enhances existing city architectural styles, designs and forms and creates visual\ncharacter. Enhancement shall be achieved through techniques such as varied roof lines, the use of similar proportions in building mass and outdoor spaces,\nsimilar relationships to the street, relief of the visual effect of long extensive walls, and the use of building materials that have natural color, including primary\ncolors, shades and textures that adds architectural interest to the facade.\n(B) Building design standards. Design standards promote creativity and innovation while discouraging obtrusive, incongruous structures. The city\ndiscourages architectural style that does not enhance or add visual character to the city. The city supports the view that inspiring, well-maintained and\nharmonious development is in the best economic development interests of all residents and businesses.\n(1) Emphasize human scale. Building design shall emphasize a human scale at ground level, at entryways, and along street frontages through the\ncreative use of windows, doors, columns, canopies and lawnings.\n(2) Major building design features proportional. Major building design features, such as windows, doors, leaves and parapets, shall be designed to be in\nproportion to one another.\n(3) Structural lines retained at storefront level. The structural lines of a building and its materials shall be retained at the storefront level. For instance,\nbrick piers and columns shall be carried down to street level.\n(4) Awnings and canopies. Awnings and canopies shall complement the color and material of the building to which they are affixed.\n(5) Massing. A single, large, dominant building mass shall be avoided. Where large structures are required, mass should be broken up through the use\nof setbacks, projecting and recessed elements, and similar design techniques. Changes in mass shall be related to entrances, the integral structure, and/or\nthe organization of interior spaces and activities and not merely for cosmetic effect.\n(C) Avoiding monotony of design. Monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided by varying detail, form and siting to the\nmaximum extent practical, within the standards set forth in this chapter, to provide visual interest.\n(D) Harmony of design. The purpose of this section is to enhance the design character of existing development, to add visual character to the community,\nand to promote harmony in the visual relationships and transitions between new and older buildings or an upgrade from the surrounding area by\ncomplementing other buildings of good design. New buildings should respect the scale, and proportion of existing development.\n(1) Building color shades. Building color shades shall be used to facilitate blending into the neighborhood and unify the development. The color shades\nof building materials shall draw from the range of color shades that already exist on the block or in the adjacent neighborhood.\n(2) Building materials. Building materials shall either be similar to the materials already being used in the neighborhood or, if dissimilar materials are\nbeing proposed, other characteristics such as scale and proportions, form, architectural detailing, color and texture, shall be utilized to ensure that enough\nsimilarity exists for the building to be compatible, despite the differences in materials.\n(3) Similar size and height for infill development. New infill development shall either be similar in size and height or, if larger, be articulated and\nsubdivided into massing that is proportional to the mass and scale of other structures on the same block, or if buildings do not exist thereon, then on\nadjoining blocks.\n(4) Unify individual storefronts. If several storefronts are located in one building, the individual storefronts shall be unified in all exterior design elements,\nsuch as mass, window and door placement, color, materials and signage.\n(5) Additions and renovations. Building additions and facade renovations should be designed to reflect existing buildings in scale. A change in scale may\nrequire a transitional design element between the new development and existing buildings.\n(6) Varying architectural styles. In developments with multiple structures of varying architectural styles, buildings shall be compatible by such means as\na pattern of architectural features, similar scale and proportions, and consistent location of signage.\n(E) Architectural character. Architectural character focuses on the specific details that greatly affect the overall appearance of a particular development.\nThese architectural character standards in this section provide direction in aspects of color, facade materials, rooflines and the enhancement of entryways.\nThe primary goal is to define the \"finishing touches\" that provide the development with a sense of permanence, style and compatibility. The city discourages\nproposals that have not taken these matters into account. The city policy is that all development be treated as a lasting contributor to the community and as a\n\"good neighbor\" to its surroundings.\n(1) General form.\n(a)\nEach building shall have a primary facade that faces a public street, private street or which has the main public entrance.\n(b) The primary facade may have a clearly identifiable base, body and cap with defining elements, or may have other architectural features that\nexpress quality design characteristics by providing other coherent and complete styles of architecture (see Figure 157-1).\n(c) Any building facade that is not the primary facade, and that has frontage along a private drive, parking area or street, shall be considered a\nSECONDARY FACADE.\nCELL (1, 1): \n157.01 Building design and architectural character\nCELL (1, 2): \n157.01 Building design and architectural character\nCELL (2, 1): \n157.02 Compatibility standards\nCELL (2, 2): \n157.02 Compatibility standards\nCELL (3, 1): \n157.03 Landscaping and buffering\nCELL (3, 2): \n157.03 Landscaping and buffering\nCELL (4, 1): \n157.04 Tree preservation and replacement\nCELL (4, 2): \n157.04 Tree preservation and replacement\nCELL (5, 1): \n157.05 Screening\nCELL (5, 2): \n157.05 Screening\nCELL (6, 1): \n157.06 Sidewalks\nCELL (6, 2): \n157.06 Sidewalks\nCELL (7, 1): \n157.07 Parking, stacking and loading\nCELL (7, 2): \n157.07 Parking, stacking and loading\nCELL (8, 1): \n157.08 Outdoor lighting\nCELL (8, 2): \n157.08 Outdoor lighting\nCELL (9, 1): \n157.09\nCELL (9, 2): \nSigns\nCELL (10, 1): \n157.10 Recreation and open space requirements\nCELL (10, 2): \n157.10 Recreation and open space requirements\n"}, {"page": "92", "text": "(d) Secondary facades shall also have a clearly-identifiable design quality, using materials and architectural elements similar to the primary facade.\n(e) Any facade that does not face a street, private drive or parking area, but is adjacent to a primary or secondary facade, shall continue around the\ncorner any required architectural elements of the adjoining facade for a distance equaling at least 20% of the length of the facade.\n(2) Wall plane.\nFigure 157-1\nCap\nBody\nBase\n(a) Architectural elements can be used to define bays, add interest and variety; relieve the visual effect of long extensive walls; and split tall structures\ninto human scale.\n(b) All primary and secondary facades greater than 100 feet in length, measured horizontally, shall incorporate building wall offsets including recesses\nand projections along at least 20% of the length of the facade. Windows, lawnings and arcades shall total at least 60% of the facade length abutting a public\nstreet.\n(c) Facades greater than 100 feet in length, measured horizontally, shall incorporate a repeating pattern of change in color, texture and material\nmodules. All elements should repeat at intervals of no more than 30 feet, either horizontally or vertically.\n(d) Rooflines, windows, doors, stairwells, porches, pilasters and breaks in the facade may be used to establish bays.\n(e) Replacement of windows on the facade of an existing building shall be accomplished by using windows of the same trim, size and character as the\noriginal or by using a different style of window that complements the architectural style of the building.\n(f) Bays may project or recess four inches or greater.\n(g) Landscaping may be used to give the sense of break in long facades. Berms with shrubs and trees of sufficient size to break up facade planted\nnext to the building may be used. Landscaping should be shown on architectural rendering and meet the requirements of \u00a7 157.03. (Figure 157-2 depicts\nacceptable method for breaking long facade and 157-3 does not.)\nFigure 157-2\nFigure 157-3\nYES\n(h) Canopies and lawnings may be used and are encouraged.\n(i) Another way to break facade is through a change of materials or textures. See Figure 157-4.\nFigure 157-4\nLow\n(3) Entryways.\n(a) Entryway design elements and variations shall provide orientation and aesthetically pleasing character to the building.

A \"pre-design\" conference with the Zoning Administrator is strongly encouraged to understand the requirements of this\nsection.\n(4) Alternative methods of compliance.\n(a) Alternative landscaping plans, plant materials, planting methods and street yard and buffer yard widths may be used where unreasonable or\nimpractical situations would result from strict application of landscaping requirements or where necessary to protect existing vegetation. The situations may\nresult from streams, natural rock formations, topography, protected riparian buffer locations, other physical conditions; or from lot configuration, utility\neasements or unusual site conditions. Alternative landscaping plans may propose different plant materials, methods and locations if the quality, effectiveness,\ndurability and performance are equivalent to that required by this section. Sufficient evidence or proof may be required with alternative landscaping plans to\nsubstantiate any claim that may be made regarding the proposed plans, materials or methods. Alternative plans shall be considered for approval as part of\nthe normal site plan approval process as specified in \u00a7 153.10.\n(b) A combination of natural vegetation, fences, walls, stones and berms may be utilized to achieve the requirements of this section provided that the\nfollowing standards are met.\n1. Walls (a minimum of five feet in height), or an opaque fence (a minimum of five feet in height) may be used to reduce the width of a required\nbuffer yard.\n2.

Buffer types are defined in division (C)(5) below.\n(b) Any side or rear yard of any proposed principal use that abuts a residential use or residential district shall provide, in addition to the buffer\nrequirements of Table 157-1, a six-foot fence with 80% opacity.\n(5) Types and required criteria for buffers. The four types of natural and landscaped buffers that appear in Table 157-1 are described below along with\ncriteria for each. Figure 157-28 graphically displays what is intended for each buffer. Each of these buffer types may be achieved by meeting the\nrequirements listed below or by an approved alternative method that meets the performance requirements. The preservation and use of natural vegetation is\nthe preferred method of meeting the buffer and landscape requirements, as specified in divisions (C)(6)(d) and (7) below.\n(a) Type A. For every 50 linear feet, or fraction thereof, the five-foot wide buffer yard shall\ncontain: one canopy tree, two under story trees and three shrubs.\n(b) Type B. For every 50 linear feet, or fraction thereof, the ten-foot wide buffer yard shall contain: two canopy trees or four under story trees, and six\nshrubs.\n(c) Type C. For every 50 linear feet, or fraction thereof, the 15-foot wide buffer yard shall contain: two canopy trees or four under story trees, and six\nshrubs and a six-foot fence with 80% opacity.\n(d) Type D. For every 50 linear feet of frontage, or fraction thereof, the six-foot wide street yard shall contain: one under story tree with sidewalks or\nplanters built within or upon the sidewalk. Sidewalk requirements are detailed in \u00a7 157.06. Type D buffer yards are intended to be used as streetscapes in\nnew subdivisions and nontraditional residential developments in addition to required buffer yards as listed in Table 157-1.\nTable 157-1: Minimum Perimeter and Streetscape Buffer Yard Widths\nPerimeter/Streetscape Yard\nBuffer Type\nProposed Principal Use\nWidth\nCELL (1, 1): \nTable 157-1: Minimum Perimeter and Streetscape Buffer Yard Widths\nCELL (1, 2): \nTable 157-1: Minimum Perimeter and Streetscape Buffer Yard Widths\nCELL (1, 3): \nTable 157-1: Minimum Perimeter and Streetscape Buffer Yard Widths\nCELL (2, 1): \nBuffer Type\nCELL (2, 2): \nProposed Principal Use\nCELL (2, 3): \nPerimeter/Streetscape Yard\nWidth\nCELL (3, 1): \nType A\nCELL (3, 2): \nBusiness/Office Use/Parking Areas or\nCommercial Development 10,000 sq. ft. or\nless (Public or Private)\nCELL (3, 3): \n5 feet\nCELL (4, 1): \nType A\nCELL (4, 2): \nMulti-plex Attached and Townhouse\nDevelopment\nCELL (4, 3): \n5 feet\nCELL (5, 1): \nType A\nCELL (5, 2): \nUpper Story Residential Attached\nCELL (5, 3): \n5 feet\nCELL (6, 1): \nType B\nCELL (6, 2): \nMulti-Family Attached (Condominium or\nApartment) Development\nCELL (6, 3): \n10 feet\nCELL (7, 1): \nType B\nCELL (7, 2): \nNontraditional Residential Development\nCELL (7, 3): \n10 feet\nCELL (8, 1): \nType B\nCELL (8, 2): \nIntensive Commercial, Multi-Use Facilities,\nParking Areas, greater than 10,000 sq. ft.\n(Public or Private)\nCELL (8, 3): \n10 feet\nCELL (9, 1): \nType B\nCELL (9, 2): \nInstitutional (Government Buildings, Schools,\nChurches) and Group Residential\nCELL (9, 3): \n10 feet\nCELL (10, 1): \nType B\nCELL (10, 2): \nSide and Rear Perimeter Buffers for Low\nDensity, Zero Lot Line and Semi-Attached\n(Duplex) Residential Subdivisions\nCELL (10, 3): \n10 feet\nCELL (11, 1): \nType B\nCELL (11, 2): \nSide and Rear Perimeter Buffers for\nManufactured Home Parks and Planned\nManufactured Home Communities\nCELL (11, 3): \n10 feet\nCELL (12, 1): \nType C\nCELL (12, 2): \nIndustrial (Heavy and Light)\nCELL (12, 3): \n15 feet\nCELL (13, 1): \nType D\nCELL (13, 2): \nStreetscape for Low Density, Zero Lot Line\nand Semi-Attached (Duplex) and Residential\nSubdivisions\nCELL (13, 3): \n6 feet\n"}, {"page": "99", "text": "(6) General buffer standards.\n(a) Coverage.

Utilities are not permitted in buffers unless no reasonable alternative exists. If utilities are placed in a buffer, they shall be located and installed in a\nway that minimizes disturbance of the buffer area (for example, installed not parallel but perpendicular or not less than at a 75-degree angle).\n3. Streets may not be placed within a buffer except to cross the buffer where necessary to connect to adjoining properties.\n(6) Natural area buffer credits. The Zoning Administrator may grant credit for the preservation of existing natural vegetation (pursuant to $157.04) and\napply this credit toward meeting perimeter and streetscape buffer requirements, provided the caliper and quantity of the vegetation is equal to or exceeds the\nspecifications herein described. If an existing natural area is to be preserved and used as a required perimeter or streetscape buffer, but it does not meet the\nrequired buffer type as specified in Table 157-1, it must be enhanced to meet the specifications. The final buffer shall have the width, amount of vegetation,\nand other features to properly mitigate negative effects of contiguous land uses.\n(D) Landscaping for parking areas.\n(1) Minimum standards.\n(a) At least 8% of the gross paved area of a parking facility shall be landscaped and located in the interior. For purposes of this section, INTERIOR\nshall mean the area within the parking facility.\n(b) Plantings shall be distributed evenly throughout the parking facility.\n(c) All interior plantings shall be physically protected. Non-mountable concrete curbing shall be provided to prevent vehicles from encroaching onto\nand overhanging required plantings.\n(d) Consecutive parking spaces shall incorporate landscaped peninsulas no more than 15 spaces apart and at the ends of all parking rows.\n(2) Existing vegetation. Existing healthy, well-formed, canopy trees that are preserved on site according to $157.04 may be counted toward the\nrequirements of this section, provided that these trees are protected, in accordance with division (F) below and \u00a7 157.04, before and during development of\nthe site and maintained after development in a healthy growing condition.\n(E) Other landscaping requirements. The following requirements apply to all landscaping and buffers installed under $157.03.\n(1) Plant materials.\n(a) All tree and plant material selections shall be native or adaptable to the city region and its climate.\n(b) The city recognizes Crape Myrtle as a widely planted species. The practice of topping such species is discouraged. Topping of this species can\ncontribute to a decline in tree cover canopy and is in direct conflict with the goals of this section. Minimum pruning to develop the crape myrtle's natural tree\nform is encouraged.\n(c) A recommended plant materials list is provided in Appendix C.\n(2) Plant size. The following are the minimum required sizes at planting:\n(a) Shrubs: 12 inches in height;\n(b) Understory trees: six feet in height; and\n(c) Canopy trees: one inch in caliper, eight feet in height.\n(3) Berms. All berms used in a perimeter buffer, streetscape buffer or other landscape area shall meet all of the following design standards.\n(a) The slope of all berms shall not exceed a two-to-one ratio (horizontal to vertical), shall have a top width at least one-half the berm height, and\na\nmaximum height of four feet above the toe (top) of the berm. The Zoning Administrator shall approve all berms. Berms proposed to be greater than four feet\nin height may be permitted if deemed appropriate by the Zoning Administrator.\n(b) Proposed berms to be placed over an existing or proposed utility easement(s) shall be approved by the Zoning Administrator.\n(c) Berms shall be vegetated as required by this section. Berms must be stabilized with ground cover to prevent erosion and sedimentation. It is\nstrongly discouraged to use berms as a substitute for existing healthy vegetation. However, if berms are allowed to replace existing vegetation which already\nmeets the standards in this section then they must also meet the buffer standards and must be approved by the Zoning Administrator.\n(d) Berms shall in no case damage the roots of existing healthy vegetation designated to be preserved.\n(4) Installation standards.\n(a) All required landscaping shall be installed in a manner that ensures the availability of sufficient soil and water for healthy growth and that is not\nintrusive to aboveground and underground utilities.\n(b) In order to reduce the damage to root systems of existing vegetation within streetscapes, buffers or any other tree save areas, designation of\nplanned utility connection corridors is required to be shown on all development plans to coordinate the location of electrical, telephone, cable and other\nsimilar utilities.\n(c) Understory trees are required to be substituted for canopy trees whenever located within 25 feet of an overhead utility line.\n(d) Nothing shall be planted or installed within an underground or overhead utility easement or a drainage easement without the consent of the city\nand the easement holder at the time of site plan approval.\n(e) Tree planting in or about sidewalks and pavement areas with inappropriate tree species and inadequate soil volume may create damage to\nsidewalks and pavement and block light penetration to the pavement, preventing rapid evaporation of precipitation. To avoid potential damage to sidewalks\nand pavement and pooling of precipitation from such situations, a minimum soil volume of two cubic feet shall be reserved per one square foot of crown\n"}, {"page": "101", "text": "spread for every tree proposed for planting near sidewalks and pavement areas. The circumference of the tree planting area shall be protected with either\nmulch mounds or tree grates that will prevent root damage.

Any planting area bounded by an impervious surface should be at least ten feet wide. No canopy tree should be planted closer than\nfive feet to a sidewalk, paved areas or other impervious surfaces (other types of trees may be closer).\n(g) Culverts, rip rap structures, holding ponds and other stormwater-related devices must be landscaped to reduce their visual impacts. This landscape\nscreening must consist of evergreen plantings and be part of the approved landscape plan.\n(F) Tree protection during construction.\n(1) Minimum standards. The following minimum standards apply during construction, in addition to applicable standards from $157.04.\n(a) Responsibility. During development of the property, the owner shall be responsible for the erection of barriers necessary to protect any existing or\ninstalled vegetation located within the preservation or undisturbed buffer areas from damage both during and after construction.\n(b) Tree protection fencing. All existing vegetation that is to be preserved, including buffers, shall be fenced with a sturdy and visible fence before\ngrading begins. Fencing of these areas adjacent to existing and proposed roadways is also required. Fencing is required on all city and NCDOT road projects\nthat are adjacent to protected streetscapes or buffers. The fencing must be a minimum four feet high and of durable construction and must be placed outside\nof the drip line of the tree to be protected. Passive forms of tree protection, such as continuous rope or flagging, may be used to delineate tree save areas\nthat are remote from the area of land disturbance. Both applicant and the Zoning Administrator, in determining the exact location of any tree protection\nfencing, will consider the existing site conditions. The fence shall be maintained on the site until all site work is completed. It shall be removed before final site\ninspection for the certificate of occupancy.\n(c) Tree Protection Zone signs. Tree Protection Zone signs must be installed on the tree protection fence visible on all sides of the fenced in area\n(minimum one on each side and/or every 300 linear feet).\n(G) Time limit, installation guarantees, inspections and certificate of occupancy.\n(1) Time limit.\n(a) Installation guarantee. All landscaping, including mulching and seeding shall be completed in accordance with the approved development plan\nbefore a permanent certificate of occupancy for the site is issued unless the Zoning Administrator grants an exception pursuant to division (G)(1)(b) below. If\nan exception is granted, an installation guarantee shall be required, that includes:\n1. A cost estimate provided by a landscape contractor and/or engineer;\n2. Cash, surety/performance bond or letter of credit that ensures the required landscaping will be completed at a predetermined later date, normally\nthe next planting season but not to exceed one year from date of exception; and\n3. The amount of the bond/letter of credit shall be for the cost of the plant materials plus the cost of installation, plus 10%.\n(b) Extensions and exceptions. Extensions and exceptions to the above time limit may only be granted under one of the following conditions:\n1. Unusual environmental conditions, such as drought, ice, over-saturated soil or inappropriate planting season for the plant species (plantings\nbetween June through August are strongly discouraged);\n2. Substitution or unavailability of plant species or acceptable plant size as specified on the site plan; or\n3. Circumstances beyond the developer's or property owner's control, such as incomplete construction or utility work to occur in a proposed\nlandscaped area within 30 days after expected site completion.\n(2) Inspections. The Zoning Administrator shall inspect the site before the issuance of a permanent certificate of occupancy for the development, unless\nexempted under section (G)(1)(b), and shall not issue the permanent Certificate of Occupancy if the landscaping required under this section is not living or\nhealthy or is not installed in accordance with the standards set forth in this section and in accordance with the approved site plan.\n(H) Maintenance responsibility.\n(1) In order for any landscaping and screening to fulfill the purpose for which it was established, it must be properly maintained. The owner of the\nproperty and any tenant on the property where screening is required will be jointly responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping and screening materials\nrequired under this UDO. Maintenance includes actions necessary to keep screening materials healthy, neat and orderly in appearance and free of litter and\ndebris.\n(2) All screening and landscaping areas must be protected from damage by motor vehicles or pedestrians which could reduce the effectiveness of the\nscreening.\n(3) Any dead, unhealthy or missing vegetation, or vegetation disfigured by severe or excessive pruning, shall be replaced with locally adapted vegetation\nthat conforms to the standards of this UDO and the approved site and/or subdivision plan. In the case of removal of existing original vegetation from required\nvegetation protection areas, the replacement requirements of division (J) below shall apply.\n(4) In the event that any vegetation or physical element functioning to meet the standards of this UDO is severely damaged due to an unusual weather\noccurrence or natural catastrophe, or other natural occurrence such as damage by wild or domestic animals, the owner may be required to replant if the\nbuffer standards are not being met. The owner shall have one growing season to replace or replant after reconstruction is complete. The Zoning\nAdministrator shall consider the type and location of the landscape buffer or required vegetation area as well as the propensity for natural revegetation in\nmaking a determination on the extent of replanting requirements.\n(5) Any appeals of the Zoning Administrator's decision relating to the amount of required revegetation shall be made to the Board of Adjustment within\nten days following the notice of decision, and the Board of Adjustment shall consider reduction requests at the next available regular meeting.\n(6) All required buffers, streetscapes, vehicular use areas and other landscaped areas shall be free of refuse and debris, shall be treated for\npest/diseases in accordance with the approved site and/or subdivision plan, and shall be maintained so as to prevent mulch, straw, dirt, grass clippings or\nother materials from washing onto streets and sidewalks.\n(7) The owner should take actions to protect trees and landscaping from unnecessary damage during all facility and site maintenance operations. Plants\nmust be maintained in a way that does not obstruct sight distances at roadway and drive intersection, obstruct traffic signs or devices, and/or interfere with\nthe use of sidewalks or pedestrian trails. Viable plants shall not be removed, damaged, cut or severely pruned so that their natural form is impaired (shrubs\nwithin existing vehicle use areas and streetscapes may be pruned, but must maintain the minimum required height).\n(8) In the event that existing required vegetation located within any required buffers, streetscapes, vehicular use or other landscape areas poses an\nimmediate or imminent threat to improved structures on private or public property, severe pruning and/or removal of the vegetation is allowable provided prior\napproval from the Zoning Administrator is obtained, and the performance standard of the landscape area is maintained consistent with this UDO.\n(9) Unapproved removal of vegetation and/or severe or excessive pruning in non-emergency situations will result in a violation of this UDO.\n(10) The owner of the property on which a required fence or wall is located shall maintain the fence or wall in a safe and attractive condition. This shall\nmean the following:\n"}, {"page": "102", "text": "(a) No fence or wall shall have more than 10% of its surface area with disfigured, cracked, ripped or peeling paint or other material;\n(b) A fence or wall shall not stand with bent or broken supports, including loose or missing appendages; and\n(c) Fences and walls shall be plumb (vertical) to the ground.\n(I) Replacement of disturbed and damaged vegetation.\n(1) The disturbance or damage of vegetation within any required buffers, streetscapes, vehicular use areas or other landscape areas required by this\nchapter, or by zoning condition, shall constitute a violation of the UDO.\n(2) The natural death of existing vegetation within any required landscape area does not constitute a violation and would not require revegetation to\nreplace the plant material, unless the required landscape area no longer achieves the required performance standards of this chapter.\n(3) All disturbed or damaged landscaped areas and natural vegetation shall be replanted so as to meet the standards of this chapter, as well as the\napproved site and/or subdivision plat, if applicable. A replacement planting plan shall be submitted for review and approval by the Zoning Administrator prior\nto replacement. This plan will ensure proper replacements are made.\n(4) In situations where existing required vegetation on a developed site or vacant site with an approved site and/or subdivision plat has been removed or\ndamaged in violation of this chapter, the Zoning Administrator may require that the entire site be reviewed and revegetated consistent with the current\nprovisions of this chapter.\n(J) Compliance. The property owner shall be held responsible for compliance with the provisions of this section and shall cooperate with the city in its\nefforts to administer and enforce these requirements. Any act constituting a violation of this section that results in destruction, removal or damage of trees,\nshrubs and any other regulated vegetation without a permit, shall subject the property owner to enforcement proceedings as cited in Chapter 162.\n(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)\n\u00a7 157.04 TREE PRESERVATION AND REPLACEMENT.\n(A) Tree preservation.\n(1) Preservation and credit. Existing vegetation on all development sites should be preserved to the greatest extent possible and incorporated in the\nproject landscape plan in order to promote the preservation of existing natural areas. Credits for tree preservation toward buffer, parking and other\nlandscaping requirements are available when a tree preservation plan or site plan illustrating trees to be saved is submitted prior to grading the site.\n(2) Tree Protection Zones (TPZ). The preservation plan should specify the location of temporary tree protection fences to protect trees and their roots\nduring construction. Temporary protection fences (defined in \u00a7 157.03(F)) shall be erected and encroachment prohibited in the TPZ area using the following\nguidelines:\n(B) Standards for preservation or replacement. For the purpose of achieving the objectives outlined in $157.03(A) all new commercial or residential\ndevelopments shall provide for the preservation or replacement of regulated trees using the following minimum standards.\n(1) The total number of regulated trees to be retained should be at least 15 trees per acre (less impervious surface area (ex. parking, building)).\n(2) If there are less than 15 regulated trees per acre on the site, then the difference shall be replaced with new or existing smaller trees, to a total of 15\ntrees per acre equaling at least one caliper inch per tree planted or retained.\n(3) If there are no regulated trees on the site, then at least 15 new or existing trees per acre (less impervious surface area) equaling at least one caliper\ninch per tree shall be planted or retained.\n(4) In the event a developer clear-cuts a lot or tract and has failed to provide a site plan to the office of Planning and Inspections, the developer shall be\nrequired to plant 23 trees per acre (less impervious surface area), each with a minimum caliper of one inch.\n(5) Regulated trees that are retained may be used to fulfill some of the planting requirements of street yard, parking facilities or buffering, provided they\nare not damaged by construction activities or the intended use of the property.\n(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)\n\u00a7 157.05 SCREENING.\n(A) Mechanical and utility equipment in nonresidential developments.\n(1) All site plans shall show appropriate details to demonstrate compliance with this section.\n(2) Heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and other mechanical and utility equipment, which is located on, beside or adjacent to any building or\ndevelopment shall be fully screened from the view of streets and adjacent property.

The only exception is for manufactured home parks, which are subject to separate\nrequirements, pursuant to division (C)(3) below.\nTable 157-3: Parking Requirements by Parking Category\nParking\nMinimum Off-Street Parking Facility Requirements\nCategory\n(b) In the case of a building or use not expressly provided for onTable 157-5, the number of off-street spaces shall be the same as for a similar use or\ninclusive category which is provided for.\n(c) Where there is more than one use of a single structure or on a single tract, or two or more instances of the same use, the minimum number of\nrequired off-street parking spaces shall be equal to the sum of the requirements of the various areas.\n(d) In the case of those uses requiring a special use permit (SUP) or conditional zoning district (CD) as indicated in the Permitted Use TableT(able\n155-8), the number of off-street spaces required will be conditional with approval of the SUP or CD.\n(e) In the case of mixed occupancy, the minimum number of off-street parking, stacking and loading spaces shall be the cumulative total of individual\nuse requirements unless otherwise specified.\n(f) In no event shall a nonresidential use or the nonresidential component of a mixed use development provide more than 120% of the minimum\nparking spaces, except through the approval by the Zoning Administrator of a parking demand study, prepared by a qualified professional, which\ndemonstrates the need for parking spaces in excess of 120% of the minimum requirement.\n(g) Whenever the number of parking spaces required in this section results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of one-half or less may\nbe disregarded while a fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one parking space.\n(h) The Board of Commissioners recognizes that, due to the particularities of any given development, the inflexible application of the parking\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nTable 157-3: Parking Requirements by Parking Category\nCELL (2, 1): \nParking\nCategory\nCELL (2, 2): \nMinimum Off-Street Parking Facility Requirements\nCELL (3, 1): \nA\nCELL (3, 2): \nTwo parking spaces per dwelling unit\nCELL (4, 1): \nB\nCELL (4, 2): \nTwo parking spaces per dwelling unit plus one for each four dwelling units\nCELL (5, 1): \nC\nCELL (5, 2): \nOne parking space per room plus 10% of that number for employees\nCELL (6, 1): \nD\nCELL (6, 2): \nThree parking spaces in addition to residence requirements\nCELL (7, 1): \nE\nCELL (7, 2): \nOne parking space for each four seats in the principal place of assembly\nCELL (8, 1): \nF\nCELL (8, 2): \nParking space requirements are conditional with individual special use\npermits, conditional zoning districts and home occupation permits granted\nCELL (9, 1): \nG\nCELL (9, 2): \nOne parking space for each 200 square feet of gross floor area\nCELL (10, 1): \nH\nCELL (10, 2): \nOne parking space for each 600 square feet of gross floor area\nCELL (11, 1): \nI\nCELL (11, 2): \nOne parking space for each 1,000 square feet of gross floor area\nCELL (12, 1): \nJ\nCELL (12, 2): \nTwo parking spaces for the lot plus one parking space for each service bay\nCELL (13, 1): \nK\nCELL (13, 2): \nOne parking space for each 200 square feet of activity area\nCELL (14, 1): \nL\nCELL (14, 2): \nOne parking space for each 250 square feet of gross floor area\nCELL (15, 1): \nN/A\nCELL (15, 2): \nNot applicable - no specific amount of off-street parking is required\n"}, {"page": "105", "text": "standards set forth in this section may result in a development either with inadequate parking spaces or parking spaces far in excess of its needs. Therefore,\nthe permit-issuing authority may permit deviations from the requirements of this section and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever it finds\nthat the deviations are more likely to satisfy the general standards delineated in division (A) above.\n1. The permit-issuing authority may allow deviations, for example, when it finds that a residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the\nelderly, disabled or other population that demonstrates a lesser parking need or when it finds that a business or service is primarily oriented to walk-in trade.\n2. The permit-issuing authority may also, for example, require additional overflow or visitor parking in cases where the proposed lot sizes are such\nthat anticipated parking needs for occasional visitors cannot be accommodated on individual lots.

This does not include any supporting framework or bracing, even if between sections or modules, that is clearly incidental to the display itself. For\nexample, for a sign with two equal faces placed back to back on the same structure, so that only one side can be seen from any vantage point, sign area\nis\ncomputed using the surface area on one face only. Figures 155-36 through 155-41 graphically illustrates how to calculate the sign area for a variety of signs.\nSign area for a lot is computed by adding together the sign area of all signs on that lot.\nSign Area Calculation Examples\nFour equal size faces (box sign)\nTwo sides visible from any direction\nOne sign\nSign area = 2(x* * y)\n"}, {"page": "119", "text": "a\nNN\nSIGN\nNN\nd\nFigure 157-36\ny\ny\nSIGN\nx\nSIGN\nx\nFigure 157-37\nTwo equal size faces (back to back sign)\nOne sign\nSign area =x*y\nSIGN\nFigure 157-38\nIrregular sign face\nOne sign\nSign area = 2(a * b) + (c*d) *\nSIGN\n(919)555-1212\nFigure 157-39\nFigure 157-40\nTwo equal size faces (back to back sign) permanently mounted to fence\nOne sign\nSign area =x*y *\n"}, {"page": "120", "text": "SIGN-\na\nSIGN\nb\nSIGN\nc\nd\nSIGN\ng\nFigure 157-41\nMultiple, variable size faces\nOne sign\nSign area = (a b) + (c * d) + (g h)\n(G) Removal of nonconforming fixed subdivision and PUD signs.\n(1) Nonconforming fixed subdivision and PUD signs may be removed on approval of the Board of Commissioners after a written notice recommending\nthe removal is posted on the subject sign by the Department of Planning and Inspections for a period of seven consecutive days and a public hearing is held\nto consider the removal thereof.

The purposes and intent of the recreational and open space regulations prescribed in this section to be as follows:\n(1) To provide adequate active recreational areas and passive open space;\n(2) To encourage the preservation of existing trees and vegetation;\n(3) To encourage the retention of environmentally fragile areas;\n(4) To encourage the protection of air and water quality;\n(5) To enhance flood control; and\n(6) To provide higher quality development.\n(B) Minimum public recreational space requirements.\n(1) Generally. Every person, corporation, partnership, other entity or any combination thereof who or which subdivides land for residential purposes is\nrequired to dedicate a portion of the land as provided in division (B)(3)(a) below or, upon determination by the Board of Commissioners that the land is not\nsuitable for recreational purposes, to make a payment in lieu of dedication as provided in division (B)(3)(b) below, for the purpose of public recreation to\nserve the needs of the residents of the subdivision. At the request of the subdivider, the Board of Commissioners may accept a payment in lieu of dedication\nnotwithstanding that land within the property to be subdivided may be suitable for recreational purposes or may accept a partial dedication of land and a\npartial payment in lieu thereof when the Board of Commissioners determines that same is in the best interest of the citizens of the area to be served. All\npayments received by the city in lieu of dedication shall be expended for capital improvements of recreation facilities within the city or its extraterritorial\njurisdiction.\n(2) Specifically. The requirements of \u00a7 157.10(B) shall be applicable to each of the following types of residential development, or other residential uses\nnot listed:\n(a) Traditional detached single-family, modular home, duplex home, multiplex attached home, zero-lot line detached and planned manufactured\nhousing subdivisions;\n(b) Residential cluster developments;\n(c) Townhouse developments;\n(d) Condominium developments;\n(e) Individual residential components of a Traditional Neighborhood Development that include the subdivision of property for sale to individual owners;\n(f) Manufactured home parks;\n(g) Multi-family dwelling/apartment complex; and\n(h) Mixed use developments (i.e., that include upper story attached dwellings).\n(3) Dedication/payment.\n(a) Amount of land to be dedicated. The amount of land required to be dedicated by a subdivider shall be based upon the most recent U.S. Bureau of\nCensus population figures for an average size family in the city and a park and recreation standard factor of seven acres per 1,000 persons determined by\nthe following formula: Total number of dwelling units proposed x Average size of family X .007 acres per person x Amount of land to be dedicated. Examples:\n100 units x 3.2 persons/unit X .007 acres/person = 2.24 acres; 26 units x 3.2 persons/unit x .007 acres/person = 0.58 acres.\n(b) Amount of payment in lieu of dedication. The amount of money required to be paid in lieu of dedication by a subdivider shall be an amount based\nupon the most recent U.S. Bureau of Census population figures for an average size family in the city, a park and recreation standard factor of seven acres\nper 1,000 persons and the average per acre value for property tax purposes of the land to be subdivided determined by the following formula: Total number\nof dwelling units proposed x Average size of family x .007 acres per person x 100% of the average per acre value for property tax purposes of land to be\nsubdivided = Amount of payment in lieu of dedication. Examples: 100 units x 3.2 persons/unit .007 acres/person x ($2,563.81 average per acre value for\nproperty tax purposes) = $5,742.93; 26 units x 3.2 persons/unit x .007 acres/person x ($2,563.81 average per acre value for property tax purposes) =\n$1,493.16.\n(4) Suitability of land. Criteria for use in evaluating suitability of proposed recreation areas shall include, but not be limited to, the following, as\ndetermined by the City Board of Commissioners after recommendations of the Planning Board.\n(a) Unity. The dedicated recreation land shall, where possible, form a single parcel of land except where the City Board of Commissioners, upon\nrecommendation of the Planning Board, determines that two parcels or more would be in the public interest. Recreation areas shall fit into an interconnected\nsystem with pedestrian walkways, which could also serve as routes to schools, churches and other major pedestrian destinations.\n(b) Location and access. The dedicated recreation land shall be located so as to reasonably serve the recreational needs of the immediate\nneighborhood within the subdivision. The recreation and walkway system should be located in block interiors and oriented away from exposure to heavy\nautomotive traffic. Dedicated recreation land must have a minimum width of at least 60 feet of street frontage or a dedicated right-of-way of not less than 60\nfeet in width.\n(c) Usableness. The dedicated recreation land shall be usable for recreation. Lakes and swampy areas shall not be included in computing dedicated\nrecreation land area unless acceptable to the City Board of Commissioners upon recommendation of the Planning Board and recreation director. Lift stations\nor other utility facilities are prohibited on dedicated recreation land.\n(5) Administrative procedures.\n(a) Subdivider responsibility. At the time of filing a preliminary plat for approval, the owner of the property shall, as a part of the filing, indicate the area\nor areas to be dedicated for recreation purposes on the preliminary plat as submitted or his or her desires to give fees in lieu of dedication.\n"}, {"page": "122", "text": "(b) City responsibility. At the time the preliminary plat is submitted for approval, the Planning Board shall make its recommendations to the City Board\nas to accept a dedication or fee in lieu of dedication of land within the subdivision.\n(c) Prerequisites for approval of final plat. Where a dedication is required by the City Board of Commissioners, the dedication shall be shown upon the\nfinal plat submitted for approval. Where a dedication of land is proposed for a subdivision, the deed will be submitted with the final plat. If a fee in lieu of land\nis proposed the fee may be paid upon final subdivision approval by the City Board of Commissioners or the developer may choose to pay, by the lot, with the\nrequest for a building permit.\n(6) Intent of section. It is the intent of this section to permit an early determination regarding recreation areas, especially of small subdivisions which,\nbecause of their proximity to other recreation areas or other good reasons, may not need recreation areas for the orderly development of the proposed\nsubdivision.\n(C) Minimum private recreational space requirements.\n(1) The developer of manufactured home parks, semi-attached/duplex, multiplex and multi-family/apartment developments that include the construction\nof dwelling units not intended for sale to individual owners shall be required to reserve a portion of land for private recreational development to serve the\nneeds of the residents of the development. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that unsubdivided residential developments provide adequate active\nrecreational facilities to serve the residents of the development.\n(2) The following are illustrative of the types of facilities that shall be deemed to serve active recreational needs and therefore count toward compliance\nwith the private recreational space requirements of this section: tennis courts, racquetball courts, swimming pools, sauna and exercise rooms, meeting or\nactivity rooms with clubhouses, swings, slides and play apparatus. Each development shall install the types of recreational facilities and equipment that are\nmost likely to be suited to and used by the age bracket of persons likely to reside in the development. Facilities and equipment for active recreation shall be\nindicated on the site plan provided by the developer and shall be reviewed by the Director of the City Parks and Recreation Department. The Recreation\nDirector shall forward a recommendation as to the adequacy of the proposed recreational facilities and equipment to the Planning Board for review and\nrecommendation to the Board of Commissioners.\n(3) The developer of each semi-attached/duplex, multiplex, upper story attached, and multi-family residential development that includes dwelling units\nthat are not constructed for the purpose of sale to individual owners shall reserve a minimum of 750 square feet of active recreational space per\nmanufactured home space or dwelling unit.\n(4) The owner of the development shall be responsible for the continuing upkeep and proper maintenance of the private, active recreational space\nrequired by this section.\n(D) Private common open space requirements for residential developments.\n(1) Private, common open space shall be required for residential developments where higher residential densities and/or smaller lot sizes than base\nzoning for the zoning district in which located are allowed. This requirement shall be in addition to any public or private recreational space requirements\nrequired by divisions (B) and (C) above, and shall apply to each of the following types of residential development:\n(a) Multifamily/apartment, semi-attached/duplex, multiplex developments that include dwelling units that are not constructed for the purpose of sale to\nindividual owners;\n(b) Manufactured home park parks;\n(c) Condominium and townhouse developments;\n(d) Upper story attached dwellings;\n(e) Zero lot line developments;\n(f) Residential cluster developments; and\n(g) Traditional neighborhood developments.\n(2) Common open space may be passive or active and shall be owned and maintained by the property owner, a property owners association, or\napproved private, non-profit organization as authorized in division (E) below.\n(3) Multi-family/apartment complex. The developer of each multi-family/apartment complex development that includes dwelling units that are not\nconstructed for the purpose of sale to individual owners shall reserve 1,000 square feet of open space per dwelling unit.\n(4) Manufactured home park. The developer of each manufactured home park shall reserve 1,500 square feet of open space per dwelling unit.\n(5) Condominium, townhouse and upper story attached development. The developer of each condominium, townhouse or upper story attached\ndevelopment shall reserve 500 square feet of open space per dwelling unit.\n(6) Zero lot line development. The developer of each zero lot line development shall reserve 500 square feet of open space per dwelling unit.\n(7) Residential cluster development. The developer of each residential cluster development shall reserve open space as follows.\n(a) The minimum amount of open space shall equal the amount of lot area by which all dwelling unit lots are reduced below the base zoning for single-\nfamily detached residential units for the zoning district in which located.\n(b) For example, a proposed residential cluster development in the R-20 Zoning District allows minimum lot sizes of 12,000 square feet. The base\nminimum lot size for a single-family unit in R-20 is 20,000 square feet. Consequently, the 8,000 square feet of lot area resulting from the reduced lot size shall\nbe set aside for common open space. The application of this open space requirement for a ten-acre residential cluster development in an R-20 Zoning District\nis illustrated below:\nTable 157-7\nExample of Minimum Open Space Required for a Residential Cluster Development\nLocated in an R-20 Zoning District\nCELL (1, 1): \nTable 157-7\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \nExample of Minimum Open Space Required for a Residential Cluster Development\nLocated in an R-20 Zoning District\nCELL (2, 2): \nExample of Minimum Open Space Required for a Residential Cluster Development\nLocated in an R-20 Zoning District\nCELL (3, 1): \nDevelopment acres\nCELL (3, 2): \n10 acres\nCELL (4, 1): \nBase density for single-family residential units\nCELL (4, 2): \n2.2 du/ac\nCELL (5, 1): \nBase maximum # single-family residential units\nCELL (5, 2): \n22 max. du\nCELL (6, 1): \nBase minimum lot area per single-family residential unit\nCELL (6, 2): \n20,000 sq. feet\nCELL (7, 1): \nTotal base minimum single-family residential lot area\nCELL (7, 2): \n440,000 sq. feet\nCELL (8, 1): \nResidential cluster minimum lot area per unit\nCELL (8, 2): \n12,000 sq. feet\n"}, {"page": "123", "text": "(8) Upper story attached dwellings and mixed use. The developer of each upper story attached dwelling unit shall reserve a minimum of 500 square feet\nof open space per dwelling unit.\n(9) TND Developments. The developer of each residential component (i.e., multi-family, condominiums, zero lot line homes and the like) of a traditional\nneighborhood development shall reserve open space as required above for that specific type of residential development. The nonresidential components of\neach traditional neighborhood development shall reserve open space equal to a minimum of 15% of the gross land area of the nonresidential portion of the\ndevelopment (see also Chapter 155).\n(10) For purposes of this division (D), OPEN SPACE means an area that:\n(a) Is not encumbered with any structure unless the structure is intended for recreational purposes and is accessible to all residents of the\ndevelopment or general public;\n(b) Is not contained within a street right-of-way or otherwise devoted to use as a roadway or parking area not associated with the use of the open\nspace;\n(c) Is left in its natural or undisturbed state (as of the date development began), if wooded (except for the cutting of trails for walking or jogging) or, if\nnot wooded at the time of development, is landscaped for ball fields, picnic areas, play areas or similar recreational facilities, or is properly vegetated and\nlandscaped with the objective of creating a wooded area or other area that is consistent with the objective set forth in division (D)(10)(d) below;\n(d) Is capable of being used and enjoyed for purposes of informal and unstructured recreation and relaxation;\n(e) Is legally and practically accessible to the residents of the development out of which the required open space is taken, or to the public if dedication\nof the open space is proposed pursuant to division (E)(3); and\n(f) Is not encumbered by underground private septic lines, any part of a private sewage disposal system, or any above-ground or below-ground\nstructure.\n(11) All floodplains, wetlands, streams, riparian buffers, ponds, lakes and other water bodies shall be contained in common open space.\n(12) Open space shall be shown on the site plan with a notation to indicate that the open space shall not be used for future structures except as allowed\nper division (D)(10)(a) above.\n(13) The following shall not be counted towards open space areas:\n(a) Private yards and building setback areas;\n(b) Public or private streets or street rights-of-way;\n(c) Parking lot landscaping;\n(d) Parking areas and driveways; and\n(e) Land covered by structures except as allowed per division (10)(a) above.\n(14) Buffer areas required by \u00a7 157.03 may be counted towards private open space areas.\n(E) Ownership and maintenance of required private open space.\n(1) Common open space required by division (D) above shall not be dedicated to the public except upon the written acceptance of the city, pursuant\nto\ndivision (E)(3) below, but shall remain under the ownership and control of the developer (or successor in title) or a property owners' association or similar\norganization established pursuant to Chapter 158. As an alternative to a property owners' association, a private non-profit organization, such as a private land\ntrust, whose primary purpose is the preservation or conservation of open space may own and manage the proposed open space.\n(2) The person or entity identified in division (E)(1) above as having the right of ownership and control over the open space shall be responsible for the\ncontinuing upkeep and maintenance of the same.\n(3) The Board of Commissioners shall have the authority to accept or reject offers for land dedications made as a requirement of division (D) above.\nLand proposed by the developer as public open space on a site plan shall be considered to be offered for dedication until the offer is officially accepted by the\nBoard of Commissioners.\n(a) The offer may be accepted by the city through:\n1. Written acceptance by the Board of Commissioners; or\n2. Written acceptance by an administrative officer designated by the Board of Commissioners.\n(b) Until the dedication has been accepted, land so offered may be used for open space purposes by the property owner or by a property owners'\nassociation. Land so offered for dedication shall not be used for any purpose inconsistent with the proposed public use. The property owner shall be\nresponsible for the maintenance of all facilities and improvements until an offer of dedication is accepted by the city.\n(F) Flexibility in administration authorized.\n(1) The requirements set forth in divisions (B) through (D) above concerning the amount, size, location and nature of open space and recreational space\nto be provided in connection with residential developments are established by the Board of Commissioners as standards that presumptively will result in the\nprovision of that amount of open space and recreational space that is consistent with generally recognized standards relating to the need for those areas.\nThe Board of Commissioners recognizes, however, that due to the particular nature of a tract of land, or the particular type or configuration of development\nproposed, or other factors, the underlying objectives of the recreational and open space requirements may be achieved even though the standards are not\nadhered to with mathematical precision. Therefore, the permit-issuing board is authorized to permit minor deviations from these standards whenever it\ndetermines that: the objectives underlying these standards can be met without strict adherence to them; and because of peculiarities in the developer's tract\nof land or the particular type or configuration of the development proposed, it would be unreasonable to require strict adherence to these standards.\n(2) Whenever the permit-issuing board authorizes some deviation from the standards set forth in divisions (B) through (D) above, pursuant to division (F)\n(1) above, the official record of action taken on the development application shall contain a detailed statement of the reasons for allowing the deviation.\nCHAPTER 158: SUBDIVISION PROCEDURES AND DESIGN STANDARDS\nSection\nCELL (1, 1): \nTotal residential cluster minimum lot area\nCELL (1, 2): \n264,000 sq. feet\nCELL (2, 1): \nDifference in minimum lot areas\nCELL (2, 2): \n176,000 sq. feet\nCELL (3, 1): \nCommon open space acres to be dedicated\nCELL (3, 2): \n4.04 acres\n"}, {"page": "124", "text": "\u00a7 158.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.\nThe purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures and standards for the development and subdivision of real estate within the corporate limits and\nextraterritorial jurisdiction of the city in order to, among other things, insure proper legal description, identification, monumentation and recordation of real\nestate boundaries; further the orderly layout and appropriate use of the land; provide safe, convenient and economic circulation of vehicular traffic; facilitate\nadequate provision of water, sewerage, schools, parks, playgrounds and other public requirements; provide adequate building sites which are readily\naccessible to emergency vehicles; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; assure the proper installation of streets and utilities; promote the\neventual elimination of unsafe or unsanitary conditions because of undue concentration of population; and help conserve and protect the physical and\neconomic resources of the city and its environs.\n(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)\n\u00a7 158.02 REGULATION OF SUBDIVISIONS IN GENERAL.\n(A) Exclusions determination.

In the event these two\nengineers are unable to agree as to any matter concerning the proposed variation or modification, the disagreement shall be referred to a third engineer\nselected by the engineer for the city and the engineer for the subdivider. The engineer so selected shall settle the disagreement between the engineer for\nthe\ncity and the engineer for the subdivider. The engineers shall submit their findings to the Planning and Inspections Director who promptly shall submit the\nfindings to the Planning Board for consideration. All expenses incurred by the city in obtaining the opinion of the engineers shall be paid by the subdivider.\n(D) In the case of a plan or program for a nontraditional residential lot development which, in the judgment of the Planning Board, provides adequate light,\nair, and service needs of the tract when fully developed and populated, and which also provides the covenants or other legal provisions as will assure\nconformity to and achievement of the land development plan of the city and the UDO, the Planning Board may recommend and the Board of Commissioners\nmay authorize that certain standards and requirements of these regulations be modified.\n(E) Any modification thus authorized is required to be entered in writing in the minutes of the Planning Board and the reasoning on which the modification\nwas based set forth. It is intended here that these regulations be used in association with the nontraditional residential lot development provisions of the UDO.\nAny modifications in the standard design criteria of these regulations needed, in the opinion of the Planning Board, to fulfill the intent and purpose of the\nnontraditional residential lot development provisions of the zoning ordinance are permitted.\n(F) Where, because of topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site, strict adherence to the provisions of the regulations of this chapter would\ncause an unnecessary hardship, the Board of Adjustment may authorize a variance pursuant to \u00a7 159.02, if the variance can be made without destroying the\nintent of these regulations and if the other requirements of Chapter 159 are met.\n(Ord. passed 7-25-2011; Ord. 23-O-07, passed 4-10-2023)\nCHAPTER 159: APPEALS, VARIANCES AND INTERPRETATIONS\nSection\n\u00a7 159.01 APPEALS.\n(A) Generally.

The\nappeal system established in this chapter provides for a review of cases in which a decision or interpretation made by the Zoning Administrator or other\nadministrative official charged with enforcement of the UDO is alleged to be erroneous. For example, an appeal may contest the Zoning Administrator's\ndecision regarding whether a particular use is permitted within a particular zoning district or the Zoning Administrator's interpretation of the methodology for\ncomputation of sign area.\n(B) Applicability. The appeal system established herein applies only to decisions or interpretations made by the Zoning Administrator or other\nadministrative official charged with enforcement of the UDO. This appeal system does not apply to decisions or interpretations made by the Planning Board\nor the City Board of Commissioners. Additionally, the Board of Adjustment is not authorized to issue advisory decisions regarding appeals, except as\nprovided in \u00a7\u00a7 159.01.1 and 159.01.2. Only the formal decisions or interpretations of the Zoning Administrator or other administrative official charged with\nenforcement of the UDO may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment.\n(C) Filing.

Whenever an appeal is filed, the Zoning Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board of Adjustment all the papers,\napplications and recordings constituting the record relating to the action appealed from. A copy of the record shall also be provided to the appellant and to the\nowner of the property if the appellant is not the owner.\n(E) Stay of action. An appeal stays all actions by the Zoning Administrator seeking enforcement of or compliance with the order or decision appealed from,\nincluding fines, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board of Adjustment that (because of facts stated in the certificate) a stay would, in his or her\nopinion, cause imminent peril to life or property and/or seriously interfere with the enforcement of the UDO for the reason that the violation charged is\ntransitory in nature. In this case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order which may be granted by a court. If enforcement is not stayed,\nthe appellant may file with the Zoning Administrator a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board shall meet to hear the appeal within 15\ndays after the request is filed.\n(F) Decision. The Board of Adjustment may reverse or affirm (wholly or partly) or may modify the order, requirement or decision or determination appealed\nfrom and shall make any order, requirement, decision or determination that in its opinion ought to be made in the case before it.

The Board shall vary any provision of the zoning regulation upon a showing of all of the following:\n(a) If the applicant complies strictly with the provisions of the UDO, he or she will experience unnecessary hardship;\n(b) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal\ncircumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a\nvariance. A variance may be granted when necessary and appropriate to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a\nperson with a disability;\n(c) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that\ncircumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance is not a self-created hardship; and\n(d) The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the regulation, such that public safety is secured and substantial justice\nis achieved.\n(3) In granting variances, the Board of Adjustment may impose such reasonable conditions as will ensure that the use of the property to which the\nvariance applies will be as compatible as practicable with the surrounding properties. Appropriate conditions, which must be reasonably related to the\ncondition or circumstance that gives rise to the need for a variance, may be imposed on any approval issued by the Board of Adjustment.\n(4) A variance may be issued for an indefinite duration or for a specified duration only. Unless otherwise specified, any order or decision of the Board of\nAdjustment granting a variance shall expire if the applicant does not obtain a building permit or certificate of occupancy for such use within 60 calendar days\nfrom the date of the decision or if construction of the use has not commenced within 180 calendar days from the date of the issuance of a building permit.\n(5) The nature of the variance and any conditions attached to it shall be entered on the face of the zoning permit, or the zoning permit may simply note\nthe\nissuance of the variance and refer to the written record of the variance for further information. All such conditions are enforceable in the same manner as\nany other applicable requirement of the UDO.\n(6) No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance.\n(7) Evidentiary hearing procedures for variance requests are delineated in $159.06. Hearing notice requirements are outlined in $159.07.\n(B) Variances from Flood Hazard Overlay District requirements. The Board of Adjustment, hereinafter referred to as the \"appeal board\", is authorized to\nreview and decide upon request for variances from the Flood Hazard Overlay District Requirements delineated in \u00a7 156.02 pursuant to the provisions\ndelineated in this section.\n(1) Variances may be issued by the Board of Adjustment for:\n(a) The repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon the determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's\ncontinued designation as a historic structure and that the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure;\n(b) Functionally dependent facilities if determined to meet the definition as stated inChapter 163, provided the provisions ofChapter 156 have been\n"}, {"page": "140", "text": "satisfied, and such facilities are protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety; or\n(c) Any other type of development provided it meets the requirements stated in this section.\n(2) In passing upon variances, the Board of Adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other\nsections of the UDO, and:\n(a) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;\n(b) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;\n(c) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of the damage on the individual owner;\n(d) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;\n(e) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location as defined under Chapter 163 as a functionally dependent facility, where applicable;\n(f) The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;\n(g) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;\n(h) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;\n(i) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;\n(j) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,\nexpected at the site; and\n(k) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such\nas sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and bridges.\n(3) A written report addressing each of the above factors shall be submitted with the application for a variance.\n(4) Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of the UDO, the Board of Adjustment may attach conditions to the granting of\nvariances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of the UDO.\n(5) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the\nelevation to which the structure is to be built and that such construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property, and that the\nissuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25 per $100\nof\ninsurance coverage. The notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance.\n(6) The Zoning Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency\nand the state upon request.\n(7) Conditions for variances:\n(a) Variances shall not be issued when the variance will make the structure in violation of other federal, state or local laws, regulations or ordinances;\n(b) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway or non-encroachment area if the variance would result in any increase in flood levels\nduring the base flood discharge;\n(c) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief;\n(d) Variances shall only be issued prior to development permit approval; and\n(e) Variances shall only be issued upon:\n1. A showing of good and sufficient cause;\n2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and\n3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public\nexpense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.\n(8) A variance may be issued for solid waste disposal facilities, hazardous waste management facilities, salvage yards, and chemical storage facilities\nthat are located in special flood hazard areas provided that all of the following conditions are met. A floodplain development permit may be issued for the\ndevelopment only if a variance is granted.\n(a) The use serves a critical need in the community.\n(b) No feasible location exists for the use outside the special flood hazard area.\n(c) The reference level of any structure is elevated or floodproofed to at least the regulatory flood protection level.\n(d) The use complies with all other applicable federal, state and local laws.\n(e) The city has notified the Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Public Safety of its intention to grant a variance at least 30 days prior to\ngranting the variance.\n(C) Variances from \"The Neuse River Basin Stormwater Ordinance for New Development.\"\n(1) The Board of Adjustment, hereinafter referred to as the \"Board\", is authorized to review and decide upon requests for major and minor variances for\nthe stormwater ordinance in Chapter 53 pursuant to the provisions set forth in this section.\n(2) Any person may petition the City for a variance granting permission to use the person's land in a manner otherwise prohibited by the stormwater\nordinance in Chapter 53.\n(3) For all proposed variances from the stormwater ordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall make findings of fact in accordance with the procedures set\nforth in Chapter 159 and \u00a7 153.03 showing that:\n(a) There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships that prevent compliance with the strict letter of the ordinance;\n(b) The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the stormwater ordinance and preserves its spirit; and\n(c) In granting the variance, the project will ensure equal or better protection of waters of the State than the requirements of 15A NCAC 02B.0711\n(Neuse Storm Water Rule) and that the public safety and welfare have been assured and substantial justice has been done.\n(4) In the case of a request for a minor variance, as defined inChapter 53, the Board may vary or modify any of the regulations or provisions of the\nchapter so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done may impose reasonable and\nappropriate conditions and safeguards upon any variance it grants.\n"}, {"page": "141", "text": "(5) The Board may attach conditions to the variance approval that support the purpose of the stormwater ordinance.\n(6) If the variance request qualifies as a major variance, as defined inChapter 53, and the Board decides in favor of granting the major variance, the\nBoard shall then prepare a preliminary record of the hearing and submit it to the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission for review and\napproval. If the Commission approves the major variance or approves with conditions or stipulations added, then the Commission shall prepare a\nCommission decision which authorizes Board to issue a final decision which would include any conditions or stipulations added by the Commission.

In deciding whether to adopt a proposed amendment to the UDO, the central issue before the Board of\nCommissioners is whether the proposed amendment advances the public health, safety or welfare. All other issues are irrelevant, and all information related\nto other issues at the public hearing may be declared irrelevant by the Mayor and excluded. When considering proposed map amendments:\n(1) Except for Conditional Zoning District requests submitted in accordance with $160.12, the Board of Commissioners shall not consider any\nrepresentations made by the petitioner that, if the change is granted, the property will be used for only one of the possible range of uses permitted in the\nrequested classification. Rather, the Board of Commissioners shall consider whether the entire range of permitted uses in the requested classification is more\nappropriate than the range of uses in the existing classification.\n(2) The Board of Commissioners shall not regard as controlling any advantages or disadvantages to the individual requesting the change, but shall\nconsider the impact of the proposed change on the public at large.\n(B) Approval criteria for text amendments. In reviewing applications to amend the text of the UDO, the Board of Commissioners should consider the\nfollowing criteria:\n(1) Whether the proposed amendment corrects an ambiguity or error or meets the challenge of some changing condition, trend or fact;\n(2) Whether the proposed amendment is consistent with the city's CAMA Comprehensive Land Use Plan and the stated purposes of the UDO;\n(3) Whether the proposed amendment will protect the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public; and\n(4) Whether the proposed amendment will result in significant adverse impacts on the natural environment, including air, water, noise, stormwater\nmanagement, wildlife and vegetation.\n(C) Approval criteria for map amendments. In reviewing proposed rezonings, the Board of Commissioners should consider the following criteria:\n(1) Whether the proposed rezoning corrects an error or meets the challenge of some changing condition, trend or fact;\n(2) Whether the proposed rezoning is consistent with the city's CAMA Comprehensive Land Use Plan and the purposes set forth in the UDO;\n(3) Whether the city and other service providers will be able to provide sufficient public safety, educational, recreational, transportation and utility\nfacilities and services to the subject property, while maintaining sufficient levels of service to existing development;\n(4) Whether the proposed rezoning is unlikely to have significant adverse impacts on the natural environment, including air, water, noise, stormwater\nmanagement, wildlife and vegetation;\n(5) Whether the proposed rezoning will not have significant adverse impacts on other property in the vicinity of the subject tract; and\n(6) Whether the proposed zoning classification is suitable for the subject property.\n(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)\n\u00a7 160.07 CITIZEN COMMENTS.\nIf any resident or property owner in the City's jurisdiction submits a written statement regarding a proposed amendment, modification, or repeal to a zoning\nregulation, including a text or map amendment that has been properly initiated to the City Clerk at least two (2) business days prior to the date of the\nlegislative hearing, the City Clerk shall deliver such written statement to the Board of Commissioners.\n(Ord. 21-O-04, passed 6-28-2021)\n\u00a7 160.08 WITHDRAWAL OF AMENDMENT PETITION.\nThe petitioner shall have the right to withdraw, in writing, an amendment petition at any time prior to a final decision by the Board of Commissioners.\nHowever, petitions that have been withdrawn shall be reconsidered only as a new petition and shall adhere to the submission and review requirements of \u00a7\u00a7\n160.01 through 160.05.\n(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)\n\u00a7 160.09 PETITION RESUBMITTAL.\n(A) In the event a proposed change in the zoning classification of a tract or parcel of land shall be denied by the Board of Commissioners or has been\nwithdrawn by the applicant after notice has been given of the public hearing on the application, a request for the same or substantially the same zoning\nclassification change may not be resubmitted for the same property or a portion of the property, either to the Board of Commissioners or to the Planning\nBoard, until the expiration of 180 days following the date of the Board of Commissioners action denying the proposed change or applicant's withdrawal of\npetition.\n(B) The only exception to the waiting period defined in division (A) above is a resubmitted petition that sufficiently amends the proposal to address the\ncomments and concerns expressed by the BOC in denying the initial submittal.\n(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)\n\u00a7 160.10 NOTIFICATION OF DECISION.\n(A) Within five working days of any action by the Board of Commissioners on an amendment petition, notice of that action shall be sent by first-class mail\nto the petitioner and any other persons who have indicated to the Zoning Administrator, in writing, that they would like the decision mailed to them.\n(B) Additionally, within 15 days after the effective date of a zoning change to commercial or industrial zones within 660 feet of the right-of-way of an\ninterstate or primary highway, written notice by registered mail shall be sent to the Raleigh offices of the State Department of Transportation in accordance\nwith G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 136-136 and 136-153.\n(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)\n\u00a7 160.11 CITY-INITIATED COMPREHENSIVE REZONINGS.\n(A) City-initiated comprehensive rezonings shall follow the procedures and notification requirements in $$160.02 through 160.10.\n(B) Repair of zoning map errors. In situations where errors are found to exist on the official zoning map, the repair of these errors is not considered to be a\nrezoning as described in \u00a7 160.01.

In these circumstances, a general zoning district designation allowing a use by right would not be appropriate for a particular property even\nthough the use itself could, if properly planned, be appropriate for the property consistent with the objectives of the UDO and adopted land development plan,\ncomprehensive plan, transportation and corridor plans, small area plans and other land use and transportation policy documents.\n(2) The rezoning process established in this section provides for the accommodation of the uses by a reclassification of property into a conditional\nzoning district, subject to additional conditions which ensure compatibility of the proposed use with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties. A\nconditional zoning district bears the same designation as a general use zoning district but is a conditional zoning district subject to additional conditions\nin\nwhich limited uses are permitted and that are contained in the ordinance approving the conditional zoning district. A conditional zoning district allows a\nparticular use or uses to be established only in accordance with specified standards and conditions tailored to each individual development project. The\ndistricts also can be used to implement environmental mitigation measures to avoid or minimize the impacts of the project, as determined through the\nanalysis required in \u00a7 160.02(A). This is a voluntary rezoning procedure that is intended for firm development proposals. It is not intended or suited for\nsecuring early zoning for tentative proposals that may not be undertaken for some time.\n(3) Conditional zoning districts parallel general use zoning districts. Only those land uses (including uses by right, special uses and those uses identified\nas CD in Table 155-8 Table of Permitted Uses) permitted in a general use zoning district to which a conditional zoning district corresponds shall be allowed.\nAll requirements of any corresponding general use district and all other requirements of the UDO apply to a conditional zoning district except to the extent\nthat the approved rules, regulations and conditions included in the petition for rezoning are more restrictive than the general use district requirements.\n(B) Process required.\n(1) A person petitioning for rezoning of a tract of land may elect to request a conditional zoning district for that tract. The conditional zoning district\napplication must specify the actual use or uses, and all other development regulations authorized by state law, which are intended for the property specified\nin the petition. The intended use or uses and development regulations must be permitted in the corresponding general use district.\n(2) The Board of Commissioners is to approve or disapprove the application on the basis of the specific use or uses and development regulations\nrequested. Development in a conditional zoning district requires approval of a single application similar to a general use district rezoning application.\n(3) Property may be placed in a conditional zoning district only in response to a petition signed by the owners of all the property to be included or by an\nagent authorized by all of the owners to file the application. A petition for conditional zoning shall include:\n(a) A master site plan prepared in accordance withAppendix A;\n(b) Written supporting documentation that specifies the actual use or uses proposed for the property;\n(c) Proposed rules, regulations, and conditions that, in addition to all predetermined requirements of this UDO, will govern the development and use\nof\nthe property; and\n(d) A statement analyzing the reasonableness of the proposed rezoning.\n(4) During its initial review of a conditional zoning petition, the Planning Board shall consider whether or not a community informational meeting, to be\norganized and conducted by the petitioner, would be beneficial to making project information available to those most likely to be impacted by the proposed\nzoning change. If the Planning Board concludes that a community informational meeting should be held, the petitioner shall conduct such meeting in\naccordance with the following provisions.\n(a) The community informational meeting shall be held prior to the date of the next Planning Board meeting at which the petition will be reviewed.\n(b) Written notice of such a meeting shall be given to the property owners and organizations entitled to notice as determined by policies established by\nthe city.\n(c) The petitioner shall file a written report of the community informational meeting with the Zoning Administrator. The petitioner's report shall include,\namong other things, a listing of those persons and organizations contacted about the meeting and the manner and date of contact; the date; time and\nlocation of the meeting; a roster of the names, mailing addresses, and telephone numbers of the persons in attendance at the meeting; a summary of issues\ndiscussed at the meeting; and a description of any changes to the rezoning petition made by the petitioner as a result of the meeting.\n(d) The purpose of the community informational meeting is to:\n1. Provide specific information regarding the proposed development including but not limited to a description of the proposed use(s) of the property,\nthe proposed density and intensity of land uses, the location and arrangement of the proposed land use(s) on the property, the proposed development\nschedule, and proposed regulations or conditions, in addition to those required by this Ordinance, that will govern the development and use of the property;\nand\n2. To receive comments and input from citizens likely to be impacted by the proposed zoning change and subsequent development of the property.\n(e) In the event the petitioner has not held at least one meeting pursuant to this section, the petitioner shall file a report with the Zoning Administrator\ndocumenting efforts that were made to arrange such a meeting and stating the reasons such a meeting was not held.\n(f) The adequacy of a meeting held or report filed pursuant to this section shall be considered by the Board of Commissioners but shall not be subject\nto judicial review.\n(5) Review and approval process. The review and approval process for conditional zoning district petitions involves a legislative hearing and legislative\ndecision by the Board of Commissioners. The review of conditional zoning district petitions shall be undertaken in accordance with the provisions of\n160.02 through 160.10, as modified by this section.\n(a) In the course of evaluating the proposed use, the Board of Commissioners may request additional information deemed appropriate to provide a\ncomplete analysis of the proposal.\n(b) Conditional zoning district decisions are subject to judicial review using the same procedures and standard of review applicable to general use\ndistrict zoning decisions.\n(c) Conditional zoning district decisions shall be made in consideration of identified relevant adopted land use plans for the area, including, but not\nlimited to, land development plans, comprehensive plans, strategic plans, district plans, small area plans, transportation and corridor plans and other land\ndevelopment policy documents.\n(d) If the conditional zoning district application is approved, the Board of Commissioners shall authorize the requested use with reasonable conditions\nas mutually agreed to in writing by the applicant and Board of Commissioners and determined to be desirable in promoting public health, safety and general\nwelfare.\n(6) Conditions to approval. Specific conditions applicable to the conditional zoning districts may be proposed by the petitioner or the city or its agencies,\nbut only those conditions mutually agreed to in writing by the city and the petitioner may be incorporated into the zoning regulations or permit requirements.\n(a) The conditional district rezoning application shall specify the use or uses that are intended for the property, as well as any additional conditions on\nthe use of the property that the applicant may propose be conditions of the rezoning. Conditions and site-specific standards imposed in a conditional zoning\ndistrict shall be limited to:\n"}, {"page": "148", "text": "1.\nThose that address conformance of the development and use of the site to ordinances and officially adopted plans and\n2. Those that address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site.\n(b) Any such conditions should relate to the relationship of the proposed use to surrounding property, proposed support facilities such as parking areas\nand driveways, pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems, screening and buffer areas, the timing of development, street and right-of-way improvements,\nwater and sewer improvements, stormwater drainage, the provision of open space, the mitigation of environmental impacts, and other matters that the Board\nof Commissioners may find appropriate or the petitioner may propose.\n(c) Such conditions to approval of the petition may include dedication to the city or state, as appropriate, of any rights-of-way or easements for streets,\nwater, sewer or other public utilities necessary to serve the proposed development.\n(d) No condition shall be less restrictive than the standards of the general use district or the standards of any overlay district that applies to the\nproperty.\n(e) No condition shall be made part of the application, or shall be attached to approval of the conditional zoning district, which specifies the ownership\nstatus, race, religion or character of the occupants of housing units, the minimum value of improvements, or any illegal exclusionary device; or which states\nthat the use of the property will not be subject to regulations or restrictions set forth in the UDO which would apply to the property in any event, such as the\nregulations for an overlay district which covers the property.\n(f) If for any reason any condition for approval is found to be illegal or invalid or if the petitioner should fail to carry out any condition in the written and\nsigned agreement, the approval of the site plan for the district shall be null and void and of no effect and proceedings shall be instituted by the city to rezone\nthe property to its previous zoning classification or to another zoning district.\n(g) The conditions shall be agreed upon, put in writing, and signed by both the petitioner and City upon final approval of the rezoning by the Board of\nCommissioners.\n(h) After the city has delivered to the newspaper the notice of public hearing for the application, the applicant shall make no changes in the conditions\nthat are less restrictive than those stated in the application, including, but not limited to, smaller setbacks; more dwelling or rooming units; greater height;\nmore access points; new uses; and fewer improvements. However, more restrictive conditions or additional conditions may be added to the application if the\nconditions are received by the Planning and Inspections Department in writing and signed by all owners of the property at least ten working days before the\ndate scheduled for final Board of Commissioners action on the application.\n(7) Effect of approval. If a petition for conditional zoning is approved, the development and use of the property shall be governed by the predetermined\nordinance requirements applicable to the district's classification, the approved site plan or master plan for the district, and any additional approved rules,\nregulations and conditions, all of which shall constitute the zoning regulations for the approved district and are binding on the property as an amendment to\nthis Ordinance and to the zoning map.\n(a) If a petition is approved, only those uses and structures indicated in the approved petition and site plan shall be allowed on the subject property. A\nchange of location of the structures may be authorized pursuant to division (B)(8) below provided that the change in building layout does not result in an\nincrease in the number of structures.\n(b) Following the approval of the petition for a conditional zoning district, the subject property shall be identified on the zoning map by the appropriate\ndistrict designation. A conditional zoning district shall be identified by the same designation as the underlying general district followed by the letters \"CD\" (for\nexample, \"R-20 (CD)\").\n(c) No permit shall be issued for any development activity within a conditional zoning district except in accordance with the approved petition and site\nplan for the district.\n(d) Any violation of the approved site plan or any rules, regulations and conditions for the district shall be treated the same as any other violation of the\nUDO and shall be subject to the same remedies and penalties as any such violation.\n(8) Alterations to approval. Except as provided in division (B)(8)(a) below, changes to an approved petition or to the conditions attached to the approved\npetition shall be considered a change to the conditional zoning district and shall be processed as a new conditional zoning application in accordance with the\nprocedures set forth in this section.\n(a) The Zoning Administrator shall have the delegated authority to approve administrative minor modifications to an approved site plan. The Zoning\nAdministrator shall have no authority to amend the conditions of approval of a petition. Any decision by the Zoning Administrator must be in writing stating the\ngrounds for approval or denial. Minor modifications shall be limited to changes that the Zoning Administrator determines would not:\n1. Change the gross square footage of nonresidential development by more than 5%;\n2. Change the lot coverage by more than 5%;\n3. Change any use or density;\n4. Adjust the landscaping requirements by more than 10%; or\n5. Adjust the required parking more than 5%.\n(b) The Zoning Administrator, however, shall always have the discretion to decline to exercise the delegated authority either because he or she is\nuncertain about approval of the change pursuant to the standard or because a rezoning petition for a legislative hearing and Board of Commissioners\nconsideration is deemed appropriate under the circumstances. If the Zoning Administrator declines to exercise this authority, the applicant may file a rezoning\npetition for a legislative hearing and Board of Commissioners decision in accordance with the provisions delineated in \u00a7\u00a7 160.02 through 160.10.\n(c) Any request for an administrative modification shall be pursuant to a written letter, signed by the owners of all of the property affected by the\nproposed change, detailing the requested change. Upon request, the applicant shall provide any additional information as deemed necessary by the Zoning\nAdministrator. Upon an approval of an administrative modification, the applicant shall file a sufficient number of copies of the revised site plan as deemed\nnecessary by the Zoning Administrator.\n(d) If the Zoning Administrator denies approval of the requested administrative modification, the applicant may file a rezoning petition for a legislative\nhearing and Board of Commissioners decision in accordance with the provisions delineated in \u00a7\u00a7 160.02 through 160.10.\n(9) Review of approved Conditional Zoning Districts. It is intended that property shall be reclassified to a conditional zoning district only in the event of\nfirm plans to develop the property. Therefore, no sooner than two years after the date of approval of the petition, the Planning Board may examine the\nprogress made toward developing the property in accordance with the approved petition and any conditions attached to the approval.\n(a) If the Planning Board determines that substantial progress has not been made in accordance with the approved petition and conditions, the\nPlanning Board shall forward to the Board of Commissioners a report which may recommend that the property be rezoned to its previous zoning classification\nor to another zoning district. If the Board of Commissioners concurs with the Planning Board's recommendation, the Board of Commissioners may initiate the\nrezoning of the property in accordance with the procedures delineated in \u00a7\u00a7 160.02 through 160.10.\n(b) If the Planning Board determines that substantial progress has been made to develop the property, the Planning Board may recommend that an\nextension of time be granted. The Board of Commissioners, after reviewing the recommendation of the Planning Board, may approve an extension of time\nnot to exceed an additional 12 months. Approval of such a time extension by the Board of Commissioners may be made without conducting a formal public\nhearing.\n"}, {"page": "149", "text": "(c) If, after the expiration of the extended time period, the Planning Board determines that no substantial progress has been made and the Board of\nCommissioners concurs with that determination, the Board of Commissioners shall proceed to: conduct a legislative hearing on the matter to evaluate\nwhether or not another extension of time is warranted; or initiate the rezoning of the property to its previous zoning classification or to another zoning\nclassification using the procedures delineated in \u00a7\u00a7 160.02 through 160.10.\n(d) For purposes of this section, examples of substantial progress may include: the approval of construction plans for streets, utilities and other\ninfrastructure; the initiation of land preparation activities such as clearing and grading; the initiation of the construction of the principal building(s); and the\ninitiation of the construction of streets, utilities, other infrastructure or required site amenities.\n(Ord. passed 7-25-2011; Ord. 21-O-04, passed 6-28-2021)\n\u00a7 160.13 INONTRADITIONAL RESIDENTIAL LOT DEVELOPMENT.\n(A) Purpose.\n(1) Nontraditional residential lot developments as listed in 155.02(D), are intended to permit and encourage, on application and approval of detailed\ndevelopment plans, establishment of new developments for specified purposes where tracts of land suitable in location, area and character are to be planned\nand developed as a whole and in a unified manner.\n(2) The nontraditional residential lot development process established in this section provides for the accommodation of the uses by a reclassification\nof\na property into a conditional zoning district, subject to regulations and conditions specified in the developer's master plan.

Among other possibilities, a nonconforming situation\nmay arise because a lot does not meet minimum acreage requirements, because structures exceed maximum height limitations, because the relationship\nbetween existing buildings and the land (in such matter as density and setback requirement) is not in conformity with the UDO, because signs do not meet\nthe requirements of the UDO, or because land or buildings are used for purposes made unlawful by the UDO.\n(B) Unless otherwise specifically provided for inChapter 154 for specific districts, as well as other chapters of the city code of ordinances, and subject to\nthe restrictions and qualifications set forth in the remaining sections of this chapter, nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date\nof the UDO may be continued.\n(C) Whenever the UDO refers to the effective date of the UDO, the reference shall be deemed to include the effective date of any amendments to the\nUDO if the amendment, rather than the UDO as originally adopted, creates a nonconforming situation.\n(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)\n\u00a7 161.02 NONCONFORMING LOTS.\n(A) Single lot of record with lot area and/or lot width nonconformity.\n(1) When an undeveloped lot has an area or width which does not conform to the dimensional requirements of the district where located, but the lot was\napproved and of record at the time of adoption of the UDO or any subsequent amendment which renders the lot nonconforming, then the lot may be used for\na use permitted in the district where located, provided that the setback dimensions and other requirements, except area or width, are complied with.\n(2) In residential zones, only a single-family detached dwelling shall be permitted on the nonconforming lot.\n(3) Nothing contained herein exempts a lot from meeting the applicable provisions of the City Public Services Department or the County Environmental\nHealth Department regulations.\n(B) Lots with contiguous frontage in one ownership.\n(1) When two or more adjoining and vacant lots of record with contiguous frontage are in one ownership at the time of the adoption of the UDO or\nsubsequent to adoption and the lots individually have a lot area or lot width which does not conform to the dimensional requirements of the district where\nlocated, the lots shall be combined to create one or more lots that meet the standards of the district where located.\n(2) Nothing contained herein exempts the contiguous lots considered as a single buildable lot or lots from meeting the applicable provisions of the City\nPublic Services Department or the County Environmental Health Department regulations.\n(C) Reduction of a lot of record. A lot of record reduced to less than the required area, width or setback dimensions as the result of a condemnation or\npurchase by a local or state government agency shall become a nonconforming lot of record.\n(D) Lot of record with setback nonconformity. When the use proposed for an undeveloped nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other respects\nexcept that the applicable setback requirements cannot reasonably be complied with, then the entity authorized by the UDO to issue a permit for the\nproposed use (the Zoning Administrator, Board of Commissioners or Board of Adjustment) may allow deviations from the applicable setback requirements if it\nfinds that:\n(1) The property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without the deviations;\n(2) The deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot; and\n(3) The property can be developed as proposed without any significantly adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety.\n(Ord. passed 7-25-2011)\n\u00a7 161.03 NONCONFORMING USE OF LAND.\n(A) Continuance of nonconforming use of land.
