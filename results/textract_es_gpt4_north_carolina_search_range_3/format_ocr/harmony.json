The\nConditional Zoning District classification will be considered for rezoning only upon request of a\nproperty owner or authorized agent.\nTherefore, the following Conditional Zoning Districts (CD) which correspond to each of the\ndistricts authorized by this ordinance are established: RA-CD, RU-R-CD, R-20-CD, R-O-CD, O-\nI-CD, N-B-CD, H-B-CD, M-1-CD.\nSection 4.9.2 Uses\nWithin a CD, only those uses authorized as permitted uses in the zoning district with which the\nCD corresponds shall be permitted, and all other requirements of the corresponding district shall\nbe met as minimum standards.\nSection 4.10 Permitted Uses\nSection 4.10.1 General\nThe Table of Permitted Uses and Special Uses which follows contains a listing of uses which may\nbe permitted in one or more of the various Zoning Districts established by this Ordinance.

These\nrequirements are contained in Chapter 5, \"Special Requirements to the Table of Permitted and\nSpecial Uses.\" For any use subject to a Special Requirement, the Special Requirement shall\nrepresent the minimum conditions for issuance of a Conditional Rezoning or a Special Use Permit.\nIn determining proposed uses, the Zoning Administrator shall refer to the latest edition of the North\nAmerican Industry Classification System (NAICS). When a proposed use is NOT specifically\nlisted in the Table of Permitted Uses, the Zoning Administrator shall use NAICS to determine if\nthe use is the same as, or manifestly similar to, a listed use in form and function. If the Zoning\nAdministrator finds that the proposed use in the same as, or manifestly similar to, a listed use, he\nshall classify the proposed use as the listed use. If the Zoning Administrator finds that proposed\nuse is NOT the same as, or is NOT manifestly similar to, a listed use, then the Zoning\nAdministrator shall classify the proposed use as NOT

Iredell County should facilitate alternative modes of transportation for citizens who cannot\ndrive and for citizens interested in biking and walking for health, environmental, or recreational\npurposes. Iredell County and the municipalities within have created greenway, bike and\npedestrian, and transit plans detailing the best routes to traverse the county; the routes should\nbe preserved for these purposes.\nB. Relationship with Other Plans\n1.

By restricting the number of points of ingress and egress onto the\nthoroughfare, access management regulations decrease points of conflict and congestion by\neliminating excessive stops and starts. The marginal access and interconnectivity provisions in\nthis article also decrease congestion on the thoroughfare by providing alternative routes.\nA.

Marginal Access\nWhere a tract of land to be subdivided adjoins a qualifying road, the developer may be required\nto provide a marginal access street parallel to the road.\na. Where a marginal access street is established, private driveways with access to the marginal\nstreet shall be prevented from having direct access to the thoroughfare.\nb.

Applicability\n1. A TIA is required for any proposed development that meets any of the following\nrequirement thresholds:\na. Residential subdivisions proposing one hundred (100) or more lots/units.\nb. New developments or expansions (residential or non-residential) proposed to generate\nan average daily traffic count of 1,000 plus vehicles per day or 100 plus trips during\npeak traffic hour.

A TIA shall NOT be required if the property to be developed has been the subject of a TIA\nwithin the previous three (3) years and the projected trip generation of the newly proposed\ndevelopment is equal to or less than the previous TIA performed and the trip distribution\nhas NOT significantly changed.\n3. For sites of special concern, such as those found in blind curves, roads over design capacity,\nwhere driveways will be in close proximity to an existing signal, etc., the Administrator or\nNCDOT may require a technical memo or signal warrant analysis, prepared by a licensed\nengineer or transportation planner.\nC. TIA Preparation\n1. When required, a TIA must be submitted:\na. Prior to obtaining a development permit\nb.\nPrior to preliminary subdivision plat approval for major subdivisions, whichever\napplicable.\n2.

TIA Guidelines\n1. Any TIA, whether required or voluntarily, must be prepared by a licensed engineer.\n2. The TIA should consider the future impact of other proposed land uses in the study area\nNOT yet developed, but which may have a statutory or common law vested right as defined\nin NCGS 160D-108.\n3. The TIA should consider the future impact of nearby proposed/planned NCDOT roadway\nimprovement projects as identified on the County or any Municipal Comprehensive\nTransportation Plan (CTP) and the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).\n4.\nThe TIA should consider the future impact of any officially-adopted transportation plan\n(including but NOT limited to county or municipal transit plans and pedestrian plans) in\nthe study area.\nE.
