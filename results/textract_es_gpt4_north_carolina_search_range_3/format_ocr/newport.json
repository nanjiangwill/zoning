Remand the application back to the Planning Board for further consideration.\n(5) Statement of plan consistency and additional reasonableness statement (G.S. \u00a7 160D-605). When adopting or\nrejecting any Zoning Map amendment, the Town Council shall approve a brief statement describing whether its action is\nconsistent or inconsistent with the Core CAMA Land Use Plan. The requirement for a plan consistency statement may also\nbe met by a clear indication in the minutes of the Town Council that at the time of action on the amendment the Town\nCouncil was aware of and considered the Planning Board's recommendations and any relevant portions of the Core CAMA\nLand Use Plan. If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a \"large-scale rezoning\" under G.S. \u00a7 160D-602(b), the Town\nCouncil's statement describing plan consistency may address the overall rezoning and describe how the analysis and\npolicies in the relevant adopted plans were considered in the action taken.

The relationship between the current actual and permissible development on the tract and adjoining areas and the\ndevelopment that would be permissible under the proposed amendment;\niv.

If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a \"large-scale\nrezoning\" under G.S. \u00a7 160D-602(b), the governing board statement on reasonableness may address the overall rezoning.\nvi. The statement of reasonableness and the plan consistency statement may be approved as a single statement.\nf. Zoning Map amendment standards. Amending the Official Zoning Map is a matter committed to the legislative\ndiscretion of the Town Council.

Any legal nonconforming use of a building, structure, mobile home or premises may be continued; provided, however,\nthat if the use is discontinued for a period of 180 calendar days, said use shall be considered abandoned and said building,\nstructure or premises shall thereafter be used only for uses permitted within the district in which the use is located.

When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations (other than area, depth or width\nrequirements) applicable to the district in which the lot is located, such use may be made as of right. Otherwise, the\nnonconforming lot may be used only in accordance with a special use permit issued by the Board of Adjustment.

In issuing the permit authorized by this paragraph, the\nBoard may allow deviations from applicable dimensional requirements (such as setback lines and yard minimums) if it finds\nthat no reasonable use of the property can be made without such deviations.\nb. Whenever this ordinance creates a nonconforming lot and the owner of the nonconforming lot also owns land adjacent\nto it, and a portion of this other land can be combined with the nonconforming lot to create a conforming lot (without thereby\ncreating other nonconformities), the owner of the nonconforming lot, or his or her successors in interest, may not take\nadvantage of the provisions of paragraph a. of this section.\n"}, {"page": "42", "text": "(Ord.

Except as specifically provided in this subsection, it shall be unlawful for any person to engage in any activity that\ncauses an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation.\nb. Subject to paragraph d. of this subsection, a nonconforming use may not be extended throughout any portion of a\ncompleted building that, when the use was made nonconforming by this ordinance, was manifestly designed or arranged to\naccommodate such use. However, subject to \u00a7 5-9 (authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain\ncircumstances), a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building.\nC. Subject to \u00a7 5-9 (authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances), a nonconforming use\nof open land may not be extended to cover more land that was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming, except\nthat a use that involves the removal of natural materials from the lot (e.g., a quarry) may be expanded to the boundaries of\nthe lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming, if 10% or more of the earth products had\nalready been removed at the effective date of this ordinance.\nd. The volume, intensity or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation exists and may be increased\nand equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar\nchanges amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other paragraphs\nof this subsection occur.\ne. Physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if it results in:\n1. An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use;\n2. Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as yard requirements, height limitations or\ndensity requirements; or\n3. The enclosure of previously unenclosed areas, even though those areas were previously used in connection with the\nnonconforming activity. An area is unenclosed unless at least 75% of the perimeter of the area is marked by a permanently\nconstructed wall or fence.\nf. For the purpose of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this subsection,\nall of the buildings, activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally considered as a whole. For example, failure to\nrent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building or one space in a nonconforming mobile home park for 180 days\nshall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building or mobile\nhome park as a whole is continuously maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming\nuse, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter. And so,\nif a mobile home is used as a nonconforming use on a residential lot where a conforming residential structure also is located,\nremoval of the mobile home for 180 days terminates the right to replace it.\n(Ord.

All work on any nonconforming project shall cease on the effective date of this ordinance, and all permits previously\nissued for work on nonconforming projects shall be revoked as of that date. Thereafter, work on nonconforming projects may\nbegin, or may be continued, only pursuant to a special use permit issued by the Board of Adjustment (except as provided\nin\nparagraph b. of this section). The Board shall issue such a permit if it finds that the applicant has in good faith made\nsubstantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changed his or her position in such\nsubstantial way in reasonable reliance on the land use law as it existed before the effective date of this ordinance and\nthereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete his or her project as proposed. In considering whether\nthese findings may be made, the Board shall be guided by the following.\n1. All expenditures made pursuant to a validly issued and unrevoked building or zoning permit shall be considered as\nevidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this ordinance became effective.\n2. Except as provided in subparagraph 1. of this paragraph, no expenditures made between 180 days and the effective\ndate of this ordinance shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this\nordinance became effective. An expenditure is made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure.\n3. To the extent that expenditures are reasonable with a reasonable effort, a party shall not be considered prejudiced\nby having made those expenditures. For example, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made expenditure to\nacquire a potential development site if the property obtained is just as valuable under the new classification as it was under\nthe old, for the expenditure can be recovered by resale of the property.\n4. An expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant both in dollar amount and in terms of: (i) the total\nestimate cost of the proposed project; and (ii) the ordinary business practices of the developer.\n5. A person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use\nlaw affecting the proposed development site could not be attributed to him or her.\n6.

Nothing in this section shall interfere with the provisions in \u00a71-11 (Vested Right) of this ordinance. The requirements\nof paragraph a. of this section shall not apply to a nonconforming project if the Zoning Administrator certifies that actual\nconstruction of the project began at least 180 days before the effective date of this ordinance and that the work is at least\n75% complete at the effective date of this ordinance, notwithstanding the two-year vested rights, \u00a7 1-11 of this ordinance.\nb. The Board of Adjustment shall not consider any application for the special use permit authorized by paragraph a. of\nthis section that is submitted more than 60 days after the effective date of this ordinance, unless it waives this requirement\nfor good cause shown.\nC. If the Board of Adjustment issues a special use permit pursuant to paragraph a. of this section, it may attach such\nreasonable conditions to the permit as it finds necessary to reduce the extent to which the nonconforming project is\nincompatible with the surrounding neighborhood. In particular, the Board may require that work on the nonconforming\nproject be continuously maintained, if possible, and that the project be completed as expeditiously as possible.\nd. The Zoning Administrator shall send copies of this subsection to owners (and developers, if different from the owners)\nof all properties in regard to which permits have been issued for nonconforming projects or in regard to which a\nnonconforming project is otherwise known to be under construction. This notice shall be personally delivered or sent by\nregistered or certified mail not less than 15 days before the effective date of this ordinance.\ne. The Board of Adjustment shall establish expedited procedures for hearing applications for special use permits under\nthis subsection. These applications shall be heard, whenever possible, before the effective date of this ordinance, so that\nconstruction work is not needlessly interrupted.\nf. When it appears from the developer's plans, or otherwise, that the nonconforming project was intended to be or\nreasonably could be completed in phases, segments or other discrete units, the Board of Adjustment shall determine and\nnot allow the nonconforming project to be constructed or completed in a fashion that is larger or more extensive than is\nnecessary to allow the developer to recoup and obtain a reasonable rate of return on the expenditures he or she has made\nin connection with that nonconforming project.\n(Ord.

For a 33 lot, 12-acre subdivision.\n33 X 2.43 X 0.008 X 1.2 = 0.76 acres (33,105 sq. ft.)\nNDU = Number of dwelling units.\nAFS = Average family size (latest census).\nVDF = Variable density factor.\n1. The average acre per dwelling unit is computed by dividing the combined total acreage of all dwelling units or lots by\nthe number of dwelling units or lots. For computation purposes, land dedicated or reserved for purposes such as streets,\nalleys and purposes other than residential shall not be used in determining average acreage. In no case shall a developer be\nrequired to dedicate more than 30% of the acreage of a development.\nExample 1. For a 33 lot 12 acre subdivision.\n12 acres 33 = 0.36 acre average. Reference to the chart shows a 1.2 VDF\n2. Variable density factor is designed to provide an adjustment to subdivision plats which contain average lot sizes of\none-half acres and above. This adjustment is used since subdivisions with larger lots contain more open space and thus\nfewer lots and greater park acreage. Conversely, those subdivision plats that create lots or units which average less than\ntwo-fifths acres are adjusted due to the density of development and the inherent increased demand for more public\nrecreation and park land. The adjustments for large lots or for small lots are based on a sliding scale reflecting degree of\ndensity.\n(Ord. 2021-02, passed 6-14-2021)\n\u00a7 16-4.5.5 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING SUITABILITY.\nCriteria for evaluating suitability of proposed recreation, parks and open space areas shall include, but not be limited to,\nthe following as determined by the Council.\na.
