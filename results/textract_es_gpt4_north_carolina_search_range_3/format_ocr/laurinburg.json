If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a \"large scale rezoning\"\nunder Section 4.2.2, the City Council statement describing plan consistency may address the\noverall rezoning and describe how the analysis and policies in the relevant adopted plans were\nconsidered in the action taken.\n4.5.2. Additional Reasonableness Statement for Rezonings.\nWhen adopting or rejecting any petition for a zoning map amendment, a statement analyzing\nthe reasonableness of the proposed rezoning shall be approved by the City Council. This\nstatement of reasonableness may consider, among other factors, (i) the size, physical condition,\nand other attributes of the area proposed to be rezoned, (ii) the benefits and detriments to the\nlandowners, the neighbors, and the surrounding community, (iii) the relationship between the\ncurrent actual and permissible development on the tract and adjoining areas and the\ndevelopment that would be permissible under the proposed amendment, (iv) why the action\ntaken is in the public interest; and (v) any changed conditions warranting the amendment. If a\nzoning map amendment qualifies as a \"large-scale rezoning\" under Section 4.2.2, the City\nCouncil statement on reasonableness may address the overall rezoning.\n4.5.3. Single Statement Permissible.\nThe statement of reasonableness and the plan consistency statement required by this section\nmay be approved as a single statement.\nPART II. VESTED RIGHTS AND PERMIT CHOICE (Amended 5/18/2021)\nSECTION 4.6 FINDINGS\nCity approval of development typically follows significant investment in site evaluation, planning,\ndevelopment costs, consultant fees, and related expenses. Therefore, it is necessary and\ndesirable to provide for the establishment of certain vested rights in order to ensure reasonable\ncertainty, stability, and fairness in the development regulation process, secure reasonable\nexpectations of landowners, and foster cooperation between the public and private sectors in\nland-use planning and development regulation.\nSECTION 4.7 PERMIT CHOICE\nIf an application made in accordance with local regulation is submitted for a development\napproval required pursuant to this Ordinance and a development regulation changes between\nthe time the application was submitted and a decision is made, the applicant may choose which\n5/18/2021\nPage 4-4\nArticle 4\n"}, {"page": "40", "text": "ARTICLE 4. LEGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES\nversion of the development regulation will apply to the application. If the development permit\napplicant chooses the version of the rule or ordinance applicable at the time of the permit\napplication, the development permit applicant shall not be required to await the outcome of the\namendment to the rule, map, or ordinance prior to acting on the development permit. This\nsection applies to all development approvals issued by the State and by local governments. The\nduration of vested rights created by development approvals are as set forth in Section 4.9.\nSECTION 4.8 PROCESS TO CLAIM VESTED RIGHT\nA person claiming a statutory or common law vested right may submit information to\nsubstantiate that claim to the UDO Administrator, who shall make an initial determination as to\nthe existence of the vested right. The UDO Administrator's determination may be appealed\nunder G.S. 160D-405. On appeal the existence of a vested right shall be reviewed de novo. In\nlieu of seeking such a determination, a person claiming a vested right may bring an original civil\naction as provided in G.S. 160D-405(c).\nSECTION 4.9 TYPES AND DURATION OF STATUTORY VESTED RIGHT\nExcept as provided by this section and subject to Section 4.7, amendments to this Ordinance\nshall not be applicable or enforceable with regard to development that has been permitted or\napproved pursuant to this Ordinance so long as one of the approvals listed in this subsection\nremains valid and unexpired. Each type of vested right listed below is defined by and is subject\nto the limitations provided in this section and the cited statutes. Vested rights established under\nthis section are not mutually exclusive. The establishment of vested right under one subsection\ndoes not preclude vesting under one or more other subsections or by common law principles.\n4.9.1. Six Months - Building Permits.\nPursuant to NCGS 160D-1110, a building permit expires six (6) months after issuance unless\nwork under the permit has commenced. Building permits also expire if work is discontinued for\na period of twelve (12) months after work has commenced.\n4.9.2. One Year - Other Local Development Approvals.\nPursuant to NCGS 160D-403(c), unless otherwise specified by this section, statute, or local\nordinance, all other local development approvals expire one year after issuance unless work has\nsubstantially commenced. Expiration of a local development approval does not affect the\nduration of a vested right established as a site-specific vesting plan, a multiphase development\nplan, a development agreement, or vested rights established under common law.\n4.9.3. Two to Five Years - Site Specific Vesting Plans.\n4.9.3.1. Duration. A vested right for a site-specific vesting plan shall remain vested\nfor a period of two years. This vesting shall not be extended by any amendments or\nmodifications to a site-specific vesting plan unless expressly provided by the City.

EGISLATIVE/QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES\nCity may provide that rights regarding a site-specific vesting plan shall be vested for a\nperiod exceeding two years, but not exceeding five years if warranted by the size and\nphasing of development, the level of investment, the need for the development,\neconomic cycles, and market conditions or other considerations. This determination shall\nbe made in the discretion of the City and shall be made following the process specified\nby subsection 4.9.3.3 below for the particular form of a site-specific vesting plan\ninvolved.\n4.9.3.2. Relationship to Building Permits. A right vested as provided in this\nsubsection shall terminate at the end of the applicable vesting period which respect to\nbuildings and uses for which no valid building permit applications have been filed. Upon\nissuance of a building permit, the provisions of NCGS 160D-1110 and 160D-1113 shall\napply, except that the permit shall not expire or be revoked because of the running of\ntime while a vested right under this section exists.\n4.9.3.3. Requirements for Site-Specific Vesting Plans. For the purposes of this\nsection, a \"site-specific vesting plan\" means a plan submitted to the City describing with\nreasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of\nproperty. The plan may be in the form of, but not be limited to, any of the following\nplans or approvals: a planned unit development plan, a subdivision plat, a site plan, a\npreliminary or general development plan, a special use permit, a conditional zoning, or\nany other development approval as may be used by the City. Unless otherwise expressly\nprovided by the City, the plan shall include the approximate boundaries of the site;\nsignificant topographical and other natural features effecting development of the site;\nthe approximate location on the site of the proposed buildings, structures, and other\nimprovements; the approximate dimensions, including height, of the proposed buildings\nand other structures; and the approximate location of all existing and proposed\ninfrastructure on the site, including water, sewer, roads, and pedestrian walkways. The\nCity of Laurinburg uses existing development approvals, such as a preliminary plat, a\nspecial use permit, or a conditional zoning, to approve a site-specific vesting plan. A\nvariance shall not constitute a \"site specific vesting plan,\" and approval of a site specific\nvesting plan with the condition that a variance be obtained shall not confer a vested\nright unless and until the necessary variance is obtained. If a sketch plan or other\ndocument fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a\nspecified parcel or parcels of property, it may not constitute a site-specific vesting plan.\n4.9.3.4. Process for Approval and Amendment of Site-Specific Vesting Plans.\nIf a site-specific vesting plan is based on an approval required by a local development\nregulation, the City shall provide whatever notice and hearing is required for that\nunderlying approval. If the duration of the underlying approval is less than two years,\nthat shall not affect the duration of the site-specific vesting established by this\nsubsection. If the site-specific vesting plan is not based on such an approval, a\nlegislative hearing with notice as required by NCGS 160D-602 shall be held.

Such\nconditional approval shall result in a vested, although failure to abide by such terms and\nconditions will result in a forfeiture of vested rights. The City shall not require a\nlandowner to waive vested rights as a condition of developmental approval. A site-\nspecific vesting plan shall be deemed approved upon the effective date of the City's\ndecision approving the plan or such other date as determined by the City Council upon\napproval. An approved site-specific vesting plan and its conditions may be amended with\nthe approval of the owner and the City as follows: Any substantial modification must be\nreviewed and approved in the same manner as the original approval; minor\nmodifications may be approved by staff, if such are defined and authorized by local\nregulation.\n4.9.4. Seven Years - Multi-Phase Developments\nA multi-phased development shall be vested for the entire development with the Unified\nDevelopment Ordinance in place at the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase\nof the multi-phased development. This right shall remain vested for a period of seven years\nfrom the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased\ndevelopment. For the purposes of this subsection, \"multi-phased development\" means a\ndevelopment containing 100 acres of more that (i) is submitted for site plan approval for\nconstruction to occur in more than one phase and (ii) is subject to a master development plan\nwith committed elements, including a requirement to offer land for public use as a condition of\nits master development plan approval.\n4.9.5. Indefinite - Development Agreements\nA vested right of reasonable duration may be specified in a development agreement approved\nunder Part IV of this Article.\nSECTION 4.10 CONTINUING REVIEW\nFollowing approval or conditional approval of a statutory vested right, the City may make\nsubsequent reviews and require approvals by the City to ensure compliance with the terms and\nconditions of the original approval, provided that such reviews and approvals are not\ninconsistent with the original approval. The City may revoke the original approval for failure to\ncomply with applicable terms and conditions of the original approval or the applicable local\ndevelopment regulations.\nSECTION 4.11 EXCEPTIONS\n4.11.1. A vested right, once established as provided for by subsections 4.9.3 and 4.9.4,\nprecludes any zoning action by a local government that would change, alter, impair prevent,\ndiminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the property as set forth in an approved\nvested right, except:\n5/18/2021\nPage 4-7\nArticle 4\n"}, {"page": "43", "text": "ARTICLE 4.

DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS (Amended 5/18/2021)\nSECTION 4.13 AUTHORIZATION\n4.13.1. In accordance with NCGS 160D-1002, the City of Laurinburg finds:\n4.13.1.1. Development projects often occur in multiple phases over several years,\nrequiring a long-term commitment of both public and private resources.\n4.13.1.2. Such developments often create community impacts and opportunities that\nare difficult to accommodate within traditional zoning processes.\n4.13.1.3. Because of their scale and duration, such projects often require careful\ncoordination of public capital facilities planning, financing, and construction schedules\nand phasing of the private development.\n4.13.1.4. Such projects involve substantial commitments of private capital which\ndevelopers are usually unwilling to risk without sufficient assurances that development\nstandards will remain stable through the extended period of the development.\n4.13.1.5. Such developments often permit communities and developers to experiment\nwith different or nontraditional types of development concepts and standards, while still\nmanaging impacts on the surrounding areas.\n4.13.1.6. To better structure and manage development approvals for such\ndevelopments and ensure their proper integration into local capital facilities programs,\nthe City needs flexibility to negotiate such developments.\n4.13.2. The City may enter into development agreements with developers, subject to the\nprocedures of this Part. In entering into such agreements, the City may not exercise any\nauthority or make any commitment not authorized by general or local act and may not\nimpose any tax or fee not authorized by otherwise applicable law.\n4.13.3. This Part is supplemental to the powers conferred upon the City and does not\npreclude or supersede rights and obligations established pursuant to other law regarding\ndevelopment approvals, site-specific vesting plans, phased vesting plans, or other provisions of\nlaw.

The development agreement may, by ordinance, be incorporated, in whole or in part,\ninto any development regulation adopted by the City. A development agreement may be\nconsidered concurrently with a zoning map or text amendment affecting the property and\ndevelopment subject to the development agreement. A development agreement may be\nconcurrently considered with and incorporated by reference with a sketch plan or preliminary\nplat required under a subdivision regulation or a site plan or other development approval\nrequired under a zoning regulation.

Any use and/or hazardous material which is illegal under North Carolina and/or\nFederal statutes.\nSECTION 6.3 PRIMARY ZONING DISTRICTS.\nFor the purposes of this Ordinance, the City of Laurinburg, North Carolina is hereby divided into\nthe following primary zoning districts:\n6.3.1. RA-20 MH Residential District.\nThe RA-20 MH district is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for low-\ndensity, single-family residences, two-family residences, multi-family residences and agricultural\npurposes. Single-family attached residences, manufactured homes situated on individual lots,\ntwo-family residences, and multi-family residences are permitted in this district at a density of 2.1\ndwelling units per acre.\n6.3.2. R-20 Residential District.\nThe R-20 district is established to allow low-density, single-family residences, two-family\nresidences, multi-family residences, and agricultural land uses which are interspersed with large,\nundeveloped open areas. Single-family residences (excluding manufactured homes), two-family\nresidences, and multi-family residences are permitted in this district at a density of 2.1 dwelling\nunits per acre.\n6.3.3. R-15 Residential District.\nThe R-15 district is established to allow principally single-family residences (excluding\nmanufactured homes) at a density of 2.9 dwelling units per acre.\n6.3.4. R-6 Residential District.\nThe R-6 district is established to allow a variety of single-family residences (excluding\nmanufactured homes), two-family residences, and multi-family residences at a medium density\nranging from approximately 7 dwelling units per acre to 12 dwelling units per acre.\n5/18/2021\nPage 6-2\nArticle 6\n"}, {"page": "91", "text": "ARTICLE 6. ZONING DISTRICTS\n6.3.5. R-6 MH ResidentialDistrict:\nThe R-6 MH district is established to allow a variety of single-family residences (including\nmanufactured homes), two-family residences, and multi-family residences at a medium density\nranging from approximately 7 dwelling units per acre to 12 dwelling units per acre. In addition,\nmanufactured home parks are allowed within the R-6 MH district by special use permit.\n6.3.6. OI Office and Institutional District.\nThe OI district is established as a district in which to allow primarily office, institutional, and\nlimited retail land uses. In addition, a variety of residential uses, ranging in density from\napproximately 7 dwelling units per acre to 12 dwelling units per acre are permitted within the OI\ndistrict. The major objectives of this district are to (1) encourage land uses which serve as an\nadequate buffer between intensive non-residential uses and residential uses; (2) provide aesthetic\ncontrols and dimensional requirements to ensure compatible office and service development with\nsurrounding residential uses; and (3) encourage a mixture of medium-density residential uses\nwith offices and services.\n6.3.7. CB Central Business District.\nThe CB district is established as a district in which to accommodate a wide variety of commercial\nactivities (particularly those that are pedestrian-oriented) in an intensive development pattern in\nthe city's central business district. The regulations of this district are intended to (1) preserve\nthe general character and integrity of the current development in the central business district;\n(2) encourage land uses which provide for a multi-purpose central business district including\nretail, offices, services, entertainment, and living space; (3) encourage land uses which do not\nrequire large amounts of outdoor use areas; (4) encourage common or shared off-street parking;\nand (5) encourage the continued use of land for governmental activities.\n6.3.8 GB General Business District.\nThe GB district is established as a district in which to accommodate highway-oriented retail and\ncommercial service businesses which generally have as their market area the entire city and\nsurrounding area. The major objectives of this district are to (1) encourage planned commercial\nand office parks; (2) discourage small lot development on major highways; (3) encourage\nvehicular access from service drives and other local commercial streets rather than directly from\narterial streets; and (4) provide a location for major shopping facilities and land uses requiring\nlarge outdoor spaces.\n6.3.9. I IndustrialDistrict\nThe I district is established as a district in which to allow primarily light manufacturing, assembly,\nresearch, warehousing, and intensive commercial uses. The regulations of this district are\nintended to (1) encourage light manufacturing and intensive commercial uses as well as accessory\nland uses incidental to and in support of manufacturing uses; (2) exclude heavy industry,\nhazardous waste management facilities, major retail, and residences as acceptable land uses;\nand (3) preserve locations that are best suited for industrial development. Land uses in the I\ndistrict are limited to those determined to be compatible with the character of the community.\n5/18/2021\nPage 6-3\nArticle 6\n"}, {"page": "92", "text": "ARTICLE 6. ZONING DISTRICTS\nSECTION 6.4 OVERLAY DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.\n6.4.1. One special control overlay district is hereby established: FHO (Flood Hazard Overlay).\nThis special control overlay district is intended to be superimposed over the underlying general\nzoning district and the land so encumbered may be used in a manner permitted in the underlying\ndistrict only if and to the extent such use is also permitted in the applicable overlay district.\n6.4.2. The FHO district is established as an overlay district of all general zoning districts for the\npurpose of protecting people and property from the hazards of flooding. The flood hazard districts\nare further described in Article 9, Part VIII of this Ordinance.\nSECTION 6.5 CONDITIONAL ZONING DISTRICT. (AMENDED 5/18/2021)\nThe large site conditional zoning district (CZD) allows a site to be developed with a mixture of\nland uses according to an approved overall site plan. For example, a large tract may be developed\nwith a mix of single-family and multi-family housing, with part of the site also devoted to\ncommercial and office uses. The CZD allows for greater flexibility in dimensional standards (such\nas lot sizes and setbacks) upon approval of an overall master plan for the entire development.\nThe district does not require a rigid separation of different land uses. Uses are limited to the uses\nidentified in Section 6.6 Table of Uses and Activities. All of the site-specific standards and\nconditions, including a site plan, are incorporated into the zoning district regulations for the CZD.\nApproval of the site plan will establish all zoning requirements for the subject property. A large\nsite CZD district shall not be less than three (3) acres in area.\nThis negotiated approach to a legislative decision allows maximum flexibility to tailor regulations\nto a particular site and project. But it also has great potential for abuse - both in terms of impacts\non individual landowners seeking approval and their neighbors and on the public interests zoning\nis supposed to promote. Thus, special restrictions have been placed on conditional zoning.\nConditional Zoning Districts may only occur at the owner's request and cannot be imposed without\nthe owner's agreement. The individual conditions and site-specific standards that can be imposed\nare limited to those that are needed to bring a project into compliance with city ordinances and\nadopted plans and to those addressing the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by use\nof the site. The city must assure that all of the factors defining reasonable spot zoning are fully\nconsidered and that the public hearing record reflects that consideration.\nConditional zoning provides important opportunities to carefully tailor regulations to address the\ninterest of the landowner, the neighbors, and the public. The city may use conditional zoning\nwhen it concludes that a particular project should be approved but that the standards in the\ncomparable conventional zoning district(s) are insufficient to protect neighbors or public interests\n(perhaps because the conventional zoning allows other uses not suitable for the site or\ndimensional standards inadequate to preserve the neighborhood). Conditional zoning often\nallows a developer to proceed with a project in a way that addresses site-specific concerns of\nneighbors and the City of Laurinburg. The petitioner must consent in writing to all conditions\nimposed by the conditional zoning.\n5/18/2021\nPage 6-4\nArticle 6\n"}, {"page": "93", "text": "ARTICLE 6.

Permissible Uses Not Requiring Permits\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, no zoning or special use permit is\nnecessary for the following uses:\n6.7.1.1. Streets.\n6.7.1.2. Electric power, telephone, telegraph, cable television, gas, water, and sewer\nlines, wires, or pipes, together with supporting poles or structures, located within a public\nright-of-way or easement.\n6.7.1.3. Neighborhood utility facilities located within a public right-of-way with the\npermission of the owner (state or city) of the right-of-way or easement.\nAn encroachment agreement, however, shall be obtained from the Engineering Office of the City\nof Laurinburg prior to the commencement of utility work within a city-owned right-of-way or\neasement.\n6.7.2. Change in Use\n6.7.2.1. A substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character\nor nature of the activity conducted on a lot changes. This occurs whenever:\n6.7.2.1.1. The change involves a change from one principal use category to\nanother.\n6.7.2.1.2. If the original use is a planned residential development, the relative\nproportions of different types of dwelling units change.\n6.7.2.1.3. If there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot, that\nbusiness or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in. For\nexample, if there is only one building on a lot and a florist shop that is the sole\ntenant of that building moves out and is replaced by a a clothing store, that\nconstitutes a change in use even though both tenants fall within the Retail Sales\nand Services classification. However, if the florist shop were replaced by another\nflorist shop, that would not constitute a change in use since the type of business\nor enterprise would not have changed. Moreover, if the florist shop moved out of\na rented space in a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store, that\nwould not constitute a change in use since there is more than one business on the\nlot and the essential character of the activity conducted on that lot (shopping\ncenter) has not changed.\n5/18/2021\nPage 6-18\nArticle 6\n"}, {"page": "107", "text": "ARTICLE 6.

The conditions may impose greater restrictions on a particular use than those\nwhich are listed herein.\nSECTION 7.2 ACCESSORY USES.\n7.2.1. The Table of Uses and Activities (Section 6.6) classifies different principal uses according\nto their different impacts. Whenever an activity (which may or may not be separately listed as\na principal use in this table) is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former\nuse (1) constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on\na lot, or (2) is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it, then the\nformer use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath\nthe umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use. For example, a swimming pool/tennis\ncourt complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a residential subdivision or\nmulti-family development and would be regarded as accessory to such principal uses, even though\nsuch facilities, if developed apart from a residential development, would require a zoning permit.\n7.2.2. For purposes of interpreting subsection 7.2.1:\n7.2.2.1. A use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is of minor\nconsequence in and of itself or is subordinate in relation to the principal use.\n7.2.2.2. To be \"commonly associated\" with a principal use it is not necessary for an\naccessory use to be connected with such principal use more times than not, but only that\nthe association of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient\nfrequency that there is common acceptance of their relatedness.\n7.2.3. Without limiting the generality of subsections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2, the following activities are\nspecifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses so long as they satisfy the general\ncriteria set forth above:\n7.2.3.1. Offices or studios within an enclosed building and used by an occupant of a\nresidence located on the same lot as such building to carry on administrative or artistic\nactivities of a commercial nature, so long as such activities do not fall within the definition\nof a home occupation.\n7.2.3.2.

If the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a\nnonconforming use exists is (i) discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days, or (ii)\ndiscontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity, then\nthat property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to\nthe preexisting use unless the City Council issues a special use permit to allow the property to be\nused for this purpose without correcting the nonconforming situations.

Spot zoning is legal only if the government establishes that it is\nreasonable. Reasonableness is determined by considering the size of the area; any special\nconditions or factors regarding the area; the consistency of the zoning with the land use plan;\nthe degree of change in the zoning; the degree it allows uses different from the surrounding area;\nand the relative benefits and detriments for the owner, the neighbors, and the surrounding\ncommunity. The City of Laurinburg should consider the following factors in deliberating any\npotential spot zoning:\n(1)\nThe Size and Nature of the Tract - The larger the area of spot zoning the more\nlikely it is to be reasonable. Singling out an individual lot for special zoning\ntreatment is more suspect than creating a zoning district that involves multiple\nparcels and owners. Special site characteristics, such as topography, availability\nof utilities, or access to rail or highways, can be important in this analysis.\n(2)\nCompatibility with Existing Plans - If a clear public policy rationale for the different\nzoning treatment is set out in the local government's adopted plans, that evidences\na public purpose for the zoning. By contrast, a zoning action that is inconsistent\nwith a plan may indicate special treatment that is contrary to the public interest\nand thus be unreasonable.\n(3)\nThe Impact of the Zoning Decision on the Landowner, the Immediate Neighbors,\nand the Surrounding Community - An action that is of great benefit to the owner\nand only a mild inconvenience for the neighbors may be reasonable, while a zoning\ndecision that significantly harms the neighbors while only modestly benefitting the\nowner would be unreasonable.\n(4)\nThe Relationship between the Newly Allowed Uses in a Spot Rezoning and the\nPreviously Allowed Uses - The degree of difference in the existing surrounding land\nuses and the proposed new use is also important. The greater the difference in\nallowed uses, the more likely the rezoning will be found unreasonable. For\nexample, in an area previously zoned for residential uses, allowing slightly higher\nresidential density may be reasonable while allowing industrial uses would be\nunreasonable.\n5/18/2021\nPage A-41\nAppendix A\n"}, {"page": "331", "text": "APPENDIX A.
