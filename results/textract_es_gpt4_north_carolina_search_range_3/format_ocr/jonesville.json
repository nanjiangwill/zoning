One hundred animal units equates to\n70 dairy cows, 100 beef cattle, 250 hogs, 50 horses, 1,000 sheep, 5,500 turkeys, 3,000 chickens\nwith liquid manure systems, 10,000 chickens with continuous overflow waterers, or 500 ducks.\nBest Management Practices (BMP's). A structural or nonstructural management-based practice\nused singularly or in combination to reduce nonpoint source inputs to receiving waters in order to\nachieve water quality protection goals.\nBuffer (watershed). An area of natural or planted vegetation through which stormwater runoff\nflows in a diffuse manner SO that the runoff does not become channelized and which provides for\ninfiltration of the runoff and filtering of pollutants. The buffer is measured landward from the\nnormal pool elevation of impounded structures and from the bank of each side of streams or\nrivers.\nBuilt-upon Area (impervious area). Built-upon areas shall include that portion of a development\nproject that is covered by impervious or partially impervious cover including buildings, pavement,\ngravel roads, recreation facilities (e.g. tennis courts), etc. (Note: wooden slatted decks and the\nwater area of a swimming pool are considered pervious.)\nCluster Development. The grouping of buildings in order to conserve land resources and provide\nfor innovation in the design of the project. This term includes non-residential development as\nwell as single-family residential subdivisions and multi-family developments that do not\ninvolve the subdivision of land.\nCritical Area. The area adjacent to a water supply intake or reservoir where risk associated\nwith pollution is greater than from the remaining portions of the watershed. The critical\narea is defined as extending either one-half mile from the normal pool elevation of the\nreservoir in which the intake is located or to the ridge line of the watershed (whichever\ncomes first); or one-half mile upstream from the intake located directly in the stream or river\n(run-of-the-river), or the ridge line of the watershed (whichever comes first). Local\ngovernments may extend the critical area as needed. Major landmarks such as highways\nor property lines may be used to delineate the outer boundary of the critical area if these\nlandmarks are immediately adjacent to the appropriate outer boundary of one-half mile.\nDevelopment. Any land disturbing activity which adds to or changes the amount of\nimpervious or partially impervious cover on a land area or which otherwise decreases the\ninfiltration of precipitation into the soil.\n"}, {"page": "41", "text": "Discharging Landfill.

Any variance of the watershed regulations not considered a\nmajor one as defined above.\nNon-residential Development. All development other than residential development,\nagriculture and silviculture.\nPlat. A map or plan of a parcel of land which is to be, or has been subdivided.\nProtected Area.
