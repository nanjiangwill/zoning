ZONING DISTRICTS, USES, AND DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS\nThis article establishes zoning districts and describes the various uses permitted within the zoning districts, as well as design regulations. Several types of zoning districts are established.\nFirst, 'Conventional' districts (section 3.3) divide the town into various residential, commercial and industrial zones. Each district establishes uses that are permitted \"as of right,\" and uses permitted only\nas \"special uses.\" Special uses require an evidentiary hearing in order to assess whether conditions are needed in order to make the use compatible with other uses in the district. The uses permitted in\neach district are listed in section 3.7.\n'Conditional Zoning' Districts (section 3.4) include district-specific plans, site-specific standards, and conditions agreed upon, in writing, by the town council and the property owner(s) to ensure that the\nuse or group of uses is compatible with adjoining districts and uses. Such Conditional Zoning Districts are established by the town council pursuant to NCGS 160D-703.\n'Special' districts (section 3.5) involve uses which cannot be adequately addressed by the base district regulations. Unlike the overlay districts, these districts are independent of the conventional zoning\ndistricts. The special districts have separate use and design regulations.\n'Overlay' districts are established in section 3.6. Within these districts, the standards of both the conventional and overlay districts apply. These districts address special situations such as groundwater\nrecharge, historic preservation, airport hazards, and utility conversions where the base district regulations are not sufficient to protect the public.\nOne essential function of zoning is to regulate the dimensional aspects of development. Section 3.8 establishes regulations governing the configuration and location of lots, buildings, structures and\npaved surfaces. This includes lot size, density, intensity, lot width, and setbacks from streets and property lines. These standards are consolidated in a schedule called the Dimensional Matrix (Table 3.8-1).\nThe amount of a lot that may be covered with built or paved surfaces (\"impervious surface ratio\") is also established in the dimensional matrix.\nSection 3.9 establishes incentives in the form of additional density and other regulatory measures in order to encourage redevelopment and enhanced site design. Landowners are permitted through\nrezoning to transfer densities from environmentally sensitive sites that are inappropriate for development to sites that are suitable for increases in density.\nSome uses, while permitted in a zoning district, raise special concerns which require additional regulations. These regulations are established in article 6. They apply regardless of whether the use is\npermitted as of right or as a special use within the district.\n(Ord. No. 2017-04-05/0-7, \u00a7 1; Ord.

The use regulations and intensity regulations applicable for such zoning districts are\ndesignated in sections 3.7 and 3.8 of this article.\n3.1.1 Conventional districts may be established by the town council approval of a conventional rezoning pursuant to the procedures established in section 4.4.2 of this appendix. Such approval\nauthorizes the full range of uses in accordance with the standards applicable to the conventional district.\n3.1.2 The Light-Industrial Conditional Zoning District (LI-CZD), may be established by the town council approval of a conditional zoning district pursuant to the procedures established in section 4.4.3\nof this appendix. The light-industrial conditional zoning district incorporates district-specific rezoning plans and conditions agreed to by the owner(s) of the rezoned land. Such approval authorizes\ndevelopment of the Light-Industrial conditional zoning district-specific rezoning plan in accordance with the standards applicable to the conditional zoning district, as modified by the conditions\ncontained with the conditional zoning district approval.\n3.1.3 The Residential-Community Priority-Conditional Zoning District (R-CP-CZD) may be established by the town council approval of a conditional zoning district pursuant to the procedures\nestablished in section 4.4.5 of this appendix, provided the conditional zoning district is deemed consistent the Future Land Use Map Update to Chapel Hill 2020. The Residential-Community\nPriority-Conditional Zoning District (R-CP-CZD) incorporates community priority rezoning plans and conditions agreed to by the owner(s) of the rezoned land. Such approval authorizes\ndevelopment of the community priority rezoning plan in accordance with the standards applicable to the conditional zoning district, as modified by the conditions contained with the conditional\nzoning district approval.\n3.1.4 Conditional Zoning Districts, other than the LI-CZD and R-CP-CZD, may be established by the town council approval of a conditional zoning district pursuant to the procedures established in\nsection 4.4.7 of this appendix, provided the conditional zoning district is deemed consistent with the Future Land Use Map (2050) in the comprehensive plan by locating in conformance with\nan\nadopted small area plan, in a Focus Area as defined in the Future Land Use Map Update to Chapel Hill 2020, or in one of the following land use categories\nMedium Residential\nHigh Residential\nCommercial/Office\nMixed Use\nVillage Center\nInstitutional\nUniversity\nConditional zoning districts incorporate district-specific plans, site-specific standards, and conditions agreed to, in writing, by the town and the owner(s) of the property included in the conditional\nzoning district.

The district is designed to facilitate stated public policies to encourage\ndesign which emphasizes lively, people-oriented environments and compatible, visually interesting development. This district provides areas where moderate scale mixed use centers can locate\nwith an emphasis on development of a balance of residential, office and commercial uses.\nIt is further intended that the mixed use districts shall encourage development within which mutually supporting residential, commercial and office uses are scaled, balanced and located to\nreduce general traffic congestion by providing housing close to principal destinations, and convenient pedestrian and bicycle circulation systems and mass transit to further reduce the need for\nprivate automobile usage. Mixed use districts are intended to encourage development that allows multiple destinations to be achieved with a single trip. These standards encourage a design such\nthat uses within a mixed use district are arranged in a manner that encourages internal vehicular trip capture and the development patterns that encourage walking, transit and bicycling as\nalternatives to automotive travel.\nWhen such districts adjoin residential development or residential zoning districts, it is intended that arrangement of buildings, uses, open space, and vehicular or pedestrian and bicycle access\nshall be such as to provide appropriate transition and reduce potentially adverse effects.\n(a) The mixed-use village conditional zoning district (MU-V-CZD) is permitted only upon approval of a conditional zoning district rezoning application by the town council pursuant to section 4.4.5\nof this appendix.\n(b) Permitted uses and development intensities.\n(1) The uses permitted in the MU-V-CZD include the following:\nA. Vertical mixed-use buildings, or\nB. Uses listed in subsection (2), below, which are mixed horizontally. Uses are \"mixed horizontally\" where:\ni. Such uses comprise not less than the minimum, and not more than the maximum, percentage of floor area prescribed in subsection (b)(2)A, below; and\nii. Uses within a land use category set forth below, are located not further than eight hundred (800) feet from the uses located within another land use category;\niii. The uses within separate land use categories, as set forth below, are linked by a continuous system of sidewalks or trails.

The following special districts are defined below: mixed use\ndistricts, office/institutional-4 district, traditional neighborhood development district, and transit oriented development district.\n3.5.1 Mixed Use Districts.\nPurpose statement: The mixed use districts are intended to provide for the coordinated development of office, commercial, and residential uses and their necessary support functions in the vicinity of\nkey highway intersections and transit corridors in Chapel Hill. They are designed to facilitate stated public policies to encourage design which emphasizes lively, people oriented environments and\ncompatible, visually interesting development. This district provides areas where moderate scale mixed use centers can locate with an emphasis on development of a balance of residential, office and\ncommercial uses.\nIt is further intended that the mixed use districts shall encourage development within which mutually supporting residential, commercial and office uses are scaled, balanced and located to reduce\ngeneral traffic congestion by providing housing close to principal destinations, and convenient pedestrian and bicycle circulation systems and mass transit to further reduce the need for private\nautomobile usage. Mixed use districts are intended to encourage development that allows multiple destinations to be achieved with a single trip. These standards encourage a design such that uses\nwithin a mixed use district are arranged in a manner that encourages internal vehicular trip capture and the development patterns that encourage walking, transit and bicycling as alternatives to\nautomotive travel.\nWhen such districts adjoin residential development or residential zoning districts, it is intended that arrangement of buildings, uses, open space, and vehicular or pedestrian and bicycle access shall be\nsuch as to provide appropriate transition and reduce potentially adverse effects.\n(a) Establishment and intent of mixed use districts.\nThree mixed use (MU) districts are hereby established. The boundaries of the mixed use districts are as shown on the official zoning atlas. The districts are identified as Mixed Use-OI-1 (MU-OI-1),\nMixed Use-R-1 (MU-R-1), and Mixed Use-Village (MU-V).\nIt is the intent of the Town of Chapel Hill to reserve the MU-OI-1 and MU-R-1 designations and regulations for areas already so zoned as of September 2002 and to reserve MU-V for areas already so\nzoned as of October 2020. The policy of the town is to grant no further rezonings to MU-OI-1, MU-R-1, or to MU-V and to reserve future mixed-use village zoning designations for MU-V-CZD.\n(b) Permitted uses and development intensities-Mixed Use-Village (MU-V).\n(1) The uses permitted in the MU-V districts include the following:\nA. Vertical mixed use buildings, or\nB. Uses listed in subsection (2), below, which are mixed horizontally. Uses are considered to be \"mixed horizontally' where:\n1. Such uses comprise not less than the minimum, and not more than the maximum, percentage of floor area prescribed in subsection (b)(2)A, below; and\n2. Uses within a land use category set forth below, are located not further than eight hundred (800) feet from the uses located within another land use category; and\n3. The uses within separate land use categories, as set forth below, are linked by a continuous system of sidewalks or trails. Sidewalks or trails shall be considered \"continuous\" if they are\ninterrupted only by street intersections, but shall not be considered \"continuous\" if interrupted by natural or man-made barriers to pedestrian and bicycle movement or by a street\nconsisting of more than two (2) lanes of traffic, unless a pedestrian and bicycle island is provided.\n(2) Land use categories.\nA. An MU-V shall include office, commercial, and residential uses as described below. The mix of floor area within a proposed development shall contain at least twenty-five (25) percent of\nthe floor area devoted to residential uses and at least twenty-five (25) percent of the floor area devoted to office/commercial uses.\nB.

A key feature of this district is the preparation of a development plan that would allow the property owner, immediate neighbors, and the larger community to understand\nspecifically what levels of development are being proposed, and what impacts would likely accompany the development, so that mitigation measures can be designed and implemented.\n(b) Overview of Development Review Procedures.\nProcedures in this zoning district are designed to facilitate:\nArticulation of development plans that involve multiple buildings in multiple locations over an extended time period on a given tract of land, as defined in a development plan;\nIdentification of total infrastructure needs for such proposed development as specified in a development plan and cumulative impacts resulting from full development as specified in a\n10 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n"}, {"page": "11", "text": "Chapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\ndevelopment plan; and\nProvision of measures to mitigate the negative impacts, including off-site construction of parking decks as described in subsection (d)(2), phased in a manner appropriate with the pace of\nconstruction.\nTo this end, owners of property zoned OI-4 are encouraged to prepare detailed development plans, as described below, for review and approval by the town council. For buildings that are included in an\napproved development plan, site development permits for individual buildings are to be issued by the town manager, following a determination by the town manager that such individual building plans are\ngenerally consistent with the town council-approved development plan.\nFor development proposed within an OI-4 zoning district that is not included in a town council-approved development plan, but is a minor modification according to the provisions of subsection (j) of this\nsection, the town manager may approve a change to the development plan and issue a site development permit. For development proposed within an OI-4 zoning district that is not included in a town\ncouncil-approved development plan and that cannot be considered a minor modification to the plan according to subsection (j) of this section, such development shall be considered to be a special use, and\nsubject to the special use permit procedural requirements of section 4.5 of this appendix. In the alternative, the applicant may apply to the town council for an amendment to the development plan.\nOnce a property is zoned office/institutional-4, all regulations, standards, and procedures prescribed for the previously-applicable zoning district shall apply until (1) a development plan is approved; or\n(2) six (6) months have elapsed, whichever comes first.\n(c) Concept plan review. Prior to submittal of a development plan or modification of development plan, a concept plan review shall be conducted by the Town Council.

On request by the holder of an approved development plan, the town\ncouncil shall approve the abandonment of the plan if it determines that no subsequent development approvals have been granted and no construction activity has taken place pursuant to the\ndevelopment plan. If material conditions of a development plan are violated, and remain in violation after giving the property owner a reasonable amount of time to correct such violation, the\ntown council may revoke the plan after notification to the property owner and opportunity for property owner response at a public meeting of the town council.\n(j) Process for amending the development plan.\nThe town manager is authorized to approve minor modifications and changes in the ordering of phases in an approved development plan, as long as such changes continue to be in compliance with the\napproving action of the town council and all other applicable requirements, and result in a configuration of buildings that is generally consistent with the approved development plan. The town manager\nshall not have the authority to approve changes that constitute a major modification of the development plan.\nBefore making a determination as to whether a proposed action is a minor or major modification, the town manager shall review the record of the proceedings on the original application for the\ndevelopment plan and any subsequent applications for modifications of the development plan, and shall use the following criteria in making a determination:\n(1) A change in the boundaries of the development plan approved by the town council shall constitute a major modification;\n(2) A substantial change in the floor area or number of parking spaces approved by the town council shall constitute a major modification. (General rule: more than a 5% increase in overall net\nnew floor area or parking in a development plan approved by the town council would be considered substantial.);\n(3)\nSubstantial changes in pedestrian or vehicular access or circulation approved by the town council shall constitute a major modification. (General rule: changes that would affect access or\ncirculation beyond the boundaries of a development plan would be considered substantial.); and\n(4) Substantial change in the amount or location of open areas approved by the town council shall constitute a major modification.\nIf the proposed action is determined to be a major modification, the town manager shall require the filing of an application for approval of the major modification, following procedures outlined in this\nsection for initial approval of a development plan.\n(Ord.

The district allows for a more intense and efficient use of land at increased densities for the mutual reinforcement of public investments and private development. Uses and\ndevelopment are regulated to create a more intense built-up environment, oriented to pedestrians and bicycles, to provide a density and intensity that is transit supportive. The development\nstandards of the zone also are designed to encourage a safe and pleasant pedestrian and bicycle environment near transit stations by encouraging an intensive area of shops and activities, by\nencouraging amenities such as benches, kiosks, and outdoor cafes, and by limiting conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians and bicycles. It is the intent of this section that a TOD district be\nrestricted to areas within one-half of a mile of a transit station, which area is equivalent to a typical 10-minute walking distance.\nBecause most transit users will walk only one-quarter to one-half of a mile to a transit facility, transit influence areas require high densities on small areas of land. The town therefore finds and\ndetermines that uses inconsistent with transit will undermine the most efficient use of limited land areas within a TOD, and may render the transit system unworkable. Accordingly, the uses\npermitted within the core (TOD-C) and perimeter (TOD-P) zoning districts are those which are dependent upon, or which may generate, a relatively high level of transit usage. Uses which would\ninterfere with transit usage and which generate few transit trips are not permitted.\n(a) Designation procedures.\nA transit oriented development may be designated pursuant to the procedures established in section 4.4 of this appendix.\n(b) Designation criteria.\nTo be designated a transit oriented development district, the area must meet the following criteria:\n(1) At least fifty (50) percent of the territory within a TOD must lie within one-quarter (1/4) of a mile of a transit station or major bus boarding location, and shall be classified as transit oriented\ndevelopment-core (\"TOD-C\").\n(2) Areas between one-quarter (1/4) of a mile and one-half (1/2) of a mile from a transit station or a major bus boarding location may be classified as transit oriented development-perimeter (\"TOD-\nP\").

The ordinance\nshall establish maximum setbacks and maximum parking requirements which support transit usage.\nTransit related development\nTeam\nExample: Buildings within a TOD district feature small front setbacks in order to provide efficient pedestrian and bicycle movement (top graphic). Buildings in conventional commercial strips do not\nsupport transit usage because pedestrians are separated from buildings by parking lots and wide setbacks (bottom graphic).\n(Source: USDOT, A Guide to Land Use and Public Transportation (Dec. 1989))\n3.5.5. University-1 District\n(a) Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of the University-1 district (U-1) is to establish procedural and substantive standards for the town council's review and approval of development on\nlarge tracts of land where the predominant uses aretobepublic orprivate developmentforcollege/university,researchactivity,civic,hospital, clinics, cultural, and/or related or support functions\nwith integrated supporting housing, general business, convenience business, office-type business, recreation, utility, and/or open space uses.\nThe objective of the U-1 district is to allow for orderly and sustainable growth and major new development while mitigating impacts to nearby neighborhoods, the community, and the environment. A key\nfeature of this district is the concurrent review of a rezoning application and an initial proposed development agreement within such district that allows the property owner, immediate neighbors, and\ncommunity to understand the type and intensity of development being proposed, the timing of that development, the potential impacts of the development, the mitigation measures that will be\nimplemented to address those impacts, and the commitments of both the developer and the town regarding public facilities and services needed to support the proposed development. A development\nagreement that is approved by ordinance as a legislative decision of the town council pursuant to G.S. 160D-1003 is an integral component of the U-1 zoning district.\n(b) Overview of development review procedures. Procedures in this zoning district are designed to facilitate:\n1. Articulation of a long-term development plan that provides a context for more detailed intermediate and short term plans and projects;\n2. Articulation of detailed plans that involve multiple buildings over an extended time period on a defined portion of the zoning district that is subject to an individual development agreement;\n3. Identification of the infrastructure needs and impacts related to the development specified in a development agreement;\n4.\nProvision of measures to mitigate the negative impacts of development in the development agreement and to promote sustainability of approved development, with the mitigation\nimplemented in a manner appropriate with the pace of development; and\n5. Provision of predictability and certainty as to the type, intensity, and design of development set out in a town council-approved development agreement.\nApplicants proposing that property be zoned U-1 must submit a long-range development plan and supporting analysis at the time of petition for rezoning to this district. Upon approval by the town\ncouncil of a development agreement in this district, site development permits for individual buildings are to be issued by the town manager, following a determination by the town manager that such\nindividual building projects do not violate the town council-approved development agreement.\nFor development proposed within the U-1 zoning district that is not included in a town council-approved development agreement, but is a minor modification according to the provisions of this section,\nthe town manager may approve a change to the development agreement and issue a site development permit.\nExcept as specifically authorized as a permitted use under subsection 3.5.5(g)(1), development proposed within this zoning district that is not included in a town council-approved development\nagreement and/or that cannot be considered a minor modification to a development agreement shall be considered to be a special use and subject to the special use permit standards and procedural\nrequirements of section 4.5 of this appendix. In the alternative, the applicant may apply to the town council for an amendment to the development agreement.\nThe terms used within this section have the same meaning and scope as provided by this appendix and state law. Provided, however, that to the extent a council-approved and owner-executed\ndevelopment agreement define a term to have a different meaning or scope, that meaning and scope shall apply as specified in the development agreement.\n(c) Minimum requirements.\nAn\napplication for rezoning to a U-1 district may only be initiated by the owner of the property to be rezoned or a duly authorized agent of the owner.\nAn application for rezoning to a U-1 district must, in addition to all other requirements of this ordinance, include:\n1. A long-range plan for the development of the entire area proposed to be included in the district.\n2. An ecological assessment of the entire area proposed to be included in the district.\n3. A proposed development agreement for a discrete portion of the land to be placed in the district.\nThe town manager may specify forms and reasonable requirements related to these mandated materials to be submitted with a rezoning petition.\n(d) Long-range development plan. When an application for a rezoning to this district is submitted, the developer shall submit a long-range development plan to provide an opportunity for the town\ncouncil, town manager and citizens to see the developer's current plans at a conceptual level for long-term development of all property within the proposed zoning district. This long-range plan is\nnecessary to provide a context for individual development agreements for development within the district. The long-range plan shall represent a good faith depiction of the developer's intentions\nrelative to overall development of the site. It is not, however, submitted for town approval and shall not be deemed to create a binding commitment on behalf of the developer or the town.\nThe long-range development plan shall be submitted to the town manager prior to or concurrently with the submission of an application to rezone property into this district. An updated long-range\ndevelopment plan shall also be submitted with all applications for approval of a development agreement within the district or for approval of major modifications of a development agreement within the\ndistrict.\n(e) Development agreement. A proposed development agreement in this district must include all provisions mandated by state law and shall at a minimum include:\n1. A legal description of the property subject to the agreement and the names of its legal and equitable property owners.\n2. The duration of the agreement.\n14 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n"}, {"page": "15", "text": "Chapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n3.\nThe development uses permitted on the property, including population densities and building types, intensities, placement on the site, and design.\n4. A description of public facilities that will service the development, including who provides the facilities, the date any new public facilities, if needed, will be constructed, and a schedule or\ntriggering points to assure public facilities are available concurrent with the impacts of the development.\n5.\nA description, where appropriate, of any reservation or dedication of land for public purposes and any provisions to protect environmentally sensitive property.\n6. A description of all local development permits approved or needed to be approved for the development of the property together with a statement indicating that the failure of the agreement\nto address a particular permit, condition, term, or restriction does not relieve the developer of the necessity of complying with the law governing their permitting requirements, conditions,\nterms, or restrictions.\n7. A description of any conditions, terms, restrictions, or other requirements determined to be necessary by the town council for the public health, safety, or welfare.\n8. A description, where appropriate, of any provisions for the preservation and restoration of historic structures.\n9. A development schedule, including commencement dates and interim completion dates at no greater than five-year intervals, provided, however, the failure to meet a commencement or\ncompletion date shall not, in and of itself, constitute a material breach of the development agreement pursuant to NCGS 160D-1008 but must be judged based upon the totality of the\ncircumstances.\nThe development agreement may provide that the entire proposed development or any phase of it be commenced or completed within a specified period of time. The development agreement may\ninclude other defined performance standards to be met by the applicant and/or its successors in interest.\n(f) Permitted within the boundary of a development agreement.\n(1) Permitted uses within a development agreement. The predominant uses are to be public or private development for college/university, research activity, civic, hospital, clinics, cultural, and/or\nrelated or support functions with integrated supporting housing, general business, convenience business, office-type business, recreation, utility, and/or open space uses. Uses that may be\napproved within a development agreement in this district include all uses allowed within the OI-4 district as permitted uses, special uses, or accessory uses. The maximum floor area, density\nof development, building heights and general locations, other attributes of development intensity, and design guidelines for the development permitted shall be as provided in a town council-\napproved development agreement. The development agreement may provide that specified uses shall require a town council-approved special use permit.\nA large central cogeneration/utility plant may only be approved within a development agreement in this district upon approval of a special use permit by the town council. For the purposes of\nthis section, a large central cogeneration/utility plant includes any facility designed to produce steam, heat, electric power, chilled water, or cooling for other buildings and that is designed to\nor has the capacity to serve more than two million square feet of building space. The process established by section 4.5.3 of this appendix shall be followed in the consideration of this special\nuse permit and sections 4.5.4 and 4.5.5 of this appendix shall apply to modification, expiration, and revocation of this special use permit. The town council shall not approve that permit unless\neach of the following findings is made:\n1. That the use is located, designed, and proposed to be operated so as to maintain or promote the public health, safety, and general welfare;\n2. That the use is located, designed, and proposed to be operated so as to maintain or enhance the value of contiguous property, or that the use is a public necessity;\n3. That the use conforms with the general plans for the physical development of the town as embodied in the comprehensive plan; and\n4. That the use conforms with the applicable terms of the development agreement.\n(g) Permitted and special uses outside a boundary area of a development agreement.\n(1) Permitted uses outside the boundary area of a development agreement. Uses that may be approved as permitted uses within the zoning district but outside the boundary area or terms of a\ntown council-approved development agreement are:\nCommunity gardens;\nLocal farmers markets;\nRecreational facility, non-profit;\nTrails, greenways, and recreational land;\nPublic use facilities;\nSolar energy collection arrays;\nRadio, television, or wireless transmitting and/or receiving facilities, provided the total height of an antenna-supporting structure is not more than one hundred twenty (120) feet and there is\na\nfive hundred-foot or more setback from the property line;\nWind turbines designed to produce 100kW or less, provided the total height is not more than one hundred twenty (120) feet, there is a minimum ground clearance of thirty (30) feet from\nrotors, and there is a five hundred-foot or more setback from the property line. Wind turbines designed to produce 100kW or less may also be located on rooftops.\nThese permitted uses shall require a zoning compliance permit pursuant to section 4.9 of this appendix and, as is provided for OI-3 and OI-4 districts in Table 3.7-1 (Use Matrix), shall not require a\nspecial use permit based on the floor area of the proposed development.\n(2) Uses subject to a special use permit outside the boundary area of a development agreement. Uses that may be approved as special uses within this zoning district outside the boundary or\nterms of a town council-approved development agreement (including proposed uses for property formerly covered by a development agreement that has expired or been terminated) are\nlimited to those uses allowed within the OI-4 district as permitted uses, special uses, or accessory uses as set forth in Table 3.7-1 (Use Matrix). These special uses shall be subject to the\ndimensional requirements for the OI-4 district as set forth in Table 3-8.1 (Dimensional Matrix) and the perimeter transition area requirements applicable in the OI-4 district.\n(h) Existing conditions within a U-1 zoning district. Existing uses, structures, and conditions within a U-1 zoning district as of the effective day property is placed in this district may be continued as\nspecified by this section. All existing uses of land that do not involve the use of a building can be continued as they exist as of the effective date the property is zoned U-1 and can be changed to\nany use permitted by subsection 3.5.5(f)(1). Any existing building within the U-1 district can be used for the use in effect as of the effective date property is zoned U-1 and can be changed to any\nuse permitted pursuant to a development agreement as authorized by subsection 3.5.5(f)(1). Any existing building being used for a use permitted by this appendix or by an applicable\ndevelopment agreement may be expanded to the extent that the town manager finds that the expansion is exempt from the transportation impact analysis requirements of subsection 5.8(g) of\nthis appendix. Any new construction, development, or site improvements associated with continuation of existing conditions shall be consistent with the terms of all applicable development\nagreements in effect within the district.\n(i) Development standards. Development in the U-1 zoning district shall be designed to provide a mix of uses within all major phases of the development that are integrated, interrelated and linked\nby pedestrian ways, bikeways, and/or other transportation systems. Development agreements shall, to the extent practical and consistent with applicable laws and regulations, include measures\nto encourage reduction of automobile use and promote alternative modes of transportation; to provide sustainable building design and land uses; to mitigate adverse environmental impacts; to\npromote conservation of non-renewable energy resources; to exceed minimally accepted practices; and to achieve visual continuity in the siting and scale of buildings.\nSpecifically, a development agreement in this district shall at a minimum address the following:\n1. Plan consistency. The proposed development shall be generally consistent with the long range development plan for the district submitted by the owner. The development shall be generally\nconsistent with the adopted comprehensive plan for the town.\n15 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n"}, {"page": "16", "text": "Chapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n2. Transportation. Proposed development shall be accompanied by reasonable measures to mitigate transportation impacts that are caused by the development. Proposed development shall\naddress parking, transit, traffic, road, greenway, bikeway, and pedestrian access.\n3.\nFiscal impact. Proposed development shall be accompanied by reasonable measures to mitigate any adverse fiscal impacts for the town; provided that, pursuant to NCGS 160D-1001 (b), the\ntown may not impose any tax or fee not authorized by otherwise applicable law.\n4. Housing. Proposed development shall be accompanied at appropriate times by on-site housing to mitigate the impacts that are caused by the development. Such housing shall address\nstudent and/or workforce housing needs. A range of housing availability and price levels shall be shall be provided within each major phase and area of the proposed development.\n5. Noise and lighting. Noise and lighting levels from proposed development shall not exceed those allowed by town ordinances or the provisions of the development agreement, whichever are\nmore stringent.\n6. Environment. Proposed development shall seek to minimize impacts on natural site features and shall be accompanied by reasonable measures to mitigate those impacts. Proposed\ndevelopment shall address preservation of open land and natural areas, management of stormwater quality and quantity, energy generation and use, preservation of solar access, solar\norientation of buildings, air quality, sustainable water and wastewater management, protection of stream buffers, soil erosion and sedimentation control, landscape and vegetation protection.\n7. Public utilities and services. Proposed development shall assure that there are adequate public utilities and services and shall be accompanied by reasonable measures to assure the\navailability of such services concurrent with the creation of the need for the services. There shall be a general demonstration that police, fire, emergency, water, sewer, school, recreation, and\nother necessary utilities and public services will be available to accommodate the proposed development.\nThe development agreement shall provide for regular monitoring, reporting, and evaluation of the effectiveness of the development standards.\n(j) Minor and major modifications to development agreements. A development agreement may be modified or canceled by mutual consent of the parties to the agreement or by their successors in\ninterest.\nEither party may propose a major or minor modification to any town council-approved development agreement. Upon receipt of a proposed modification, the town manager shall consider the following\ncriteria in making the determination as to whether a proposed adjustment is a major or a minor modification to a development agreement:\n1. A substantial change in the boundaries of the development agreement shall constitute a major modification. Any single proposed increase or decrease in the area of land subject to the\ndevelopment agreement approved by the town council of more than five (5) percent shall be considered substantial. A cumulative increase of fifteen (15) percent or more in the land area\nsubject to the development agreement shall be considered substantial.\n2.\nA substantial change in the floor area or number of parking spaces shall constitute a major modification. Any single proposed increase or decrease in new floor area or number of parking\nspaces of more than a five (5) percent in a development agreement approved by the town council shall be considered a major modification. A cumulative increase of fifteen (15) percent or\nmore in the floor area or number of parking spaces subject to the development agreement shall be considered a major modification. Provided, under no circumstances shall a change in floor\narea of less than one thousand (1,000) square feet or fewer than ten (10) parking spaces be deemed either a major amendment or minor modification and such changes shall be reported by\nthe applicant to the town manager.\n3. Changes that would substantially affect pedestrian, bicycle, or vehicular access or circulation beyond the boundaries of the development agreement shall constitute a major modification.\n4.\nSubstantial change in the amount or location of open space within the boundaries of a development agreement shall constitute a major modification. Any single change that increases or\ndecreases the amount of open space by more than five (5) percent shall be considered a major modification. A cumulative increase or decrease in the amount of open space by fifteen (15)\npercent or more or a substantial change in the location of designated open space shall be considered a major modification.\nNotwithstanding the above, some proposed changes to a town-council approved development agreement that do not meet the threshold to constitute a major modification may in the judgment of the\ntown manager, because of size, perimeter location or transportation impacts, merit public review.

No. 2021-05-19/O-1, \u00a7\u00a7 14-21)\n3.5.6 Development Agreement-1 District.\n(a)\nPurpose and intent. The purpose and intent of the Development Agreement-1 district (DA-1) is to establish procedural and substantive standards for the town council's review and approval of\ndevelopment where the predominant uses are to be private development that includes uses such as housing, general business, convenience business, office-type business, recreation, utility, and/\nor open space uses.\nThe objective of the DA-1 district is to allow for orderly and sustainable growth and major new development while mitigating impacts to nearby neighborhoods, the community, and the environment. A\nkey feature of this district is the concurrent review of a rezoning application and an initial proposed development agreement within such district that allows the property owner, immediate neighbors, and\ncommunity to understand the type and intensity of development being proposed, the timing of that development, the potential impacts of the development, the mitigation measures that will be\nimplemented to address those impacts, and the commitments of both the developer and the Town regarding public facilities and services needed to support the proposed development. A development\nagreement that is approved by ordinance as a legislative decision of the town council pursuant to NCGS 160D-1003 is an integral component of the DA-1 zoning district.\n(b) Overview of development review procedures. Procedures in this zoning district are designed to facilitate:\n1. Articulation of a long-term development plan that provides a context for more detailed intermediate and short term plans and projects;\n17 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n"}, {"page": "18", "text": "Chapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n2. Articulation of detailed plans that involve multiple buildings over an extended time period on a defined portion of the zoning district that is subject to an individual development agreement;\n3. Identification of the infrastructure needs and impacts related to the development specified in a development agreement;\n4. Provision of measures to mitigate the negative impacts of development in the development agreement and to promote sustainability of approved development, with the mitigation\nimplemented in a manner appropriate with the pace of development; and\n5.\nProvision of predictability and certainty as to the type, intensity, and design of development set out in a town council-approved development agreement.\nApplicants proposing that property be zoned DA-1 must submit a long-range development plan and supporting analysis at the time of petition for rezoning to this district. Upon approval by the town\ncouncil of a development agreement in this district, site development permits for individual buildings are to be issued by the town manager, following a determination by the town manager that such\nindividual building projects do not violate the town council-approved development agreement.\nFor development proposed within the DA-1 zoning district that is not included in a town council-approved development agreement, but is a minor modification according to the provisions of this section,\nthe town manager may approve a change to the development agreement and issue a site development permit.\nExcept as specifically authorized as a permitted use under section 3.5.6(e)(1), development proposed within this zoning district that is not included in a town council-approved development agreement\nand/or that cannot be considered a minor modification to a development agreement shall be considered to be a special use and subject to the special use permit standards and procedural requirements of\nsection 4.5 of this appendix. In the alternative, the applicant may apply to the town council for an amendment to the development agreement.\nThe terms used within this Section have the same meaning and scope as provided by this appendix and state law. Provided, however, that to the extent a council-approved and owner-executed\ndevelopment agreement defines a term to have a different meaning or scope, that meaning and scope shall apply as specified in the development agreement.\n(c) Minimum Requirements. Areas with contiguous acres of developable property (as defined by NCGS 160D-1004) under common ownership or management may be placed in a DA-1 zoning district:\nAn application for rezoning to a DA-1 district must, in addition to all other requirements for this ordinance, include:\n1. An ecological analysis of the entire area proposed to be included in the district.\n2. A proposal to establish a development agreement of the land to be place in the district.\nThe requirement of an approved development agreement may include work or restrictions beyond the property zoned DA-1.\nThe town manager may specify forms and reasonable requirements related to these mandated materials to be submitted with a rezoning petition.\n(d) Development agreement. A proposed development agreement in this district must include all provisions mandated by state law and shall at a minimum include:\n1. A legal description of the property subject to the agreement and the names of its legal and equitable property owners.\n2. The duration of the agreement.\n3.\nThe development uses permitted on the property, including population densities and building types, intensities, placement on the site, and design.\n4. A description of public facilities that will service the development, including who provides the facilities, the date any new public facilities, if needed, will be constructed, and a schedule or\ntriggering points to assure public facilities are available concurrent with the impacts of the development.\n5. A description, where appropriate, of any reservation or dedication of land for public purposes and any provisions to protect environmentally sensitive property.\n6. A description of all local development permits approved or needed to be approved for the development of the property together with a statement indicating that the failure of the agreement\nto address a particular permit, condition, term, or restriction does not relieve the developer of the necessity of complying with the law governing their permitting requirements, conditions,\nterms, or restrictions.\n7.\nA description of any conditions, terms, restrictions, or other requirements determined to be necessary by the Town Council for the public health, safety, or welfare.\n8. A description, where appropriate, of any provisions for the preservation and restoration of historic structures.\n9. A development schedule, including commencement dates and interim completion dates provided, however, the failure to meet a commencement or completion date shall not, in and of itself,\nconstitute a material breach of the development agreement pursuant to NCGS 160D-1008 but must be judged based upon the totality of the circumstances.\nThe development agreement may provide that the entire proposed development or any phase of it be commenced or completed within a specified period of time. The development agreement may\ninclude other defined performance standards to be met by the applicant and/or its successors in interest.\n(e) Permitted uses within the boundary of a development agreement.\n(1) Permitted uses within a development agreement. The predominant uses are to be private development for housing, general business, convenience business, office-type business, recreation,\nutility, and/or open space uses. The permitted uses, special uses, or accessory uses in the Development Agreement-1 (DA-1) within the boundary of a development agreement are limited to\nthose uses as set forth in Table 3.7-1: Use Matrix and may be further limited by the terms of any development agreement entered into by a property owner and the Town.\n(2)\nThe maximum floor area, density of development, building heights and general locations, other attributes of development intensity, and design guidelines for the development permitted shall\nbe as provided in a town council-approved development agreement. The development agreement may provide that specified uses shall require a town council-approved special use permit.\n(f) Permitted and special uses outside a boundary area of a development agreement.\n(1)\nUses that may be approved as permitted uses within the DA-1 zoning district but outside the boundary area or terms of a town council-approved development agreement are:\nCommunity gardens;\nLocal farmers markets;\nRecreational facility, non-profit;\nTrails, greenways, and recreational land;\nPublic use facilities;\nSolar energy collection arrays;\nWind turbines designed to produce one hundred (100) kW or less, provided the total height is not more than one hundred twenty (120) feet, there is a minimum ground clearance of 30 feet from rotors,\nand there is a 500-foot or more setback from the property line. Wind turbines designed to produce 100kW or less may also be located on rooftops.\nThese permitted uses shall require a zoning compliance permit pursuant to section 4.9 of this appendix.\n(2)\nUses that may be approved as special uses within this zoning district outside the boundary or terms of a Town Council-approved development agreement (including proposed uses for\nproperty formerly covered by a development agreement that has expired or been terminated) are limited to those uses as set forth in Table 3.7-1 (Use Matrix). These special uses shall be\nsubject to the dimensional requirements as set forth in Table 3-8.1 (Dimensional Matrix) and the applicable perimeter transition area requirements.\n(g) Existing conditions within a DA-1 zoning district. Existing uses, structures, and conditions within a DA-1 zoning district as of the effective day property is placed in this district may be continued as\nspecified by this section. All existing uses of land that do not involve the use of a building can be continued as they exist as of the effective date the property is zoned DA-1. Any existing building\nbeing used for a use permitted by this appendix or by an applicable development agreement may be expanded to the extent that the town manager finds that the expansion is exempt from the\n18 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n"}, {"page": "19", "text": "Chapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\ntransportation impact analysis requirements of section 5.8(g) of this appendix. Any new construction, development, or site improvements associated with continuation of existing conditions shall\nbe consistent with the terms of all applicable development agreements in effect within the district.\n(h) Development standards. Development in the DA-1 zoning district shall be designed to provide a mix of uses within all major phases of the development that are integrated, interrelated and linked\nby pedestrian ways, bikeways, and/or other transportation systems. Development agreements shall, to the extent practical and consistent with applicable laws and regulations, include measures\nto encourage reduction of automobile use and promote alternative modes of transportation; to provide sustainable building design and land uses; to mitigate adverse environmental impacts; to\npromote conservation of non-renewable energy resources; to exceed minimally accepted practices; and to achieve visual continuity in the siting and scale of buildings. In the DA-1 zone, a\ndevelopment agreement covering land may provide for standards and regulations that are different from those which would otherwise be applicable under the LUMO. Except as specifically\nprovided otherwise by the terms of any approved development agreement, the regulations found in this Appendix applicable in the R-1 zoning district shall apply.\nSpecifically, a development agreement in this district shall at a minimum address the following:\n1.\nPlan consistency. The proposed development shall be generally consistent with the long range development plan for the district submitted by the owner. The development shall be generally\nconsistent with the adopted comprehensive plan for the Town.\n2. Transportation. Proposed development shall be accompanied by reasonable measures to mitigate transportation impacts that are caused by the development. Proposed development shall\naddress parking, transit, traffic, road, greenway, bikeway, and pedestrian access.\n3. Fiscal impact. Proposed development shall be accompanied by reasonable measures to mitigate any adverse fiscal impacts for the Town; provided that, pursuant to NCGS 160D-1001(b), the\nTown may not impose any tax or fee not authorized by otherwise applicable law.\n4.\nHousing. Proposed development shall be accompanied at appropriate times by on-site housing to mitigate the impacts that are caused by the development. A range of housing availability and\nprice levels shall be shall be provided within each major phase and area of the proposed development.\n5.\nNoise and lighting. Noise and lighting levels from proposed development shall not exceed those allowed by Town ordinances or the provisions of the development agreement, whichever are\nmore stringent. In cases where property frontage is along a US highway, lighting standards may be governed by North Carolina Department of Transportation standards in the event they are\nless stringent than the Town ordinance.\n6. Environment. Proposed development shall seek to minimize impacts on natural site features and shall be accompanied by reasonable measures to mitigate those impacts. Proposed\ndevelopment shall address preservation of open land and natural areas, management of stormwater quality and quantity, energy generation and use, preservation of solar access, solar\norientation of buildings, air quality, sustainable water and wastewater management, protection of stream buffers, soil erosion and sedimentation control, landscape and vegetation protection.\n7.

A development agreement may be amended or canceled by mutual consent of the parties to the agreement or by their successors\nin\ninterest.\nEither party may propose a major modification or minor modification to any town council-approved development agreement. Upon receipt of a proposed adjustment, the town manager shall consider\nthe following criteria in making the determination as to whether a proposed adjustment is a major or a minor modification to a development agreement:\n1. A substantial change in the boundaries of the development agreement shall constitute a major modification. Any single proposed increase or decrease in the area of land subject to the\ndevelopment agreement approved by the town council of more than five (5) percent shall be considered substantial. A cumulative increase of 15 percent or more in the land area subject to\nthe development agreement shall be considered substantial.\n2. A substantial change in the floor area or number of parking spaces shall constitute a major modification. Any single proposed increase or decrease in new floor area or number of parking\nspaces of more than a five (5) percent in a development agreement approved by the town council shall be considered a major modification. A cumulative increase of fifteen (15) percent or\nmore in the floor area or number of parking spaces subject to the development agreement shall be considered a major modification. Provided, under no circumstances shall a change in floor\narea of less than one thousand (1,000) square feet or fewer than ten (10) parking spaces be deemed either a major or minor modification and such changes shall be reported by the applicant\nto the town manager.\n3.\nChanges that would substantially affect pedestrian, bicycle, or vehicular access or circulation beyond the boundaries of the development agreement shall constitute a major modification.\n4. Substantial change in the amount or location of open space within the boundaries of a development agreement shall constitute a major modification.

In the event the manager makes such a determination he/she may submit the proposed minor\nmodification at a town council meeting to allow an opportunity for council review and public comment. Unless the other party to the development agreement agrees otherwise, such a review shall not\nextend the time period allowed for a decision by the manager on the minor modification or convert the change from a minor modification into a major modification.\nAll proposed adjustments to a town council-approved development agreement shall be publicly posted in such a manner that the public will have the opportunity to express any concerns to the town\ncouncil and/or the town manager.

The town manager shall approve the application upon finding it is substantially consistent with and does not\nviolate any term of the agreement and shall deny approval upon finding the application is NOT substantially consistent with or violates a term of the agreement. If the application is denied,\nthe Town manager shall specify the grounds for finding that it is inconsistent or in violation and refer the applicant to the special use permit process described in section 4.5 of this appendix.\nAlternatively, the applicant may modify the site development permit application or apply for a major modification to the development agreement. Provided, under no circumstances shall a\nchange in floor area of less than one thousand (1,000) square feet or fewer than ten (10) parking spaces be deemed either a minor or major modification of the development agreement nor\nrequire approval or modification of an individual site development permit; such changes shall be reported by the applicant to the town manager.\n(3)\nExpiration, abandonment, revocation or development agreement. The term of any development agreement shall be set forth in the agreement. The development agreement shall also contain\nspecific provisions relative to default or termination of the agreement.\n(4) Periodic review and amendment of the development agreement. The town manager shall at least every twelve (12) months conduct a review of the development agreement at which time the\napplicant or its successors in interest must demonstrate good faith compliance with the terms of the development agreement. The town manager shall promptly report the results of this\nreview to the town council. If, as a result of this periodic review, the town council finds and determines that the applicant or its successors in interest has committed a material breach of the\nterms or conditions of the agreement, the town manager shall serve notice in writing, within a reasonable time not to exceed thirty (30) working days after the periodic review, upon the\napplicant or its successors in interest setting forth with reasonable particularity the nature of the breach and the evidence supporting the finding and determination, and providing the\napplicant or their successors in interest a reasonable time in which to cure the material breach. If the applicant or its successors in interest fail to cure the material breach within the time\ngiven, then the town council unilaterally may terminate or modify the development agreement pursuant to NCGS 160D-1008; provided, the notice of termination or modification may be\nappealed to the board of adjustment in the manner provided by 160D-405. Thereafter the applicant or its successors in interest may pursue any other rights and remedies available at law or\nin equity. If the town council elects to unilaterally modify the agreement, the applicant or its successors in interest may elect for the development agreement to be terminated rather than\naccede to the development agreement with the modifications unilaterally made by the town council.\n3.5.7.

The maximum period of delay authorized by this section shall be reduced by the commission\nwhere it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use of or return from such property by virtue of the delay. During such period the\ncommission may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building. If the commission finds that the building has no particular\nsignificance or value toward maintaining the character of the historic district, it shall waive all or part of such period and authorize earlier demolition or removal. In every case, the record of\nthe commission's action shall include the reasons for its action.\"\n(6) Actions subsequent to decision. The town manager shall notify the applicant of a decision in writing, and shall file a copy of it with the town's planning department.

Dimensional standards.\nPurpose statement: It is the intent of this article to provide for performance standards which serve to define the development character of an area, and to ensure the compatibility of development both\nwith the environmental characteristics, accessibility levels, and special amenities offered by the development site and with surrounding land uses and development intensities. It is further intended that the\nestablishment of intensity regulations reflect the protection of critical environmental areas and the suitability of land for a particular level of development intensity, in accord with the goals and objectives of\nthe comprehensive plan.\nThe setback and height regulations established in the dimensional matrix are intended to ensure adequate solar access, privacy, and ventilation; access to and around buildings, off-street parking areas,\nloading space, and service areas; space for landscaping; and spacing between buildings and portions of buildings to reduce potential adverse effects of noise, odor, glare, or fire. Adequate solar access is\ndeemed to consist of varying levels of access ranging from rooftop solar access in high-intensity zoning districts to south wall solar access in low-intensity zoning districts.\n3.8.1 Establishment and General Applicability of Dimensional Regulations.\nExcept as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, regulations governing the dimensions of lots and buildings are hereby established as described in section 3.8.2 and shown in Table 3.8-1.\n(a) No land or structure shall be used or occupied, and no structure, or part thereof, shall be constructed, erected, altered, or moved except in compliance with the dimensional regulations herein\nspecified for each zoning district.\n(b)\nNo portion of land used in connection with an existing or proposed structure or use of land and necessary for compliance with the dimensional regulations of this article shall also be used,\nthrough sale or otherwise, as part of the land required in connection with any other development.\n(c) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, dimensional regulations applicable to OI-3 and OI-4 zoning districts and planned development zoning lots shall be applied to the district or lot as a\nwhole and not to individual parts thereof.\n3.8.2 Dimensional Regulations.\nAbout the Building Envelope. Sections (f)-(j) define the three-dimensional building envelope. All structures, or portions thereof, must be placed within the building envelope and may not encroach the\nbuilding envelope unless specifically exempted by this Appendix.\nDivisions (f) and (g) regulate the setback height and core height, respectively, which together define the vertical extent of the building envelope.\nDivisions (h)-(j) regulate the street, interior, and north setback lines, respectively, which together define the perimeter setback line and horizontal extent of the building envelope.\nDefinitions. Refer to Appendix A for definitions of applicable terms.\n(a) Zoning District. Column (A) refers to the applicable Zoning District. The requirements set forth in sections (b)-(i) below, relate to the zoning district specified in the row under Column (A),\n(b) Minimum Lot Size. Column (B) is expressed in square feet of gross land area.\nNotes:\n(1) Where a zoning lot is located in more than one zoning district, the minimum gross land area required of such zoning lot shall be the sum of the areas derived by multiplying the minimum\ngross land area required for each represented district by the proportion of the zoning lot located within that district.\n(2) For all uses that consist of three (3) or more dwelling units, the minimum lot size is two (2) times the figure shown in Column (B).\n(c) Minimum Frontage. Column (C) is the minimum width of the lot measured along the street.\nNotes:\n(1) Where a zoning lot fronts on two (2) or more streets, minimum street frontage width requirements shall be considered met if the frontage along any one of such streets meets the minimum\nstreet frontage width requirements.\n(2) Where a zoning lot fronts on a turning circle of a cul-de-sac or at a point of a street where the radius of the curvature of the right-of-way is less than ninety (90) feet, the minimum street\nfrontage width requirement shall be thirty-five (35) feet.\n(d) Minimum Lot Width. Column (D) is the minimum width of the lot, expressed in feet, measured at least twenty-five (25) feet interior from the minimum street setback. No portion of a lot, created\nas part of a subdivision, between a street setback and the opposite interior (rear) setback, shall be less than twenty (20) feet in width.\nException:\n(1) Authorized flag lots, created as part of a subdivision and subject to the lot layout standards in section 5.2, may contain areas between a street setback and the opposite interior (rear) setback\nthat are less than twenty (20) feet in width. Authorized flag lots shall reach the minimum lot width at a point not to exceed two hundred (200) feet from the street right-of-way.\nNotes:\n(2) Where a zoning lot fronts on two (2) or more streets, minimum lot width requirements shall be considered met if the lot width at the street setback from any one of such streets meets the\nminimum lot width requirement.\n(3)\nWhere a zoning lot fronts on a turning circle of a cul-de-sac or at a point of a street where the radius of the curvature of the right-of-way is less than ninety (90) feet, the minimum lot width\nshall be reached at a distance derived by the following formula: D = 50 (W)(35) 50, where W = minimum required lot width, and D = maximum distance from street right-of-way to where the\nlot width equals the minimum required width for that district.\n(e) Maximum Setback Height: Column (E) is the maximum allowable height at the perimeter setback line of a zoning lot, as defined by the minimum street, interior, and solar setbacks.\n(1)\nHeight shall be measured from mean finished grade, along the street fa\u00e7ade of the building. Where a structure fronts more than one (1) street, height shall be measured from the lower, more\nrestrictive mean finished grade.\n(2)\n42 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n"}, {"page": "43", "text": "Chapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nTo determine mean finished grade, take the spot elevations from the highest and lowest points of the foundation. The average of these two (2) spots elevations is the mean finished grade and the elevation\nfrom which height measurements are made.\n(3) The entire structure, and all portions thereof, is subject to the maximum setback height.\nExceptions:\nA. The structure or part thereof is below the allowable core height, as described in division (g) below.\nB. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted in section 3.8.3 Exceptions to Setback and Height Requirements, below.\nC. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted as provided elsewhere in this Appendix.\n(4) For purposes of applying setback and height regulations to development within an OI-3 or OI-4 zoning district or within a townhouse development or a planned development, all contiguous\nland within the district, townhouse development, or planned development shall be considered as a single zoning lot.\n(f) Maximum Core Height: Column (F) is the maximum allowable height in the interior or core area of a lot. The core height provides additional allowable height on the interior of a zoning lot based\non the horizontal distance measured away from the perimeter setback line of the lot. The allowable core height increases with the distance interior to the lot, measured from the perimeter\nsetback line at a rate described below.\n(1) In all Zoning Districts, except those explicitly named in subdivision (2), the allowable core height increases at a rate of one (1) foot in height for every two (2) feet of distance interior to the lot,\nmeasured away from the perimeter setbacks. This is equivalent to a slope of 1/2 (rise/run) or 1:2.\n(2) In the Town Center 1 to 3, Office/Institutional 3 to 4 zoning districts the allowable core height increases at the following rates:\nA. Street and interior setbacks: one (1) feet in height for every one (1) feet of distance interior to the lot, measured away from the street and interior setbacks. This is equivalent to a slope of\n1/1 (rise/run) or 1:1.\nB. Solar setbacks: one (1) feet in height for every one (1) foot and seven-tenths of a foot (1.7 feet) of distance interior to the lot, measured away from the street and interior setbacks. This is\nequivalent to a slope of 1/1.7 (rise/run) or 1:1.7.\n(3) No structure, or part thereof, shall project beyond the allowable core height of a structure or part thereof.\nExceptions:\nA. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted in section 3.8.3 Exceptions to Setback and Height Requirements, below.\nB. The structure or part thereof is explicitly exempted as provided elsewhere in this Appendix.\n(4) If a structure is located in the vicinity of an airport, the height limitations set forth in Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 77, or successor regulations, shall apply where such limitations are\nstricter than those established in this appendix.\n(g) Minimum Street Setback. Column (G) establishes a minimum setback from the street right-of-way line. Where a zoning lot fronts on a street with a right-of-way width not meeting the standards of\nthis appendix, street setback shall be measured from a line running parallel to the centerline of the street at a distance from such centerline equal to one-half (1/2) the standard right-of-way width\nof the street.\nException:\n(1) The town manager or town council may exempt lots from this requirement upon making one (1) of the following findings:\nA. Where a building line has already been established by existing structures along the block which are situated on lots comprising at least twenty-five (25) percent of the street frontage, the\nbuilding may be constructed at the established building line; or\nB. The existing right-of-way is adequate to encompass any anticipated need for widening of the street or other improvements and widening of the right-of-way to town standards would\ncreate nonconforming street setbacks for other structures on the street.\n(h) Minimum Interior Setback. Column (H) establishes a minimum setback measured from the interior lot lines.\nException:\n(1) The interior setback requirements may be reduced to zero (0) under certain conditions (see section 5.2.8.).\nNote:\n(2) Side setbacks are set at zero (0) in many non-residential districts in order to encourage the formation of a street wall, as is found in traditional commercial centers such as the TC district along\nFranklin Street.\n(i) Minimum Solar Setback. Column (I) establishes a minimum setback measured from north lot lines. Where a solar setback and either a street or interior setback both apply to the same portion of a\nlot line, the required minimum setback shall be the greater of the two (2).\nExceptions:\n(1) The solar setback may be reduced to zero (0) under certain conditions (see section 5.2.8).\n(2) Minimum solar setback requirements shall not apply to any structure, or part thereof, when the proposed height of the structure is ninety (90) percent, or less, of the maximum allowed\nsetback height. In such cases, the lesser interior setback may be used instead.\n(j)\nMaximum Impervious Surface Ratio. Column (J) establishes the maximum ratio of impervious surface on a lot. The maximum amount of impervious surface area is divided by multiplying the gross\nland area of the lot by the ratio established in Column (K) and as described below:\n(1) Single-family and two-family residential development: (.50)\n(2) Multifamily developments, fraternities and sororities, non-residential, or mixed-use development: (.70).\nException:\n(3) Impervious surface restrictions shall not apply to town center zoning districts.\n(k) Maximum Floor Area Ratio. Maximum floor area allowed shall be the number of square feet derived by multiplying gross land area by the applicable floor area ratio (FAR) as shown in Table 3.8.1.\nExceptions:\n(1) A maximum floor area ratio shall not apply to:\nA. Dwelling Units, Single-Family\nB. Dwelling Units, Single-Family with Accessory Apartment\nC. Dwelling Units, Single-Family with Cottage\nD. Public Cultural Facilities\n(2) For two-family dwellings on a single zoning lot, the floor area shall be .40 in all zones and overlay zones, except where the overlay zone establishes a more restrictive floor area ratio for\nduplexes.\n(3)\nFor public elementary and secondary schools, the maximum floor area ratio shall be 0.174 unless a higher floor area ratio is established in Column (L).\n43 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n"}, {"page": "44", "text": "Chapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n(4) Where a lot is partially within the resource conservation district, the maximum allowable floor area of the portion of the lot outside of the resource conservation district shall be calculated\nthe sum of:\nas\nA.

Only the minimum recreation area reservation required in section 5.5 may be dedicated outside the boundaries of the land being\nsubdivided as specified in section 5.5.2.\n(c)\nReductions in lot and setback requirements. For lots created as part of a cluster development, minimum gross land area, minimum lot width, and minimum setback requirements may be reduced\nas follows:\n(1) Minimum lot size requirements specified in section 3.8 may be reduced to five thousand, five hundred (5,500) square feet gross land area.\n(2) Minimum lot width requirements specified in section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to fifty (50) feet.\n(3) Minimum street setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the street lot line forms an exterior boundary of the cluster development.\n(4)\nMinimum interior setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to eight (8) feet except where the interior lot line\nforms a boundary of the cluster development.\n(5) Minimum solar setback requirements specified in Section 3.8 for R-LD5, R-LD1, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, and R-2 zoning districts may be reduced to ten (10) feet except where the north lot line forms\na\nboundary of the cluster development.\n(d) Floor area ratios and impervious surface limitations.

This section promotes the public health, safety and welfare of the town by promoting housing of high quality located in neighborhoods throughout the community for households of\na\nvariety of income levels, ages and sizes in order to meet the town's goal of preserving and promoting a culturally and economically diverse population in our community.\nBased upon the review and consideration of reports and analyses of the housing supply in the town, the town finds and determines that the diversity of its housing stock has declined for many reasons\nincluding increasing property values and construction costs.

Without intervention, the trend toward rising housing prices will result in an increasingly inadequate supply of affordable housing\nfor town residents and local employees, which will have a negative impact upon the ability of local employers to maintain an adequate local work force and will otherwise be detrimental to the public health,\nsafety and welfare of the town and its residents. Since the remaining land appropriate for new residential development within the town is limited, it is essential that a reasonable proportion of such land be\ndeveloped into housing units affordable to low- and moderate-income households and working families. The town finds and determines that additional market rate development would displace and\neliminate opportunities for additional affordable housing in the town unless the restrictions on use established by this section are included. This displacement would create the following threats to the\nhealth, safety, or the general welfare of the community:\nIncreases in travel time and distances for persons who provide services or are employed in the town, but who cannot find decent, affordable shelter, which in turn increases traffic congestion,\nreduces air and water quality, and has an adverse impact on public health resulting from excessive commuting; and\nAn imbalance in population diversity; and\nInconsistency with the vision for future development and the specific policies of the town's comprehensive plan.\nThe regulations set forth in this section further a key goal of the town's comprehensive plan: to create and preserve affordable housing opportunities. The regulations also support other goals of the\ntown including the reduction of traffic congestion and associated air pollution; and the prevention of sprawl through the maintenance of the urban services boundary. Documentation exists demonstrating\nthat the construction of residential dwelling units in Chapel Hill generates need for affordable housing for workers and families. These regulations are intended to provide a structure for cooperative\nparticipation by the public and private sectors in the production of affordable housing.\n3.10.1 Applicability and Minimum Project Size.\n(a) Single-family and two-family units. This section applies to all development that includes:\n(1) At least five (5) single-family dwelling units or two-family dwelling units; or\n(2) At least five (5) single-family lots; or\n(3) Two-family lots in which six (6) or more residential units are allowed by the Chapel Hill Land Use Management Ordinance, either individually or as part of the same subdivision.\n(b) Multifamily units. This section applies to all development that includes:\n(1) New development that creates at least five (5) multifamily dwelling units; or\n(2) Any vertical mixed use building that creates at least five (5) multifamily dwelling units; or\n(3) Renovation or reconstruction of an existing building that contains multifamily dwelling units, and that increases the number of dwelling units from the number of dwelling units in the original\nstructure by at least five (5); or\n(4) Any change in use of all or part of an existing building from a nonresidential use to a residential use that has at least five (5) dwelling units.\n3.10.2 Affordable Dwelling Units or Lots Required.\n(a) General requirement.

For guidelines applicable to certificate of\nappropriateness review as indicated in the appendix of the Design Guidelines, the Community Design Commission shall deem the application to have met a given standard of Section 3.11\nif the application complies with at least one lettered statement under the applicable guideline(s).\n3. The Design Guidelines shall provide guidance to the Community Design Commission in determining whether a design alternative is warranted.\n4. Where qualitative terms such as \"compatible\" and \"appropriate\" are used in Section 3.11 to describe the form of the built environment, the Community Design Commission shall refer to the\nDesign Guidelines when making a determination of whether development exhibits such qualities.\n5. The town council shall consider revisions to the Blue Hill Design Guidelines to reflect changes in best practices for urban design, changes in technology, and/or changes to development\nregulations. The town manager shall revise the Design Guidelines as needed to make technical corrections or improve formatting.\nH.\nApplication of design alternatives. Where a proposed variation to the requirements of section 3.11 meets the intent of the Design Guidelines and satisfies the provisions of section 3.11.1 in terms\nof building form, aesthetic quality, orderly development, and high-quality public realm, and where the Community Design Commission makes a finding that a proposed design alternative could\nprovide an equivalent or better result that meets the purpose and intent of section 3.11, the Community Design Commission may approve such an alternative design as part of a certificate of\nappropriateness.\n3.11.2. District Character.\n3.11.2.1. Districts and Frontages.\nA. District summary. The Blue Hill District is a vital node of living, shopping and working, centrally located between downtown Chapel Hill and Durham. The Form District ensures that this essential\nhub is able to reach its full potential as both a destination and a community. The regulations support residential and mixed uses at varying levels of intensity, all of which will combine to foster a\nlively and engaging street environment easily accessible to pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders and automobile users.\nB. District intent. This Form District is intended to implement the Ephesus Church Road/Fordham Boulevard Small Area Plan. Specifically, the Blue Hill District provides the implementation\nmechanism for the citizen-endorsed vision for the project area, which is a more dense, walkable urban environment with balanced access for all modes of travel.\nC. Subdistricts established. In order to implement the vision of the Ephesus Church Road/Fordham Boulevard Focus Area Plan, the following subdistricts have been established and are depicted on\nthe Regulating Plan in section 3.11.2.2.\n1. Walkable Residential (WR-). The Walkable Residential Subdistrict is intended to create residential neighborhoods with a mix of housing types, together with civic buildings and open space\nessential to creating neighborhoods. The Walkable Residential Subdistricts are differentiated by the maximum building height permitted.\na. WR-3: maximum height limit of three (3) stories (forty-five (45) feet).\nb. WR-7: maximum height limit of seven (7) stories (ninety (90) feet).\nD.\nFrontages established. Frontages are established in this code to apply certain standards for development along all thoroughfares in the district, both existing and proposed. All public\nthoroughfare frontages shall be assigned one of the frontage types defined in this code.\n1. Type A Frontage. The Type A Frontage is intended for areas where the highest level of walkability is desired. The Frontage creates a \"main street\" environment with buildings pulled up to the\nstreet edge. Type A frontage is differentiated into Type A-1, Type A-2, and Type A-3 to provide three different levels of build-to-zone coverage, sidewalk width, and setback criteria. Type A\nfrontages are generally appropriate for Collector Streets, Local Streets, and District Streets.\n2. Type B Frontage. The Type B Frontage is intended for areas adjacent to major streets where pushing buildings back creates a quiet pedestrian setting at the building. While buildings are\nallowed to be pulled up to the street edge, they may also be set back behind one or two rows of head-in or angle parking served by a single drive aisle.\n3. Type C Frontage. Streets with significant traffic volumes that are not conducive to sustained pedestrian activity have been designated with a Type C Frontage.\n52 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n"}, {"page": "53", "text": "Chapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n4. Type D Frontage. The Type D Frontage is appropriate for Alleys that are shared between sites and provide residents and businesses access to garages, parking decks, loading docks and service\nareas. An alley used to satisfy the maximum block length requirement shall meet the assigned frontage requirement.\n5. Type E Frontage. The Type E Frontage is intended for non-vehicular thoroughfares where development fronts on a multiuse path corridor and/or a significant natural feature.\n6. The Regulating Plan shows assigned frontages for existing streets and some proposed streets in the district. Frontages along all new thoroughfares west of Fordham Boulevard not otherwise\nshown in the Regulating Plan are assigned as Type A-1. Frontages along all new thoroughfares south of Europa Drive, least of 15-501, and north of Ephesus Church Road not otherwise shown\nin the Regulating Plan are assigned as Type A-1. Frontages along all new thoroughfares south of Ephesus Church Road and east of Fordham Boulevard not otherwise identified in the\nRegulating Plan are assigned as Type A-2. Frontages along any new thoroughfares north of Europa Drive not otherwise identified in the Regulating Plan are assigned as Type A-2.\nFor new thoroughfares not shown on the Regulating Plan, the town manager may assign a different frontage other than what is described in the preceding paragraph where one of the\nfollowing applies:\na. Because there are Type A-1 and/or Type A-2 Frontages on other sides of the development parcel;\nb. To protect sensitive natural areas or save healthy existing trees;\nC. To protect natural conditions, such as watercourses, riparian buffers, natural rock formations or topography;\nd. Due to the presence of existing utilities or other easements;\ne. For traffic safety, site distance considerations, intersection spacing, or intersection alignment and/or adequate site distance;\nf. Because there are no other options for ingress and egress;\ng. To provide greater consistency with pedestrian infrastructure, building placement and/or streetscape on adjoining lots and/or the opposite side of the street; or\nh. Because an alternative designation of frontage would promote greater consistency with the overall objectives of the district.\n7. Corner lot application of frontage.\na. Where a corner lot has two different assigned frontages, the more restrictive frontage requirement shall apply to the assigned frontage, and must be continued for a minimum of seventy-\nfive (75) feet around the corner, measured from the intersection of the two (2) right-of-way lines.\nb. Where a corner lot has the same assigned frontage on two (2) or more sides, the town manager shall designate one (1) side of the lot as the primary frontage where one (1) of the following\napplies:\ni. To provide greater consistency with pedestrian infrastructure, building placement and/or streetscape on adjoining lots and/or the opposite side of the street.\nii. Because of a condition where a longer frontage on a development parcel promotes consistent pedestrian character; or\niii. Because the frontage designation would promote greater walkability and support the overall objectives of the district as described in section 3.11.1.\nThe assigned frontage requirements shall apply to that primary frontage, and must be continued along all other frontages for a minimum of seventy-five (75) feet around the corner,\nmeasured from the intersection of the two (2) right-of-way lines.\nC. Any frontages not designated as the primary frontage shall be deemed secondary lot frontages, and shall meet at least one half (1/2) of the minimum Build-to-zone percentage requirement\nof the underlying frontages unless a design alternative is approved by the community design commission.\n3.11.2.2. Regulating Plan.\nThe Walkable Residential (WR-), Walkable Mixed Use (WX-) subdistricts are identified and located on the Town of Chapel Hill Official Zoning Map. The Regulating Plan is intended to show the general areas\nof\neach subdistrict and associated road frontage(s). Additional street right-of-way or public easement may be required at the time of development, in accordance with the Ephesus Church/Fordham\nBoulevard Small Area Plan, the Ephesus Fordham District Illustrative Block Studies, the Ephesus Fordham sections of the Mobility and Connectivity Plan and this section 3.11.\n-\nFrontage\n[The image of the map above is revised to show a Type A-2 frontage in (purple) along the north side of Franklin Street, the south side of Legion Road extension, the north side of Legion Road, both\nsides of Europa Drive and both sides of the new/proposed street that crosses Elliott Road extending from Franklin Street eastward to the new/proposed street that parallels the Booker Creek\ngreenway. The Type A frontage previously shown is now labelled as Type A-1 frontage. No changes are made to Type C frontage.]\n3.11.2.3. Walkable Residential (WR-3 and WR-7).\nDevelopment in the Walkable Residential Subdistricts that meets the Enhanced Development Option conditions as specified in Section 3.11.1.2.C. shall be subject to the following standards:\n1.

A minimum of ten (10) percent of any outdoor amenity space requirement must occur on the development site; however, up to ninety (90) percent of the outdoor amenity\nspace requirement may, with the approval of the town manager, be met through payment of a fee in-lieu to the town. The amount of the payment is the product of the amount of outdoor\namenity space required multiplied by a dollar amount established by the town council annually as part of the budget process. The applicant must make the payment before issuance of a form\ndistrict permit, provided, however, that the town manager may allow phasing of payments consistent with the approved phasing of the development.\n3. Greenway alternative. Form District development applications for sites that include any land which overlaps a portion of a proposed greenway shown on the town's adopted Greenway Master\nPlan must be designed to accommodate the extension of that greenway in accordance with the Greenway Master Plan. A developer's financial obligation to contribute to the dedication and\nconstruction of the greenway is based on the formulas for calculation of amenity space and recreation space provided in this section 3.11.2.7. Land dedicated for a public pedestrian and non-\nmotorized vehicle easement or deeded to the town along the greenway may be substituted for required improved outdoor amenity or recreation space, where deemed acceptable by the\ntown manager.\n4. Standards.\na. The minimum size of outdoor amenity space is the number of square feet derived by multiplying the net land area of the development by the applicable ratio shown for the zoning district.\nb. Outdoor amenity space may be met in one contiguous open area or in multiple open areas on the lot and must meet minimum dimensions described as follows:\ni. Where not located adjacent to a building, or where located adjacent to a building that is three stories in height or less, an outdoor amenity space must be at least 20 feet in width and\nlength.\nii.\nWhere located adjacent to a building that is four stories in height or greater, the outdoor amenity space shall have greater dimensions, such that the space is in proportion to the\nassociated building, provides a comfortable scale for pedestrians, and invites public use and enjoyment. In no case shall the area of a single outdoor amenity space be required to\nexceed the minimum outdoor amenity space ratio as specified for the Subdistrict.\niii. Where located in the build-to zone and used to create inviting space along a street facing fa\u00e7ade, the width of the outdoor amenity space measured perpendicular to the right-of-way\nmay be less than the dimension prescribed above, subject to approval of a design alternative.\nC. Outdoor amenity space must be adjacent or adjoining a public right-of way, greenway, or publicly accessible thoroughfare, and must be within one-half story in elevation of the adjoining\npublic walkway except under the following circumstances:\ni. An administrative adjustment is provided due to unusual topographical or environmental conditions of the site.\nii. A design alternative is approved for outdoor amenity space to be within two stories in elevation of the adjoining public walkway. A rooftop amenity space must be highly visible from\nthe adjoining public walkway and must have an easily identified route of public access, including provision of ADA access.\nd. Outdoor amenity space may be counted to meet the build-to-zone percentage requirements; however, only half the width of the applicable outdoor amenity space can be counted toward\nthe required percentage.\n65 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n"}, {"page": "66", "text": "Chapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\ne. Where pedestrian connectivity requirements are met through spaces between buildings, any portions meeting all requirements of this section 3.11.2.7.F.4 may qualify as outdoor amenity\nspace.\nf. Outdoor amenity space cannot be parked or driven upon, except for emergency access and permitted temporary events.\ng. Outdoor amenity spaces may include but not be limited to:\ni.

Any streetscape components located within the public right-of-way; and\nii. Any landscaping internal to or screening a parking lot.\ni. The requirement for outdoor amenity space may also be met by means of a design alternative approved by the Community Design Commission where the space is located on a parcel\nother than the subject property, no further than eight hundred (800) feet from the subject parcel and within the boundaries of the Blue Hill District. This provision is intended to allow the\naggregation of outdoor amenity space to create larger, publically accessible areas.\nG. Recreation space.\n1.\nIn general. Active, improved outdoor space must be provided for common active recreational use by residents of multifamily or mixed use developments.\n2. Fee alternative. In lieu of providing recreation space, an applicant may, with the approval of the town manager, make a payment to the town whereby the town may acquire or develop\nrecreation land or greenways to serve the development. A minimum of fifty (50) percent of the required recreation space must be met through a payment in lieu. The amount of the payment\nis the product of the amount of recreational space required multiplied by a dollar amount established by the town council annually as part of the budget process. The applicant must make the\npayment before issuance of a Form District permit, provided, however, that the town manager may allow phasing of payments consistent with the approved phasing of the development.\n3. Greenway alternative. Form District development applications for sites that include any land which overlaps a portion of a proposed greenway shown on the town's adopted Greenway Master\nPlan must be designed to accommodate the extension of that greenway in accordance with the Greenway Master Plan. A developer's financial obligation to contribute to the dedication and\nconstruction of the greenway is based on the formulas for calculation of amenity space and recreation space provided in section 3.11.2.7. Land dedicated for a public pedestrian and non-\nmotorized vehicle easement or deeded to the town along the greenway may be substituted for required improved outdoor amenity or recreation space, where deemed acceptable by the\ntown manager.\n4. Standards.\na. The minimum size of active recreation space is the number of square feet derived by multiplying gross land area of the development by the applicable ratio shown for the zoning district\nand building height. Where a development contains residential and nonresidential uses, this standard applies only to the residential portion of the building. The land area used for\napplying the ratio described above is calculated based on the proportion of residential floor area.\nb. Recreation space not provided as a Fee or Greenway Alternative shall be provided on-site at ground level, at the perimeter lot line of the site.\nC. Recreation space shall be unobstructed above by any building elements. Canopies, coverings, or other roofs incidental to the intended use or purpose of the recreation space may be\nconsidered as unobstructed above.\nd. A pedestrian connection shall be provided between a recreation space and an adjoining public sidewalk or greenway.\ne.\nA pedestrian connection shall be provided between a recreation space and at least one area provided for outdoor amenity space.\nH. Building setbacks.\n1. There are three types of building setbacks-front, side interior and rear.\n2. Front setbacks are measured from the edge of the nearest right-of-way line.\n3.\nSide interior setbacks are measured from the side property line or the edge of the right-of-way where applicable.\n4. Rear setbacks are measured from the rear property line or the edge of the right-of-way where applicable.\n5. When the side interior or rear setback is zero (0) or five (5) feet, the building or structure must be placed on the side or rear property line or be placed a minimum of five (5) feet from the side\nor rear property line or the edge of the right-of-way line where applicable.\n6. The town manager will determine the application of front, side and rear setbacks to any irregularly-shaped lot.\nI. Build-to Requirements.\n1.\nThe build-to zone is the area on the lot where a certain percentage of the front building fa\u00e7ade must be located, measured as a minimum and maximum setback range from the edge of the\nright-of-way.\n2.

The maximum upper story floor plate area shall be based on the conditioned floor area measured for the ground story and applies at the fourth story and above.\nWhere multiple stories are subject to the floor plate area requirement, both an average upper story and maximum upper story floor plate area apply.\na.\nBonus. An upper story bonus is permitted for a building or a site that includes a non-residential use as listed in the Permitted Use Table under 3.11.3.4. Where non-residential square\nfootage is required under Section 3.11.3.5.A.4, the bonus described in this subsection is only available for square footage that exceeds the minimum required. For each square foot of non-\nresidential use provided, the floor plate area of an upper story may increase by one (1) square foot in excess of the average upper story and maximum upper story floor plate, subject to\nprovision of a twenty (20) foot building step back in accordance with Section 3.11.2.7.T.2.b.\n2.\nBuilding Step Back. The building step back shall be measured as the horizontal change in the building wall plane, perpendicular to the applicable frontage or property line.\na.\nIn addition to applicable frontages, a ten (10) foot building step back above the second or third floor is also required for buildings four (4) stories or greater at the boundary of the Form\nDistrict.\nb. A twenty (20) foot building step back above the second or third floor is required for the primary street frontage of a building that utilizes an upper story bonus in accordance with Section\n3.11.2.7.T.1.a. A building fa\u00e7ade located outside of the build-to zone remains subject to this requirement.\nC. A building step back is not required where a street-facing fa\u00e7ade is located at the maximum setback line or outside of the maximum setback, and is not the primary frontage of a building\nthat utilizes an upper story bonus, or where a building fa\u00e7ade facing the Form District boundary is located more than twenty (20) feet from the boundary.\n3. Module Offset. The module offset shall be measured as the horizontal change of a portion of the building wall plane at ground level, perpendicular to the applicable frontage. The module\nwidth shall be measured for the portion of the wall plane closer to the sidewalk, while the width of offset shall be measured for the portion further from the sidewalk. The dimensions of\nmodules and offsets should maintain a sense of proportion to the building as a whole.\na. Offset areas may count towards a build-to zone requirement when the area meets the criteria for a forecourt, outdoor amenity space, or outdoor dining area.\nb.\nA module offset is not required where a building fa\u00e7ade is located at the maximum setback line or outside of the maximum setback.\n4.\nThe Community Design Commission may approve a design alternative for mass variation, where a building exhibits varied heights, smaller building masses and/or articulated facades that\nprovide a positive visual impact and a sense of scale in the public realm.\nU. Building Footprint, Width, and Depth.\n1. Maximum Building Dimensions.\na.\nMaximum building width and secondary wing width are measured parallel to the primary frontage for each site.\nb. Maximum building depth and secondary wing depth are measured perpendicular to the primary frontage for each site, and apply to side facades. A building and wing must adjoin portions\nof the public realm for the full measurement of their depth.\nC.\nA secondary wing, if included, shall be appended to the rear of the building to create an extension of the building's depth. The wing may not be configured to increase the maximum\nbuilding width. The depth of the wing shall be measured starting at the point where the building footprint exceeds the baseline maximum depth.\nd. A Wrapped Parking Configuration is one where the building is integrated with structured parking and where the building fully screens at least two (2) sides of the parking structure from\nview as follows:\n70 of 89\n3/20/24, 00:44\n"}, {"page": "71", "text": "Chapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\ni.\nthe building shall fully screen the side along the primary frontage.\nii. where the site has additional frontages, the building shall fully screen at least one other side along a frontage.\niii. if the above are not met, the footprint must meet the standards of a different Building Configuration.\ne. The maximum dimensions for Structured Parking are applicable to any configuration of structured parking, including standalone, wrapped, and podium configurations, except that the\ndimensions are not applicable to portions of the structured parking below grade.\nf.\nThe maximum building width and/or depth may be increased by five percent (5%) through an administrative adjustment where one or more of the following applies:\ni. Based on some unusual aspect of the development site or the proposed development that is not shared by landowners generally within the Blue Hill district (e.g., unusual lot size,\nconfiguration, or surrounding parcelization patterns);\nii. Based on design considerations due to existing or proposed utilities or easements;\niii. Based on design considerations for the accommodation of life safety, ingress or egress requirements.\niv. Based on design considerations associated with the provision of public space in excess of the minimum requirements, and/or in support of a walkable public realm.\n2. Building Separation.\na. Multiple buildings may be constructed on a lot provided that each building or aggregation of buildings meets the maximum building dimensions.\nb.\nWhere required, the minimum separation between two (2) buildings on a lot shall be the distance between building facades measured parallel to the street frontage.\nC.\nUnbuilt area used to meet building separation requirements shall be configured for Pedestrian Connectivity as defined in section 3.11.2.7.S.\nd. Service drives and vehicular access may be provided between buildings. The roadway width shall not count towards meeting the minimum building separation unless the town manager\ndetermines that it functions effectively as shared pedestrian-vehicular space.\ne. Multiple buildings arranged such that their combined width and/or depth does not exceed the maximum applicable dimensions shall not be subject to Building Separation requirements.\n3.11.2.8 Conventional Development.\nDevelopment in the Form District that meets the Conventional conditions as specified in Section 3.11.1.2.C. shall be subject to the following standards:\n1. Lot\nA\nOutdoor amenity space is a ratio of net land area.\nRecreation space, Residential density, and Floor area ratio are ratios of gross land area.\n2.

Use Requirements.\n3.11.3.1. Permitted Uses.\nA. A lot or building must be occupied with only the principal uses permitted on the permitted use table in section. 3.11.3.4. Accessory uses and structures are permitted in conjunction with a\npermitted principal use.\nB. Any one (1) or more uses permitted in a Form District may be established on any lot within the subdistrict, subject to the permitted use table, and in compliance with all other applicable\nrequirements of Section 3.11.\n3.11.3.2. Accessory Uses.\nA.\nAccessory uses and structures must be accessory and clearly incidental and subordinate to a permitted principal use or building.\nB. No accessory use or structure may be established prior to the establishment of a permitted principal use or building.\nC. The town manager is authorized to determine when a use or structure is accessory. In order to classify a use or structure as accessory, the town manager must determine that the use or\nstructure:\n1. Is subordinate to the principal use or building in terms of area, extent and purpose;\n2.\nContributes to the comfort, convenience or necessity of occupants of the principal use or building served;\n3. Is located on the same lot as the principal use or building, or on a contiguous lot in the same ownership;\n4. Does not involve operations not in keeping with the character of the principal use or building served; and\n5.\nIs not of a nature likely to attract visitors in larger numbers than would normally be expected for the principal use or building.\nD.\nAll accessory structures must meet the dimensional requirements applicable to a principal structure in the subdistrict.\nE. Food trucks must comply with Section 6.20 of the Land Use Management Ordinance.\n3.11.3.3. Classification of Uses.\nA. In order to regulate use, categories of uses have been established in Section 3.11.3.5, providing a systematic basis for assigning land uses to appropriate categories with other similar uses. Use\ncategories classify land uses and activities based on common functional, product or physical characteristics.\nB. The town manager is responsible for categorizing all uses into the use categories in Section 3.11.3.5. When determining the use category in which a proposed use fits, the town manager must\nconsider the following criteria:\n1. The actual or projected characteristics of the proposed use.\n2. The relative amount of site area or floor area and equipment devoted to the proposed use.\n3. Relative amounts of sales.\n4. The customer type.\n5. The relative number of employees.\n6. Hours of operation.\n7. Building and site arrangement.\n8. Types of vehicles used and their parking requirements.\n9. The number of vehicle trips generated.\n10. How the proposed use is advertised.\n11. The likely impact on surrounding properties.\n12. Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other activities on the site.\nC. Where a use not listed is found by the town manager not to be similar to any other permitted use, the use is not permitted.\n3.11.3.4. Permitted Use Table.\nUses permitted by subdistrict are shown below. Broad use categories have been established in order to regulate a variety of similar uses and are defined in Section 3.11.3.5. Customary accessory and\ntemporary categories, as determined by the town manager, are permitted in the Form Districts, including, but not limited to, home occupations, food trucks and trailers, and outdoor seasonal sales, subject\nto issuance of a Zoning Compliance Permit.\n74 of 89\n3/20/24,00:44\nCELL (1, 1): \nPERMITTED USES\nCELL (1, 2): \nWR-3\nCELL (1, 3): \nWR-7\nCELL (1, 4): \nWX-5\nCELL (1, 5): \nWX-7\nCELL (1, 6): \nDef./Stds.\nCELL (2, 1): \nResidential Uses\nCELL (2, 2): \nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nCELL (2, 5): \nCELL (2, 6): \nCELL (3, 1): \nHousehold living, as listed below:\nCELL (3, 2): \nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (3, 4): \nCELL (3, 5): \nCELL (3, 6): \nSec. 3.11.3.5.A\nCELL (4, 1): \nDetached living\nCELL (4, 2): \n-\nCELL (4, 3): \n-\nCELL (4, 4): \n-\nCELL (4, 5): \n-\nCELL (4, 6): \nSec. 3.11.3.5.A.1.a\nCELL (5, 1): \nAttached living\nCELL (5, 2): \nP\nCELL (5, 3): \nP\nCELL (5, 4): \nL\nCELL (5, 5): \nL\nCELL (5, 6): \nSec. 3.11.3.5.A.1.b\nCELL (6, 1): \nMultifamily living\nCELL (6, 2): \nP\nCELL (6, 3): \nP\nCELL (6, 4): \nL\nCELL (6, 5): \nL\nCELL (6, 6): \nSec. 3.11.3.5.A.1.c\nCELL (7, 1): \nGroup living\nCELL (7, 2): \n-\nCELL (7, 3): \nP\nCELL (7, 4): \nL\nCELL (7, 5): \nL\nCELL (7, 6): \nSec. 3.11.3.5.A.2\nCELL (8, 1): \nSocial service living\nCELL (8, 2): \n-\nCELL (8, 3): \n-\nCELL (8, 4): \nS+\nCELL (8, 5): \nS+\nCELL (8, 6): \nSec. 3.11.3.5.A.3\nCELL (9, 1): \nShort-Term Rental, Primary Residence\nCELL (9, 2): \nP\nCELL (9, 3): \nP\nCELL (9, 4): \nP\nCELL (9, 5): \nP\nCELL (9, 6): \nSec. 3.11.3.5.A.5\nCELL (10, 1): \nShort-Term Rental, Dedicated\nCELL (10, 2): \nP\nCELL (10, 3): \nP\nCELL (10, 4): \nP\nCELL (10, 5): \nP\nCELL (10, 6): \nSec. 3.11.3.5.A.5\n"}, {"page": "75", "text": "Chapel Hill, NC Code of Ordinances\nKEY:\nP = Use permitted under any of the following circumstances:\n1.

Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish minimum stormwater performance criteria, management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and\nwelfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. This section seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:\n1. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding, siltation and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels;\n2. Minimize increases in non-point source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development that would otherwise degrade local water quality;\n3. Minimize the total volume of surface water runoff that flows from any specific site during and following development in order to replicate the pre-development hydrology to the maximum\nextent practicable;\n4.\nReduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and non-point source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management controls and to ensure that these\nmanagement controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety;\n5. Meet the requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES Phase 2) regulations as established by the Clean Water Act and administered by the North Carolina\nDepartment of Natural Resources, or its successor agency; and\n6. Control nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment and help protect the water supply uses of Jordan Lake.\nC. Applicability.\n1.\nThis section applies to all new development and redevelopment projects for which a form district permit is required. No development or redevelopment for which a form district permit is\nrequired pursuant to this section shall occur except in compliance with the provisions, conditions, and limitations of the permit.\n2.
