Find the\nrow that lists the group of uses or specific use you've identified. Match this row to your district (across\nthe top of the table) to determine if the use you want to establish is permitted. To determine if the use\nyou've identified is part of group of uses go to $2.3, Use Interpretation.\nSTEP 4:\nIf your use is permitted, before building the structure or establishing the use, you must\nget the appropriate permits approved (see Article 9). For details on minimum lot size and required yards\n(setbacks) see $2.4. For specific use standards see Article 4. The use may also be subject to the general\nstandards in Article 3 and the natural resource protection standards in Article 7.\nSTEP 5:\nDon't forget that the overlay districts established in $2.5 may apply to your\nproperty. These requirements are intended to help you and the County ensure that your project is legally\nestablished and that it matches the development vision that Lincoln County, as a community, desires.\nYou should also review any applicable design guidelines for other applicable development information.\nIF YOU WANT TO BUILD OR ESTABLISH A PARTICULAR USE:\nFollow Steps 1 through 5 above, to identify your zoning district and the permitted uses. You can find the\nspecific details for the permitted uses in your zoning district in either Article 3 or Article 12. You can\nalso find the various development standards that apply to your property in Article 3 and Article 5.\nIF YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR ZONING DISTRICT:\nOnly the Board of Commissioners may rezone property - following public notice and hearings. See $9.4,\nRezonings, for details on the procedure.\nIF YOU WANT TO SUBDIVIDE YOUR PROPERTY:\nProperty can only be subdivided in accordance with $9.6, Subdivision Review.\n"}, {"page": "4", "text": "This page left intentionally blank\n"}, {"page": "5", "text": "CONTENTS\nARTICLE 1.

Unless consented to in\nby the petitioner in writing, the County may not require, enforce, or\nincorporate into the zoning regulations or permit requirements any condition\nor requirement not authorized by otherwise applicable law, including, without\nlimitation, taxes, impact fees, building design elements within the scope of\nG.S. 160D-702(b), driveway-related improvements in excess of those allows\nin G.S. 136-18(29), or other unauthorized limitations on development or use\nof land.\n2.\nA conditional zoning district may provide for greater but not lesser setbacks\nthan those applicable to the corresponding general use district, and may\nspecify that only one or some of the uses allowed (either on a permitted or a\nspecial use basis) in the general use district are allowed in the conditional\nzoning district.\nE.\nEffect of Approval; Zoning Map Designation\nIf a petition for a conditional zoning district is approved, the development and use\nof the property shall be governed by the UDO requirements applicable to the\ndistrict's zoning classification, the approved site plan for the district, and any\nadditional approved rules, regulations, and conditions, all of which shall constitute\nthe zoning regulations for the approved district and are binding on the property as\nan amendment to these regulations and to the Zoning Map. Following the approval\nof the petition for a conditional zoning district, the subject property shall be\nidentified on the Zoning Map by the appropriate district designation preceded by\nthe letters CZ (i.e., CZ B-G).\nF.\nModifications to Conditional Zoning Districts\n1.\nMinor changes in a conditional zoning district may be approved by the\nDirector, provided such changes will not:\n(a)\nAlter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent\nproperty;\n(b) Alter the uses permitted or increase the density or intensity of\ndevelopment; or\n(c) Change the boundaries of the approved site.\n(d) Substantially change the vehicular access or circulation.\n(e) Substantially change the location of principal or accessory structures, or\nthe location or size of open space and recreation facilities.\nUnified Development Ordinance\nEffective 8/31/2009\nLincoln County, North Carolina\n2-5\n"}, {"page": "22", "text": "$2.1 Districts Established\nArticle 2.

A cluster residential subdivision involves\nplacing a cluster of home sites within a portion of the development site, allowing\nhousing units on smaller lots than those permitted in a conventional residential\nsubdivision to promote environmental sensitivity, make more efficient use of the\nland and provide additional common recreation and open space. Cluster\nsubdivision development is encouraged by Lincoln County in the form of these\nflexible design and maximum density provisions. Other purposes of a cluster\nresidential subdivision include the following:\n1.\nTo preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as\ngroundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and\nwildlife habitat.\n2.\nTo preserve important historic and archaeological sites.\n3.\nTo permit clustering of houses and structures in a manner that will reduce the\namount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements,\nnecessary for residential development.\n4.\nTo reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and\nremoval of vegetation in residential development.\n5.\nTo promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the\ncommunity, and create contiguous green space within and adjacent to\ndevelopment sites.\n6.\nTo protect scenic views.\nUnified Development Ordinance\nEffective 8/31/2009\nLincoln County, North Carolina\n2-25\nCELL (1, 1): \nR-MF\nCELL (1, 2): \nSingle-\nfamily\nDetached\nCELL (1, 3): \nZero\nLot Line\nCELL (1, 4): \nAlley-\nloaded\nCELL (1, 5): \nTwo-family\nCELL (1, 6): \nTownhouse(1)\nCELL (1, 7): \nMulti-family(1)\nCELL (2, 1): \nUse\nCELL (2, 2): \nPermitted\nCELL (2, 3): \nNot Permitted\nCELL (2, 4): \nNot Permitted\nCELL (2, 5): \nNot Permitted\nCELL (2, 6): \nPermitted\nCELL (2, 7): \nSpecial Use\nCELL (3, 1): \nDensity (max. units/acre)\nCELL (3, 2): \n--\nCELL (3, 3): \nCELL (3, 4): \nCELL (3, 5): \nCELL (3, 6): \n6\nCELL (3, 7): \n8\nCELL (4, 1): \nSite (min.)\nArea (acres)\nRecreation/open space (sq. ft.)\nCELL (4, 2): \nNone\nN/A\nCELL (4, 3): \nCELL (4, 4): \nCELL (4, 5): \nCELL (4, 6): \n4\nN/A\nCELL (4, 7): \n4\nN/A\nCELL (5, 1): \nParcel (min. sq. ft.)\nArea per building\nCELL (5, 2): \n--\nCELL (5, 3): \nCELL (5, 4): \nCELL (5, 5): \nCELL (5, 6): \nCELL (5, 7): \nCELL (6, 1): \nLot (min.)\nLot area (sq. ft.)\nLot width (ft.)\nWater/sewer, public\nCELL (6, 2): \n43,560\n100\nRequired\nCELL (6, 3): \nCELL (6, 4): \nCELL (6, 5): \nCELL (6, 6): \nSet by Special Use\nProcess\nCELL (6, 7): \nSet by Special\nUse Process\nCELL (7, 1): \nYards (min. ft.)\nRoad yard\nSide yard (interior)\nSide yard (total)\nSide yard (road)\nRear yard\nCELL (7, 2): \n20\n6\n12\n10\n20\nCELL (7, 3): \nCELL (7, 4): \nCELL (7, 5): \nCELL (7, 6): \nSet by Special Use\nProcess\nCELL (7, 7): \nSet by Special\nUse Process\nCELL (8, 1): \nBulk (max.)\nHeight (ft.)\nBuilding coverage\nImpervious surface\nCELL (8, 2): \n35\n35%\n60%\nCELL (8, 3): \nCELL (8, 4): \nCELL (8, 5): \nCELL (8, 6): \nSet by Special Use\nProcess\nCELL (8, 7): \nSet by Special\nUse Process\n"}, {"page": "42", "text": "$2.4 General Use District Standards\nArticle 2.
