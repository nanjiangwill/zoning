section for a development project is effective upon filing of the application in accordance with N.C.G.S. \u00a7\n143-755, for so long as the permit remains valid pursuant to law. Unless otherwise specified by this section or other statute, local development permits expire one year after issuance\nunless work authorized by the permit has substantially commenced. For the purposes of this section, a permit is issued either in the ordinary course of business of the Town or by the\napplicable governmental agency as a court directive.\nExcept where a longer vesting period is provided by statute or this Ordinance, the statutory vesting granted by this section, once established, expires for an uncompleted development\nproject if development work is intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than 24 consecutive months, and the statutory vesting period granted by this section for\na\nnonconforming use of property expires if the use is intentionally and voluntarily discontinued for a period of not less than 24 consecutive months. The 24-month discontinuance period is\nautomatically tolled during the pendency of any Town appeal proceeding or civil action in a State or federal trial or appellate court regarding the validity of a development permit, the use\nof the property, or the existence of the statutory vesting period granted by this section. The 24-month discontinuance period is also tolled during the pendency of any litigation involving\nthe development project or property that is the subject of the vesting.\n4-36 Multiple Permits for Development Project\nWhere multiple Town development permits are required to complete a development project, the development permit applicant may choose the version of each of the Town land\ndevelopment regulations applicable to the project upon submittal of the application for the initial development permit. This provision is applicable only for those subsequent development\npermit applications filed within 18 months of the date following the approval of an initial permit. For purposes of the vesting protections of this section, an erosion and sedimentation\ncontrol permit or a sign permit is not an initial development permit.\n4-37 Multi-Phased Development\nA multi-phased development is vested for the entire development with the land development regulations then in place at the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of\nthe multi-phased development. A right which has been vested as provided for in this subsection remains vested for a period of seven years from the time a site plan approval is granted for\nthe initial phase of the multi-phased development.\n4-38 Continuing Review\nFollowing issuance of a development permit, the Town may make subsequent inspections and reviews to ensure compliance with the applicable land development regulations in effect\nat the time of the original application.\n4-39 Process to Claim Vested Rights\nA person claiming a statutory or common law vested right may submit information to substantiate that claim to the Land Use Administrator who shall make an initial determination as\nto\nthe existence of the vested right. The decision of the Land Use Administrator may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment. On appeal, the existence of a vested right shall be reviewed\nde novo. In lieu of seeking such a determination or pursuing an appeal, a person claiming a vested right may bring an original civil action as provided by N.C.G.S. \u00a7 160D-1403.1.\n4-40 Miscellaneous Provisions\nThe vested rights granted by this section run with the land except for the use of land for outdoor advertising governed by N.C.G.S. 136-131.1 and N.C.G.S. \u00a7 136-131.2 in which case the\nrights granted by this section run with the owner of a permit issued by the North Carolina Department of Transportation.

GENERAL\n5-1 Requests to be Heard Expeditiously\nAs provided in Section 4-17, the Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide all appeals of administrative decisions made by staff and variance requests as expeditiously as possible,\nconsistent with the need to follow regularly established agenda procedures, provide notice in accordance with Article 6, and obtain the necessary information to make sound decisions.\nPART II. APPEALS OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS\n5-2 Appeal of Administrative Decisions\n5-2.1 Applicability. Appeals of decisions made by the Land Use Administrator or his/her deputy or staff under this Ordinance shall be made to the Board of Adjustment. Appeals shall\nbe heard by the Board of Adjustment, in compliance with the quasi-judicial processes set forth herein.\n5-2.2\nStanding. Any person who has standing or the Town may appeal an administrative decision to the Board of Adjustment. An appeal is taken by filing a notice of appeal with the\nClerk to the Board. The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for the appeal.\n5-2.3 Time to Appeal. The owner or other party shall have 30 days from receipt of the written notice of the determination within which to file an appeal. Any other person with\nstanding to appeal shall have 30 days from receipt from any source of actual or constructive notice of the determination within which to file an appeal. In the absence of\nevidence to the contrary, notice given by first-class mail shall be deemed received on the third business day following deposit of the notice for mailing with the United States\nPostal Service.\n5-2.4 Record of Decision. The official who made the decision shall transmit to the Board of Adjustment all documents and exhibits constituting the record upon which the decision\nappealed from is taken. The official shall also provide a copy of the record to the appellant and to the owner of the property that is the subject of the appeal if the appellant is\nnot the owner.\n5-2.5 Stays. An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays enforcement of the action appealed from and accrual of any fines assessed unless the official who\nmade the decision certifies to the Board after notice of appeal has been filed that, because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property\nor, because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement of the development regulation. In that case, enforcement proceedings shall\nnot be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a court. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the official a request for an\nexpedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions\ngranting a development approval or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the development regulation shall not stay the further review of an\napplication for development approvals to use such property; in these situations, the appellant or Town may request and the Board may grant a stay of a final decision of\ndevelopment approval applications, including building permits affected by the issue being appealed.\n5-2.6 The Appeals of Decisions. Any appeal from the decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be made to Superior Court of Carteret County, in accordance with the provisions of\nN.C.G.S. \u00a7 160D-1402.\nPART III. VARIANCES\n5-3 - Procedure for Submitting an Application for a Variance\n5-3.1 Findings of Fact. When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of a requirement of this Ordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall vary the\nrequirement of this Ordinance upon a showing of all of the following:\n(A) Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the requirement. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no\nreasonable use can be made of the property.\n(B) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as\nhardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance. A variance may be granted\nwhen necessary and appropriate to make a reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act for a person with a disability.\n(C) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may\njustify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.\n(D) The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the regulation, such that public safety is secured and substantial justice is achieved.\n5-3.2 Appropriate conditions may be imposed on any variance, provided that the conditions are reasonably related to the variance.\n5-3.3 No change in permitted uses may be authorized by variance.\nARTICLE 6. QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURE\n6-1 Process Required.\nAll boards shall follow quasi-judicial procedures in determining appeals of administrative decisions, special use permits, certificates of appropriateness, variances, or any other quasi-\njudicial decision.\n34 of 235\n4/13/24, 12:43\n"}, {"page": "35", "text": "Morehead City, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n6-2 Notice of Hearing\n6-2.1 Advertised notice of hearing.

The notice shall be published the first\ntime not less than ten (10) days nor more than twenty-five (25) days before the date fixed for the hearing. In computing such period, the day of publication is not to be included\nbut the day of the hearing shall be included.\n6-2.2 Mailed notice of hearing. Notice of evidentiary hearings conducted pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 160D-406 shall be mailed to the person or entity whose appeal, application, or request\nis the subject of the hearing; to the owner of the property that is the subject of the hearing if the owner did not initiate the hearing; to the owners of all parcels of land abutting\nthe parcel of land that is the subject of the hearing; and to any other persons entitled to receive notice as provided by this development regulation. In the absence of evidence to\nthe contrary, the Town may rely on the County tax listings to determine owners of property entitled to mailed notice. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least ten (10)\ndays, but not more than twenty-five (25) days, prior to the date of the hearing. Within that same time period, the Town shall prominently post a notice of the hearing on the site\nthat is the subject of the hearing or on an adjacent street or highway right-of-way.\n6-3 Administrative Materials\nThe Land Use Administrator shall transmit to the Board all applications, reports, and written materials relevant to the matter being considered. The administrative materials may be\ndistributed to the members of the Board prior to the hearing if at the same time they are distributed to the Board a copy is also provided to the appellant or applicant and to the\nlandowner if that person is not the appellant or applicant.

Other witnesses may\npresent competent, material, and substantial evidence that is not repetitive as allowed by the Board.\n6-5 Objections\nObjections regarding jurisdictional and evidentiary issues, including, but not limited to, the timeliness of an appeal or the standing of a party, may be made to the Board. The Board\nchair shall rule on any objections, and the chair's rulings may be appealed to the full board. These rulings are also subject to judicial review pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 160D-1402. Objections\nbased on jurisdictional issues may be raised for the first time on judicial review.\n6-6 Appearance of Official New Issues\nThe official who made the decision or the person currently occupying that position, if the decision maker is no longer employed by the Town, shall be present at the evidentiary hearing\nas a witness. The appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated in a notice of appeal. If any party or the Town would be unduly prejudiced by the presentation of matters\nnot presented in the notice of appeal, the Board shall continue the hearing.\n6-7 - Modification of Application for Variance or Special Use Permit at Hearing\nIn response to questions or comments by persons appearing at the hearing or to suggestions or recommendations by the Board of Adjustment, the applicant may agree to modify his\napplication, including the plans and specifications submitted. Unless such modifications are so substantial or extensive that the Board cannot reasonably be expected to perceive the\nnature and impact of the proposed changes without revised plans before it, the Board of Adjustment may approve the application with the stipulation that the permit will not be issued\nuntil plans reflecting the agreed upon changes are submitted to the planning staff.\n6-8 Oaths\nThe chair of the Board or any member acting as chair and the clerk to the Board are authorized to administer oaths to witnesses in any matter coming before the Board. Any person\nwho, while under oath during a proceeding before the Board determining a quasi-judicial matter, willfully swears falsely is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\n6-9 Subpoenas\nThe Board making a quasi-judicial decision under this Ordinance through the chair or, in the chair's absence, anyone acting as chair may subpoena witnesses and compel the\nproduction of evidence. To request issuance of a subpoena, the applicant, the Town, and any person with standing may make a written request to the chair explaining why it is necessary\nfor certain witnesses or evidence to be compelled. The chair shall issue requested subpoenas he or she determines to be relevant, reasonable in nature and scope, and not oppressive.\nThe chair shall rule on any motion to quash or modify a subpoena. Decisions regarding subpoenas made by the chair may be immediately appealed to the full board.

INONCONFORMING SITUATIONS\n8-1 Intent\nThis section places restrictions on the use and development of land by establishing minimum standards. In many instances, land and improvements were developed or proposals for\nthe use of land were initiated prior to the adoption of this Ordinance. These uses may not meet the minimum standards contained in this Ordinance because they were developed under\nno specific standards or under standards which were less restrictive. The City Council recognizes that the strict application of these standards to such uses may create certain hardships for\nthe property owner. The City Council also recognizes that these uses may be allowed to continue in use in accordance with the spirit of this Ordinance even though not meeting the\nOrdinance standards. Therefore, the uses or situations described below are accorded a nonconforming status with all the specific privileges and limitations set forth to govern their\nexistence.\n8-2 Nonconforming Lots\nA nonconforming lot is a lot which does not conform to the size requirements of this Ordinance for the district in which it is located, either at the effective date of this Ordinance or as a\nresult of subsequent amendments which may be incorporated in this Ordinance.\nA nonconforming vacant lot may be used for any of the uses permitted by this Ordinance in the district in which it is located if the use of the lot meets the following standards:\n8-2.1 The minimum requirements for front, side and rear yards, height of structures, and unobstructed open space for the particular district must be met;\n8-2.2 Two-family and multifamily dwellings must meet the minimum lot standards in Section 13-1;\n8-2.3 The lot in question does not abut a lot which could be combined with it to make it conforming which is under common ownership;\n8-2.4 A legally recorded plat or deed shall be required prior to obtaining any building permits.\n8-3 Nonconforming Structures\nA nonconforming structure is a structure which does not meet the minimum requirements for area, front, side or rear yard setbacks, height requirements or which exceeds the\nallowable lot coverage for the district in which it is located. A nonconforming structure may be improved or expanded in accordance with the following standards:\n8-3.1 Any improvement or expansion of any nonconforming structure on sides meeting minimum setbacks must also comply with the minimum setback requirements of the\nOrdinance for front, side and rear yard for the district in which the lot is located. Improvements or expansion of any nonconforming structure on sides not meeting\nminimum setbacks may be allowed provided, the addition encroaches no closer to the property line than the existing (nonconforming) outside wall of the original structure.\nIn no case may maximum lot coverage or height limits be exceeded. Adding additional living space on a second floor within existing exterior dimensions is not considered as\nincreasing the nonconformity even if the exterior dimensions do not meet the current setback requirements.\n8-4 Reconstruction, Restoration, and Replacement of Damaged Nonconforming Structures\n8-4.1 No special use permit required from the Board of Adjustment. The rebuilding, reconstruction, restoration, or replacement of any zoning nonconforming structure which was\ndamaged or partially destroyed by: the exercise of eminent domain; man-caused acts such as fire, accident, explosion; or flood, lightning, wind, or other calamity or natural act,\ndoes not require a special use permit if all of the following are met:\n(A) The cost of rebuilding, reconstructing, or restoring is less than seventy-five (75) percent of the replacement cost of the original nonconformity as determined at the time such\ndamage or destruction occurred.\n(B) The nature and degree of the nonconforming use or structure is not expanded, changed, or increased from that which existed prior to the damage or destruction, except as\nprovided in Section 8-3.\n(C) A completed application for a building permit to substantially rebuild, reconstruct, or restore the nonconformity is submitted to the building inspections department within\none (1) year of the date the nonconformity was damaged or destroyed.\n8-4.2 Special use permit required from Board of Adjustment. The rebuilding, reconstruction, or restoration of any zoning nonconforming structure which was damaged or partially\ndestroyed by: the exercise of eminent domain; man-made acts such as fire, accident, explosion; or flood, lightning, wind, or other calamity or natural act, requires a special use\npermit from the Board of Adjustment if one (1) or more of the following apply.\n(A) The cost of rebuilding, reconstructing, and restoring is seventy-five (75) percent or more of the replacement cost of the original nonconformity as determined at the time\nsuch damage or destruction occurred.\n(B) A completed application for a building permit to substantially rebuild, reconstruct, or restore the nonconformity has not been submitted to the building inspection\ndepartment within one (1) year of the occurrence of the damage or destruction.\nPermission may be granted for the restoration of a nonconforming structure if the Board of Adjustment finds from the evidence that the provisions of Subsection 3-7.2 are met.\n37 of 235\n4/13/24, 12:43\n"}, {"page": "38", "text": "Morehead City, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\n8-5 Nonconforming Uses\nA nonconforming use is a use which existed prior to the adoption of this Ordinance or an amendment thereto, which would not be permitted by this Ordinance or an amendment\nthereto in the district in which it is located.

Any nonconforming use which has been visibly discontinued, unused, abandoned or ceased for a continuous period of one\nhundred eighty (180) days or more is not allowed thereafter to resume or restart. If a site where the nonconforming use has being (been) actively offered for sale during the 180-\nday period and has not been sold, the Land Use Administrator may grant one (1) additional 180-day continuance from the date the nonconforming use was visibly abandoned,\ndiscontinued, became unused, unoccupied, or ceased provided the request for extension was made prior to the expiration of the initial 180-day period. The only use permitted\nthereafter is a use which will conform to the use regulations in the zoning district.\n8-7 Expansion of Nonconforming Uses\nThe expansion, extension or alteration of a nonconforming use may be permitted if the Board of Adjustment issues a special use permit pursuant to Section 3-7.2.\n8-8 Change of Nonconforming Use\nThe change of an existing nonconforming use to another nonconforming use may be allowed by a special use permit issued by the Board of Adjustment, provided, however, that the\nnew use will have no greater adverse effect on the surrounding property than the existing use. Once a nonconforming use of a structure has been changed to a conforming use, there shall\nnot be a return to any nonconforming use.\n8-9 Changes in Zoning\nAny structure or use which becomes nonconforming as a result of a change in a zoning classification or district boundary or by a change in the provisions in the Ordinance will be\nsubject to the provisions of this section.\nARTICLE 9.

It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions\nwithin floodprone areas by provisions designed to:\n(A) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights\nor velocities;\n(B) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;\n(C) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;\n(1) Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and\n(2) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\n18-1.4 Objectives. The objectives of this Ordinance are:\n(A) To protect human life and health;\n(B) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\n(C)\nTo minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;\n(D) To minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;\n(E) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e. water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are located in floodprone\nareas;\n(F) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and\n(G) To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a special flood hazard area.\n18-2 Definitions\n18-2.1 See Article 2, Basic Definitions and Interpretations.\n18-3 General Provisions\n18-3.1 Lands to which this Ordinance applies.

The Special Flood Hazard Areas are those identified under the Cooperating Technical State (CTS) agreement between the\nState of North Carolina and FEMA in its FIS for the Town dated February 16, 1977, and May 15, 1980, and associated DFIRM panels, including any digital data developed as part of\nthe FIS, which are adopted by reference and declared a part of this ordinance, and all revisions thereto. The special flood hazard areas also include those defined through\nstandard engineering analysis for private developments or by governmental agencies, but which have not yet been incorporated in the FIRM. This includes, but is not limited to,\ndetailed flood data:\n(A) Generated as a requirement of Subsection 18-4.5(K) and (L) of this Ordinance;\n(B) Preliminary FIRMs where more stringent than the effective FIRM; or\n(C) Post-disaster flood recovery maps.\nIn addition, upon annexation to the Town of Morehead City or inclusion in the extra-territorial jurisdiction (ETJ), the special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency (FEMA) and/or produced under the Cooperating Technical State agreement between the State of North Carolina and FEMA as stated above for the\nunincorporated areas of Carteret County, with accompanying maps and other supporting data, and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of\nthis Ordinance.\n18-3.3\nEstablishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this Ordinance prior to the\ncommencement of any development activities within special flood hazard areas as determined in Subsection 18-3.2.\n18-3.4 Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, altered, or developed in any way without full compliance with the terms of this Ordinance and\nother applicable regulations.\n18-3.5 Abrogation and greater restriction.

Reasonable cost shall be defined as fifty (50) percent of the value that the\ndwelling or dwelling unit shall have after repair. The order may require that the property be vacated and closed only if continued occupancy during the time allowed for\nrepair will present a significant threat of bodily harm, taking into account the nature of the necessary repairs, alterations, or improvements; the current state of the\nproperty; and any additional risks due to the presence and capacity of minors under the age of 18 or occupants with physical or mental disabilities. The order shall state\nthat the failure to make timely repairs as directed in the order shall make the dwelling subject to the issuance of an unfit order under Section 23-21.1.\n(B) If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the dwelling cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the dwelling, the inspector will issue and order\nrequiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to remove or demolish the dwelling.\n23-19.3 Appeals/Remedies.\n(A) An appeal from any decision or order of the inspector is a quasi-judicial matter and may be taken by any person aggrieved thereby to the Board of Adjustment.

In that case the requirement is not\nsuspended except by a restraining order, which may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than one day's written notice to the inspector, by the Board, or by a court\nof record upon petition made pursuant to Section 23-19.5 herein.\n(D) The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for hearing appeals, shall give due notice to the parties, and shall render its decision within a reasonable time.

The clerk of\nsuperior court shall issue a summons requiring the defendant to appear before a magistrate at a certain time, date, and place not to exceed 10 days from the issuance of the summons\nto answer the complaint. The summons and complaint shall be served as provided in G.S. 42-29.

Subject to the length of the agenda and complexity of the application, late submittals may be placed on the meeting agenda with the approval of the\nLand Use Administrator. The Administrator of this Ordinance shall be responsible for presenting the application to the Planning Board. Each application shall be signed and shall contain at\nleast the following information:\n24-3.1 The applicant's name in full, applicant's address, and description of the property to be rezoned;\n24-3.2 Applicant's interest in the property and type of rezoning or amendment requested;\n24-3.3 If the proposed change would require a change in the Zoning Map, an accurate diagram of the property proposed for rezoning showing:\n(A) All adjoining property lines with dimensions and north arrow;\n(B) Adjoining streets with rights-of-way and paving widths;\n(C) The location of all structures;\n(D) The use of all land;\n(E) Zoning classification of all abutting zoning districts.\n24-4 Proposed Amendments to be Submitted to Planning Board for Recommendation\n(A) Zoning Amendments. All proposed amendments to this Ordinance or Zoning Map shall be submitted to the Planning Board for review and comment. If no written report is\nreceived from the Planning Board within 45 days of referral of the amendment to that board, the City Council may act on the amendment without the Planning Board report. The\nCity Council is not bound by the recommendations, if any, of the Planning Board.\n(B)\nPlan Consistency. When conducting a review of proposed zoning text or map amendments pursuant to this section, the Planning Board shall advise and comment on whether\nthe proposed action is consistent with the Morehead City Land Use Plan that has been adopted and any other officially adopted plan that is applicable. The Planning Board shall\nprovide a written recommendation to the City Council that addresses plan consistency and other matters as deemed appropriate by the Planning Board, but a comment by the\nPlanning Board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the Morehead City Land Use Plan shall not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by\nthe City Council. If a Zoning Map amendment qualifies as a \"large-scale rezoning\" under Section 24-7(B), the Planning Board statement describing plan consistency may address\nthe overall rezoning and describe how the analysis and policies in the relevant adopted plans were considered in the recommendation made.\n(C) Separate Board Required. Notwithstanding the authority to assign duties of the Planning Board to the City Council as provided by Chapter 160D, the review and comment\nrequired by this section shall not be assigned to the City Council and must be performed by a separate board.\n24-5 Hearing with Published Notice\nBefore adopting, amending, or repealing any provision of this Ordinance, the City Council shall hold a legislative hearing.

For purposes of this prohibition, \"down-\nzoning\" means a zoning ordinance that affects an area of land in one of the following ways: (a) by decreasing the development density of the land to be less dense than was allowed under\nits previous usage, or (b) by reducing the permitted uses of the land that are specified in a zoning ordinance or land development regulation to fewer uses than were allowed under its\nprevious usage.\n24-6 City Council\n(A) When adopting or rejecting any zoning text or map amendment, the City Council shall approve a brief statement describing whether its action is consistent or inconsistent with\nthe Morehead City Land Use Plan. The requirement for a plan consistency statement may also be met by a clear indication in the minutes of the City Council that at the time\nof\naction on the amendment the City Council was aware of and considered the Planning Board's recommendations and any relevant portions of an adopted comprehensive plan. If\na Zoning Map amendment is adopted and the action was deemed inconsistent with the adopted plan, the zoning amendment shall have the effect of also amending any future\nland-use map in the approved plan, and no additional request or application for a plan amendment shall be required. A plan amendment and a zoning amendment may be\nconsidered concurrently. The plan consistency statement is not subject to judicial review. If a Zoning Map amendment qualifies as a \"large-scale rezoning\" under Section 24-7(B),\nthe City Council statement describing plan consistency may address the overall rezoning and describe how the analysis and policies in the relevant adopted plans were\nconsidered in the action taken.\n(B) Additional Reasonableness Statement for Rezonings. When adopting or rejecting any petition for a Zoning Map amendment, a statement analyzing the reasonableness of the\nproposed rezoning shall be approved by the City Council. This statement of reasonableness may consider, among other factors, (i) the size, physical conditions, and other\nattributes of the area proposed to be rezoned, (ii) the benefits and detriments to the landowners, the neighbors, and the surrounding community, (iii) the relationship between\nthe current actual and permissible development on the tract and adjoining areas and the development that would be permissible under the proposed amendment; (iv) why the\naction taken is in the public interest; and (v) any changed conditions warranting the amendment. If a Zoning Map amendment qualifies as a \"large-scale rezoning\" under Section\n24-7(B), the City Council statement on reasonableness may address the overall rezoning.\n(C)\n133 of 235\n4/13/24, 12:43\n"}, {"page": "134", "text": "Morehead City, NC Code of Ordinances\nabout:blank\nSingle Statement Permissible.

written comment, and the provision of such names and addresses to all members of the City Council shall not disqualify any member of the City Council from voting.\n24-9 Petition Withdrawal\nAny petition for an amendment to this Ordinance may be withdrawn up to two (2) weeks prior to the legislative hearing by the person initiating such a request, upon written notice to\nthe City Manager.\n24-10 Reconsideration\nIf the applicant withdraws his application following the recommendation of the Planning Board, the Town shall not thereafter accept any other application for the same change of\nzoning affecting the same property, or any portion thereof, until the expiration of six (6) months from the date of such previous withdrawal; or when the City Council shall have denied any\napplication for the change of any zoning district, the Town shall not thereafter accept any other application for the same change of zoning affecting the same property, or any portion\nthereof, until the expiration of six (6) months from the date of such previous denial.\nAppendix I STANDARD INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION (SIC) SYSTEM\n134 of 235\n4/13/24, 12:43\nCELL (1, 1): \n20\nCELL (1, 2):
