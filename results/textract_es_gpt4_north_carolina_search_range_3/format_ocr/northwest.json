Coverage can be estimated by visual estimates, aerial photography or by land\nsurvey methods.\nA.\nHeritage Tree Survey\n1.\nA heritage tree survey shall be required for any multifamily development, nonresidential development,\nmajor subdivisions or planned development, with applications for site plan, preliminary plat, development\nplan, or special use permit. The heritage tree survey shall show the general location, species and size of\ntrees listed below. However, a heritage tree survey shall not be required for land in the floodway (unless\nfilled or developed in accordance), preserved wetlands and wetland buffers, steep slope areas, and stream\nbuffers.\n2.\nFor purposes of this Ordinance, a heritage tree shall be defined as follows:\ni.\nA flowering Dogwood, Live Oak, Long Leaf Pine, Redbay, Black Tupelo or Laurel Oak with a trunk\ndiameter measurement of 4\" or greater measured at 4.5 feet above ground;\nii.\nAny tree species included in the planting table (See Section 6.1.5.C) with a trunk caliper measurement\nof 18\" or greater measured at 4.5 feet above ground;\n3.\nFor development plans where specific building locations are not shown, a more generalized survey of\nvegetation may be provided in lieu of a heritage tree survey. This survey shall describe existing forest\nstands, indicating the average species and size of trees on the tract. A more specific survey should be\nprovided in conjunction with preparation of specific development plans.\n4.\nHaving better information about the location of heritage trees is not especially useful where plans call for\nthe preservation of large areas in undisturbed vegetation. An example is the pervious portions of\ndevelopments in watershed protection districts. Producing such information adds to the project's cost\nwithout providing information that could result in project redesign.

The preservation of the\nmaximum amount of existing vegetation and selective removal of existing trees throughout the site is\nstrongly encouraged during project design and construction. In order to encourage such preservation, the\nPlanning Director may count established vegetation preserved during development towards the\nlandscaping requirement (see paragraph C, above) where the percent opacity requirement is met (See\nSection 6.3.9.A.4, Buffer Alternatives Table [Required Opacity]).\nCommentary: Clear-cutting trees should be avoided especially areas along roadways. Trees and plantings along\nroadways are desirable and provides a better visual appearance for the traveling public.

What about unusual site circumstances? The table provides a number of alternative approaches to achieving the\nrequirements.\n2. Why do I have to put all the plants in- the lot next to me is vacant? This approach anticipates this type of\nsituation. The initial developer will have a reduced buffer requirement.\n3. What if I want to put in a narrower buffer? The developer may select Alternative 3, Canopy and Wall or may\ninstall a berm. This will allow the developer to reduce the buffer depth while still providing appropriate screening.\n4.

These cross-access corridors are intended to link parking areas on neighboring\ndevelopments.\nB.\nApplicability\n1.\nCross-access corridors(s) shall be required for all nonresidential sites within a related project\n(as evidenced by a common development plan or site plan); even if the properties are\nsubdivided.\n2.\nCross-access corridor(s) are encouraged for all other developments.\n3.\nCross-access corridors(s) are not required from or to adjoining sites which have more than 75%\nof the total land area in residential development.\nCommentary: This means that single family developments are not required to provide cross-access\ncorridors.\n4.\nThe Planning Director may modify or even waive the requirements of this section through the\nAdministrative Adjustment process (see Section 9.6) if it can be proven that strict compliance\nwould be impracticable due to unique site conditions such as environmental concerns,\nextreme slopes, or similar circumstances.\nC.\nStandards\n1.\nCross-access corridor(s), where utilized, shall be designed to provide unified circulation and\naccess between sites.\n2.\nThe minimum paved width for a cross-access corridor(s) is 20 feet.\n3.\nCross-access corridor(s) must be set back at least 20 feet from any public roadway.\n4.\nIf a site is developed adjoining to an undeveloped piece of property, it shall be designed so\nthat its parking, access and circulation are easily tied together to create a unified system at a\nlater date. If the building site abuts an existing developed property, it shall tie into the abutting\nparking, access and circulation to create a unified system. To accomplish this, the Planning\nDirector may allow the applicant to:\ni.\nconstruct a cross-access corridor future connection to the property line to allow for future\nconnection; or\nii.\ndedicate an easement of sufficient width to accommodate a future cross-access corridor\nand post fiscal surety in a form acceptable to the City of sufficient amount to construct the\nportion of the connection on the applicant's property.\nD.\nMaintenance and Operation\n1.\nWhere a cross access corridor is developed, the owners/developers of the affected properties\nshall provide for mutually coordinated parking, access and circulation systems, and shall\nprovide design features as necessary to make it visually obvious that abutting properties shall\nbe tied together to create a unified system.\nIn order to maintain a clear passage for emergency and non-emergency travel, no parking shall\nbe allowed in a cross-access corridor. Signs indicating \"No Parking at Any Time\" shall be\nerected along both sides of the corridor.\n6-56\n"}, {"page": "269", "text": "Article 6 Design and Performance Standards\n6.14 Emergency Management Standards\n6.14\nEMERGENCY MANAGEMENT STANDARDS\n6.14.1.

The developer agreed to preserve the trail and the\ncommunity actually advocated for the project at the public hearing because the project improved child\nsafety. Other examples of when a neighborhood meeting would be required are when open space is\nproposed to be converted to another land use such as single family residential or when a single family\nresidential use is proposed to be converted to a multi-family residential use.\nA.\nAfter the project planning session, the applicant is encouraged to hold a neighborhood meeting prior to\nsubmitting an application for any of the following approvals:\n1.\nRezoning (Section 3.8);\n2.\nPlanned Development review (Section 3.3.3); and\n3.\nSpecial Use Permit (Section 3.5).\nB.\nA neighborhood meeting is required (MANDATORY) for Conditional Zoning, all modifications to an\nexisting Planned Development or an existing Major Subdivision, except in situations where the Planning\nDirector is authorized to approve the modification administratively.\nCommentary: Examples of situations where a neighborhood meeting is required include a change in\nland use from open space to single-family or single-family to multi-family.\n9-3\n"}, {"page": "330", "text": "Article 9 Administration and Enforcement\n9.2 Neighborhood Meeting\nC.\nThe purpose of the neighborhood meeting is to inform the neighborhood of the nature of the proposed\nland use and development features, explain the plan (if any), and receive comments.
