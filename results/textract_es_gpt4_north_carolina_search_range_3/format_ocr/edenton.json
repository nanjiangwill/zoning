The major objectives of this district are to (1) encourage land\nuses which serve as an adequate buffer between intensive non-residential and residential uses; (2)\nprovide aesthetic controls and dimensional requirements to ensure compatible office and service\ndevelopment with surrounding residential uses; and (3) encourage a mixture of medium-density\nresidential uses with offices and services.\n(g)\nThe CS District is designed to accommodate well planned shopping centers serving the\ncommunity and regional marketplace. The major objectives of this district are to (1) encourage\nattractive and orderly shopping center development, (2) promote unified site design, pedestrian\ncirculation and traffic control within the shopping center complex, (3) provide opportunities for\ncoordinated transportation planning for ingress and egress, and (4) promote urban design and\ncorridor landscape improvements which are compatible with the Town's comprehensive planning\ngoals. (Amended 3/99)\nSection 9.3 Industrial Districts Established.\nThe IW District is established as a district in which to allow primarily light manufacturing,\nassembly, research, warehousing, and intensive commercial uses. The regulations of this district\nare intended to (i) encourage light manufacturing and intensive commercial uses as well as\naccessory land uses incidental to and in support of manufacturing uses; (ii) exclude heavy industry,\nmajor retail, and residences as acceptable land uses; and (iii) preserve locations that are best\nsuited for industrial development. Land uses in the IW District are limited to those determined to be\ncompatible with the character of the community.

These special control overlay districts are intended to be superimposed over\nthe underlying general zoning district and the land so encumbered may be used in a manner\npermitted in the underlying district only if and to the extent such use is also permitted in the\napplicable overlay district. The specific objectives of each of these overlay districts are explained in\nthe remainder of this section.\n(b)\nThe FHO District is established as an overlay district of all general zoning districts for\nthe purpose of protecting people and property from the hazards of flooding. The flood hazard\ndistricts are further described in Part I of Article 16 of this ordinance.\n(c)\nThe AHO District is established as an overlay district of all general zoning districts in\nthe vicinity of the Edenton Municipal Airport. The purpose of the AHO is to protect the airport\nenvirons from encroachment of incompatible land uses which present hazards to users of the\nairport as well as to persons residing or working in the airport vicinity. The additional regulations\nimposed in the AHO are designed to (i) place additional height restrictions on buildings and trees;\n(ii) control the above-ground storage of flammable materials; and (iii) control the locations of\nhigh-density residential uses and places of assembly. The additional regulations governing land\ndevelopment in the AHO district are delineated in Section 11.14.\n(d)\nThe HO District is established as an overlay district for all general zoning districts that\ncontain structures or other facilities of historic significance. The purpose of the HO is to protect and\nconserve the heritage and character of the Edenton community by providing for the preservation of\ndesignated areas within the planning jurisdiction. No new historic districts nor any change to the\nboundaries of any existing historic district shall be designated until the North Carolina Department\nof Cultural Resources shall have been given an opportunity, in accordance with Chapter 160D,\nArticle 9, Part 4 of the N.C. General Statutes, to make recommendations with respect to the\nestablishment of such new district or change in the boundaries of an existing district. The additional\nregulations governing land development in the HO district are delineated in Section 11.15.\n(Amended 9/14/2021)\n(e)\nThe RCO District is established as an overlay district of all general zoning districts for\nthe purpose of establishing streetscape appearance and pedestrian and bicycle circulation\nrecommendations along six main road corridors that lead into downtown Edenton. The additional\nregulations governing land development in the RCO districts are delineated in Section 11.36.\n(f)\nThe BSR overlay district is established as an overlay district for an area of Broad Street\nlocated in the CD (Downtown Commercial) zoning district. The purpose of the overlay district is to\nprohibit residential uses in the first floor of structures fronting on South Broad Street.\nSection 9.5 Conditional Zoning District.\nThe conditional zoning district (CZD) allows a site to be developed with a mixture of land uses\naccording to an approved overall site plan. For example, a large tract may be developed with a mix\nof single-family and multi-family housing, with part of the site also devoted to commercial and office\nuses. The CZD allows for greater flexibility in dimensional standards (such as lot sizes and\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 9/14/2021\n9-3\n"}, {"page": "107", "text": "setbacks) upon approval of an overall master plan for the entire development. The district does not\nrequire a rigid separation of different land uses. Uses are limited to the uses identified in Section\n10.1 Table of Permitted Uses. All of the site-specific standards and conditions, including a site plan,\nare incorporated into the zoning district regulations for the CZD. Approval of the site plan will\nestablish all zoning requirements for the subject property. A CZD district shall not be less than three\n(3) acres in area.\nThis negotiated approach to a legislative decision allows maximum flexibility to tailor regulations to\na particular site and project. But it also has great potential for abuse - both in terms of impacts on\nindividual landowners seeking approval and their neighbors and on the public interests zoning is\nsupposed to promote. Thus, special restrictions have been placed on conditional zoning.\nConditional Zoning Districts may only occur at the owner's request and cannot be imposed without\nthe owner's agreement. The individual conditions and site-specific standards that can be imposed\nare limited to those that are needed to bring a project into compliance with town ordinances and\nadopted plans and to those addressing the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by use of\nthe site. The town must assure that all of the factors defining reasonable spot zoning are fully\nconsidered and that the public hearing record reflects that consideration.\nConditional zoning provides important opportunities to carefully tailor regulations to address the\ninterest of the landowner, the neighbors, and the public. The town may use conditional zoning when\nit concludes that a particular project should be approved but that the standards in the comparable\nconventional zoning district(s) are insufficient to protect neighbors or public interests (perhaps\nbecause the conventional zoning allows other uses not suitable for the site or dimensional\nstandards inadequate to preserve the neighborhood). Conditional zoning often allows a developer\nto proceed with a project in a way that addresses site-specific concerns of neighbors and the Town\nof Edenton. The petitioner must consent in writing to all conditions imposed by the conditional\nzoning.

Vested Rights and Permit Choice.\nSection 20.11 Findings.\nTown approval of development typically follows significant investment in site evaluation,\nplanning, development costs, consultant fees, and related expenses. Therefore, it is necessary and\ndesirable to provide for the establishment of certain vested rights in order to ensure reasonable\ncertainty, stability, and fairness in the development regulation process, secure reasonable\nexpectations of landowners, and foster cooperation between the public and private sectors in land-\nuse planning and development regulation.\nSection 20.12 Permit Choice.\nIf an application made in accordance with local regulation is submitted for a development\napproval required pursuant to this Ordinance and a development regulation changes between the\ntime the application was submitted and a decision is made, the applicant may choose which version\nof the development regulation will apply to the application. If the development permit applicant\nchooses the version of the rule or ordinance applicable at the time of the permit application, the\ndevelopment permit applicant shall not be required to await the outcome of the amendment to the\nrule, map, or ordinance prior to acting on the development permit. This section applies to all\ndevelopment approvals issued by the State and by local governments. The duration of vested rights\ncreated by development approvals are as set forth in Section 20.11.\nSection 20.13 Process to Claim Vested Right.\nA person claiming a statutory or common law vested right may submit information to\nsubstantiate that claim to the UDO Administrator, who shall make an initial determination as to the\nexistence of the vested right.

Each type of vested right listed below is defined by and is\nsubject to the limitations provided in this section and the cited statutes. Vested rights established\nunder this section are not mutually exclusive. The establishment of vested right under one\nsubsection does not preclude vesting under one or more other subsections or by common law\nprinciples.\n(a)\nSix-Months - Building Permits. Pursuant to NCGS 160D-1110, a building permit\nexpires six (6) months after issuance unless work under the permit has commenced. Building\npermits also expire if work is discontinued for a period of twelve (12) months after work has\ncommenced.\n(b)\nOne Year - Other Local Development Approvals. Pursuant to NCGS 160D-403(c),\nunless otherwise specified by this section, statute, or local ordinance, all other local development\napprovals expire one year after issuance unless work has substantially commenced.

For the purposes of this\nsection, a \"site-specific vesting plan\" means a plan submitted to the town\ndescribing with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specific\nparcel or parcels of property. The plan may be in the form of, but not be\nlimited to, any of the following plans or approvals: a planned unit development\nplan, a subdivision plat, a site plan, a preliminary or general development\nplan, a special use permit, a conditional zoning, or any other development\napproval as may be used by the town. Unless otherwise expressly provided\nby the town, the plan shall include the approximate boundaries of the site;\nsignificant topographical and other natural features effecting development of\nthe site; the approximate location on the site of the proposed buildings,\nstructures, and other improvements; the approximate dimensions, including\nheight, of the proposed buildings and other structures; and the approximate\nlocation of all existing and proposed infrastructure on the site, including water,\nsewer, roads, and pedestrian walkways. The Town of Edenton uses existing\ndevelopment approvals, such as a preliminary plat, a special use permit, or a\nconditional zoning, to approve a site-specific vesting plan. A variance shall not\nconstitute a \"site specific vesting plan,\" and approval of a site-specific vesting\nplan with the condition that a variance be obtained shall not confer a vested\nright unless and until the necessary variance is obtained. If a sketch plan or\nother document fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type and\nintensity of use for a specified parcel or parcels of property, it may not\nconstitute a site-specific vesting plan.\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 9/14/2021\n20-5\n"}, {"page": "285", "text": "(4)\nProcess for Approval and Amendment of Site-Specific Vesting Plans.

Such conditional approval shall result in\na vested, although failure to abide by such terms and conditions will result in a\nforfeiture of vested rights. The town shall not require a landowner to waive\nvested rights as a condition of developmental approval. A site-specific vesting\nplan shall be deemed approved upon the effective date of the town's decision\napproving the plan or such other date as determined by the Town Council\nupon approval. An approved site-specific vesting plan and its conditions may\nbe amended with the approval of the owner and the town as follows: Any\nsubstantial modification must be reviewed and approved in the same manner\nas the original approval; minor modifications may be approved by staff, if such\nare defined and authorized by local regulation.\n(d)\nSeven Years - Multi-Phase Developments.

This right shall\nremain vested for a period of seven years from the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial\nphase of the multi-phased development. For the purposes of this subsection, \"multi-phased\ndevelopment\" means a development containing 100 acres of more that (i) is submitted for site plan\napproval for construction to occur in more than one phase and (ii) is subject to a master\ndevelopment plan with committed elements, including a requirement to offer land for public use as a\ncondition of its master development plan approval.\n(e)\nIndefinite - Development Agreements. A vested right of reasonable duration may be\nspecified in a development agreement approved under Part III of this Article.\nSection 20.15 Continuing Review.\nFollowing approval or conditional approval of a statutory vested right, the town may make\nsubsequent reviews and require approvals by the town to ensure compliance with the terms and\nconditions of the original approval, provided that such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent\nwith the original approval. The town may revoke the original approval for failure to comply with\napplicable terms and conditions of the original approval or the applicable local development\nregulations.\nSection 20.16 Exceptions.\n(a)\nA vested right, once established as provided for by subsections 20.14(b) and (c),\nprecludes any zoning action by a local government that would change, alter, impair prevent,\ndiminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the property as set forth in an approved\nvested right, except:\n(1)\nWith the written consent of the affected landowner;\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 9/14/2021\n20-6\n"}, {"page": "286", "text": "(2)\nUpon findings, after notice and an evidentiary hearing, that natural or man-\nmade hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected,\nwould pose a serious threat to the public health, and safety, and welfare if the\nproject were to proceed as contemplated in the approved vested right;\n(3)\nTo the extent that the affected landowner receives compensation for all costs,\nexpenses, and other losses incurred by the landowner, including, but not\nlimited to, all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural,\nplanning, marketing, legal, and other consultant's fees incurred after approved\nby the town, together with interest as is provided in Section 1.13.\nCompensation shall not include any diminution in the value of the property\nthat is caused by such action;\n(4)\nUpon findings, after notice and an evidentiary hearing, that the landowner or\nhis representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made\nmaterial misrepresentations that made a difference in the approval by the\ntown of the vested right; or\n(5)\nUpon the enactment or promulgation of a State or Federal law or regulation\nthat precludes development as contemplated in the approved vested right, in\nwhich case the town may modify the affected provisions, upon a finding that\nthe change in State or Federal law has a fundamental effect on the plan, after\nnotice and an evidentiary hearing.\n(b)\nThe establishment of a vested right under subsections 20.14(b) and (c), shall not\npreclude the application of overlay zoning or other development regulation that imposes additional\nrequirements but does not affect the allowable type or intensity of use, or ordinances or regulations\nthat are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to development regulation by the\ntown including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes.\nOtherwise, applicable new regulations shall become effective with respect to property that is subject\nto a vested right established under this section upon the expiration or termination of the vested\nrights period provided for in this section.\n(c)\nNotwithstanding any provision of this section, the establishment of a vested right\nunder this section shall not preclude, change or impair the authority of the town to adopt and\nenforce development regulation provisions governing nonconforming situations or uses.\nSection 20.17 Miscellaneous Provisions.\n(a)\nA vested right obtained under this section is not a personal right, but shall attach to\nand run with the applicable property.

This tree has an interesting, papery bark and a graceful\nbranching habit. It has no special pest or maintenance problems.\nAMERICAN HORNBEAM (Carpinus carolinia) Height: 20-30'; Spread: 15-20'.\nThis native tree has a natural yet refined appearance. It is slow growing,\nbut at maturity it serves as an excellent small shade tree. Its fluted, \"muscular\"\ntrunk is an interesting feature. In the wild, the American Hornbeam is common in\nmoist rich soil, yet, when used in landscape design, it is soil tolerant and does not\nrequire an unusual amount of water. It has no pests and no special maintenance\nproblems.\nEASTERN REDBUD (Cercis canadensis) Height: 20-30'; Spread: 12-25'.\nThis native tree is covered by beautiful pink flowers in the Spring and\ndevelops a dense round crown when allowed to grown in direct sunlight. The\nRedbud has some pests, and its fruit pods may present a litter problem, but it\nrecommends itself for being drought resistant and tolerant of polluted city air.\nFLOWERING DOGWOOD (Cornus florida) Height: 15-30'; Spread: 15-20'.\nThe Dogwood is a native woodland tree which is very popular for\nlandscape planting. It is considered to be a fairly hardy tree, but, when planted in\ndirect sun, it must be frequently watered. A healthy dogwood will develop\nattractive horizontal branches and a bushy crown. Dogwoods look best when\nplanted in groups or when used as an accent in borders. These trees should be\nguarded against borers and other pests.\nRUSSIAN OLIVE (Elaegnus augustifolia) Height: 15-20'; Spread: 20-30'.\nThe Russian Olive can withstand severe exposure and will grow in almost\nany soil. Its toughness and wide spreading habit make it an exceptional screening\nplant. The foliage is an attractive silver-gray color and its flowers, though\ninconspicuous, are very fragrant. The Russian Olive is especially notable for its\nrapid growth. It has no pest problems but it may require periodic trimming of dead\ntwigs.\nMOUNTAIN SILVERBELL (Halesia monticola) Height: 20-40'; Spread: 20'.\nSilverbells are attractive multi-stem trees which are native to the\nsoutheastern United States. They are excellent plants for a natural effect and are\nbest placed where their small flowers and pods will be closely observed.\nCompared to other trees on this list, its crown is more open and irregular. The\nMountain Silverbell has no pests, no maintenance problems, and no special soil\nrequirements.\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix E-11\n"}, {"page": "328", "text": "AMERICAN HOLLY (llex opaca) Height: 15-30'; Spread: 10-20'.\nThis familiar native tree possesses a pyramidal evergreen crown with\nabundant red berries in the winter. It grows best in full sun and prefers moist yet\nwell drained soils. If the lower limbs are allowed to grow naturally, they will branch\nto the ground. Hollies should be protected from high winds. The American Holly\nis a relatively slow grower.\nCRAPE MYRTLE (Lagerstroemia indica) Height: 15-25'; Spread: 15-20'.\nThis popular flowering tree is decorative and interesting in all seasons.\nHowever, it should not be expected to stand alone as a screen. It is most effective\nagainst an evergreen background. It grows best in direct sun and may develop\nmildew problems when planted in shade. Crape Myrtle may be pruned to a\ndesired shape, but when left on its own it will form a densely branching crown.\nSOURWOOD (Oxyndrum arboreum) Height: 20-30'; Spread: 10-15'.\nSourwoods are handsome native trees which are most effective in\nlandscape design when planted in groups. They are easy to transplant and as\neach tree matures it assumes a slender form with upright branches. Sourwood\nprefers relatively dry acid soils. Its only special maintenance problems may be\ninfestations of webworms.\nCAROLINA CHERRY-LAUREL (Prunus caroliniana) Height: 20-30';\nSpread: 15-20'.\nThis tree is prized for its dense evergreen foliage. It may be trimmed as a\nhedge, but also serves as an excellent screen in its natural form. The Cherry-\nLaurel grows rapidly and has no pests. However, it may not be as cold hardy as\nother trees on this list.\nCALLERY PEAR (Pyrus calleryana) Height: 20-40'; Spread: 20-30'.\nThe Callery Pear has recently gained popularity as a city street tree\nbecause it is impervious to air pollution. Furthermore, it will grow in relatively\ninfertile soils. It is a beautiful, upright tree which grows rapidly and is long lived.\nHowever, it may be subject to an assortment of pests and diseases. The\n\"Bradford\" variety is not recommended, due to its poor branching structure\nresulting in a short life.\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix E-12\n"}, {"page": "329", "text": "E-12 Large Trees for Evergreen Screening\nThe following trees are ideal for screening large scale areas such as shopping\ncenters and industrial sites.

It should be\nallowed plenty of room in order to assume its beautiful natural form. Its pendulous\nbranches should be allowed to touch the ground. It prefers relatively dry soils,\ngrows rapidly, and is easy to maintain. \"True Cedars\" such as the Deodar are not\nnative to North America, but they have become quite popular in the South as a\nlandscape tree.\nSOUTHERN MAGNOLIA (Magnolia grandiflora) Height: 40-60';\nSpread: 25'+.\nMagnolias are striking trees which serve well as screens when their\nbranches are allowed to grow to the ground. Generally, this tree does well in city\nconditions, but it should be planted in quite rich acidic soils and it requires a lot of\nmoisture. Furthermore, Magnolias require ample space for growth. It planted in\nfull sunlight, they will grow rapidly. Because it drops large waxy leaves, seed\npods, and flowers, the Magnolias may present a litter problem.\nCANADIAN HEMLOCK (Tsuga canadensis) Height: 30-70';\nSpread: 20'+.\nIt may be sheared or pruned to any shape, but when it grows naturally, its\ngraceful branches form an excellent high screen. The Hemlock prefers cooler,\npartially shaded locations and does best in highly fertile soils. It grows quite\nrapidly. Carolina hemlocks are not widely available and are not as reliable to\nwithstand heat as the Canadian Hemlock.\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix E-13\n"}, {"page": "330", "text": "E-13\nLarge Trees for Shading\nThe following trees may be used for screening, but they are recommended\nespecially for shading trees and parking lots. Unless otherwise noted, they will grow\nrapidly. Each species will attain a mature spread of a least thirty feet.\nNORWAY MAPLE (Acer platanoides) Height: 40-50'; Spread: 50'+.\nMaples as a group are not particularly tolerant to city conditions. The\nNorway Maple is an exception, however, as it is relatively invulnerable to air\npollution and has no special maintenance requirements. This tree assumes a\nwide spreading form and provides very dense shade. In the autumn, the leaves\nare a brilliant red and yellow. The Norway Maple grows rapidly, but it is subject to\nice and wind damage. Plenty of room should be available for its shallow roots and\nit should be given ample water.\nRED MAPLE (Acer rubrum) Height: 40-50'; Spread: 25'+.\nThis tree is an example of a Maple which is not recommended where there\nwill be high concentrations of air pollution. However, with its excellent shading\ncharacteristics and beautiful colors, it should not be ignored. This tree grows\nrapidly, but, unlike the Norway Maple, it does not become brittle with age. The\nRed Maple is a native tree which is usually found in moist, even swampy areas,\nbut it adapts will to a variety of situations. Although subject to Maple insects and\ndiseases, it is usually a long lived tree. Cultivars of this species should be used.\nGINKGO or MAIDENHAIR TREE (Ginkgo biloba) Height: 40-80'; Spread: 30'+.\nThe Ginkgo is a tree which is recommended for several outstanding\nreasons. It is one of the oldest surviving species of trees. It is adaptable to any\nsoil, climate, or degree of exposure to the sun. It does quite well in the city. It has\nno pests, no diseases, and no pruning requirements. In sum, it is a tree of\nexceptional vitality. The N.C. Department of Forest Resources call the Ginkgo,\n\"probably the best all around street tree\". Two reservations are worth stating,\nhowever. First, only male trees should be planted because female Ginkgos bear a\nmessy, malodorous fruit. Second, the Ginkgo is a slow grower. When young, it\nhas a rather gangly appearance. It takes 25 to 30 years to assume its mature,\nsymmetrically spreading form.\nHONEYLOCUST (Gleditisia triacanthos) Height: 50-75'; Spread: 25'+.\nIts open, spreading form and feathery leaves may give the Honeylocust a\nfrail appearance, but it is in fact a quite sturdy tree, notable for its resistance to city\nconditions. Grass and shrubs thrive beneath a Honeylocust because it casts a\nlight shade.\nThis tree is especially useful for its ability to be transplanted at a relatively\nadvanced age. Accordingly, it may be used for immediate effect in a landscape\ndesign. The Honeylocust has its own pests and diseases, but it is fairly hardy.\nThornless and fruitless varieties such as \"Moraine\" are strongly recommended.\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix E-14\n"}, {"page": "331", "text": "SWEET GUM (Liquidamber styraciflua) Height: 60-100'; Spread: 50'+.\nThe Sweet Gum is a native bottomland tree which adapts to a variety of\nsoils.

In the fall, its leaves turn a brilliant wine and gold\ncolor. Other than clean up of its prickly seed balls, the Sweet Gum poses no\nspecial maintenance problems. Seedless varieties are available.\nLONDON PLANE-TREE (Platanus acerifolia) Height: 70-100';\nSpread: 30'+\nThe London Plane-Tree is excellent for streets and parking lots for a\nvariety of reasons. It puts out its branches high enough above the ground so as\nnot to obstruct traffic. Its broadly spreading crown makes is especially useful\nalong wide streets. The London Plane is one of the world's hardiest trees in\npolluted air. Although it needs plenty of sun and moisture, it is undemanding\nabout soil. Finally, it is very long lived. The London Plane-Tree is a hybrid of the\nSycamore, and like the Sycamore, it may suffer from certain diseases. However,\nit is more resistant. Cultivars are available.\nEASTERN RED OAK (Quercus rubra) Height: 50-70'; Spread: 40'+.\nThis tree grows faster than any other oak, two feet or more per year. It is\nprized as a tree because its high branching habit gives it an ideal shape. The Red\nOak grows in almost any average soil and presents no special maintenance\nproblems.\nWILLOW OAK (Quercus phellos) Height: 60-80'; Spread: 30'+.\nThis is another rapidly growing oak. It has proven to be quite successful\nas a street and parking lot tree. Its slender leaves give it a finer texture than that\nof other oaks, but it still casts excellent shade. The Willow Oak is native to\nbottomland soils, and, thus, it needs plenty of moisture. It often spreads\nmajestically as it matures so it should be given ample room to grow. No significant\npests or diseases afflict the Willow Oak.\nSCARLET OAK (Quercus coccinea) Height: 60-80'; Spread: 40'+.\nThis is a third oak which grows rapidly and is easy to maintain. The\nScarlet Oak is more difficult to transplant that the red or the willow, but it may be a\nworthwhile selection for its excellent foliage.\nLAUREL OAK (Quercus laurifolia) Height: 40-60'; Spread: 30'+\nThe Laurel Oak grows more slowly than the other oaks listed above, but it\nhas the advantage of being nearly evergreen in piedmont sections of North\nCarolina. It has proven to be a good street tree and does quite well under city\nconditions. It presents no special maintenance problems.\nLITTLELEAF LINDEN (Tilia cordata) Height: 30-50'; Spread: 25'+.\nLindens are notable for their exceptional symmetry and their ability to grow\nin poor soils. The Littleleaf Linden requires plenty of moisture, but it has proven to\nbe useful for city planting and is especially recommended as a street tree. With its\nmany thick branches and abundant foliage, the Linden provides very dense shade.\nIt should be sprayed for aphids in order to prevent sticky droppings from the\nleaves. Best suited for parks.\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix E-15\n"}, {"page": "332", "text": "E-14 Small Shrubs for Evergreen Screening\nThe following shrubs are recommended for informal (unclipped) hedges or\nscreens.

It bears pale pink flowers throughout the summer.\nAlthough it has proven quite popular for informal hedges, it has several\ndrawbacks. Abelia should be pruned and thinned to maintain its best form. It may\ndrop its leaves due to low temperatures, lack of pruning, or starvation.\nWARTY BARBERRY (Barberis verruculosa) Height: 3-4'; Spread: 3-4'.\nBarberrys as a group have proven to be excellent as hedge\nplants.\nWith their dense, spiny limbs, they are effective barriers in public places. The\nWarty Barberry is a shrub with a neat, compact habit. It is soil tolerant and has no\nspecial maintenance requirements. It grows slowly, but it will reach a height of 3\nto 4 feet within five years.\nWINTERGREEN BARBERRY (Berberis julianae) Height: 4-6'; Spread: 2-5'.\nThis is another Barberry which forms an impenetrable thorny hedge. In\nfact, it grows even more densely than the Warty Barberry. It is pest resistant and\nis very hardy. No pruning is required.

Phillips, Ph.D.\nHerein are contained recommended practices to be followed in the planting and pruning\nof\nStreet and Park trees and those annual maintenance practices that will contribute to the\nhealth and appearance of public plantings in the Town of Edenton, North Carolina.\nI.\nSelection and Planting of Street and Park Trees\nA.\nTime to Plant\nMost hardy trees and shrubs can be moved successfully in the fall or spring.\nThe fall planting season extends from the time the leaves begin to turn color until\nafter the leaves have fallen (October-November in Edenton). The spring planting\nseason begins when the soil warms up and is dry enough to work and continues\nuntil growth starts (March and April in Edenton). Fall planting has the advantage\nof allowing the root system to grow in the late fall before top growth begins the\nfollowing spring. Planting can be done to the likelihood of greater moisture stress.\nB.\nSelection of Specimens\n1. What to Look for When Purchasing Plants\nNursery-grown plants generally have better root and branch structure and\nbecome established more quickly than trees collected from fields or woods.\nThe quality of plants selected can be as important in determining their\nsuccess in the landscape as proper selection of species, planting and\nmaintenance. A young plant with structural defects may never thrive and\nproduce a suitable specimen. A healthy well-grown nursery plant is a good\ninvestment.\nThe following factors should be considered when purchasing trees and\nshrubs:\na) Apparent health and vigor-live buds; no buds; no dried out wood; if\nin leaf, normal color, density and size of leaves.\nb) Healthy root system-free of kinks or circling roots; if in containers,\nsufficient root volume to anchor plant but not pot bound.\nc)\nTop-to-root ratio-moderate ratio of top growth to root system. A small\nroot system may not be able to support a large top.\nd) Well-trained branch structure-straight trunk standing without support,\nevenly distributed branches radially and vertically, branches set as\nwide angles to the trunk; for vertically, branches set at wide angles to\nthe trunk; for shrubs-evenly distributed branches and symmetry of\ngrowth.\ne) Freedom from disease, insect pests or mechanical injury.\n2. Size of Nursery Stock\nLarge shade trees are measured in caliper determined at 6\" above the\nsoil line for trees up to and including 4\" in diameter. Tree caliper is\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix F-1\n"}, {"page": "337", "text": "measured 12\" above the soil line for trees greater than 4\" in diameter.\nTrees are classified by size in one-fourth inch intervals up to 2\" in diameter,\none-half inch intervals up to 4\" in diameter, and 1\" intervals over 4\"\nin\ndiameter.\nFor public plantings, trees with a minimum one and one-fourth inch to one\nand one-half inch caliper are recommended. Trees of this size become\nestablished more quickly and are less subject to vandalism and accidental\nbreakage than smaller plants. Trees over 4\" caliper are not routinely\nrecommended due to expense, need for heavy equipment and extra long-\nterm care required.\nSmall trees are measure in height determined at one foot intervals up to\n6' in height, and two foot intervals over 6'. Plants of 6'-8 size are\nrecommended.\nShrubs are measured in height or spread depending on their growth\nhabit. They are classified in groups with 3\" increments up to 18\", and in 6\"\nincrements over 18\" in height or spread. Availability of various size grades\ndepends somewhat on the species and its growth rate. A size intermediate\nin the range of those available is recommended.\n3. Types of Nursery Stock\nTrees are handled \"bare-root\" (roots free of soil and wrapped in moist\npacking moist packing material), \"balled and burlapped\" (dug with a ball of\nsoil, wrapped in burlap and tied), or in containers.\nDormant deciduous trees of less than 2\" caliper may be available \"bare-\nroot\" for fall or early spring planting. Some kinds of small deciduous trees,\nmost large trees, and evergreens are moved \"balled and burlapped\" in the\nspring or fall. Many deciduous and evergreen trees are shrubs are now\navailable at all times of the year in containers ranging from one (1) gallon to\nten (10) gallons or more in size. Balled and burlapped and container grown\nplants tend to suffer less transplanting shock than plants moved bare-root.\nC.\nPlanting Instructions\n1. Preplant Care\nIf planting can not be done immediately after plants are purchased, they\nmust be kept cool and moist. Bare-root plants should be heeled-in by\ndigging a trench in a shaded location large enough to accommodate the\nroot system without crowding. Lay the tree roots in the trench and mound\nmoist soil, wood shavings, or peat over the roots. Store balled and\nburlapped plants in the shade and keep the root ball moist. Take care not to\nbreak the root ball when moving the plants. Container-grown plants should\nbe kept shaded and watered.\n2. Preparing the Planting Hole\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix F-2\n"}, {"page": "338", "text": "A properly dug planting hole is roomy with good bottom drainage. Holes\nneed be no deeper than needed to allow the plant's crown to sit an inch or\nso above the surrounding soil level. For bare-root trees, make the hole wide\nenough to accommodate the roots when they are spread out naturally. For\nballed and burlapped and container plants, dig the hole twice the diameter\nof the root ball container.\nLoosen the soil on the bottom and sides of the hole to provide easier\npenetration of developing roots. The soil dug from the planting hole is\nsatisfactory fro backfilling around the roots if it is a well-drained, average\nloam. Heavy clay soil or very sandy soil may benefit from thoroughly mixing\norganic matter (compost, damp peat) with the backfill.\n3. Planting Care Root Plants\na) Soak root system in water about twelve (12) hours.\nb) Remove any broken or bruised roots.\nc) Mound and firm the soil in the center of the planting hole to hold\nthe crown of the plant up with the roots spread out naturally at about\na 6\" depth.\nd) Holding the trunk so the previous soil line is 1-2\" above finished\nground level, gradually fill and tamp soil around roots taking care not\nto break or bruise the roots and to avoid air pockets.\n4. Planting Balled and Burlapped Plants\na) Carefully set the ball in the planting hole without cracking the ball\nof soil. The ball should sit about an inch or two higher than the\nsurrounding soil. Add backfill under the ball to bring to correct\nheight.\nb) Check that the ball is centered and the trunk aligned vertically.\nc) Alternatively backfill and firm the soul halfway up the ball.\nd) Loosen the twine and burlap from around the top and shoulder of\nthe ball. Fold the burlap back into the hole or cut it off.\ne) Finish filling the hole making sure the burlap is well buried.\n5. Container Plants\na) Handle the plant by the container, not the trunk.\nb) Carefully remove the container (cut it, if necessary).\nc) Loosen the root ball by hand or slit with a knife to provide good\nsoil contact. If roots are matted around the bottom and sides of the\nball or circling the ball, remove or straighten them. Removing as\nmuch as one-half of the roots from the outer 1\" of the ball should\nnot harm the plant.\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix F-3\n"}, {"page": "339", "text": "d) Set the plant in the hole so that it sits an inch or two higher than\nthe surrounding soil.\ne) Alternately fill and firm the soil around the root ball.\n6. Finishing the Job\na) Shape the soil on top of the hole to form a broad shallow saucer\nwith the rim just inside the lip of the original hole.\nb) Fill the basin slowly with the water. Water thoroughly.\nc) After the water has soaked in, reshape the basin to make the base\nof the plant slightly higher than the bottom of the basin. Unless the\nsoil has washed off the top of the root ball, do not add soil over the\nroot ball to obtain the desired basin shape.\nd) Place 2\"-3\" of mulch (wood chips, shredded bark, etc.) over the\nbasin and surrounding lip to reduce moisture loss, moderate soil\nloss, moderate soil temperature, and reduce settling and cracking\nof the soil.\ne) Fertilizer at planting is not necessary or recommended.\nf) See directions for pruning \"Newly Planted Trees\", page F-11.\ng) Staking is not always needed to make a tree stand upright, but\ntrees in public planting areas need to be staked to help them\nachieve good root anchorage and protect them from vehicles,\nlawn mowers, animals and vandals.\nDrive two or three 2 X 2\" stakes one and one-half feet deep into the soil\njust clear of the planting hole. If wind is not a problem, the stakes should be\nplaced so as to provide maximum protection from traffic and equipment. In\nmoderate to strong wind situations, an imaginary line drawn through the\nsupport stakes should be at right angles to the wind direction.\nWire covered with hose or tubing to protect the trunk, elastic webbing,\nbelting, or polyethylene tape can be used for ties. Ties are located near the\ntop of the stake and a figure eight loop is made between trunk and stake.\nThe ties should not be within two and one-half feet from the top of the tree\nin order to avoid unnecessary stress on the trunk. (See Figure 1, page F-\n14).\nII.\nAnnual Maintenance\nA.\nNewly Planted Trees (1st and 2nd growing season after planting)\nThe first two years after planting are critical in the life of a tree. For street\ntrees they are particularly difficult because of the often less than ideal site\nconditions. It is better to plant a smaller number of trees at one time with\nreasonable assurance of care for several years thereafter, than to over plant and\nneglect them. The following instructions pertain to trees but, with the exception of\nstake and tie care, apply equally well to shrub plantings.\nSeasonal care includes a minimum of two visits to each tree the first two growing\nseasons: one in March and one in August.\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix F-4\n"}, {"page": "340", "text": "First Season: The following maintenance operations should be performed at\neach visit:\n1. Check condition of mulch. Aerate (loosen) with pitchfork if tightly\npacked. Add new mulch to maintain 2-3\" level.\n2. Remove weeds and grass from mulched area. These compete with the\ntree for water and increase the likelihood of mower damage to tree.\n3. Check stakes and ties. Keep taut.\n4. Prune off any broken branches in proper manner (see Where and How\nto Make a Pruning Cut.\", page F-9)\n5. Check health of plant including possible attack by insects and disease.\nSeek advice of extension agent for control measures.\n6. Water thoroughly, if needed. Deep watering is necessary to avoid\nshallow root systems and unstable trees. Additional watering should be\ndone, one a week whenever rainfall levels during the growing season\nare less than 1\" per month.\nSecond Season: Same operations as first year except:\n1. Remove stakes and ties unless trunk and root anchorage appear to be\nweak, in which case, leave stakes and ties one more year. Removing all\nwire and tie material is especially important to avoid its cutting into the\nbark and girdling the trunk.\n2. Fertilize the tree just before new growth starts in the spring. A fertilizer\ncontaining only nitrogen is sufficient for most new trees. It can be\napplied to the soil surface in readily soluble form (ammonium nitrate,\nammonium sulfate) at the rate of 10-.25 lb-sq. yd. and watered in.\nB.\nEstablished Plants\nPlants in the ground three of more years are usually considered\n\"established\". The following procedures for the maintenance of street and\npark plantings should be done each year.\n1. Late Winter to Early Spring\na)\nPrune to train young plants for proper shape and branch structure.\n(See directions for \"Newly Planted and Young Trees, pg 11). To avoid\nlater problems and the need for heavy equipment it is wise to correct\nstructural defects early in the life of a plant.\nb)\nApply fertilizer, as needed, to plants showing poor growth and/or\nfoliage color. Fertilize plants in restricted root zone areas (e.g.\ndowntown Broad Street) annually. (See following section on\nFertilization).\nc)\nAerate and replenish mulch in park shrub borders.\nd)\nBroad-leaf weed control for lawn areas in parks.\ne)\nPerform previously outlines spring maintenance for newly planted\ntrees.\n2. Mid-Summer\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix F-5\n"}, {"page": "341", "text": "a)\nWater plants weekly in areas of restricted root space whenever rainfall\nis less than 1\" per month. Water other trees and shrubs if signs of\nwilting occur.\nb)\nUse Poast or Fusilade with a non-ionic surfactant (Enduce, Agri-Dex)\nfor grass control in shrub borders and for edging.\nc)\nCheck for insect and disease problem. Ask county extension agent for\ndiagnosis and recommended control measures.\nd)\nPrune hedges and shrubs to keep within bounds.\n3. Late Summer\na)\nPrune out dead, diseased and broken limbs according to\nrecommended procedures (See page F-9).\nb)\nRemove excessive basel sucker growth and limb up street trees to\nprovide proper clearance and sight distance.\n4. All Seasons\nAfter storms, cleanly prune stub ends of broken limbs within the crown of\nthe tree back to the next largest branch.\nBroken and town stubs are prime decay entry points and lead to major\nproblems if not cleanly pruned at the time of breakage.\nC.\nFertilization\nThe extent to which fertilizers are applied to established plantings\ndepends on the fertility of the soil in which they are growing. If plants are\nmaking good growth and have good foliage color, the soil is probably fertile\nenough. On plantings showing signs of malnutrition, fertilizer is best applied\nin the spring about the time buds are beginning to grow. The results of a\nsoil analysis can provide recommended treatment and application rates\nfor\ngeneral fertilization and micronutrients needs. The following information\ncontains broad guidelines for application methods and rates for various\nplantings.\n1. Shrub Beds\nA 5-10-5 fertilizer may be broadcast on the beds at a rate of 25\nlbs/1000 sq ft. Individual plants, depending on size would receive 1 to 3 or\n4 handfuls.\nSeveral application methods are used, but some require specialized\nequipment for injection of fertilizer. More common methods include\nsurface broadcasting and soil incorporation.\nIn non-lawn areas, surface application is the easiest and most\neffective method for nitrogen and micronutrient fertilizers. The rate of\napplication depends on tree size. Apply fertilizer starting two and one-half\nfeet from the trunk to a distance extending 25-30% beyond the spread of\nthe branches.\nFor trees up to 3\" in diameter:\n5-10-5:2 lbs/inch trunk diameter\n10-6-4:1 lb/inch trunk diameter\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix F-6\n"}, {"page": "342", "text": "For trees over 3\" in diameter:\n5-10-5:5 lb/inch trunk diameter\n10-6-4:3 lb/inch trunk diameter\nIf rate is indicated in excess of 20 lbs. of 5-10-5 or 10 lbs. of 10-6-4 in 100\nsquare feet of surface area, divide the fertilizer in two or more portions and\napply at 4-6 week intervals. When roads and sidewalks cover much of the\nsurface area under the plant, the rate of application should be reduced and\nthe amount apportioned in several smaller applications.\nFor plants in lawn area, soil incorporation is a more effective method of\nfertilizer application. Fertilizer is placed in holes bored in the soil to more\ndirectly place nutrients in the root zone area and avoid over fertilization of\nthe lawn.\nHoles should be drilled with an auger or punched with a soil corer to avoid\nsoil compaction resulting from merely pounding holes into the soul. Drill\nholes 10-12\" deep and 2-3' apart beginning away from the trunk to avoid\ninjury to the main support roots. Continue drilling holes in a spiral pattern\nextending 25-30% beyond the spread of the branches. Pour one (1) cup of\n5-10-5 or one-half cup 10-6-4 in each hole. Fill holes with water. After water\ndrains, refill hole with good topsoil.\nPlants located in paved areas providing limited root space and little\nsurface soil area benefit from annual fertilizer application. Micronutrient\n(e.g. iron and zinc) deficiencies may also be more common and require\nspecial attention. Spring surface application at a reduced rate is\nrecommended for such plants.\nSlow release fertilizers are available which release small amounts of\nnutrients over 6-18 months. These are often expensive and no more\neffective than other methods, but may be used for plants that are difficult to\nreach for more regular fertilizations.\nIII.\nGeneral Pruning Principles.\nSuccessful pruning requires knowledge of plant growth and development,\ngrowth habits of different kinds of plants and an ability to mentally envision the\nfuture from of a given specimen. It is not possible to provide directions for every\nsituation that necessitates pruning. The following are only general guidelines.\nAdditional references should be consulted for further information of handling\nparticular problems or plant species. Only with good pruning and training can the\nmaximum aesthetic and functional benefit be acquired from plants.\nA.\nPurposes of Pruning\nOne must have a clear purpose in mind before any pruning is done. This\npurpose will dictate the time of pruning and the kind of cuts to be made. Valid\nreasons for pruning include:\n1.\nTo Train Young Plants-The arrangement, attachment, and size of scaffold\nbranches (main structural branches) can be controlled to produce vigorous\nand mechanically strong plants. The early removal of crowded, rubbing and\ncrossing branches will eliminate later\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix F-7\n"}, {"page": "343", "text": "problems. Pruning should take advantage of the plant's natural growth habit.\n2.\nTo Maintain Health and Appearance-Pruning must be done to remove dead,\ndiseased and broken branches. A dense top may be thinned to allow for\npassage of light and to reduce wind resistance.\n3.\nTo Control Plant Size-Control of plant height and spread may be needed to\nreduce interference with utility wires, views and traffic. Initial selection of\nplants with a size and growth habit compatible with site conditions can\nminimize such pruning, but existing plantings may require pruning to direct\ntheir growth in an appropriate manner.\n4.\nFor Safety-The safety of citizens and property must always be considered.\nTrees or branches that through age, storm damage, old pruning wounds or\ndisease become sufficiently decayed internally to pose an imminent threat to\npeople or property must be removed promptly.\nB.\nWhen to Prune\nThe correct time to prune depends of the type of plant, its condition and the\nresults desired. Some general rules are as follows:\n1. Light pruning can be done anytime. Unwanted growth is most easily\nremoved when it is small.\n2. Broken, dead, weak or hazardous branches should be removed\nwhenever they occur. It is often more easy to see theses problems\nduring the growing season.\n3. Young plants are best trained during the dormant season from after leaf\nfall to before the period of rapid spring growth. Pruning at this time\nresults in more rapid plant development and wound healing. A few\nbroadleaf evergreens grow most rapidly after the weather warms up in\nlate spring and pruning should be delayed until spring growth occurs.\n4. Control of plant growth is best achieved when pruning is done soon\nafter growth is complete for the season. Such pruning should not be so\nsevere or early to encourage new shoot growth. In general, mid to late\nsummer pruning results in maximum growth reduction.\n5. Trees and shrubs with desirable flowers should be pruned according to\nthe time the plant blooms. Plants that bloom in spring should be pruned\nnear the end of their blooming period. Plants that bloom in summer or\nfall should be pruned in winter.\n6. Research has shown that pruning wounds heal 20% more quickly in the\nspring due to decay fungi produce spores. Therefore, fall pruning is\ndiscouraged.\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix F-8\n"}, {"page": "344", "text": "C.\nBasic Pruning Methods\nThe type of pruning cut not only affects the initial appearance of the branch or\nplant but also determines growth. The following pruning methods produce quite\ndifferent growth responses.\n1. Heading back is cutting a one year old shoot back to a bud (\"tip pruning\"),\nor cutting an older branch back to a stub or a munch smaller later. Heading\nback a large branch is often called \"topping\", \"lopping\" or \"stubbing\" (See\nFigure 2, page F-14).\nIn response to tip pruning, new growth develops from one or more buds just\nbelow the cut (See Figure 3, page F-15). The result is denser branching.\nThe response to topping or stubbing is a flush of shoots growing from latent\nbuds in the trunk. These shoots are new and will branch internally. These\ncan break out easily as well as increase wind resistance within the crown.\nTip pruning is acceptable in the training of young trees. Topping or\nstubbing is prohibited by the Edenton Tree Ordinance. (See later section of\ncorrect pruning of Mature Trees.)\n2. Thinning Out is the removal of a lateral branch at its point of origin of\nshortening a branch by cutting to a lateral large enough to assume the\nterminal role (Figure 4, page F-15). Reducing the height of a tree or\nbranch by cutting back to a large lateral is called \"drop-crotching\". The\nlateral back to which a branch is cut should have at least one-third the\ndiameter of the branch removed.\nThe growth response to thinning is distributed more evenly throughout the\nplant than the response to heading. The plant becomes more open and\nretains a more natural form. Thinning is the more commonly used pruning\nmethod.\nD.\nWhere and How to Make a Pruning Cut\nThe location of the pruning cut in relation to branch attachment determines\nthe size of the wound, the rate of wound healing and exposure to decay\norganisms. The closeness of the cut also affects the amount of regrowth from the\nbase of the cut and the strength of attachment when a branch is thinned to a\nlateral.\nCurrent research indicated pruning cuts should be made close to, but\nbeyond, the branch bark ridges and the collar at the base of a branch. Branch\nbark ridges are areas, rings or lines of bulging bark that may be rough and darker\nin color than the surrounding bark (See Figure 5, page F-16).\nThis zone is a naturally strong physical barrier to decay. Pruning just outside\nthe branch bark ridges is not the same as a \"flush\" cut, which is made as close\nas possible to the base of the branch. Flush cuts produce unnecessarily large\nwounds and increase the likelihood of decay.\nIn removing small branches with hand shears of long-handled lopping shears,\nmake a close cut by placing the blade just to the outside of the branch bark ridge\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix F-9\n"}, {"page": "345", "text": "of the limb to be removed (Figure 6). In heading back to a bud, a diagonal cut is\nmade about one-fourth inch above the bud. The cut should be made above a bud\nthat will grow in the desired direction (See Figures 6 & 7, p. F-16, p. F-17).\nLimbs over 1\" in diameter must usually be cut with a saw. Those over 2\"\nshould be cut in three steps to avoid splitting and tearing the bark. The first cut\nshould be made on the underside of the branch, 1-2 feet from the crotch. Cut the\nbranch about one-fourth of the way through or until the saw begins to bind. The\nsecond cut is made from the top within 1-2 inches out from the first cut. The third\ncut is made just beyond the branch back ridge or color to remove the stub (see\nFigure 8, page F-17). If the stub is heavy it should be removed with two cuts\ninstead of one, the first cut made from the underside.\nRemoving a large branch with a narrow crotch angle is similar to the above\nexcept the third cut should be made upward at a 30-40 degree angle to the\nactual union of the branch and trunk. The actual union is often much lower than\nthe apparent junction where they touch (See Figure 9, page F-18).\nThe use of pruning paints the cover the surface of the wound is of doubtful\nvalue. People think it looks \"professional\", but current research indicates that no\ndressing currently available in the United States will prevent decay of influence\nthe rate of wound healing. In fact, some indications are that wound dressings can\nactually increase decay when they crack with age and allow water to accumulate\non the cut surface.\nA correctly made, smooth pruning cut is the best insurance against decay. It\nis wise to prune branches as soon as it becomes evident of their need for\nremoval. Smaller wounds heal more rapidly. In order to make smooth cuts, tools\nshould be kept sharp and when pruning diseased or decayed wood, tools should\nalso be disinfected with rubbing alcohol before using them on healthy plants.\nE. Pruning Trees of Different Ages\n1. Newly Planted and Young Trees\nAt planting, prune only broken or rubbing branches. Other branches, however\nlow on the trunk should not be removed at this time as they will provide nutrition\nto the plant during the critical first years of establishment. Do not indiscriminately\nprune back ends of branches or the main trunk. Continue to remove only broken\nbranches and dead twigs during the first growing seasons.\nThe third year after planting, prune only the crown of the plant. This process\nwill continue over several years. A young tree should be left with more branches\nthan will ultimately be wanted to provide for the greatest total growth.\nStart by removing or heading back those branches that are clearly unwanted,\nsuch as those growing inward across the crown or those with narrow angles of\nattachment to the trunk (See figure 10, page F-18).\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix F-10\n"}, {"page": "346", "text": "Trees that form a central leader (e.g. Ginkgo, Pines, Holly) should be pruned\nto maintain a leader. This may be achieved by heading back competing laterals\n(See Figure 11, page F-19), removing vigorous erect watersprouts (See Figure\n12, page F-19), or removing the leader if it has already been outgrown by a\nvigorous lateral (See Figure 13, page F-19).\nTrees along streets and sidewalks will need to have their major scaffold limbs\nat least above head height, but until trees have reached the desired height of the\nlowest scaffold, some lower lateral branched are allowed to remain. Select\nlaterals of weak to moderate vigor spaced 4-12 inches apart to remain as\ntemporary branches to protect and nourish the trunk. As the tree develops a\nsturdy trunk and top, gradually remove the temporary branches.\nEventually, the main permanent scaffold branches of a tree must be selected.\nDepending on the plant's size and growth rate, this process may take several\nyears. When selecting permanent limbs it is important to remember that the\nposition of a limb on a trunk remains essentially the same throughout the life of\nthe tree. As the branch increases in diameter, the distance to the ground actually\ndecreases (See Figure 14, page F-19)\nScaffold branches should have wide angles of attachment to the trunk, should\nbe vertically spaced 12-24 inches apart and should be evenly spaced all around\nthe trunk (See Figure 15, page F-20).\nTrees that do not naturally form a central leader but instead have a vase-\nshaped habit or multiple trunks (e.g., Elms, Crepe myrtle) require care\nin\nselection of scaffold branches. Vertical spacing is critical to avoid weak branch\nstructure.\n2. Mature Trees\nMature street tree plantings need to be evaluated for clearance for vehicular\nand pedestrian traffic. Training young trees for suitable height of lowest branch\nmay eliminate the need for pruning; however, lower limbs may have bent\ndownward over time necessitating pruning to raise the crown (also called crown\nlifting and heading-up). When raising the crown, thin back to a more upright\nlarge lateral or remove the limb entirely. Cutting back to a small upright lateral\noften results in the need to further pruning as the branch eventually loses vigor\ndue to loss of photosynthetic foliage area and shade from upper branches.\nMaintain a tree's symmetry by pruning branches opposite those removed in\nraising the crown.\nCrown lifting may need to be done over several years to avoid removing too\nmuch foliage and thereby weakening the tree. Removing too many lower limbs at\nonce also decreases a tree's stability. For a\nproperly balanced tree, at least one-half of the foliage should be on branches\noriginating in the lower two thirds of the trunk.\nPruning may also be needed over time to correct branches interfering with\nutility wires. Both trees and wires are essential for the health and prosperity of\nthe community. Inexperienced topping results in complaints and unnecessary\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix F-11\n"}, {"page": "347", "text": "butchering of trees. Careful tree trimming can remedy the problem and preserve\nthe shape of trees. Directional pruning has the most lasting benefits. This method\ninvolved opening paths for wires through trees by removing smaller branches.\nThe branches selected to remain are those growing away from the wires.\nInitial selection of plants with a mature size and shape appropriate for the\nplanting site will reduce the need for pruning of mature trees to control growth.\nExisting plants and changing site conditions will still make crown reduction a\nnecessary pruning operation. Crown reduction is the thinning of branches to\nreduce spread, height or to remove limbs jutting out beyond the general outline of\nthe tree. Size can be most effectively maintained if crown reduction is begun as\nthe plant reaches maximum acceptable size. Pruning will be more difficult and\nthe larger wounds harder to heal if pruning is delayed.\nTopping is often mistakenly done to reduce size. Topping is cutting main\nbranches back to stubs with little regard for their location. Size reduction is\ncorrectly done by a thinning process called \"drop-crotching\" (see F- 9). This\npractice retains the natural shape of the tree, reduces regrowth of watersprouts\nand minimizes the chance of decay in the wound (See Figure 16, page F-20).\nDense headed trees may benefit from crown thinning to open up the crown\nand allow better light penetration, more productive growth and lessen wind\nresistance. Start from the top and work down removing small, weaker, heavily\nshaded inner branches. If a tree was poorly trained, cuts up to six inch diameter\nmay be needed to remove branches arising to close together.\nStubs of limbs broken by storms and wind should be pruned back to the next\nlarger branch as a routine practice of storm clean up (See Figure 17, page F-20).\nSuch stubs are the major point of entry for decay causing organisms. Their\nsubsequent decay makes them a hazard to persons and property.\nMature trees may also require routine removal of basal sucker growth and\nvigorous watersprouts arising from earlier pruning wounds.\n3. Aging Trees\nOlder trees will require periodic cleaning out to remove dead, dying of broken\nwood. Watersprouts arising from old pruning cuts should also be removed as\nclose to their base as possible. Examine old pruning wounds for defects and\nsigns of decay.\nCrown reduction may be called for where the branch system seems\ninadequate for the height and weight carried, or the tree as a whole is in declining\nhealth. Some kinds of trees, such as Oak, Elm and Linden, will tolerate relatively\nsevere pruning, others, such as Maple, Sycamore and Ash, are less tolerant. As\npreviously stated, drop-crotching is the correct procedure for crown reduction.\nLarge pruning wounds on older trees rarely heal and can be expected to show\nsigns of decay in the future.\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix F-12\n"}, {"page": "348", "text": "Crown renewal of restorative pruning may be needed on trees that were\npruned improperly in earlier years. Crown renewal is the practice of reshaping a\ntree that has been topped to restore a more natural form, improve health and\ngive it greater structural strength. A tree is probably worth saving if the main\nscaffold branched and trunk are sound or can be cut back to sound wood. A\ndead branch stub that has a collar of live wood should be cut just at the outer\nedge of the collar (See Figure 18, page F-21). Branches that have grown from\ntopped scaffold branches should be thinned until only 1-3 remain on each\nscaffold. These remaining branches should be thinned back to large, low laterals\nto reduce possible wind damage and to encourage stronger attachment. Crown\nrenewal is best done during the growing season gradually over a 2-4 year period.\nRestorative work on topped trees must be recognized as a stop gap method and\naction should be taken to provide eventual replacements for such plants.\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix F-13\n"}, {"page": "349", "text": "Figure 1.\nAeroun Any Sheets\nwithin 18cm of Seil\nPlant Signity Higher\nThan Green - Hursery\nThis Layer of\nOrganic Matter\nVigat Loves 210 18cm\nstare Soit - Sheate\n(216 adidas Diameter\nPlanting AND -\nMater Resident\nHale Twice\nhim with Original -\nof Contact\nAddition of Organic Mas-\nSaid its Resires an film\n- MAY Be advisor\nFigure 2.\nFigure 2\n- - asset -\n. - . that\n- meal want.\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix F-14\n"}, {"page": "350", "text": "Figure 3\nFigure 3.\nHaiding a - / -\n-4 donta IND a - Scale lass isalone\nthe outlets vigarous carame Birth\nGrowth from . simpler but - /\n+if be mane - Farmer along\nthe shaw and all be less -\njight with\nFigure 4\nFICUSE +\nto / . 11 .\n. - trust by data IN issues the\nThis issues in Philase (inn) M will .. i times\nTown of Edenton\nUnified Development Ordinance, 10/99\nAppendix F-15\n"}, {"page": "351", "text": "Figure 5\nfigure 3.\nCOLLAR\nDetails\n2Hatar\nFigure 6\n2.

New development brings with it new homes,\njobs and land uses which in turn mean new residents, businesses and visitors will be introduced\nto a growing community. Such growth places new burdens on local governments which are\noften unequipped to efficiently or even adequately provide the public services required by new\nresidents, employers and visitors, especially in light of the rapid pace at which new development\nproposals are being processed in towns such as Edenton.\nIn order to properly plan for new growth in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of\nexisting and new residents, local government officials must be able to accurately project\nresident and school-age children populations attributable to new development. They must also\nplan an appropriate governmental response to such a project. For instance, they must project\nthe number of additional public employees-policemen, firemen, teachers, etc.-and the kinds of\nmunicipal facilities that will be needed to serve the changing population. Furthermore, they\nmust decide whether or not the proposed land use fits in with the locality's future land use plan,\nas expressed in Edenton's Land Classification Map, which graphically represents the\ncommunity's vision for its future. A fiscal impact analysis provides municipal officials with\naccess to the information needed to make these kind of decisions.\nA fiscal impact analysis provides a realistic projection of the direct, current, public costs and\nrevenues associated with a proposed development project to the local jurisdiction(s) in which\nthe development would be located. When properly done, a formal fiscal impact study should\ninclude simple, straightforward procedural steps used to estimate costs and revenues\nassociated with development so that all citizens may understand its assumptions and\ncalculations. Such an analysis provides a participating locality with several major benefits. First\nand foremost, it can help the community to project service requirements of anticipated\ndevelopment.

It is the role of the Town Council,\nPlanning Board and other boards and commissions to ensure that future development is in keeping with Council's\nvision of the Town and in the best long term interest of the residents.\nIn 2004, the Town of Edenton asked a group of citizens to study architectural standards and make\nrecommendations to Council for possible inclusion of standards in the Town's Unified Development Ordinance.\nDesign standards such as these are intended to document a community's design objectives with the use of\nillustrations and other examples so that developers and consultants can visualize how their projects work towards\nthe goals of the Town Plan. They are intended to assist property owners, developers and town review boards with\nthe preliminary planning, design and evaluation of proposals and approval of projects. By incorporating the\nstandards in the early phases of design, time consuming and costly changes can often be avoided. In addition, they\nare intended to reduce or eliminate the more common architectural characteristics of sprawl development, and work\ntowards a common vision for Edenton's future.\nThe goal of this document is to ensure that, over time, the standards will improve the character and natural beauty\nof the community making it an even more attractive and prosperous place.\nSCOPE\nThis manual provides design standards for all new construction and substantial renovations (see Appendix B) of\ncommercial and medical properties outside of Edenton's Historic District. A map of affected areas has been\nillustrated on page 4 of this manual for easy reference; however it is recommended that you check with the latest\nzoning maps on file at the Town Planning Office to verify what properties are covered.\nAUTHORITY\nFor all projects involving new construction or substantial renovation (see Appendix B) of a building or buildings; the\nTown reserves the right to retain a licensed architect, at the applicant's expense, to review the application and\nprovide a report regarding whether or not the application complies with these design standards.\nThis document is intended to act in conjunction with the Town of Edenton's Unified Development Ordinance.

This helps to define the identity of the street and gives the business maximum public exposure.\n1.1 The primary building entry should always be placed at the front of the building (facing the front lot line) and be clearly identifiable from\nthe street. (A) In this example, an entry vestibule is created which faces the front, side and rear parking area simultaneously. (NOTE:\nProperty boundaries adjacent to controlled access highways will require a 50-foot foliated buffer yard; and secondary frontages on major or\nminor arterials will require formal street tree plantings).\n1.2 Parking should be placed at the side or rear of the lot and screened from view whenever possible. Break the parking areas up into\ngroups of no more than 20 spaces per area separated by landscaping areas. (B)\n1.3 Place as much of the building width at the front of the lot as possible to maximize front fa\u00e7ade exposure to the public.

(D)\n1.5 Whenever possible, attempt to link with adjacent parking lots or provide shared parking areas which can serve neighboring buildings\nsimultaneously. (E) This provides a secondary means of access to the site and can ease congestion on the main road.\n1.6 Provide sidewalks for the full width of the property with a direct link to the primary building entry.

Curb cuts should only be as wide as\nnecessary to accommodate needed lanes. Curb radiuses should be kept to a minimum.
