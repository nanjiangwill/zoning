A person seeking to\nrezone a tract of land may either choose to petition for general use or conditional district rezoning.\nGeneral use rezoning would allow the petitioner to pursue any of the listed permitted uses for that district.\nConditional district rezoning would allow the petitioner to pursue any one of the listed permitted uses for\nthat district.\nFor the purposes of this Ordinance, the Town of Denton and its extraterritorial jurisdiction are hereby\ndivided into the following use districts:\nSection 4-2. General Use Districts\nResidential Agricultural (RA)\nThis district accommodates agricultural and low-density single family residential uses with some\nlimited public, semipublic, and recreational uses when they are compatible to low density\nresidential development. Uses may include single family site built and manufactured homes in\nsmall neighborhoods (minor subdivisions). The minimum lot size is 1 acre, Public water and\nsewer are not available and uses are served by individual wells and septic tanks.\nResidential Medium-Density (R-20)\nThis district allows medium-density residential uses (one unit per 1/2 acre or more) within\nneighborhoods where public water and sewer are available, including single family site-built, two-\nfamily residences, and neighborhood services, parks and schools.\nResidential Medium/High-Density (R-15)\nThis category a variety of medium/high-density residential uses (one unit per 1/3 acre or more)\nwhere public water and sewer are available, including single family site-built, two-family\nresidences, rooming houses, multi-family dwellings of 3 units or less and compatible\nneighborhood services, parks and schools.\nResidential High-Density (R-8)\nThis district has a variety of high-density residential uses (one unit per 1/6 acre or more) where\npublic water and sewer are available, including single family site-built two-family residences,\nrooming houses, multi-family dwellings of four units or less, multi-family dwellings of more than\nfour units, and compatible neighborhood services, parks and schools.\n18\nCELL (1, 1): \nRA\nCELL (1, 2): \nResidential Agricultural\nCELL (2, 1): \nR-20\nCELL (2, 2): \nResidential Medium Density Single-Family\nCELL (3, 1): \nR-15\nCELL (3, 2): \nResidential -Medium/High Density\nCELL (4, 1): \nR-8\nCELL (4, 2): \nResidential -High Density\nCELL (5, 1): \nO&I\nCELL (5, 2): \nOffice and Institutional\nCELL (6, 1): \nNB\nCELL (6, 2): \nNeighborhood Business District\nCELL (7, 1): \nMUD (old B1)\nCELL (7, 2): \nDowntown Mixed Use District\nCELL (8, 1): \nHB (old B2)\nCELL (8, 2): \nHighway Business\nCELL (9, 1): \nLI\nCELL (9, 2): \nLight Industrial District\nCELL (10, 1): \nHI\nCELL (10, 2): \nHeavy Industrial District\nCELL (11, 1): \nHO\nCELL (11, 2): \nHighway Overlay\nCELL (12, 1): \nC - O\nCELL (12, 2): \nConservation Overlay\n"}, {"page": "24", "text": "Denton Zoning Ordinance\nOffice and Institutional (O&I)\nThis district is primarily reserved to accommodate public and quasi-public uses within the\ncommunity including schools, churches, parks, recreation facilities, medical and dental services,\nbusiness offices, government facilities and other public properties.\nNeighborhood Business (NB)\nThis district includes low intensity retail and service uses compatible in scale and design with\nsurrounding neighborhoods and would be suitable for transitional areas between residential and\nbusiness districts.\nDowntown Mixed Use District (MUD)\nThis district includes the historic downtown center and primary fire district of the community and\nallows for a variety of medium and high density uses compatible in scale and design with a\npedestrian friendly 'village' environment. Uses in this district are primarily business and\ncommercial, but mixed uses may include residential use above stores and offices, as well as\nmulti-family (apartments, condominiums) or townhomes developed in-scale with surrounding\nproperties. The district should continue to require brick and other aesthetically pleasing building\nfront facades along the existing Highway Overlay District on Salisbury Street. There should not be\nany minimum lot sizes for this district and setback requirements should support infill that fits the\ncharacter of the existing historic properties.\nHighway Business (HB)\nThis district includes larger-scale, automobile-oriented retail and service uses.\nIndustrial (LI)\nThis district includes facilities for the manufacturing, compounding, assembly, treatment and\nstorage of goods, materials and products.

Conditions to Approval - Specific conditions applicable to the conditional zoning districts may be\nproposed by the petitioner or the Town or its agencies, but only those conditions mutually approved\nby the Town and by the petitioner may be incorporated into the zoning regulations or permit\nrequirements.\n1.\nConditions and site-specific standards imposed in a conditional zoning district shall be\nlimited to those that address the conformance of the development and use of the site to\ntown ordinances and an officially adopted comprehensive or other plan and those that\naddress the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of\nthe site.\n2.\nAny such conditions should relate to the relationship of the proposed use to surrounding\nproperty, proposed support facilities such as parking areas and driveways, pedestrian\nand vehicular circulation systems, screening and buffer areas, the timing of development,\nstreet and right-of-way improvements, water and sewer improvements, stormwater\ndrainage, the provision of open space, and other matters that the Town Commission may\nfind appropriate or the petitioner may propose. Such conditions to approval of the petition\nmay include dedication to the town or state, as appropriate, of any rights-of-way or\neasements for streets, water, sewer, or other public utilities necessary to serve the\nproposed development.\n3. The petitioner shall have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any such\nconditions before final action by the Town Commission. Evidence of the petitioner's\napproval shall be documented by the petitioner's signature on the conditions or in the\nminutes of the meeting in which the conditional zoning is acted upon.\n4.\nIf for any reason any condition for approval is found to be illegal or invalid or if the\npetitioner should fail to accept any condition following approval, the approval of the site\nplan for the district shall be null and void and of no effect and proceedings shall be\ninstituted by the Town to rezone the property to its previous zoning classification or to\nanother zoning district.\n22\n"}, {"page": "28", "text": "Denton Zoning Ordinance\nC.

Exceptions to the following pedestrian\nrecommendations must be approved by the Zoning Enforcement Officer during the site plan review\nprocess (see example graphic of site design).\nEncourage Parking in Rear & Side Yards. An effective way to attract pedestrians to a store and to\nreduce pedestrian-vehicle interaction is to minimize the amount of parking area that a pedestrian must\ntraverse to enter a store. Locating parking spaces in side and rear yards is strongly encouraged (while\nmaintaining any required setbacks).\nMaintain Open Sight Lines. Especially at major turning points inside the parking area.\nProvide Well-Marked Pedestrian Access Perpendicular to Store Fronts. Whenever possible, provide\nperpendicular pedestrian access into the front of a major shopping center or employer. The final crossing\nto the store entrance(s) should be well-marked, preferably with a raised crosswalk and/or colored\ndemarcations to provide clear visual cues to the driver.

Uses of Land or Structures in General\nExcept as specifically provided in this chapter, it shall be unlawful for any person to engage in any activity\nthat causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation. A nonconforming\nsituation is the use of land or existence of a structure that, after the effective date of this Ordinance, is\nprohibited in the district in which it is located.\nSection 10-2. Nonconforming Uses of Open Land\nA nonconforming use of open land consists of open lots used for storage yards, car lots, auto\nwrecking, junkyards, and similar uses where the only buildings on the lot are incidental and\naccessory to the open use of the lot and where the use is not permitted in the zoning district where it\nis located.\nSuch nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied\nby that use when it became nonconforming. Fencing or other screening of the use does not change\nits status as a nonconforming use of open land.\nSection 10-3. Nonconforming Uses of Structures\nA nonconforming use of a structure is a function or purpose, occurring in the particular structure,\nthat is not permitted in the zoning district in which the structure is located.\nA. Enlargement of Structures That Are a Nonconforming Use is Prohibited: Use of a structure for\npurpose that has been made nonconforming by adoption of this ordinance or by rezoning may\nnot be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity.\nB. Maintenance and Repair. Normal maintenance and repair of a structure used for a\nnonconforming purpose is permitted and encouraged, provided it does not extend the\nnonconformity.\nC. Change to Conforming Use: Any nonconforming use of a structure may be changed to a conforming\nuse, or, with the approval of the Board of Adjustment, a nonconforming use may be changed to a use\nmore in character with the uses permitted in the district as long as there is no structural enlargement.\nD. Extension of Use Within a Nonconforming Structure: A nonconforming use of a structure shall not be\nextended or enlarged except into portions of the structure, which, at the time the use became\nnonconforming, were already erected and arranged or designed for such nonconforming use. No\nstructural alterations shall be made in any structure occupied by a nonconforming use, except those\nrequired by law or ordinance or ordered by the Building Inspector to secure the safety of the structure.\nE. Discontinuance of a Nonconforming Use of Structure: When any nonconforming use of a structure is\ndiscontinued for a continuous period of 180 days, any future use of the structure shall be limited to\nthose uses permitted in that district under the provisions of this ordinance. Vacancy and/or non-use of\nthe building, regardless of the intent of the owner or tenant, shall constitute discontinuance under this\nprovision. If active operations are discontinued for a continuous period of twelve (12) months with\nrespect to a nonconforming use, such building, buildings, or land shall thereafter be occupied and\nused only for a conforming use.\nF.\nSingle-Family Residence Exception: Any structure used for a single-family residence that has\nbeen made nonconforming by adoption of this ordinance or by rezoning may be replaced with a\nstructure of the same or a larger size, as long as the replacement does not create new\n76\n"}, {"page": "82", "text": "Denton Zoning Ordinance\nnonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to yard size and\nsetback.

This policy is adopted in the interest of maintaining an adequate stock of housing\nin Denton.\nSection 10-4. Nonconforming Structures\nA nonconforming structure is a structure that does not meet all of the dimensional requirements of this\nordinance for lot coverage, height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or its placement on the\nlot.\nA. Lawful Structures May be Continued: Any structure that was lawful as to its dimensions at the\neffective date of the adoption, amendment or re-adoption of this Ordinance but could not be\nbuilt under its present provisions may be continued as long as it remains.\nB. Enlargement Prohibited: Nonconforming structures shall not be enlarged or expanded.\nIn limited circumstances, the Board of Adjustment, after notice and hearing, may issue a permit\nfor enlargement. The following minimum conditions, in addition to any other reasonable\nconditions, shall be met in order for the Board to grant an extension of the nonconforming\nstructure:\n1. The enlargement does not increase the space devoted to the nonconforming use\n2. The enlargement does not increase the dimensional nonconformity of the use (yard,\nheight, setback requirements)\n3. The enlargement does not enclose previously unenclosed land\nC.\nMaintenance and Repair: Normal maintenance and repair of a nonconforming structure is\npermitted and encouraged provided it does not extend the nonconformity.\nD. Change or Expansion of Uses Within Nonconforming Structures: If no structural alteration or\nenlargements are made, the Board of Adjustment, after notice and hearing, may permit an\nextension of a use or a change to a use more compatible with the district. In permitting such\nextension or change, the Board of Adjustment may require appropriate conditions and\nsafeguards in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance. Such extension or change shall\nnot be permitted to take place beyond the building in which it occurs.\nE. Damage or Destruction: If a nonconforming building is destroyed by any means to an extent of\nmore than fifty (50) percent of its assessed value at time of destruction, such building may not\nbe restored for any nonconforming use.\nSection 10-5. Nonconforming Lots\nA.\nVacant Lots: A nonconforming vacant lot is defined as a lot for which a plat or deed has been\nrecorded in the office of the Davidson County Register of Deeds, which at the time of adoption\nof this Ordinance failed to comply with the minimum area and/or width requirements of the\ndistrict in which it is located.

Process to Claim Vested Right\nA landowner claiming a statutory or common law vested right may submit information to substantiate that\nclaim of a vested right pursuant to North Carolina General Statute 160D-108 on a form to be provided by\nthe Town at the same time as application is made for a zoning map amendment, subdivision plan\napproval, a conditional zoning, a special use permit, a site plan approval or a planned unit development\napproval. The Zoning Administrator shall make an initial determination as to the existence of the vested\nright. The decision of the zoning administrator or officer may be appealed under NCGS 160D-405. On\nappeal, the existence of a vested right shall be reviewed de novo. In lieu of seeking such a determination,\na person claiming a vested right may bring an original civil action as provided by NCGS 160D-405(c).\nSection 11-2. Types and Duration of Statutory Vested Rights\nAmendments to Denton development regulations shall not be applicable or enforceable with regard to\ndevelopment that has been permitted or approved pursuant to NCGS 160D-108 long as one of the types\nof approvals listed in this subsection remains valid and unexpired. Each type of vested right listed in this\nsubsection is defined by and is subject to the limitations provided in this section. Vested rights established\nunder this section are not mutually exclusive. The establishment of a vested right under this section does\nnot preclude the establishment of one or more other vested rights or vesting by common law principles.\nVested rights established by Denton approvals are as follows:\nA.\nSix months - Building permits. - Pursuant to NCGS 160D-1109, a building permit expires six\nmonths after issuance unless work under the permit has commenced. Building permits also expire\nif work is discontinued for a period of 12 months after work has commenced.\nB. One year - Other local development approvals. - Pursuant to NCGS 160D-403(c), unless\notherwise specified by statute or local ordinance, all other local development approvals expire one\nyear after issuance unless work has substantially commenced. Expiration of a local development\napproval shall not affect the duration of a vested right established under this section or vested\nrights established under common law.\nC. Two years - Site-specific vesting plans.\n1.\nDuration. - A vested right for a site-specific vesting plan shall remain vested for a period of\ntwo years. This vesting shall not be extended by any amendments or modifications to a\nsite-specific vesting plan unless expressly provided by Denton ordinance.\n2.\nRelation to building permits. - A right vested as provided in this subsection shall terminate\nat the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to buildings and uses for which no\nvalid building permit applications have been filed. Upon issuance of a building permit, the\nprovisions of NCGS 160D-1109 and NCGS 160D-1113 shall apply, except that the permit\nshall not expire or be revoked because of the running of time while a vested right under this\nsubsection exists.\n3.\nRequirements for site-specific vesting plans. - For the purposes of this section, a \"site-\nspecific vesting plan\" means a plan submitted to the Town of Denton describing with\nreasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of\nproperty. The plan may be in the form of, but not be limited to, any of the following plans or\napprovals: a planned unit development plan, a subdivision plat, a site plan, a preliminary or\ngeneral development plan, a special use permit, a conditional zoning, or any other\ndevelopment approval as guided by Town of Denton ordinance. What constitutes a site-\nspecific vesting plan shall be defined by the relevant development regulation, and the\ndevelopment approval that triggers vesting shall be so identified at the time of its approval.\nAt a minimum, the regulation shall designate a vesting point earlier than the issuance of a\nbuilding permit. In absence of a Town of Denton regulation setting forth what constitutes a\n79\n"}, {"page": "85", "text": "Denton Zoning Ordinance\nsite-specific vesting plan, any development approval shall be considered to be a site-\nspecific vesting plan. A variance shall not constitute a site-specific vesting plan and\napproval of a site-specific vesting plan with the condition that a variance be obtained shall\nnot confer a vested right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained. If a sketch\nplan or other document fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of\nuse for a specified parcel or parcels of property, it may not constitute a site-specific vesting\nplan.\n4.\nProcess for approval and amendment of site-specific vesting plans. - If a site-specific\nvesting plan is based on an approval required by the Town of Denton development\nregulations, a notice and hearing is required for that underlying approval. If the duration of\nthe underlying approval is less than two years, that shall not affect the duration of the site-\nspecific vesting plan established under this subdivision. If the site-specific vesting plan is\nnot based on such an approval, a legislative hearing with notice as required by NCGS\n160D-602 shall be held. The Town of Denton may approve a site-specific vesting plan upon\nsuch terms and conditions as may reasonably be necessary to protect the public health,\nsafety, and welfare. Such conditional approval shall result in a vested right, although failure\nto abide by its terms and conditions will result in a forfeiture of vested rights. The Town of\nDenton shall not require a landowner to waive vested rights as a condition of\ndevelopmental approval. A site-specific vesting plan shall be deemed approved upon the\neffective date of the local government's decision approving the plan or such other date as\ndetermined by the governing board upon approval. An approved site-specific vesting plan\nand its conditions may be amended with the approval of the owner and the local\ngovernment as follows: any substantial modification must be reviewed and approved in the\nsame manner as the original approval; minor modifications may be approved by the Zoning\nAdministrator, if such are defined and authorized by local regulation.\nD. Seven years - Multiphase developments. - A multiphase development shall be vested for the entire\ndevelopment with the zoning regulations, subdivision regulations, and unified development\nordinances in place at the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the\nmultiphase development. This right shall remain vested for a period of seven years from the time a\nsite plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multiphase development. For purposes of\nthis subsection, \"multiphase development\" means a development containing 100 acres or more\nthat (i) is submitted for site plan approval for construction to occur in more than one phase and (ii)\nis subject to a master development plan with committed elements, including a requirement to offer\nland for public use as a condition of its master development plan approval.\nE. Indefinite - Development agreements. - A vested right of reasonable duration may be specified in a\ndevelopment agreement approved under NCGS 160D-1001.\nSection 11-3. Continuing Review\nFollowing approval or conditional approval of a statutory vested right, the Town may make subsequent\nreviews and require subsequent approvals to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the\noriginal approval, provided that such reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original\napproval. The Town may revoke the original approval for failure to comply with applicable terms and\nconditions of the original approval or the applicable development regulations.\nSection 11-4. Exceptions\nThe provisions of this section are subject to the following:\nA. A vested right, once established precludes any zoning action that would change, alter, impair,\nprevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development or use of the property as set forth in an\napproved vested right, except when any of the following conditions are present:\n1.\nThe written consent of the affected landowner.\n80\n"}, {"page": "86", "text": "Denton Zoning Ordinance\nB.

Otherwise applicable new regulations\nshall become effective with respect to property that is subject to a vested right established under\nthis section upon the expiration or termination of the vested rights period provided for in this\nsection.\nC. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the establishment of a vested right under this section\nshall not preclude, change, or impair the authority of a local government to adopt and enforce\ndevelopment regulation provisions governing nonconforming situations or uses.\nSection 11-5. Miscellaneous Provisions\nA vested right obtained under this section is not a personal right but shall attach to and run with the\napplicable property. After approval of a vested right all successors to the original landowner shall be\nentitled to exercise such rights. Nothing in this section shall preclude judicial determination, based on\ncommon law principles or other statutory provisions, that a vested right exists in a particular case or that a\ncompensable taking has occurred.

Development Agreements\nA. Purpose\nThe purpose of this Article is to establish standards and procedures for the Town to enter\ninto Development Agreements for long-term, large-scale developments, in recognition of the\nfollowing findings and statements of intent:\n1. Large-Scale Development Projects and Long-Term Commitment of Resources\nLarge-scale development projects often occur in multiple phases extending over a period of\nyears, requiring a long-term commitment of both public and private resources.\n2. Potential Community Impacts\nSuch large-scale developments often create potential community impacts and potential\nopportunities that are difficult or impossible to accommodate within traditional zoning\nprocesses.\n3.\nCareful Integration between Public Capital Facilities Planning, Financing, Schedules\nBecause of their scale and duration, such large-scale projects often require careful integration\nbetween public capital facilities planning, financing and construction schedules and the\nphasing of the private development.\n4.\nStable Development Standards\nBecause of their scale and duration, such large-scale projects involve substantial\ncommitments of private capital by private developers, which private developers are unwilling to\nrisk without sufficient assurances that development standards will remain stable through the\nextended period of the development.\n5. Nontraditional Development Types\nBecause of their size and duration, such developments often permit communities and\ndevelopers to experiment with different or nontraditional types of development concepts and\nstandards, while still managing the impacts on the surrounding areas.\n6. Negotiating Flexibility\nTo better structure and manage development approvals for such large-scale developments\nand ensure their proper integration into local capital facilities programs, local governments\nneed the flexibility in negotiating such developments.\n7. Plan Consistency\nIn negotiating for such developments, it is the intent of the Town to remain consistent with the\nadopted plans, policies, and goals of the Town as they relate to land use and capital\nimprovements.\nB. Authority\nThe Town may enter into a Development Agreement with a developer, subject to the procedures\nand standards of this Article. In entering into such a Development Agreement, the Town may not\nexercise any authority or make any commitment not authorized by general or local act and may\nnot impose any tax or fee not authorized by otherwise applicable law. If more than one local\ngovernment is made party to an agreement, the agreement must specify which local government\nis responsible for the overall administration of the Development Agreement.\n82\n"}, {"page": "88", "text": "Denton Zoning Ordinance\nC. Relationship to Prior Development Approvals\nAlthough an application for a Development Agreement generally is submitted and reviewed\nbefore, or in conjunction with, the first development approval required for the proposed\ndevelopment (e.g., a Mixed Use Development), such an application may be submitted and\ndecided at any stage of the development. If the application is submitted after development\napprovals have been granted, either the Development Agreement should incorporate the terms\nand conditions of those prior approvals or any approval of the Development Agreement shall be\ncontingent upon any amendments to those prior approvals necessary to ensure conformance\nbetween the Development Agreement and applicable development approvals.\nD.
