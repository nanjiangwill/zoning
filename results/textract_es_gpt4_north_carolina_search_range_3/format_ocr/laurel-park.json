The\nactivities and uses are configured to promote small and medium-sized lots in a pedestrian-scaled, mixed-use district\nwhich caters to the everyday needs of nearby neighborhoods, emphasizing accessibility by automobiles, bicycles, and\npedestrians. The design and arrangement of buildings, structures, facilities, and landscaping should emphasize\ncompatibility between the district and adjacent residential and commercial areas.\n2.8.2: INTENT\nThe following are the MM district's primary intentions:\nA. To serve as a transitional area between residential and non-residential zones;\nB. To create a mixed-use, small-town character that distinguishes the area along the US 64 corridor;\nC.\nTo allow a range of small-scale commercial and institutional uses within easy walking distance of adjoining\nresidential homes;\nD.\nTo accommodate a variety of housing types and discourage one housing type from dominating the streetscape;\nE.\nTo ensure that commercial and institutional uses have a character that is compatible with the existing nearby\nresidential development;\nF.\nTo promote pedestrian orientation of streets;\nG.

The\ndistrict is the prime gateway into the Town of Laurel Park and is the cultural and economic center of the Town. Building\nwithin the district is scaled and massed appropriately together and set close to the street and to each other, inviting\npedestrians to walk from place to place, with mixed uses that will serve a multitude of purposes for both residents and\nvisitors. The district is intended to provide for the most frequent daily needs of the residents in a compact area rather\nthan a commercial strip catering to a more regional market. Development within the district is to provide adequate\naccess, off-street parking, and setbacks to maintain traffic flow. The design and arrangement of buildings, structures,\nfacilities, and landscaping should emphasize the compatibility sought between the commercial service areas and\nadjacent residential areas. The district will expand the availability of land eligible for commercial activity through\nincreased density and building height, while at the same time protecting adjacent residential neighborhoods through\nthe use of landscaping, building design controls, and by limiting the height and scale of structures along the district\nedge.\n2.9.2: INTENT\nThe following are the TC district's primary intentions:\nA.

To provide for a safe, convenient parking and circulation system that balances multi-modal uses but that gives\npriority to pedestrian movement and access, with multiple pedestrian entrances into the district and robust\nconnections between land uses;\nD. To promote a mixture of land uses including civic and cultural, shopping, restaurants, offices, and residences;\nE. To establish community identity and ensure that new development is aesthetically pleasing through the\nappropriate use of building mass and orientation, building materials, lighting, and landscaping;\nF.\nTo protect the character of adjacent residential development through the use of landscaping, limitations upon\nexterior lighting, and appropriate transitions in building height and mass;\nG. To promote pedestrian orientation of streets and buildings;\nH. To develop businesses, institutions, streets, parks, and homes that promote social interaction;\nI.\nTo use civic and cultural spaces as community focal points;\nJ.\nTo provide and connect to recreational opportunities;\nK.

The terrain\nof the community is highly varied with ridgelines, steep slopes, geologic hazards, valleys, and riparian areas that\ntransect the community. The microclimate, soil conditions, and variations in terrain found in mountainous areas can\ncontribute to high velocity stormwater runoff, soil subsidence, and accretion of sediment and vegetated material that\ncan exacerbate flooding conditions in lower elevations. These factors have deleterious effects on public safety, the\nfunctioning of public infrastructure, and private investment. As a result, the Town Council finds that it is necessary\nand in the public interest to adopt development regulations that consider the sensitive nature of the terrain and that\nestablish higher standards of review for lands with steep slopes and geologic hazards. These development regulations\nare considered to be the minimum standards necessary in order to preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the\ncitizens of Laurel Park.\n3.1.2: PURPOSE AND INTENT\nA: These standards are proposed to regulate the development of land with steep and very steep slopes or\ngeologic hazards in order to preserve the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Laurel Park.\nThe standards are intended to ensure that development located on a lot or site with steep slopes or geologic\nhazards does not result in:\n1: The slumping, sliding, or washing of land to downslope areas;\n2: Landslides or debris flow to adjacent lands or public infrastructure;\n3: Loss of life, injury, or property damage, including to public infrastructure and utilities;\n4: Accelerated erosion or sedimentation resulting in decreased water quality, watercourse alteration, or off-\nsite flooding;\n5: Loss of living tree cover or vegetation, accumulation of deadfall, and accelerated risk of forest fire; and\n6: Increasing maintenance costs of public infrastructure and improvements.\n(AMENDED 12-15-22 UDOTA 3-22)\nB: The standards are also intended to require sites with steep and very steep slopes or geologic hazards to\ndisperse stormwater runoff from the development sites unless such dispersal could increase the possibility of\nlandslide hazards on the site.\n(AMENDED 12-15-22 UDOTA 3-22)\nC: In cases where a geo-technical evaluation determines that landslide hazards or soil instability are likely\nbecause of stormwater dispersal, then development on the site shall include stormwater control measures\nthat retain a portion of the stormwater falling onto or washing into a site, limit the infiltration of stormwater\ninto surrounding the soil, and release it in a gradual manner at a non-erosive velocity.\n(AMENDED 12-15-22 UDOTA 3-22)\nD: These standards are included in the Ordinance in recognition of and in response to the increased amount of\naverage rainfall occurring in Laurel Park relative to the State average.\n(AMENDED 05-17-22 UDOTA1-22; 12-15-22 UDOTA 3-22)\nE: Establishment of open space set-asides in unbuildable areas with

site.\n(AMENDED 12-15-22 UDOTA 3-22)\n3: Applications for development proposed on lands with very steep slopes must be accompanied by a site-\nspecific geologic analysis of the very steep slope portion of the site to be disturbed by the proposed\ndevelopment plan, paid for by the applicant, and conducted by a North Carolina licensed geologist, to\ndetermine whether that plan can be developed

impervious\nsurface (e.g., rooftops, driveways, patios, etc.) to multiple, different areas of vegetated pervious surface\nlocated throughout a development site. Instead of collecting stormwater and discharging it at\nconcentrated volumes to one or two off-site points, rainwater is directed to numerous different on-site\nlocations where it is encouraged to infiltrate into the soil.\n3: ALLOWABLE METHODS\nAllowable methods of stormwater dispersal include, but are not limited to the following (see Figure\n3.1.5.A, Dispersal Techniques):\na: Disconnected downspouts located in logical dispersed locations around a structure, such as adjacent\nto structural corners, that drain to flat or relatively flat vegetated areas of a site;\nb: Use of green roofs that retain stormwater;\nC: Use of rain gardens, bio-retention cells, dry wells, or planting beds located at strategic points of\nstormwater flow;\nd: Use of pervious paving or pavers;\ne: Avoiding impervious edging along a paved surface that will channel stormwater runoff to a single\npoint;\nf:\nUse of rainwater harvesting devices like cisterns or rain barrels that capture rainwater for subsequent\nand directed hand watering;\ng: Dispersion trenches of two-to-three feet in depth filled with crushed stone and a notched weir or\nspreader board on the downslope side of the trench;\nh: Level spreaders intended to facilitate localized sheet flow of rainwater runoff across a site; and\nCELL (1, 1): \nTown of Laurel Park\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \nUnified Development Ordinance\nCELL (2, 1): \nEffective Date: 8.18.21\nCELL (2, 2): \nPAGE 80\nCELL (2, 3): \nLast Amended: 8.15.23\n"}, {"page": "81", "text": "CHAPTER 3: ENVIRONMENT\nSECTION 3.1: SITES WITH SLOPES OR GEOLOGIC HAZARDS\ni:\nOther techniques as approved by the Planning Board during the site plan review.\nFIGURE 3.1.5.A: DISPERSAL TECHNIQUES\nDisconnected Downspout\nRain Garden\nWIDTH\nDISCONNECTED ROOF\nONE-HALF OF LENGTH\nVEGETATED RECEIVING AREA\nLENGTH\nMIN. 0.04 TIMES\nCONTRIBUTING\nROOF AREA\nSPLASH PAD\nREQUIRED\nDOWNSPOUT\nDISCHARGE UPSLOPE\nOF VEGETATED AREA\nCONTRIBUTING ROOF\nAREA (MAX 500 SF PER\nHOME\nDOWNSPOUT)\nFOOTPRINT\nTYP.\nPONDING DEPTH\nF D A\nB\nD F\n3\" MULCH LAYER\nWATER FLOW\nOVER FLOW\nBERM*\n12-36\"\nEXCAVATED/\nAMENDED SOIL DEPTH\nEXISTING UNCOMPACTED SOIL\nGreen Roof\nLevel Spreader\nSLOPE\nDispersion Trench\n(Plan View)\nCleanout\nInflow\nEndcap\n(from wye)\nor plug\nSlope\nTrench parallel to contour line\nNotched grade board\nCatch basin\nCollection vault served by downspout\nor other source\nSlope\nPipe\n12\" min.
