154.001 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES.\n(A) The goal of the Town of Beech Mountain's Zoning Ordinance is to provide for orderly\nprogress in the present and future growth of the town and to preserve, as far as is possible, Beech\nMountain in its natural state. The town should continue to grow, emphasizing its natural\nsurroundings of forest land, wildlife, and natural streams. The Zoning Ordinance should seek to\nensure the serenity of a natural environment and restrict to a minimum any artificial growth which\nwould destroy that which nature has provided.\n(B) The following goals serve as a guide for the preparation of this Zoning Ordinance, as well as\nfuture planning elements, and for the fulfillment of the projected needs of the community.\n(1) To provide for orderly and progressive development within Beech Mountain enhancing and\naccentuating the existing favorable qualities of the Town and diminish those features that detract\nfrom the most beneficial development of the Town.\n(2)\nTo promote the coordinated growth and development of the Town of Beech Mountain.\n(3) To provide for orderly residential growth.\n(4) To protect the environment and ecology of the area.\n(C) Beech Mountain's greatest asset is its natural beauty.

Each General Use\nDistrict category serves a different purpose and imposes its own set of requirements and\nrestrictions on the use of land in addition to the general requirements and restrictions imposed on\nall land or uses within the planning jurisdiction. A General Use District may be layered with an\nOverlay District.\n(A) Each district described below constitutes a General Use District.\n(1) Low Density Single-Family Residential District (R-1). The Low Density Single-Family\nResidential District is primarily intended to provide locations for low density residential and related\ntype development in areas where more intense development is not practical. These areas are not\nlikely to have public water and sewer services available and are located away from the main\ndeveloped area of Beech Mountain. The minimum required lot area will be 40,000 square feet\nunless additional land is required for adequate sewage disposal.\n(2)\nSingle-Family Residential District (R-2, R-2A). 1 The Single-Family Residential District is\nprimarily intended to provide locations for single-family residential and supporting uses in areas\nwhere public water and sewer services are available or will likely be provided in the future. This\ndistrict is further intended to protect existing single-family subdivisions from encroachment of\nincompatible land uses and thus does not allow mobile homes or mobile home parks. This district\nwill be applied within those areas designated on the Land Use Plan as Single-Family Residential\nand platted as single-family residential subdivisions.\n29 of 198\n4/30/24,\n"}, {"page": "30", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/2050bacc-5248-438d-91..\n(3) Multi-Family High Density Residential District (R-3A and R-3B). These districts are\nintended for a variety of residential uses, including single-family houses, duplexes and multi-family\nbuildings and developments, depending upon the availability of public water and sewer services.\nSome areas within these districts may not have adequate water and sewer services available for\nthe higher densities and will thus be suitable for single-family residential units. Other areas within\nthese districts will have adequate public water and sewer service available and will thus be suitable\nfor higher density uses such as multi-family residential units and Planned Unit Developments.\nThese districts also provide for various recreational and community service uses that will\ncomplement the residential development. These districts will be applied within those areas\ndesignated on the Land Use Plan as Multi-Family Residential, R-3A and R-3B. 2, 3\n(4) Commercial Service Districts (CS-1 and CS-2). The Commercial Service Districts (CS-1)\n(CS-2) are primarily intended to provide suitable locations for clustered commercial development,\nto encourage the concentration of commercial activity in those specified areas with access to major\ntraffic arteries, and to discourage strip commercial development. These districts will usually be\napplied to existing commercial developments on sites within areas designated on the Land Use\nPlan as Commercial Service Centers. These districts may also be applied to suitable areas\nadjacent to existing commercial concentrations to allow for their expansion. CS-2 shall be\ncontiguous to other commercial zones.\n(5) Private-Public Service District (PS and PS-C). The Private-Public Service District (PS) is\nprimarily intended to be an area containing a concentration of private and public service activities\nsuch as schools, recreation parks and emergency services, amidst population centers. This district\nwill apply to those areas designated on the Land Use Plan as Private-Public Service Centers.\n(6) Beech Mountain Resort District (BMR). The Beech Mountain Resort District (BMR) is\nprimarily intended to be an area used as a ski resort, theme park or similar recreational area.

The Board of Adjustments shall deny any\napplication for a special use permit for a wind energy system that it determines will be out of\nharmony with the character of the community and its land use plan for the area in which the turbine\nis proposed, that it determines would be unsafe or presents a potential safety hazard, or that it\ndetermines will be a nuisance due to its appearance, size, noise generated, and the like. In making\nsuch a determination, the Board shall consider the following standards.\n(a) Use. Accessory systems are to be located on the same tract of land as a permitted\nresidential dwelling or commercial building, and are to be designed such that their primary function\nis to produce energy for consumption by the residential dwelling or commercial building with which\nthey share the lot or tract of land.\n(b) Frequency. A maximum of one wind energy system-accessory unit is permitted per lot.\n(c) Site location and setback. Accessory units are not permitted in street yards (the portion\nof the yard that abuts a street or road and is nearer to the street or road than the primary structure\non the lot). Wind energy systems may not be located in or overhang above the required building\nsetbacks for a lot or tract.\n(d) Height. Accessory units may not extend to a height of greater than 15 feet above the\nhighest point of the structure to which they are accessory or 50 feet in total height, whichever is\nlesser. Total height shall be measured vertically from the highest point of the wind energy system to\nthe ground.

In\nsuch a response, the landowner shall set forth reasons for the operational difficulty and provide a\nreasonable timetable for corrective action. If the town deems the timetable for corrective action as\nunreasonable, the town shall notify the landowner and such landowner shall remove the energy\nsystem with 120 days of receipt of the notice.\n(S) Manufacturing/processing, light.\n(1) Purpose. The Council finds that the residential/resort character of the area within Beech\nMountain's planning jurisdiction is incompatible with the development of such area for\nmanufacturing/processing uses except to the extent that such uses create none of the negative\nimpacts often associated with such manufacturing/processing uses. Therefore, no manufacturing/\nprocessing use within any zoning district may:\n(a) Emit from a vent, stock, chimney, or combustion process any smoke that is visible to the\nnaked eye that is a result of the process of manufacturing, processing, creating, repairing,\nrenovating, painting, cleaning, or assembling of goods, merchandise, or equipment.\n(b) Generate noise in the course of manufacturing of greater than 40 decibels as measured\nat the lot line between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Between the hours of 5 p.m. and 9 a.m. the\n61 of 198\n4/30/24, 21:02\n"}, {"page": "62", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/2050bacc-5248-438d-91...\nTown of Beech Mountain's general noise regulations as coded in \u00a7 94.25 of the Beech Mountain\nCode of Ordinances shall apply.\n(c) Generate any ground transmitted vibration that is perceptible to the human sense of\ntouch measured at the lot line.\n(d) Generate any odor that reaches the \"odor threshold\" measured at the lot line. For\npurposes of this subdivision, the ODOR THRESHOLD is defined as the minimum concentration in\nair of a agas, vapor, or particulate matter that can be detected by the olfactory systems of a panel\nof healthy observers.\n(e) Require for its operations a daily average of more than 200 gallons of water per\nemployee.\n(f) Create any electrical disturbance that adversely affects any operations or equipment\nother than those of the creator of such disturbance, or otherwise causes, creates, or contributes to\nthe interference with electronic signals (including television and radio broadcasting transmissions)\nto the extent that the operation of any equipment not owned by the creator of such disturbance is\nadversely affected.\n(g) Store materials necessary for the manufacturing or processing activity in a location\nwhere such materials are visible from beyond the boundaries of the property on which the\nmanufacturing/processing facility is located.\n(h) Semi-trucks or tractor trailers may be used to deliver or pick up materials but may not\nremain on the premises continuously for more than 48 hours. Such trucks or trailers may not be\nused as a means to store materials necessary for the manufacturing or processing activity or\nfinished products of the manufacturing activity.\n(i) Manufacturing/processing, light facilities already in existence at the time of the adoption of\nthis subsection shall be required to apply for special use permits and comply with the requirements\nherein.\n(T) Alternative building methods in the Commercial Thoroughfare Overlay District.\n(1) Roof designs, building materials, building sizes (scale), color schemes, window types and\nnumbers, and landscaping arrangements, other than those specifically listed as allowed in \u00a7\n154.122, may be allowed if the totality of the design indicates harmony and compatibility with the\nCommercial Thoroughfare Overlay District, and its purpose of fostering a functional, visually\nappealing and vibrant commercial district in Beech Mountain.\n(2) The Board may impose additional conditions necessary to ensure the proposed use will be\ncompliant with the spirit and intent of the Commercial Thoroughfare Overlay District.\n(U) Sexually oriented businesses.\n(1) (a) The purpose of the following special use standards shall be to set forth the regulatory\nand requirements for adult establishments located within the town. Adult establishments, because\nof their very nature are recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics.\nStudies and experiences that are relevant to North Carolina have shown that lower property values\nand increased crime rates tend to accompany and are brought about by adult establishments. The\nTown Council finds that regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse\nsecondary effects do not contribute to the blighting of surrounding neighborhoods and to regulate\nacts, omissions or conditions detrimental to the health, safety or welfare and the peace and dignity\n62 of 198\n4/30/24, 21:02\n"}, {"page": "63", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://export.amlegal.com/api/export-requests/2050bacc-5248-438d-91.\nof the town. Regulations to achieve these purposes can be accomplished by the procedures set\nforth hereinafter.\n(b) The provisions of the following standards have neither the purpose nor effect for\nimposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including\nsexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of these standards to restrict or\ndeny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended\nmarket. These standards represent a balancing of the legitimate ends of the community by\nimposing an incidental, content neutral place, time and manner regulation of sexually oriented\nbusinesses, without limiting alternative avenues of communication and at the same time, requiring\nthe business to carry its share of financing administrative and enforcement activities.\n(2) Definitions.

New plant material shall complement existing site vegetation, should be\nmixed with it and should be integrated with all other natural site features.\n(I) Parking lots; parking lot yards. The purpose of this section is to ensure that the Commercial\nThoroughfare Overlay District of Beech Mountain is an attractive and appealing place for residents\nand visitors. This often means that a higher priority must be placed upon being an attractive and\nfunctional place for people than being convenient for automobiles.\n(1) Parking location. Parking is encouraged to be located to the rear or sides of buildings, with\nthe building fronting on the public way. However, nothing in this section is to prevent the\nestablishment of parking in front of a building so long as the project adheres to all other relevant\nregulations. When parking is to be established in front of buildings, it is recommended that the\napplicant create and utilize on-street parking if such is approved by the NCDOT and/or the town.\n(For the purposes of this section, ON-STREET PARKING is defined as a parking area without a\ndivider between the street and the parking area, in which automobiles directly access the parking\nspaces from the road. On-street parking may be parallel, angled or straight in, as approved by the\nNCDOT and the town.)\n(J) Buffer yards. The purpose of the buffer yard is to provide a transitional area between uses\nthat may differ in development intensity and density. A BUFFER YARD is defined as a planting yard\nthat serves as a visual separation between uses and should be densely planted. No buildings,\nparking areas or other development may encroach within the buffer yard, with the exception of\ntown-approved public walkways or sidewalks.

Normal maintenance, however, is permitted.\n(B) Exceptions. Particular features or concerns regarding the following types of signs provide\ncompelling reasons for their regulation in a different manner from other signs of similar duration of\ndisplay or located within a common zoning district.\n(1) Private traffic directional signs located on private property not to exceed three square feet.\nThe town finds there is a compelling need for private property owners to be able to control aspects\nof traffic on private property in order to avoid damage to property and inconveniences and potential\ndangers caused by the restriction of ingress and egress to a property by methods such as\ndesignating parking spaces and restricting \"no parking\" areas, identifying \"one-way\" driveways and\nthe like with the standard, commercially available signage commonly associated with these\npurposes. Therefore, these signs need not comply with material and style requirements, limitations\non number, and other requirements and are exempt from this section.\n(2) Signs erected to prohibit trespassing displayed in accordance with North Carolina State\nlaw.

Therefore, these signs need not comply with material and style requirements,\nlimitations on number, and other requirements and are exempt from this section, provided that the\nnumber, size, or other features of such signs is not in excess of that prescribed by state law.\n(3) Non-illuminated trade names and graphics which are customarily painted on newspaper\nand soft drink dispensers and similar outdoor amenities. The town finds there is a compelling\ninterest in exempting these signs from regulation due to their ubiquitous nature and the\nimpracticality or inability to obtain soft drink dispensers and the like without such trade names or\ngraphics. Therefore, these signs are exempt from the requirements of this section.\n(a) Parties affected. All structures, residential, multi-family, and commercial are required to\ndisplay the assigned street number in the manner described in this section.\n(b) Visibility. Street numbers shall be displayed so as to be conspicuously visible and legible\nfrom the street from both directions.

When the mailbox is clustered\nwith other mailboxes or is across the street from the primary structure, the numbers will be placed\non the front of the mailbox. There could be confusion as to the primary structure access by using\nnumbers on the mailbox than prudence would dictate placing the numbers on a post at the primary\nstructure access point on the street. Mailboxes across the street or otherwise located across the\nstreet are not adequate for the purposes of this section.\n4. Trash bins. Numbers of a minimum of three inches in height, reflective, and shall be\naffixed to both sides of the trash bins serving the primary structure.\n(e) Unauthorized building numbers prohibited. No person shall affix or allow to remain upon\nany building in the Town of Beech Mountain any different number from the one designated by this\nsection, with the exception of dates affixed for historical purpose.\n(1989 Code, Title V, Ch. 51, Art.
