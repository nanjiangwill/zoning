UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nThis document is the draft version of the Town of Franklinton, NC, Unified Development Ordinance (or \"UDO\").\nIt\ncontains the rules that control how land can be used in the Town, what kinds of uses may be located in particular\nlocations, how new development must be configured, and how land may be subdivided into separate parcels. The\nfollowing paragraphs explain some of the attributes of this document.\nThe draft Unified Development Ordinance is intended to update and consolidate Chapter 153, Subdivisions, and\nChapter 154, the Zoning Code of the Town Code of Ordinances into a single consolidated Chapter 156, Unified\nDevelopment Ordinance. The UDO is regulatory (not advisory) in nature, and compliance with its requirements is\nmandatory.\nThis draft document contains 9 articles that consolidate similar kinds of provisions, like: procedures, zoning districts,\nuse standards, infrastructure standards, or development standards. The first pages of each article in this document\nincludes the article's contents.\nThis draft document includes a text formatting system comprised of numbered section and subsection headings\nthat are designed to help code users understand how the text in the document is organized. Section headings\ninclude different color backgrounds and subsection headings use underlining to help them be more visible.\nThe top of almost every page includes a listing of the particular article number and name, as well as the appropriate\nsection number and name of the text on that particular page. Users may use the tops of pages to navigate quickly\nthrough the document. Page numbers are included at the bottom of each page. Some articles, like Article 156.2:\nProcedures, also include an introductory section that explains how the regulations in the article are structured and\nhow to use them effectively.\nThroughout this draft document, users will see underlined text. Underlined text shows cross references to other\nsections or subsections in the document. As with the table of contents entries, users of the digital version of this\ndocument may click on a cross reference, and the digital document will automatically scroll to the location in the\ndocument being cross referenced.\nAn index of key terms is located at the back of the UDO so that users may quickly find the portion of the desired\nregulations. In addition to the index, the digital version of this document is fully searchable.

It allows much smaller lot sizes but also requires the development to be fully screened from view from adjacent\nmajor roadways and existing adjacent residential subdivisions.\nTown of Franklinton, NC\nLast Updated: 6.15.21\nUnified Development Ordinance\nPage 37\n"}, {"page": "50", "text": "Article 156.2 PROCEDURES\nSection 2.4 Specific Procedures Subsection 2.4.4 Conservation Subdivision\nThe applicant shall prepare a site analysis map that analyzes existing conditions both on the\nland proposed for the development including land within 500 feet of the site, and submit the\nsite analysis map to the Zoning Administrator.

Use classifications are further broken down\ninto a series of general \"use categories\" and specific \"use types.\"\nB.\nUSE CATEGORIES\nThe use categories describe the major sub-groups of the respective use classifications and are\nbased on common functional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of\nactivity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site\nconditions. For example, the Residential Use Classification is divided into the Household Living\nand Group Living use categories. Use categories are further broken down into a series of individual\n\"use types.\"\nC.\nUSE TYPES\nThe specific use types are included in the respective use category. They identify the specific\nprincipal uses that are considered to fall within characteristics identified in the use category. For\nexample, single-family detached dwellings, two-family dwellings, multi-family dwellings,\nmanufactured homes, and upper-story residential are use types in the Household Living use\ncategory.\nD.\nDEVELOPMENTS WITH MULTIPLE PRINCIPAL USES\nWhen all principal uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is\nassigned to that use category. When the principal uses of a development fall within different use\ncategories, then each principal use is classified in the applicable use category and each use is\nsubject to applicable regulations for that use category. Developments with multiple principal uses,\nsuch as shopping centers, shall incorporate only those use types allowed in the applicable zoning\ndistrict.\n4.2.3 USE CATEGORIES IN THE AGRICULTURAL USE CLASSIFICATION\nTable 4.2.3, Agricultural Use Classification, sets out the use categories included in the agricultural use\nclassification in Table 4.1.7, Principal Use Table.

Collected funds could be utilized to further improve an existing park facility in a proximate\nlocation;\n4. The topography or other natural conditions of the site do not provide adequate opportunities\nfor on-site recreation and park areas;\n5. The amount of park land to be dedicated is too small to provide adequate recreation and park\nopportunities or to be efficiently maintained;\n6. The intended location of the park land is too far from existing recreation and park areas to be\nefficiently maintained; or\n7.
