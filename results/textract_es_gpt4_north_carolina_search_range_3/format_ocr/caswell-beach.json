This district is intended for single-family housing at a specific density; such\nas 20,000 square feet per residence. The regulations are designed to maintain a suitable environment for family living.\n(B) Single-family residential districts (R-20, R-12, R-8). These districts are intended primarily for single-family houses at\nvarious densities of population. Certain non-residential uses of public or semi-public nature are permitted. The regulations\nfor these districts are designed to maintain a suitable environment for family living. Densities of development are controlled\nby minimum lot area requirements, which are different with each district. The minimum lot area requirements, in thousands of\nsquare feet, is indicated by the numerical identification of each district.\n(C) Multi-family residential district (R-20MF). The purpose of the R-20MF multi-family district is to provide for low density\napartment development in areas which would be unsuited for multi-family use on a higher density. By having high\ndimensional standards and requiring site plan approval, maximum control of development can be achieved through this\ndistrict.\n(D) R-MH Mobile homes district. The purpose of this district is to provide for the development of properly located and\nplanned facilities for mobile homes. It is recognized that mobile homes should be located in mobile home parks and\nsubdivisions only and that such areas must be carefully located and designed to meet the needs of the residents and to\nachieve a satisfactory relationship to adjoining and nearby property.\n(E) Resort residential condominium district. This district is designed primarily as a district for resort-style condominiums\nserving visitors and tourists, composed of multi-family dwellings, parking and accessory uses such as sales and rental\noffices and recreation amenities.\n(F) Business district. Reserved.\n(G) Conservation. This district is intended to preserve and protect fragile estuarine cosystem from adverse affects\ncreated by incompatible uses.\n(H) Commercial recreation district (CR).\n(1) This district is established to maintain and protect the existing golf course and related uses. The principal use of the\nland is for recreational pursuits which are in keeping with the town's low density single-family residential development. It is\nalso the intent to limit the uses to those that presently exist.\n(a) Golf course;\n(b) Golf club house and pro shop;\n(c) Swimming pool;\n(d) Tennis courts;\n(e) Accessory buildings for golf course maintenance;\n(f) Restaurants with lounge.\n(2) Any new uses (not listed in subdivision (H)(1)) will require the zoning amendment procedure.\n(I) Non-commercial recreation district (NCR). The purpose of this district is to provide and maintain public access to the\ndesignated park land and the beach.\n(1) It is the intent of this section to limit the use to those that presently exist:\n(a) Education;\n(b) Preservation and maintenance, including historic preservation;\n"}, {"page": "8", "text": "(c) Beach access;\n(d) Parking;\n(e) Fund raising in support of the above uses, including the sale of souvenir items.\n(2) Any new uses not listed in subdivision (I)(1) shall require amendment of this section.\n(Ord. passed 6-8-78; Am.

It shall also hear and decide all matters referred to it or on which the zoning code\nrequires it to pass. In deciding appeals the Board may hear both those based on an allegedly improper or erroneous\ninterpretation of the code and those based on alleged hardship resulting from strict interpretation of the code.

If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant\nmay file with the official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board shall meet to hear the appeal within\n15 days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, appeals of decisions granting a\ndevelopment approval or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the development regulation\ndoes not stay the further review of an application for development approvals to use the property; in these situations, the\nappellant or town may request and the Board may grant a stay of a final decision of development approval applications,\nincluding building permits affected by the issue being appealed.\n(B) Procedure for filing appeals. No appeal shall be heard by the Board of Adjustment unless a complete application for\nan appeal hearing is filed within 30 days after the interested party or parties receive notice of the final order, requirement,\ndecision, or determination by the Zoning Administrator. Any other person with standing to appeal has 30 days from receipt\nfrom any source of actual or constructive notice of the determination within which to file an appeal.

An application for a rehearing may be made in the same manner as an application for an original\nhearing. Evidence in support of the application shall initially be limited to what is necessary to enable the Board to determine\nwhether there has been a substantial change in the facts, evidence, or conditions in the case.

The\ndecision may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from.\nWhen a special use permit is granted, the record shall state in detail any facts that support findings required to be made\nbefore such permit is issued.\n(b) The Chair or his or her designee shall rule on objections and motions to quash subpoenas. Objections regarding\njurisdictional and evidentiary issues, including, but not limited to, the timeliness of an appeal or the standing of a party, may\nbe made to the Board.

Unless otherwise specified, any order or decision of the Board granting a special use permit\nshall expire if the applicant does not obtain a building permit or certificate of occupancy for such use within 12 months from\nthe date of the decision.\n(4) Voting at hearings. The concurring vote of four- fifths of the Board members shall be necessary to grant a variance\nfrom the ordinance provisions. All other decisions shall be made by a majority vote. However, vacant seats and disqualified\nmembers are not considered in calculating four-fifths votes if there are no qualified alternates.\n(5) A variance may only be issued when the following findings of fact are made by the Board of Adjustment. The\nburden of proving these conditions exist is on the applicant.\n(a) Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance. It shall not be necessary to\ndemonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.\n(b) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography.\nHardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the\nneighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance.\n(c) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing\nproperty with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-\ncreated hardship.\n(d) The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the ordinance, such that public safety is\n"}, {"page": "29", "text": "secured, and substantial justice is achieved.\n(6) Notice and public records of decisions.

After thorough review, including public forums if\ndeemed necessary, the Planning Board shall submit to the Board of Commissioners a written statement as to whether the\nproposed amendment is consistent with the town's comprehensive long range planning document. When conducting a\nreview of proposed zoning text or map amendments pursuant to this section, the Planning Board shall advise and comment\non whether the proposed action is consistent with any comprehensive plan that has been adopted and any other officially\nadopted plan that is applicable. The Planning Board shall provide a written recommendation to the Board of Commissioners\nthat addresses plan consistency, but a comment by the Planning Board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the\ncomprehensive plan shall not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed amendment by the Board of\nCommissioners. If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a \"large-scale rezoning\" under G.S. \u00a7 160D-602(b), the Planning\nBoard statement describing plan consistency may address the overall rezoning and describe how the analysis and policies\nin the relevant adopted plans were considered in the recommendation made.\n(B) Hearing and notice requirements. A public hearing shall be held by the Board of Commissioners before adoption of\nany proposed amendment to this chapter. A notice of such public hearing shall be given once a week for two successive\ncalendar weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the town, the notice to be published the first time not less than ten\ndays nor more than 25 days prior to the date established for such public hearing. Whenever there is a zoning map\namendment, the owner of that parcel of land shown on the county tax listing, and the owners of all parcels of land abutting\nthat parcel of land as shown on the county tax listing and parcels within 100 feet of the subject property, shall be mailed\nnotice of a public hearing on the proposed amendment by first class mail at the last address listed for such owners on the\ncounty tax abstracts. For the purpose of this section, properties are abutting even if separated by a street, railroad, or other\ntransportation corridor. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least ten but not more than 25 days prior to the date of\nthe public hearing. The person mailing such notices shall certify to the Board of Commissioners that fact and such certificate\nshall be deemed conclusive in the absence of fraud. At the same time the first notice is sent out, a sign shall be posted on\nthe affected property stating:\n(1) The date of the hearing;\n(2) The purpose of the hearing; and\n(3) Where to get more information regarding the action.\n(C) When a zoning map amendment is proposed, the town shall prominently post a notice of the public hearing on the\nsite proposed for rezoning or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way at least ten but more than 25 days prior to\nthe date of the hearing. When multiple parcels are included within a proposed zoning map amendment, a posting on each\nindividual parcel is not required, but the town shall post sufficient notices to provide reasonable notice to interested persons.\n(D) (1) If the adoption or modification of the ordinance would result in changes to the zoning map or would change or\naffect the permitted uses of land located five miles or less from the perimeter boundary of a military base, the Board of\nCommissioners shall provide written notice of the proposed changes by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the\nCommander of the military base not less than ten days nor more than 25 days before the date fixed for the public hearing.

For purposes of this section, \"down-zoning\" means a zoning ordinance\nthat affects an area of land in one of the following ways: (1) by decreasing the development density of the land to be less\ndense than was allowed under its previous usage; or (2) by reducing the permitted uses of the land that are specified in a\nzoning ordinance or land development regulation to fewer uses than were allowed under its previous usage.\n(F) A fee will be charged for each application for business use or application for rezoning of any property within the\nzoning jurisdiction of the town.

The requirement\nfor a plan consistency statement may also be met by a clear indication in the minutes of the Board of Commissioners\nmeeting that at the time of action on the amendment the Board was aware of and considered the Planning Board's\nrecommendations and any relevant portions of an adopted comprehensive plan. If a zoning map amendment is adopted and\nthe action was deemed inconsistent with the adopted plan, the zoning amendment shall have the effect of also amending\nany future land-use map in the approved plan, and no additional request or application for a plan amendment shall be\nrequired. When adopting or rejecting any petition for a zoning map amendment, an additional statement analyzing the\nreasonableness of the proposed rezoning shall be approved by the Board of Commissioners. This statement of\nreasonableness may consider, among other factors, (i) the size, physical conditions, and other attributes of the area\nproposed to be rezoned; (ii) the benefits and detriments to the landowners, the neighbors, and the surrounding community;\n(iii) the relationship between the current actual and permissible development on the tract and adjoining areas and the\ndevelopment that would be permissible under the proposed amendment; (iv) why the action taken is in the public interest;\nand (v) any changed conditions warranting the amendment. If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a \"large-scale rezoning\"\nunder G.S. \u00a7 160D-602(b), the Board of Commissioners statement on reasonableness may address the overall rezoning.\nThe statement of reasonableness and the plan consistency statement required by this section may be approved as a single\nstatement.\n(K) If a zoning map amendment qualifies as a \"large-scale rezoning\" under G.S. \u00a7 160D-602(b), the statement describing\nplan consistency may address the overall rezoning and describe how the analysis and policies in the relevant adopted plans\nwere considered in the recommendation made. If a zoning map amendment is adopted and the action was deemed\ninconsistent with the adopted comprehensive plan, the zoning amendment shall have the effect of also amending the future\nland-use map in the approved plan, and no additional request or application for a plan amendment shall be required.\n(Ord. passed 6-8-78; Am.
