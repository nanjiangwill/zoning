References in this Ordinance to general use district shall be construed to also include the\ncorresponding conditional zoning district. Each conditional zoning district is intended to accomplish the purposes of the corresponding general use district through the development of identified uses at specific location in accordance with a site plan acceptable to the Elected Body.\nAll regulations which apply to general use district also apply to the corresponding conditional zoning district. Additional reasonable site plan conditions which may be required by the Elected Body and agreed to by the petitioner as part of the rezoning process also apply.\n(D) Purpose Statements District purpose statements in this section refer only to general objectives for each zoning district.\n(E)\nDimensional Requirements The general dimensional requirements for each zoning district cited in this section are subject to additional provisions of this Ordinance as noted in Section B.3-1.\n(F)\nGrowth Management Plan The Growth Management Plan of Legacy seeks to guide future development patterns in the community to provide services in cost effective and efficient manner; allow for urban, suburban, and rural life styles; and preserve environmental and cultural\nresources. The Growth Management Plan divides the county into five growth management areas as follows:\n(1) City/Town Centers (GMA_1);\n(2) Urban Neighborhoods (GMA_2);\n(3) Suburban Neighborhoods (GMA 3);\n(4) Future Growth Area (GMA 4); and\n(5) Rural Area (GMA 5).\nGoals are identified in Legacy for each of these areas. Zoning districts established by this Ordinance have been designed, in part, to achieve the goals of the growth management areas, the objective of the Lewisville Comprehensive Plan. Copies of Legacy are available in the office\nof the Planning Staff.\n(UDO L-164 \u00a7 2, 7-8-21)\n2-1.2 RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS PURPOSE STATEMENTS AND REGULATIONS\nThe following residential zoning districts are established. For Single Family Districts (RS), the suffix number multiplied by one thousand (1,000) indicates the minimum lot size in square feet. For Multifamily Districts (RM), the suffix number indicates the maximum number of dwelling units per\nacre. [For example, RS-40 requires a minimum lot size of forty thousand (40,000) square feet for single family dwelling, while RM-8 allows multifamily development at a density of up to eight (8) units per acre.]\nTable B.2.1\nResidential Zoning Districts\nEach residential district is designed and intended to secure for the persons who reside there a comfortable, healthy, safe, and pleasant environment in which to live, protected from incompatible and disruptive activities which more properly belong in nonresidential districts. The districts are\nalso intended to assist the community in meeting the growth management goals of Legacy. When a residential rezoning proposal is considered, the Growth Management Plan and the residential land use goals and locational criteria contained in Legacyshall be used as guides, in conjunction\nwith other factors, in determining the appropriateness of the proposed district. Other goals of these residential districts are explained in the remainder of this section.\n(A) YR Yadkin River Conservation District.\n(1) Purpose The YR District is intended primarily to protect the community's main water supply, preserve the historic features of this area, and preserve the natural beauty of continuous conservation corridor along the Yadkin River. This zoning district is the most restrictive, with\nlow density residential development the primary use allowed. Objectives of the district are the following:\n(a) Protection of water supply;\n(b) Maintenance of rural character;\n(c) Protection of sensitive natural, historical, recreational, and visual resources;\n(d) Retention of natural topography and vegetation;\n(e) Control of sedimentation and other nonpoint source pollution; and,\n(f) Support and encouragement of agricultural activities.\n15 of 100\n12/15/2023, 2:14 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nSymbol\nCELL (1, 2): \nDistrict Name\nCELL (2, 1): \nYR\nCELL (2, 2): \nYadkin River Conservation\nCELL (3, 1): \nAG\nCELL (3, 2): \nAgricultural\nCELL (4, 1): \nRS-40\nCELL (4, 2): \nResidential Single Family\nCELL (5, 1): \nRS-30\nCELL (5, 2): \nResidential Single Family\nCELL (6, 1): \nRS-20\nCELL (6, 2): \nResidential Single Family\nCELL (7, 1): \nRS-15\nCELL (7, 2): \nResidential Single Family\nCELL (8, 1): \nRS-12\nCELL (8, 2): \nResidential Single Family\nCELL (9, 1): \nRS-9\nCELL (9, 2): \nResidential Single Family\nCELL (10, 1): \nRS-7\nCELL (10, 2): \nResidential Single Family\nCELL (11, 1): \nRSQ\nCELL (11, 2): \nResidential Single Family Quadraplex\nCELL (12, 1): \nRM-5\nCELL (12, 2): \nResidential Multifamily\nCELL (13, 1): \nRM-8\nCELL (13, 2): \nResidential Multifamily\nCELL (14, 1): \nRM-12\nCELL (14, 2): \nResidential Multifamily\nCELL (15, 1): \nRM-18\nCELL (15, 2): \nResidential Multifamily\nCELL (16, 1): \nRM-U\nCELL (16, 2): \nResidential Multifamily\nCELL (17, 1): \nMH\nCELL (17, 2): \nManufactured Housing Development\n"}, {"page": "16", "text": "Lewisville, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\n(2) General Dimensional Requirements YR.\n1.\nNonconforming lots in the YR District meeting the provisions of Section B.5-3.2(C) must meet the minimum setback requirements of the RS-20 zoning district.\n2.

At this pre-application\nconference, the developer shall submit sketch plan for the LD1-C and LD2-C Districts and general information on traffic circulation and utilities for tentative review, comments and recommendations by the Planning Staff.\n(a) The Planning Staff representative, after review by the Town Manager, shall comment on the information presented at that meeting in writing within sixty (60) days. The official plan of development and rezoning request shall be submitted only after the completion of the pre-\napplication conference and the written response.\n(b) The developer shall file an application for approval of an LD1-C and LD2-C Districts within one hundred eighty (180) days after the written response from the Planning Staff.\n(3)\nAlternative Compliance. Successful planning and development of the Lewisville Downtown will likely be dependent upon thorough and systematic individual site plan reviews. Existing land parcels and historic uses of properties will likely transition slowly into planned\ndowntown area. Adjustments to specific planned downtown requirements must be tempered by the reality of existing situations in a manner providing the means for land owners, planners, and developers to prepare the best possible site plans to meet town requirements.\n(a) The Town may, in its discretion, consider site plans varying from requirements regarding dimensions, setbacks, parking, bufferyards and screening, utility easements, and architectural character per Section B.2-1.5(E)(5)-(11) where the lot size, configuration, topography,\nnature and configuration of adjoining lots and improvements thereon, parking availability, or other natural conditions beyond the control of the property owner exist or where prior acts of any public agency have occurred such that to require strict compliance with the\nstandards would compromise or contradict the spirit and intent of the requirements.\n(b) Site plans varying from the requirements may be approved only upon written finding specifically articulating how the site plan fulfills the intent and purposes of the requirements as well as or better than would strict conformance with the requirements, and that such site\nplan is in harmony with the Lewisville Comprehensive Plan and the Legacy Plan.\n(c) Nothing in this section shall require the Town to approve any site plan that does not comply with the requirements, despite the presentation of evidence that might allow the required findings to be made.\n(4) General Dimensional Requirements-LD1.C and LD2-C.\nZoning\nMinimum Zoning\nMinimum\nMinimum Setbacks\nMaximum\nMaximum\nDistrict\nLot\nContiguous\nImpervious\nHeight (ft) 2\nSide\nSite Area\nSurface\n(ac)\nCover\nArea\nWidth\nFront\nRear\nInterior\nStreet\n(%)\n(sf)\n(ft)\n(ft)\n(ft)\nSide\n(ft)\n(ft)\n26 of 100\n12/15/2023, 2:14 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nZoning\nCELL (1, 2): \nMinimum Zoning\nCELL (1, 3): \nCELL (1, 4): \nMinimum\nCELL (1, 5): \nMinimum Setbacks\nCELL (1, 6): \nCELL (1, 7): \nCELL (1, 8): \nCELL (1, 9): \nMaximum\nCELL (1, 10): \nMaximum\nCELL (2, 1): \nDistrict\nCELL (2, 2): \nLot\nCELL (2, 3): \nCELL (2, 4): \nContiguous\nSite Area\nCELL (2, 5): \nCELL (2, 6): \nCELL (2, 7): \nSide\nCELL (2, 8): \nCELL (2, 9): \nImpervious\nSurface\nCELL (2, 10): \nHeight (ft) 2\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nArea\n(sf)\nCELL (3, 3): \nWidth\n(ft)\nCELL (3, 4): \n(ac)\nCELL (3, 5): \nFront\n(ft)\nCELL (3, 6): \nRear\n(ft)\nCELL (3, 7): \nInterior\nSide\n(ft)\nCELL (3, 8): \nStreet\n(ft)\nCELL (3, 9): \nCover\n(%)\nCELL (3, 10): \nCELL (4, 1): \nMU-C\nCELL (4, 2): \n5,000\nCELL (4, 3): \n30\nCELL (4, 4): \n30\nCELL (4, 5): \n10\nCELL (4, 6): \n-\nCELL (4, 7): \n-\nCELL (4, 8): \n10\nCELL (4, 9): \n-\nCELL (4, 10): \n60/\nunlimited\n"}, {"page": "27", "text": "Lewisville, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nNote: 1 Side yards are not required, however, Section B.2-1.5(E)(8) Bufferyards and Other Screening Requirements shall be followed.\nNote: 2.

This\narea shall be adequately landscaped to screen the rear of the initial building from view of the GWR until all buildings on the site are complete. At that time, the parking area may be expanded and/or modified to serve all buildings on the site.\n(5)\nBuild-To-Line (BTL). The line on which construction of the building fa\u00e7ade is to be situated on lot. A build-to-line runs parallel to the front property line and is established to create an even building facade line on street. BTL applies only to LD1-C.\n(a) Location of BTL without Overhead Utilities. Street trees and street lamps are located on the street right-of-way line. The BTL is located nine (9) feet behind the street right-of-way line (matches the Shallowford Square structures to street relation) or nine (9) feet behind\nexisting street lamps and street trees.\n(b)\nLocation\nof\nBTL with Overhead Utilities. The BTL shall be as far forward as permitted by the standards currently stated in the National Electric Code (clearance of the area under the overhead electrical power lines plus a number of feet which as of 2002 is fifteen (15) feet).\nTypical\nutility\npole\ncross arms are eight (8) feet long with four (4) feet to either side of the pole. Provided the pole is located at the street right-of-way line (generally ten (10) feet behind the curb) plus the additional four (4) feet for the cross arm and fifteen (15) feet for the life\nsafety area the BTL will likely be located twenty-nine (29) feet behind the curb line. In some cases the utility pole may be located beyond the street right-of-way line resulting in the TBL being located the additional distance behind the curb.\n(c)\nConstruction Related to the BTL Not less than fifty percent (50%) of the facade is to be built on the BTL. The remainder of the building should be set back a minimum of six (6) feet behind the BTL.

Any off-street parking, whether located to the front, side, or rear of the primary structure, must be\nscreened from the road. \"Front\" and \"Rear\" shall be determined, for the purpose of this subsection, by the orientation of the primary structure(s) to Great Wagon Road or Shallowford Road, and not in relation to the location(s) of entrance(s) to the structure(s).\n(ii) LD2-C/DGA. Parking lots shall be designed to allow the safe movement of pedestrians from their vehicles to the building(s). Parking with a maximum depth of one (1) double loaded parking bay (parking space drive aisle parking space) shall be allowed adjacent to any\npublic street. Large parking lots shall be divided into smaller parking rooms that are defined by landscape planting and site furniture. Any off-street parking whether located to the front, side, or rear of the primary structure, must be screened from the road. Lighted\ncorridors (i.e. sidewalks) within the parking areas should be located to safely channel pedestrians from the vehicle to the building(s) and/or perimeter of each parking room or lot. The material for these sidewalks shall be different in color and texture from the paving of the\nvehicular areas.\n(c) Credits. On-street parking satisfying the off-street parking requirements is permitted provided the following requirements are met:\n(i)\nAll parking shall be angled or parallel meeting the requirements of Table B.3.9, and must be approved by the Elected Body, the NCDOT, or other agency, whichever is applicable.\n(ii) Credit shall be limited to all available public on-street parking within a radius of two hundred fifty (250) feet of the midpoint of the subject property's road frontage.

Including the exceptions in Section B.2-1.5(E)(11).\n(F) VBD-C Vienna Business District\n(1) Definitions. See Vienna Core District in Section A.2 for definition of boundaries.\n(2) Applicability, Purpose and Intent. This zoning district is intended for use in the Vienna Core District. The Vienna Business District (VBD-C) provides for restricted development in an area that has historically featured neighborhood businesses providing convenience services to the\nsurrounding rural community of Vienna. The Vienna Core District anchors the surrounding residential neighborhoods while also serving the broader community of Pfafftown and western Forsyth County. In the Vienna Business District, a broad array of uses are expected in\na\npattern which integrates shops, restaurants, services, work places, civic, educational, and religious facilities, single family housing within a pedestrian- environment.\nThe purpose of the Vienna Business Commercial district is to provide additional requirements to promote, preserve, and protect the health, safety and welfare of residents and property and to protect the aesthetic interest of the Town of Lewisville and the historic Vienna\ncommunity. It will help conserve the value of buildings and encourage appropriate use of the land. It is based, in part on the following findings:\n(a) Planned business districts contribute to each town's entire image and economic vitality.\n(b) The regulations will insure development of property appropriate for the rural community and existing business area, safeguarding property values and offering social and cultural benefits to the citizens of the Town of Lewisville\n(c) The standards will encourage new buildings, retain the values of surrounding properties, protect the town's unique character, and promote good urban design.\n(d) The regulations should reduce the number and length of auto trips by encouraging businesses to locate adjacent to residential neighborhoods.\n(e) Facilitate auto, pedestrian, bicycle travel, both within the business district and to surrounding neighborhoods.\n(3)\nAlternative Compliance. Successful planning and development of the Vienna Business District will likely be dependent upon thorough and systematic individual site plan reviews. Existing land parcels and historic uses of properties will likely transition slowly into planned\ncommercial area. Adjustments to specific planning requirements must be tempered by the reality of existing situations in manner providing the means for land owners, planners, and developers to prepare the best possible site plans to meet Town of Lewisville requirements.\n(a) The Elected Body may, in its discretion, consider site plans varying from requirements regarding dimensions, setbacks, parking, buffer yards, screening, utility easements and architectural character in Sections B.2-1.5(F)(4), (7), (8) and (9) where the lot size, configuration,\ntopography, nature and configuration of adjoining lots and improvements thereon, parking availability, or other natural conditions beyond the control of the property owner exist or where prior acts of any public agency have occurred such that to require strict compliance with\nthe standards would compromise or contradict the spirit and intent of these requirements.\n(b) Site plans varying from the requirements may be approved only upon a written finding specifically articulating how the site plan fulfills the intent and purposes of the requirements as well as or better than would strict conformance with the requirements, and that such site\nplan is in harmony with the Lewisville Comprehensive Plan and the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Legacy Plan.\n(c) Nothing in this section shall require the Elected Body to approve any site plan that does not comply with the requirements, despite the presentation of evidence that might allow the required findings to be made.\n(4) General Dimensional Requirements VBD-C Zoning District\nZoning\nMinimum Zoning\nMinimum\nMinimum Setbacks\nMaximum\nMaximum\nDistrict\nLot\nContiguous\nImpervious\nHeight (ft)\nSide\nSite Area\nSurface\n(ac)\nCover\nArea\nWidth\nFront\nRear\nInterior\nStreet\n(%)\n(sf)\n(ft)\n(ft)\n(ft)\nSide\n(ft)\n(ft)\n27 of 100\n12/15/2023, 2:14 PM\nCELL (1, 1): \nLD1-C\nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (1, 3): \n-\nCELL (1, 4): \n-\nCELL (1, 5): \nDCA 0'\nMini-\nmum/6\"\nMaxi-\nmum\nGWR 15'\nCELL (1, 6): \nCELL (1, 7): \n0' Minimum\nCELL (1, 8): \nCELL (1, 9): \nCELL (1, 10): \nsee Downtown Overlay District in\nChapter B, Article II, Section 2-1.6\n(H) for height requirements\nCELL (2, 1): \nLD2-C\nCELL (2, 2): \n-\nCELL (2, 3): \n75'\nCELL (2, 4): \n-\nCELL (2, 5): \nDGA 40'\nMinimum\nCELL (2, 6): \nCELL (2, 7): \n0'\nMinimum\nCELL (2, 8): \n-\nCELL (2, 9): \n-\nCELL (2, 10): \nsee Downtown Overlay District in\nChapter B, Article II, Section 2-1.6\n(H) for height requirements\n"}, {"page": "28", "text": "Lewisville, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nVBD-C\n-\n-\n-\nBTL\n-\n0.5/12\n-\n-\n48\n1.

The Lewisville Downtown Overlay District (DTO), see map titled Lewisville Downtown Overlay Map in Exhibit in the Appendix of the Unified Development Ordinance, provides additional requirements within the Town of Lewisville's designated\nDowntown Core and Gateway areas (Downtown Overlay Area). The purpose of the overlay district is to promote, preserve, and protect the health, safety and welfare of residents and property and to protect the aesthetic interest of the Town. It will help conserve the value of\nbuildings and encourage appropriate use of the land. It is based in part on the following findings:\n(a) Downtowns contribute to each town's entire image and economic vitality.\n(b) The regulations will ensure development of property appropriate for the downtown and central area; thus, safeguarding its property and offering social and cultural benefits to the citizens of Lewisville.\n(c) The standards will encourage new buildings, retain the values of surrounding properties, protect the town's unique character, and promote good urban design.\n(2) General Regulations.\n(a) Existing development, single family homes, and schools are exempt from regulations. However, expansions and reconstruction after demolition or destruction of uses, except single family homes and schools, must comply with the standards.\n(b) The uses permitted in the underlying zoning district shall be allowed in the Downtown Overlay District. Lewisville Downtown (LD1-C and LD2-C) Zoning District is the preferred district, however, other districts may be approved provided the Downtown Overlay District\nrequirements are complied with and only for the uses permitted in the LD1-C and LD2-C districts.\n(c) The Town may, in its discretion, consider site plans varying from setbacks and other dimensional requirements of the UDO and the development standards set forth in the DTO, where the lot size, configuration, topography nature, and configuration of adjoining lots and\nimprovements thereon, parking availability, or other natural conditions beyond the control of the property owner exist or where prior acts of any public agency have occurred such that to require strict compliance with the standards would compromise or contradict the spirit\nand intent of the requirements. Site plans varying from the requirements may be approved only upon a written finding specifically articulating how the site plan fulfills the intent and purpose of the requirements as well as or better than would strict conformance with the\nrequirements, and that such site plan is in harmony with the Lewisville Comprehensive Plan. Nothing in this section shall require the Town to approve any site plan that does not comply with the requirements, despite the presentation of evidence that might allow the required\nfindings to be made.\n(d) All new development, expansions, reconstruction after demolition or destruction of uses, except single family homes and schools, within the Downtown Overlay District shall require submission of site plans, landscaping plans, and building plans for review and approval by the\nPlanning Board and Elected Body. Such submittal shall comply with the site plan requirements of Section B.7-4.1 Form 1 and the deadlines for all petitions and submittals published by the Planning Staff, consistent with the requirements of Section B.6. For proposals requiring\nsimply site plan review but not rezoning or zoning map amendment, the Planning Board shall recommend approval and the Elected Body shall approve any plans that meet all the requirements of this Downtown Overlay District and the UDO or consistent with the alternative\ncompliance provision in DTO.2.(C), and deny any such requests that do not meet the requirements. The Planning Board and the Elected Body may exercise their full authority when considering requests for rezonings or map amendments. The Planning Board and the Elected\nBody may, as part of its approval, require conditions to reduce impacts associated with the project as specified in Section B.6-1.3(A)(1).\n(e) These boards will evaluate the design of new structures in terms of the degree to which they contribute to the well-being of the Downtown, while preserving and enhancing the village character, integrity, and attractiveness of central Lewisville as identified in the Lewisville\nComprehensive Plan. The major objectives shall be to promote a sense of human scale; to encourage architecture which is compatible but not necessarily conforming; to create architectural transition; to provide an open environment; and to develop tree-lined streets in\nDowntown areas.\n(f) All properties submitted for rezoning in the Downtown Overlay District shall be considered under the conditional district zoning provisions of Section B.6-2.2, except that only one-phase petitions shall be considered as specified in the provisions of Section B.6-2.2(C)(1).\n(3)\nArchitectural\nCharacter Standards. The Town of Lewisville sees the interaction between the built environment and the public as a crucial ingredient in maintaining a certain sense of place. Development standards herein are intended to ensure that all new development within\nthe DCA, DGA and DTO results in an architecture of high quality, encourages pedestrian activity and interaction with the built environment and provides appropriate transitions in scale while accommodating many types of approved uses, including civic and institutional,\ncommercial retail and business mixed-use, live/work and multi-family/single family residential developments. Architectural aesthetic character shall be designed so as to support and enhance a pedestrian friendly environment and compliment the historical small town unique\ncharacter of Lewisville. The following minimal architectural character standards are to be shown on the applicant's plans and included as conditions for approval of the site plan. Other specific architectural character elements are encouraged which may also be required as\nconditions for approval of the site plan:\n(a)\nBuilding Mass.

The width of a single driveway entrance to serve a duplex shall be limited to twenty-four (24) feet.\nThere shall be no more than two (2) entrances to the same property.\n(4)\nMulti-family Dwellings When driveway entrances are constructed to serve apartment houses, such entrances to the same property may be twenty-four (24) feet in width measured at the street or curb line with not more than two (2) such entrances to the same property\nfrom\nthe same street. When two (2) driveway entrances are constructed, there shall be at least twenty-five (25) feet between driveway entrances measured at the street or curb line.\n(5) Joint Driveways. The width of joint driveway, as may be authorized by the Public Works Director, serving two (2) adjacent pieces of residential property, shall be limited to twenty-four (24) feet along the street or curb line, provided no other means of driveway access is\nreasonably available and the permit for such driveway is signed by the owners of the adjacent property. There shall be no more than one joint driveway for each two (2) adjacent pieces of general residential property and no more than two (2) joint driveways for each two (2)\nadjacent pieces of duplex or multi-family property.\n(6)\nResidential Driveways Beyond the Town's Downtown Core. Residential (subdivision) lots shall not have direct access onto major or minor thoroughfare unless it can be demonstrated that the proposed driveway cannot be feasibly designed, or that no reasonable alternative\nexists, to avoid direct access onto one of these type roadways. The expectation is that all new residential subdivisions will have internal roadways that will serve all lots eliminating the need for multiple driveways along major and minor thoroughfares. Any driveways for individual\nlots having access to major or minor thoroughfares shall be designed so that there shall be no more than one (1) driveway connection per two hundred fifty (250) feet along the same side of the road in areas outside the Town's Downtown core or similarly established business\ndistrict, including, but not limited to, the Vienna Business District.\n(7)\nSubdivided Lots on Local Roads.

The Public Works Director may waive the two hundred\nfifty (250) foot distance should sufficient hardship be proved by the applicant as found within the driveway permit.\n(8) Minimum Driveway Spacing. See Table B.3.11.1.\n(9) Paving of Residential Drives See Section B.3-3.7(B)(7)(a)(b).\n(E) Commercial Driveway Standards (LD1-C, LD2-C, and VBD Districts)\n(1)\nNumber of Commercial Drives. When a commercial or multi-family development abuts more than one (1) public street, access to each abutting street may be allowed only if the following criteria are met:\n(a) It is determined that such access is required to adequately serve driveway projected volumes and will not be detrimental or unsafe to traffic operations on public streets. The Public Works Director may require the preparation of traffic impact analysis (TIA) for the use of\nthe\nTown which demonstrates that such access is required. The applicant shall be required to reimburse the Town of Lewisville for all costs associated with the preparation of required TIA prepared pursuant to Section B.7-3.7 of the Lewisville UDO.\n(b) The minimum for corner clearance for said driveways are met.\n(2)\nMaximum Width for Commercial Driveways. The maximum width of commercial driveway approach for two-way operation, shall not exceed thirty-six (36) feet measured at the property line and include separate left and right turn lanes, except that the Public Works Director\nmay issue permits for driveway approaches greater than thirty-six (36) feet in width on major streets to handle special traffic conditions. The minimum width of commercial driveway approach for two-way operation shall not be less than twenty-four (24) feet in width.\n(3)\nDriveway Throat Distances A minimum driveway throat length for commercial and multi-family drives shall be forty (40) feet pursuant to Section B.3-3(E)(4)(c). The preferred minimum throat length for minor thoroughfares is fifty (50) feet and one hundred (100) feet for major\nthoroughfares. This distance may be required to allow for traffic entering the site to be stored on site in order to avoid queue of traffic from the development from being out on the roadway causing delays to the through traffic stream.\n(4) Minimum Driveway Spacing See Table B.3.11.1.\n(5)\nPaving of Commercial Drives. See Section B.3-3.7(B)(7)(a)(b).\n(6)\nDrives Outside of the LD1-C, LD2-C and VBD Districts All driveways located outside of these districts shall comply with Sections B.3-3.7(A)(1-6) and B.3-3.7(B)(2-10).\n(F) Measuring Driveway Access\nTable B.3.11.1\nMinimum Driveway Spacing [1]\n(1)-(3)\nReserved.\nFigure B.3.1.

When minimum spacing requirements cannot be met due to the lack of road frontage, sound engineering judgment may override the\nrecommended dimensions set forth in this ordinance as warranted by specific traffic conditions.\n(1) No driveway approach may be closer to the corner than fifty (50) feet on local streets, one hundred (100) feet on collector/minor thoroughfares and one hundred twenty (120) feet for major thoroughfares. This measurement shall be taken from the intersection of property lines at\nthe corner. When these requirements cannot be met due to the lack of frontage, the driveway may be located such that the radius will begin at the farthest property line.\n(H) Geometric Design of Driveway Access\n(1) Curb cuts for driveways shall not be permitted in the curb return of an intersection.\n(2) The curb return radii for driveways intersecting at right angles with the roadway and without a deceleration lane shall be as follows:\n(a) The curb return radii for residential driveways located on local or collector streets shall be minimum of two and a half (2.5) feet and a maximum of ten (10) feet. Flare type residential driveways must also adhere to these dimensional criteria. Residential driveways located on\nthoroughfare streets must adhere to the specifications set forth in B.3-3.7(G)(2)(b) where and when applicable.\n(b) Curb return radii for commercial driveways may vary between twenty (20) feet and fifty (50) feet.\n(c) Curb return radii for driveway types not included in (a) or (b) above shall be determined by the Public Works Director.\n(I) Modified Access Requirements\n(1) To enhance traffic safety and flows on collector and thoroughfare streets, access points may be required to be designed to prohibit certain types of turning movements. Driveways not meeting the spacing guidelines in Tables B.3.11.2 and B.3.11.3 may be designed for limited\naccess by the addition of median to the driveway or may be required to be removed if access is available through a shared public access easement to an adjoining lot or access can be facilitated by the construction of shared driveway that meets the spacing guidelines found in\nTables B.3.11.2 and B.3.11.3.\n(2) For the benefit of traffic safety and flow on collector and thoroughfare streets, tapered or channelized deceleration lanes for vehicles turning right into high volume or intersection type driveways may be required if warranted. Design of right-turn deceleration lanes shall be\nin\naccordance with the AASHTO standards for auxiliary lanes.\n(a)\nThe spacing requirements for driveways not meeting the specifications in Tables B.3.11.2 and B.3.11.3 may be lessened or waived if tapered or channelized deceleration lanes are used.\n(3) At those locations where it is determined by the Town that street or driveway connection requires improvements to existing roadway facilities to provide for safe and efficient traffic operation, the applicant shall be fully responsible for roadway improvements. These\nimprovements may include, but are not limited to, separate turn lanes, deceleration lanes, acceleration lanes, lane tapers and transitions, right-of-way to contain new widening, traffic signals and roundabouts.\n(J) Shared Access Requirements A joint public access easement shall be required between adjacent lots fronting on arterial and collector streets in order to minimize the total number of access points along those streets and to facilitate traffic flow between lots. The development and\nuse of shared driveways, access drives, service drives, and similar means of shared access connecting two (2) or more lots or uses shall be required in accordance with the purpose of this Section. Upon determination that the number of vehicular access points along collector street\nor thoroughfare is greater than necessary based on the standards of this Article, the Planning Board shall require the use of shared driveway, access drive or service drive to provide primary or secondary vehicular access as part of site plan approval.\n(1) Pursuant to this section:\n(a) Owners must record an easement in the Office of Register of Deeds allowing access to and from adjoining properties served by the joint use driveways and access or service drive:\n(b) All subsequent property owners sharing access to driveway constructed pursuant to this subsection, shall construct any necessary improvements to comply with NCDOT and Town driveway standards, and as condition of site plan approval, shall maintain the said driveway\n(including any improvements thereto) for a period of five (5) years, after which period the parties shall share equally the cost of maintaining the said driveway to NCDOT and Town standards. Under no circumstance shall the Town be responsible for maintenance of driveways.\n(K) Permit Required\n(1) Plans submitted for building approval which include or involve new, relocated, altered, or reconstructed driveways shall be approved by the Public Works Director (for Town-maintained roads) and the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) (for state-maintained\nroads) before a zoning permit and building permit is issued.\n(2) All driveways are subject to the terms and standards of this section. New development, changes of use or building expansions of greater than twenty-five (25%) percent shall cause the requirements of this section to apply.\n(3) A driveway permit fee shall be set by resolution of the Town Council as deemed appropriate by the Council and shall be of an amount to cover the costs incidental to the driveway review and approval by Town staff,\n(4) All permits granted for access to publicly maintained roadways under the terms of this section may be revocable at the recommendation of the Town Council. The Town Council shall have the authority to rescind by resolution any permit granted for driveway after proper notice\nand public hearing when the Council finds such action to be in the public interest. Provided, however, any such revocation may not leave property owner without access to such owners property.\n(5) When an existing driveway permit is rescinded by action of the Town Council or the NCDOT, the driveway connection shall be removed (and replaced with applicable street yards, curbing, street trees, lighting and other street structures as necessary to comply all ordinances and\ndevelopment standards), such removal and replacement to be completed by the deadline set by Town Council, provided that the property owner(s) shall have not less than six (6) months to complete the removal and replacement of the driveway. The Town may place any barrier\nto\naccess to the former driveway pending said removal and replacement by the property owner(s). All costs incidental to said removal and replacement shall be borne by the equally by the property owner(s) having access to the said driveway, notwithstanding the provisions\nof\nsection 1)(1)(b) above.\n(6)\nDeviations from these criteria may be approved by the Public Works Director as described in the previous sections.

The WSDOT and/or the NCDOT still have the ultimate responsibility for resolving questions concerning traffic impact\nstudies.\nTo facilitate the determination of adequacy of adjoining public transportation facilities these agencies may recommend that traffic impact study be performed for any proposed commercial, industrial or institutional development, or non-residential single-family subdivision.\nIt is recommended that before anyone performs a traffic impact study in Forsyth County they contact the WSDOT and/or the NCDOT to determine the traffic concerns of each agency and/or jurisdiction or to request a multi-agency meeting. These standards are intended to define study\nlimits and analysis procedures acceptable to the WSDOT and/or the NCDOT. Any suggestion for additional analyses will be made at the time of initial contact, at the multi-agency meeting or by the mitigation plan (see Sections 20 and 21).\nThese standards are intended to provide structure for the traffic study preparer, where study recommendations will be determined on case by case basis. If the traffic impact study submitted does not adhere to the established standards, then revised study may be requested based\non suggestions by the WSDOT and/or the NCDOT officials and should be prepared by the applicant for submission.\nAll traffic impact studies should conform to sound engineering principles and are subject to review by the WSDOT and/or the NCDOT. Three copies of the study should be submitted to the Planning Department, who will, upon receipt, distribute one copy each to the Winston-Salem\nDepartment of Transportation and the appropriate NCDOT Division 9 Engineer. When other jurisdictions and/or agencies are within the study area, additional copies of the study may be requested by that other jurisdiction (see item_ 4) and/or NCDOT (see item 5).\nAll methods used for analysis other than those mentioned in these standards should be explained, (include references), and their limitations described in an appendix to the traffic impact study. It should also be noted that for planning purposes, the planning department in\nconsultation with the WSDOT and/or NCDOT has the final authority over the number and location(s) of driveways for any proposed development. NCDOT/WSDOT, in cooperation with the local planning department, will determine the engineering adequacy of any proposed driveways.\n1. A traffic impact study may be requested during the contact and/or multi-agency meeting according to any of the following:\na. any proposed development petitioned special use district rezoning that will increase the approach traffic volumes at intersections or roadways by 150 or more vehicles in the peak hour.\nb.\nproposed development is in the vicinity of areas previously identified as having levels of service \"E\" or \"F\", hazardous locations or other adequacy concerns (as determined by NCDOT, MPO, County, or City of Winston-Salem agencies).\nC. where a reduction in safety is expected at intersections or roadways.\nA traffic signal warrant study may still be requested by NCDOT or WSDOT even if traffic impact study is not.\n2. In the land planning and development process study may be recommended, based on the following:\nA contact or multi-agency meeting will address the recommendations for and scope of the proposed study. The contact or multi-agency meeting provides a means to discuss the traffic concerns expressed by the developer, reviewing agencies and jurisdictions responsible for\ntraffic operations in the vicinity of the proposed project site.\nThe traffic impact study may be performed and completed and due to City-County Planning Board along with filing for special use district rezoning, and/or non-residential subdivision.\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nZoning District under the Previous Zoning Ordinance Expiring 12/31/94\nCELL (1, 3): \nCorresponding Zoning District under the UDO\nCELL (2, 1): \nResidential\nCELL (2, 2): \nR-1 (W)\nCELL (2, 3): \nRM-U\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nR-2 (W)\nCELL (3, 3): \nRM-18\nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \nR-2 (F)\nCELL (4, 3): \nRM-12\nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nR-3\nCELL (5, 3): \nRSQ, RM-5\nCELL (6, 1): \nCELL (6, 2): \nR-4\nCELL (6, 3): \nRS-9\nCELL (7, 1): \nCELL (7, 2): \nR-5\nCELL (7, 3): \nRS-9\nCELL (8, 1): \nCELL (8, 2): \nR-6\nCELL (8, 3): \nRS-9, RS-12, RS-15, RS-20, RS-30, RS-40, AG\nCELL (9, 1): \nCELL (9, 2): \nR-7\nCELL (9, 3): \nMH\nCELL (10, 1): \nCELL (10, 2): \nR-8 (W)\nCELL (10, 3): \n--\nCELL (11, 1): \nBusiness\nCELL (11, 2): \nB-1 (W)\nCELL (11, 3): \nCB\nCELL (12, 1): \nCELL (12, 2): \nB-2\nCELL (12, 3): \nPB, LB, HB\nCELL (13, 1): \nCELL (13, 2): \nB-3\nCELL (13, 3): \nPB, LB, HB, GB\nCELL (14, 1): \nCELL (14, 2): \nB-4 (W)\nCELL (14, 3): \n--\nCELL (15, 1): \nCELL (15, 2): \nO-2 (F)\nCELL (15, 3): \nLO\nCELL (16, 1): \nIndustrial\nCELL (16, 2): \nI-1 (W)\nCELL (16, 3): \nCI\nCELL (17, 1): \nCELL (17, 2): \nI-2\nCELL (17, 3): \nLI, GB\nCELL (18, 1): \nCELL (18, 2): \nI-3\nCELL (18, 3): \nGI\nCELL (19, 1): \nCELL (19, 2): \nI-4\nCELL (19, 3): \nCPI\n"}, {"page": "97", "text": "Lewisville, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nIn those instances where a proposed development or non-residential subdivision project has been approved by the City-County Planning Board or any other elected board in Forsyth County based on recommendation from an acceptable traffic impact study and that project\nhas\nnot been completed after two (2) years of the date of approval, an updated traffic impact study may be recommended. If changes are made to the pre-approved site plan or non-residential subdivision plan that will require a new approval from the City-County Planning or other\nelected or appointed board in Forsyth County then new and/or updated traffic impact study may be recommended.\n3. This recommendation may be waived by the Director of WSDOT and/or the Division Engineer of NCDOT Division 9 upon written request by petitioner providing adequate justification for such waiver. The WSDOT and/or NCDOT shall respond in writing. Both letters shall be submitted\nwith the proposed development petition.\n4. A Traffic Impact Study can only be performed by Professional Engineer licensed by the North Carolina Board of Registration for Engineers and Land Surveyors, to practice engineering in North Carolina and with experience in the preparation of traffic impact studies.\n5. When performing a Traffic Impact Study in Forsyth County consideration should be given to the City-County Planning Board, the Winston-Salem Board of Aldermen, Forsyth County Board of Commissioners and/or other jurisdictions.\nThe\nCity\nCounty\nPlanning Board has the authority to review and approve non-residential subdivision plans within their respective jurisdictions. The Winston-Salem Board of Aldermen and the Forsyth County Board of Commissioners have the authority to approve or disapprove of\nproposed developments within their respective jurisdictions. It is recommended that the contact and/or multi-agency meeting for proposed developments within multiple jurisdictions include a representative from each jurisdiction that is familiar with traffic issues concerning each\njurisdiction (see the appendix for elected and appointed Boards meeting times, and locations, and phone numbers for each jurisdiction's contact person).\nOther government agencies (both state and local) may be requested by the Director of Planning to review any traffic impact study. When reviewing traffic impact study in this capacity, other government agencies are to be considered as staff subordinate to the staff of the\nPlanning Board recommending the traffic impact study.\n6.\nConsiderations should also be given to the NCDOT to eliminate any duplication of study recommendations, arrangements will be made by the City-County Planning Board to have a representative from the appropriate NCDOT Division 9 office present at the multi-agency meeting (or\nsend their recommendations). This representative should indicate the NCDOT recommendations for traffic impact study.\n7. The following areas of investigation will generally be included in Traffic Impact Study (The exact parameters may be defined at the contact and/or multi-agency meeting conference.):\na. An examination of traffic flows, exclusive of the site being studied, defined as \"background traffic\";\nb. An examination of projected traffic flows when site traffic is added, defined as \"total traffic\";\nC. A discussion of mitigation measures (if such measures are recommended);\nd. An examination of projected traffic flows after site is developed and mitigation measures are implemented.\n8. Traffic should be examined as follows:\na. From data collected by persons or agencies within the defined study area which is no more than two (2) years old at the time of the pre-study conference;\nb. From traffic counts obtained by the applicant based on the specification established at the pre-study conference (see item 13).\n9. The study area should be determined as follows:\nAs minimum standard, the study area should include each intersection with a major thoroughfare highway which can be considered as logical travel path between the site and the major thoroughfare highway network. Major thoroughfare highways are so designated by the\nWinston-Salem/Forsyth County Thoroughfare (or Transportation) Plan.\nAdditional intersections between the site and the major thoroughfare intersection(s) as well as those intersections that are rationally identified as being impacted by a development should be included in the study area.\n10. The design hour should be determined by:\na. the period for the proposed development which will generate/attract the highest traffic volumes; and/or\nb. the period of highest traffic volumes on the traffic facilities within the study area.\n11. The forecast year should be determined at the contact or multi-agency meeting according to some or all of following criteria:\na. a scheduled phase or the completion of the project (for this and other projects);\nb. The Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Comprehensive Plan (Legacy);\nC. locally adopted Transportation or Thoroughfare plan or capital improvement program schedule, or Transportation Improvement Program;\nd. major transportation system changes.\n12. The following technical procedures and guidelines should be used:\nRoadways and intersections should be analyzed using the appropriate analysis method as depicted in the latest edition of the Highway Capacity Manual. Transportation Research Board.\nAdditional analyses may or may not be recommended depending on the traffic concerns expressed at the pre-study conference.\n13. The minimum standard for traffic operations is defined as follows:\nLevel of service \"D\" is the lowest level of service that should be considered adequate for intersections and roadway approaches to intersections in Winston-Salem and Forsyth County. However, no development should bring level of service down by more than one level\nwithout implementing roadway improvements.\n14. Background traffic should be determined by:\nBackground traffic on roads in the study area should be determined by thoroughfare classification, as per the most current locally adopted Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Transportation or Thoroughfare Plan document:\na. by historic and/or projected traffic increase rates on roads classified as being major thoroughfares (arterial or major collectors); and\nb. by developments/trips that have been approved (recorded) on roads classified as minor thoroughfares or streets (minor collectors or local roads).\nExisting zoning activity information is available at the City-County Planning Department, at 336-727-2548. Average Daily Traffic (ADT) information is available from the Winston-Salem Department of Transportation at 336-727-2707 and/or the NCDOT Division 9 Traffic\nEngineering Office at 336-631-1375.\n15. Trip Generation, Distribution and Assignment should be determined by:\nTrip generation should be determined by using the following:\na. the latest edition of the Trip Generation Manual, Institute of Transportation Engineers, (cite land use code and page number); or\nb. documented local trip generation rates, (as determined through previous or current studies).\nTrip distribution should be determined by using the following:\na. gravity model:\nb. trip assignment of the traffic demand forecasting model:\nC. utilization of demographic data leading to trip purpose and trip tables;\nd. current directional distribution only if no future changes to land use and no improvements to transportation facilities are expected until the design year;\ne. trips should be assigned to the study area network during the study's design hour.\n16. Pass-by Trips should be determined by using either of the following:\na. the Institute of Transportation Engineers pass-by trip rates; or\nb. documented local pass-by trip rates, (as determined through previous or current studies).\n17. Traffic should be apportioned to the proposed project in the following manner:\na. First, the projected level of service for the study area is forecast without the proposed project.\nb. Second, the projected level of service is forecast with the addition of the proposed project.\nThen the two (2) forecasts are evaluated to determine whether the traffic projected to be generated by the proposed development will lower the projected Levels of Service (LOS) within the study area to below LOS \"D\" or one level below the current level of service.\n18. When traffic impact study projects that the intersection(s) or roadway(s) in the study area will be adequate then the following occurs:\nOnce plan has met the level of service standard, and other recommendations identified in consultation or in the multi-agency meeting no further approval for traffic impact is to be recommended by the City-County Planning Department. However, it is possible that the\nNCDOT Division Engineer or the Winston-Salem Department of Transportation may still recommend additional analyses and/or improvements.\n19. When traffic impact study projects that the intersection(s) or roadway(s) in the study area will be inadequate then either of the following alternatives may be considered by the City-County Planning:\na. The project is deferred or reduced in scope so that the level of service standard is not exceeded, or\nb.\nA\nmitigation plan is submitted for review by the CCPB, the WSDOT and/or the NCDOT. The mitigation plan together with the recommendations of the departments are presented to the Planning Board and subsequently to the appropriate elected board with a recommendation\nfrom the City-County Planning Board. The elected body has the authority to either approve or disapprove those projects solely under its jurisdiction.\nC. The improvements recommended in the mitigation plan are the sole responsibility of the developer to implement unless one hundred percent (100%) of construction costs for the projected improvements are in the subject budget year of the seven (7) year Transportation\nImprovement Program or the local Government's Capital Improvements Program.\nd. The developer may agree to pay fees to fund the necessary improvements by written agreement with the WSDOT and/or NCDOT.\n19A. If the existing level of service is inadequate (i.e., \"E\" or \"F\"), or the existing plus the background growth (not including the site) causes an inadequate level of service, then the developer will be expected to mitigate only the traffic to be generated by the proposed project.\n19B. If the proposed development is of significant economic importance it may be recommended that the developer be granted an exception and/or waiver where improvements are scheduled or included in either the NCDOT TIP or locally approved Capital Improvements Program.\n20. A mitigation plan is:\na. an addition to traffic impact study, (the recommendation for which is identified by preliminary study results);\nb. intended to identify specific causes of lowered levels of service (traffic impacts);\nC. recommends improvements that will moderate the effects of projected traffic impacts;\nd. recommends transportation demand management options.\nWhere legally allowed, examples of possible mitigation plan improvements may include, but are not limited to: construction of new roads, road improvements, traffic signals, ridesharing programs, off-site parking facilities and para-transit, signal timing/phasing changes,\nchannelization modifications, changes in ingress/egress points, reducing the number of entrances, and/or lane widening.\n21. Mitigation Plan improvements may be phased and shall be sensitive to the following:\na. timing of short-term and long-term network improvements that are already planned, scheduled and/or funded:\nb. time schedules of adjacent developments;\n97 of 100\n12/15/2023, 2:14 PM\n"}, {"page": "98", "text": "Lewisville, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nabout:blank\nC. size and timing of individual phases of development;\nd. right-of-way needs and availability of additional right-of-way within appropriate time frames;\ne. local priorities for transportation improvements and funding;\nf. local priorities for transportation demand management strategies;\ng. necessary lead time for additional design and construction;\nh. that the sum of improvements are proportional to the projected impact.\nAnalysis of traffic needs by development phase should provide the information needed to determine the appropriate sequence of improvements.\n22.

GENERAL REGULATIONS\n(A) Existing development, single-family homes, and schools are exempt from these regulations. However, expansions and reconstruction after demolition or destruction of uses, except single-family homes and schools, must comply with the standards.\n(B) The uses permitted in the underlying zoning district shall be allowed in the Vienna Business District. The Vienna Business District (VBD-S) is the preferred district, however, other districts may be approved provided the VBD-S district requirements are complied with and only for the\nuses permitted in the VBD-S district.\n(C)\nThe Elected Body may, in its discretion, consider site plans varying from setbacks and other dimensional requirements of the VBD-S zoning district and Section 2. Development Standards below, where the lot size, configuration, topography, nature, and configuration of adjoining\nlots and improvements thereon, parking availability, or other natural conditions beyond the control of the property owner exist or where prior acts of any public agency have occurred such that to require strict compliance with the standards would compromise or contradict the\nspirit and intent of the requirements. Site plans varying from the requirements may be approved only upon a written finding specifically articulating how the site plan fulfills the intent and purpose of the requirements as well as or better than would strict conformance with the\nrequirements, and that such site plan is in harmony with the Lewisville Comprehensive Plan. Nothing in this section shall require the Elected Body to approve any site plan that does not comply with the requirements, despite the presentation of evidence that might allow the\nrequired findings to be made.\n(D) All new development, expansions, reconstruction after demolition or destruction of uses, except single-family homes and schools, within the Vienna Business District boundary shall require submission of site plans, landscaping plans, and building plans for review and approval\nby\nthe Planning Board and the Elected Body. Such submittal shall comply with the site plan requirements of Section B.7-4.1 and the deadlines for all petitions and submittals published by the Planning Board, consistent with the requirements of Section B.6-1.3. For proposals requiring\nsimply site plan review but not rezoning or zoning map amendment the Planning Board shall recommend approval and the Elected Body shall approve any plans that meet all the requirements of this Vienna Business District and the UDO or consistent with the Alternative\nCompliance provisions of Section B.2-1.5(E)(3) and deny any such requests that do not meet the requirements. The Planning Board and the Elected Body may exercise their full authority when considering requests for rezonings or map amendments. The Planning Board and the\nElected Body may, as part of its approval, require conditions to reduce impacts associated with the project as specified in Sections B.6-1.3(A)(1) and B.6-2.2(H).\n(E) The Planning Board and Elected Body will evaluate the design of new structures in terms of the degree to which they contribute to the well-being of the District, while preserving and enhancing the character, integrity, and attractiveness of the Vienna community as identified in the\nLegacy and Lewisville Comprehensive Plans. The major objectives shall be to promote sense of human scale; to encourage architecture which is compatible but not necessarily conforming; to create architectural transition; to provide an open environment; and to develop\ntree-\nlined streets within the VBD-S district. New development shall be appropriate to the site, taking into account the safety, convenience, and amenity of the surrounding area. New development shall be evaluated in relation to the development standards of Section 2 (Development\nStandards) below.\n(F) All properties submitted for rezoning in the neighborhood commercial district area should be considered under the Special Use District zoning provisions of Section B.6-2.2 of the UDO, except that only one-phase petitions shall be considered as specified in the provisions of\nB.6-2.2(C).\n2. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS In the Vienna Business District (VBD-S), a broad array of uses is expected in pattern which integrates shops, restaurants, services, work places, civic, educational, and religious facilities, single-family housing into a pedestrian-oriented environment The\nfollowing standards apply:\n(A) Facades that face the street or sidewalk to provide windows or other architectural features so as not to create a blank facade.\n(B) Internal or external lighting oriented so as to not generate glare on sidewalks or streets.\n(C) The use of cornice canopies, balconies, and arcades to delineate between the ground level and upper levels.\n(D) Medium size buildings to be broken into smaller scale components at the ground level.\n(1)\nPublic-Private Setback Zone. There shall be public-private setback zone to each building.

Sign height shall be measured from the highest portion of the copy area.\n(5)\nMinimum Building Setback .Minimum building setback shall be zero (0) feet.\n(E)\nBuilding Scale. New buildings shall be of a character that is consistent with creating a pedestrian friendly environment considering commercial buildings in the same zoning district and other uses in the immediate vicinity in terms of bulk, scale, orientation, massing, major\ndivisions or rhythms in the facade.\n(F)\nBuilding Materials Brick, wood, stone, hard coat stucco or complementary siding material, imitation vinyl shakes, except that horizontal clapboard style vinyl siding shall be reviewed for its appropriateness and application on case by case basis. Concrete masonry units are not\nacceptable. Asphalt shingles are the preferred roofing material.\n(G)\nRoofs. The preferred roof pitch is between 8:12 and 12:12 pitch with the minimum pitch 8:12. Where the preferred roof pitch makes the height disproportionate with the proportion and mass of the building, a false slope roof acting as mansard with a minimum pitch of 8:12,\ncovering between forty percent (40%) and seventy percent (70%) of the exterior perimeter of the footprint can be used. The remainder of the roof may be covered with low slope roof.\n(H)\nFacades The facade shall enhance the pedestrian environment by use of features such as porches, columns, and cornices. Solid walls and blank exteriors are discouraged.\n(I)\nWindows Reflective glass and band windows are prohibited. The side walls of buildings on corner lots shall have windows similar to the facade.\n(J)\nCanopies\nand\nAwnings\nFeatures shall be designed to complement the street scape of the area.\n(K) Exterior Improvements Features such as fences, utilities, outdoor furniture, signs, and displays shall be compatible with the mass and scale of such other improvements elsewhere in the area.\n(L)\nMaximum Height. Buildings and structures excluding chimneys, unoccupied steeples, spires, flagpoles, cupolas, and roof venting pipes shall not exceed two and one-half stories, with a Maximum height of forty-eight (48) feet.\n(M)\nService\nAreas\nand\nUtilities.
