Many of these\nfacilities and the parking lots, spaces, Structures and facilities that support them have\nexisted for decades and it would be difficult and expensive for the owners and/or operators\nthereof to add or reconfigure onsite and offsite parking beyond that which is presently in\nuse and serving such facilities.\nTherefore, it is the intention of the Town of Montreat that as to all of the Usages existing\non the Effective Date, the parking serving such Usages shall be Non-Conforming Uses of\na Structure allowed in accordance with Article X of this Ordinance, and only with respect\nto construction of additional Structures or substantial expansion, modification or alteration\nof existing Usages, shall the additional parking be required by this Article.
