Conditional Zoning Districts provide for those\nsituations where a particular use, properly planned, may be appropriate for rezoning a particular site.\nConditional zoning provides for flexibility in the development of property while ensuring that the\ndevelopment is compatible with neighboring uses. Conditional zoning affords a degree of certainty in\nland use decisions often not possible when rezoning to a general, or primary, district. Conditional\nZoning Districts are established on an individualized basis, only in response to an application by the\nowners of all the property to be included. If an applicant believes that the development of the\nproperty in a specific manner will lessen adverse effects upon surrounding properties or otherwise\nmake the rezoning more in accordance with the Town's comprehensive plan, they shall apply for\nrezoning to the appropriate Conditional Zoning District and then may specify the nature of the\nproposed development. Otherwise, any applicant requesting the rezoning of property to any district\nother than a Conditional Zoning District (referred to as CZ) shall be prohibited from offering any\ntestimony or evidence concerning the specific manner in which they intend to use or develop the\nproperty.\n153.02 APPLICABILITY\nA Conditional Zoning District bearing the designation CZ shall correspond to each of the other\nprimary Zoning Districts authorized by this Ordinance. Conditional Zoning Districts shall be \"parallel\"\nto general districts. Uses allowed in the corresponding general district shall be permitted in CZ\ndistricts, provided that they meet all additional conditions associated with the Conditional Zoning\nDistrict.

Density requirements. The proposed residential density of the cluster development\n(land area per dwelling unit as shown in Section 152.03 Density & Dimensional\nRequirements) shall be granted no more than one additional lot per acre as that\npermitted in the district in which the development is located. If the cluster\ndevelopment lies in more than one district, the number of allowable dwelling units\nmust be separately calculated for each portion of the development that is in a\nseparate district and must then be combined to determine the number of dwelling\nunits allowable in the entire cluster development.\n3. Frontage requirements. Cluster developments shall have access to a highway or road\nsuitable for the scale and density of development being proposed.\n4. Land uses. A mixture of land uses may be allowed in a cluster development.\nNonresidential uses shall be primarily for the use of the cluster development residents\nand shall not constitute the primary use in the cluster development.

In recognition of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is the intent of the Town of Maggie\nValley to allow communication providers the opportunity to locate towers and related facilities\nwithin its jurisdiction in order to provide an adequate level of service to its customers while\nprotecting the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Maggie Valley and its ETJ.\nWireless towers may be considered undesirable with other types of uses, most notably\nresidential, therefore special regulations are necessary to ensure that any adverse effects to\nexisting and future development are mitigated.\nB. The following conditions must be met in addition to any applicable requirements set forth for\nthe underlying zoning district:\n1. All telecommunication towers must be of a monopole design and construction.\nTowers of the lattice variety may be used if documentation is provided by the\napplicant that demonstrates that a monopole tower cannot adequately serve the area.\n2. It is the intent of the town to encourage providers to co-locate facilities in an effort to\nreduce the number of towers in Maggie Valley's jurisdiction. Providers shall exhaust\nall potential co-location possibilities and provide documentation to that effect before\nthe town considers any application. The town encourages providers to construct\ntelecommunication towers such that additional telecommunication providers may be\nafforded the opportunity to co-locate facilities on the tower. The owners of the towers\nwith co-location space shall negotiate in good faith with other provider's space at a\nreasonable lease cost, and publicize the fact that space is available on a lease basis.\nThe town further reserves the right to make co-location a condition of any tower\npermitted as a special use under the guidelines listed above. No tower may be\nlocated within 1,500 linear feet of an existing tower unless the applicant can prove\nthat co-location is not a viable option.\n3. The maximum height of any tower is 125 feet unless documentation is provided to\nshow a taller tower is required to meet minimal service levels.\n4. Where a telecommunication tower is proposed to be located on a lot with an existing\nnonresidential principal use, the tower should be located in the rear yard. If the\nprincipal use is residential, the tower must be located in the rear yard only.\n5. The Town of Maggie Valley recognizes that a tower cannot be prohibited, nor can a\nspecial use permit be denied on the basis of environmental or health concerns\nrelating to radio emissions if the tower complies with the Federal Radio Frequency\nEmission Standards. The town requires that the applicant provide documentation\n41 of 147\n1/4/2024, 1:50 PM\n"}, {"page": "42", "text": "Print Preview\nhtps://maggievalley.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordina.\nproving that the proposed tower does comply with the Federal Radio Frequency\nEmission Standards.\n6. A minimum lot size as listed in the underlying zoning district is required. In addition, all\nsetbacks required herein shall be met.\n7. In all districts, on all sides of the property, the minimum setback requirement shall be\n150 feet or 2 feet for every 1 foot of actual tower height (i.e., a 150-foot tower would\nrequire a 300-foot setback), whichever is greater. If the applicant can document a\nreduced collapse area, then the setback shall be the greater of that distance or 150\nfeet.\n8. Wherever feasible, all accessory structures on the ground which contain switching\nequipment or other related equipment must be designed to closely resemble the\nneighborhood's basic architecture, or the architecture and style of the principal use on\nthe property. Every effort should be made to conceal a tower within all zoning\ndistricts.\n9. If a road needs to be constructed to a tower site, then the road must be constructed in\naccordance with the town's minimum construction standards for city streets.\n10. Vegetative screening is required along all sides of the perimeter of the tower site. It\nwill be the responsibility of the provider and/or the property owner to keep all\nlandscaping material properly maintained in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was\nestablished. The owners of the property, and any tenant on the property where\nscreening is required, shall be jointly responsible for the maintenance of all screening\nmaterials. The maintenance shall include all actions necessary to keep the screened\narea free of litter and debris, to keep plantings healthy, and to keep planting areas\nneat in appearance. Any vegetation that constitutes part of the screening shall be\nreplaced in the event it dies. In addition, a 12-foot-high fence must be placed around\nthe structure (between the structure and the screening).\n11. Freestanding signs are prohibited. Wall signs, limited to identification, are allowed on\nequipment structures or fences surrounding the telecommunication tower, provided\nsignage does not exceed 9 square feet in size. Any signage must be included in the\napplication for a special use permit.\n12. All towers shall be illuminated only as required by the Federal Communication\nCommission (FCC) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and such illuminations\nin any district shall be directed toward the tower and/or equipment shelters to reduce\nthe effect of glare.\n13. Towers and related facilities must be removed if abandoned (no longer used for its\noriginal intent) for a period greater than 90 consecutive days.\n14. Any replacement or improvement to an existing telecommunication tower, including if\nthe tower is blown over or considered inoperable, requires the provider to apply for a\nnew review and approval process by the Zoning Board of Adjustment. Normal\nmaintenance and repair of the structure can be completed without the issuance of a\nnew special use permit but will require a Zoning Permit to be issued at the discretion\nof the Town Planner.\n15. The provider must show proof of adequate insurance coverage for any potential\ndamage caused by or to the telecommunication tower prior to the issuance of a\n42 of 147\n1/4/2024, 1:50\n"}, {"page": "43", "text": "Print Preview\nhttps://maggievalley.municipalcodeonline.com/book/print?type=ordina.\nspecial use permit.\n16. Outdoor storage of equipment or other related items is prohibited on a\ntelecommunication tower site.\n17. Provider must notify the town of sale or lease of structure.\n18.
