Base Zoning Districts.\n1. Base zoning districts are established\ninitially by the Town's adoption of the\nOfficial Zoning Map and subsequently by\napproval of a rezoning.\n2. Development in a base zoning district is\nsubject to the standards set out or\nreferenced for the district.\n3. For each base zoning district, the\nregulations set out the district's purpose,\nthe intensity and dimensional standards\napplicable in the district, and reference\nother Ordinance standards generally\napplicable to development in the district.\nEach base zoning district also includes\nphotos depicting a building form typical in\nthe district and an illustration depicting\nhow the district's dimensional standards\napply to lots and typical building forms.\nGraphics following the intensity and\ndimensional standards tables are\nincluded for illustrative purposes only and\nshow the application of the dimensional\nand intensity standards to some of the\nuses allowed in the district. If the standards\nin the illustration are inconsistent with the\ntable of intensity and dimensional\nstandards, the standards in the table\ngovern.\nB. Conditional Zoning Districts. Conditional zoning\ndistricts (e.g., OI-CZ) parallel each of the base\nzoning districts and are established through\napproval of a Conditional Rezoning, which\nincorporates district-specific plans and\nconditions proposed and agreed to by the\nowner(s) of the rezoned land. Development in a\nconditional zoning district is subject to the same\nstandards applicable to the parallel base\nzoning district, as modified by the approved\ndistrict-specific terms and conditions.\nC.

Zoning Districts\nSection 2.5.\nPlanned Development Districts\n2.5.1.\nGeneral Purposes of Planned Development Districts\nThe Purpose of Planned Development Districts. Planned development districts are intended to encourage\ninnovative land planning and site design concepts that support a high quality of life and high quality of\ndevelopment and are compatible with natural features and community character.\n2.5.2.\nPlanned Development Districts Established\nThe following two planned development zoning districts are established:\nPlanned Development District (PDD)\nMixed Use Planned Development District (MUPD)\n2.5.3.\nPlanned Development District (PDD)\nA.\nPurpose. The Planned Development District (PPD) is established and intended to promote innovative land\nplanning, design and layout of large development projects that may not otherwise be permitted under\ngeneral zoning district standards, subdivision regulations, or other development regulations. The Planned\nDevelopment District promotes innovative land planning, design and layout by:\n1. Reducing or eliminating the inflexibility that sometimes results from strict application of zoning and\ndevelopment standards or regulations that are designed primarily for individual lots;\n2.\nAllowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access, light, open space, and design\namenities;\n3. Allowing greater freedom for a broad mix of various land uses in the same development;\n4. Promoting quality urban design and environmentally sensitive development by allowing projects to\ntake advantage of special site characteristics, locations, and land uses;\n5.\nEncouraging quality urban design by allowing higher densities when such increases are supported by\nsuperior design or the provision of additional amenities; and\n6. Advancing public health, safety and general welfare.\nIn return for greater flexibility, planned developments are expected to deliver communities of exceptional\ndesign, character and quality that preserve critical environmental resources and provide open space\namenities. Such communities incorporate creative design in the layout of buildings, open space, and\ncirculation; assure compatibility with surrounding land uses and neighborhood character; and provide\ngreater efficiency in the layout and provision of roads, utilities, and other infrastructure. Because flexibility\nis essential for the development of such developments, variations from otherwise applicable regulations\nand standards may be granted with the adoption of the required Planned Development District Master\nPlan (PDD Master Plan).\nThe PDD is a base-zoning district, not an overlay district. Except as modified by specific procedures set\nforth herein, a PDD zoning district shall be established through the process for rezoning property in\naccordance with the procedures for Zoning Map Amendments, as contained in Section 10.4.12, General\nUse Rezoning Review Procedures.\nThe Town Board of Commissioners may recommend revisions or additions to a proposed PDD Master Plan,\nor to a proposed amendment to a PDD Master Plan, that promote the intentions of the Planned\nDevelopment District.\nB.

USE STANDARDS\nSection 3.1.\nOrganization\nThis Section 3.2, Principal Uses, identifies land uses allowed as the principal uses in the various zoning districts\nand sets out any use-specific standards where they apply to a principal use. Section 3.3, Accessory Uses and\nStructures, identifies land uses and structures commonly allowed as accessory to principal uses, sets out\ngeneral standards applicable to all accessory uses and structures, and sets out special standards that apply\nto particular accessory uses and structures. Section 3.4, Temporary Uses and Structures, identifies land uses or\nstructures allowed on a temporary basis, sets out general standards applicable to all temporary uses and\nstructures, and special standards that apply to particular temporary uses and structures.\nSection 3.2.\nPrincipal Uses\n3.2.1.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this Section is to authorize the establishment and continuation of land uses that are allowed as\nthe principal use(s) in a zoning district. It identifies the zoning districts in which these principal uses are allowed\nand sets out any use-specific standards applicable to particular principal uses. This Section is also intended to\nestablish a hierarchy for organizing principal uses that reflects functional relationships among the various\nprincipal uses and that in conjunction with Section 12.3, Principal Use Classification System, makes it easier to\ndetermine whether a particular proposed use is allowable as a principal use in a particular zoning district.\nOrganization and Applicability\n3.2.2.\nOrganization and Applicability\nSection 3.2.3, \"Classification of Principal Uses,\" identifies the hierarchy of use classifications, use categories,\nand use types by which principal uses are organized in this Section's Principal Use Table. Section 3.2.4,\n\"Principal Use Table,\" contains a table listing allowable principal uses and shows whether each use is\npermitted, allowed as a special use, or prohibited within the various zoning districts. Section 3.2.5, \"Principal\nUse-Specific Standards,\" sets forth standards applicable to specific principal uses regardless of the zoning\ndistrict in which they are allowed or the review procedure by which they are approved, unless expressly stated\nto the contrary.\n3.2.3.\nClassification of Principal Uses\nThe following hierarchy of use classifications, use categories, and use types is used to organize allowable uses\nlisted in Section 3.2.4, \"Principal Use Table,\" and the use-specific standards set out in Section 3.2.5, Principal\nUse-Specific Standards. Descriptions of this classification system and hierarchy are contained in Section 12.3,\n\"Principal Use Classification System.\"\nA. Use Classifications. Use Classifications are very broad and general (e.g., Agricultural Uses, Residential Uses,\nInstitutional Uses, Commercial Uses, and Industrial Uses).\nB. Use Categories. Use Categories represent major subgroups of the use classifications that have common\nfunctional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, type of occupants\nor users/customers, or operational characteristics. For example, the Commercial Use Classification is divided\ninto multiple use categories, including Eating or Drinking Uses and Visitor Accommodation Uses.\nC. Use Types.\n1. Use Types identify specific principal land uses whose characteristics are considered to fall within the\nvarious Use Categories. For example, bars, lounges, brewpubs, and restaurants are use types within the\nEating and Drinking Use Category. Each use type is defined in Section 12.12, \"Terms and Uses Defined.\"\n2. While the Residential and Institutional use classifications tend to include relatively specific and well-\ndefined use types, the Commercial and Industrial use classifications tend to include broader uses types,\n50\n"}, {"page": "51", "text": "Chapter 3.

Designation of Uses. Table 3.2.4, \"Principal Use Table,\" uses the following\nabbreviations to establish whether and how a principal use is allowed in a particular zoning district:\n1. Reference to Use-Specific Standards. A particular use category or use type allowable as a principal\nuse in a zoning district may be subject to additional standards that are specific to the particular use.\nThe applicability of such use-specific standards is noted in the last column of the Principal Use Table\n(\"Use-Specific Standards\") through a reference to standards in Section 3.2.5, \"Principal Use-Specific\nStandards.\"\nB. Multiple Principal Uses. A development may include a single principal use with one or more accessory uses\nthat are customarily incidental and subordinate to the principal use (e.g., home occupation as accessory\nto a dwelling, or administrative offices as accessory to a school, retail sales, or manufacturing use). A\ndevelopment may also include multiple principal uses, none of which is necessarily customarily incidental\nor subordinate to another principal use (e.g., a place of worship combined with a school, a gas station\ncombined with a convenience store, restaurant, or automotive repair use, or a flex building housing retail,\nindustrial and services uses, and warehousing tenants). A development with multiple principal uses shall\ninclude only those principal uses designated in the use tables as allowed in the applicable zoning district,\nand each principal use shall be subject to any use-specific standards applicable to the use, unless\nexpressly stated to the contrary.\nC.

This Section\nalso identifies the zoning districts in which such accessory uses and structures are allowed, sets out general\nstandards applicable to all accessory uses and structures, and sets out any special standards applicable to\nparticular accessory uses and structures. This Section is intended to allow a broad range of accessory uses\nand structures, SO long as they are located on the same site as the principal use and comply with the standards\nset forth in this Section to reduce potentially adverse impacts on surrounding lands.\n3.3.2.\nOrganization and Applicability\nSection 3.3.3, \"General Standards for All Accessory Uses and Structures,\" establishes general standards that\napply to all allowed accessory uses and structures. Section 3.3.4, \"Accessory Use/Structure Table,\" shows\nwhether a particular type of accessory use or structure is permitted or prohibited within the various zoning\ndistricts. It is not intended to limit allowable accessory uses and structures to those listed in the Accessory\nUse/Structure Table. Section 3.3.5, \"Accessory Use-Specific Standards,\" sets forth standards for all accessory\nuses and structures for which a reference to this Section is provided in the \"Use-Specific Standards\" column of\nthe Accessory Use/Structure Table for a particular type of accessory use or structure regardless of the zoning\n64\n"}, {"page": "65", "text": "Chapter 3.

This Subsection applies where a Riparian Buffer Development Review application proposes\na use or activity listed as \"Allowable with Mitigation\" in Table 4.2.7, \"Uses and Activities Permitted in Riparian\nBuffers,\" or where mitigation is proposed or required as a condition of approval for a Riparian Buffer\nVariance application. Any application for Riparian Buffer Development Review or a Riparian Buffer\nVariance that proposes mitigation shall include a written mitigation proposal that calculates the required\narea of mitigation in accordance with Section 4.2.8.C, \"Area of Mitigation,\" and describes the area and\nlocation of each type of proposed mitigation.\nB.\nOptions for Meeting for Mitigation Requirement. The mitigation requirement may be met through one of\nthe following options: On-site or off-site riparian buffer restoration, enhancement, or preservation in\naccordance with this Section, payment of a compensatory mitigation fee to a mitigation bank if buffer\ncredits are available from the bank pursuant to 15A N.C.A.C. 02B .0295(g), or to the Riparian Buffer\nRestoration Fund pursuant to 15A N.C.A.C. 02B.0295(h) if the applicant is a government entity or buffer\ncredits are not available from a mitigation bank within the same 8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code as the buffer\nimpact; or Donation of real property or an interest in real property.\nC.

Location of Mitigation. For any option used to mitigate impacts to riparian buffers in the Jordan Lake\nwatershed, the mitigation effort shall be located within the same subwatershed of the Jordan Lake\nwatershed, and the same or closer distance from Jordan Lake as the proposed impact, and as close to\nthe location of the impact as feasible. Alternatively, the applicant may propose mitigation anywhere\nwithin the same subwatershed of the Jordan Lake watershed if the mitigation proposal accounts for\ndifferences in delivery of nutrients to the affected arm of Jordan Lake resulting from differences between\nthe locations of the buffer impact and mitigation. Additional location requirements for the property\ndonation option are enumerated in Section 4.2.8.H, Donation of Property.\nE.\nRiparian Buffer Restoration or Enhancement. Restoration and enhancement are intended to establish a\nforested riparian buffer in accordance with the standards of this Subsection. Persons who choose to meet\ntheir mitigation requirement through riparian buffer restoration or enhancement shall comply with the\nfollowing standards.\n1. Restoration or Enhancement. Restoration shall be distinguished from enhancement based on existing\nriparian buffer conditions. Where the density of existing woody vegetation is less than 100 trees per\nacre, a riparian buffer may be restored.

Development Standards\nCHAPTER 6. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS\nSection 6.1.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this Chapter is to ensure that developments include or contribute to the provision of common\nopen space for the use and enjoyment of the development's occupants and users. Open space serves\nnumerous purposes, including preservation and protection of natural areas and features, providing\nopportunities for passive and active recreation, enhancing management of stormwater runoff to protect\nwater quality and reduce flooding, and mitigating the heat island effect of developed areas. The purpose of\nthis Section is to ensure that new residential subdivisions include or contribute to the provision of public\nrecreation area sufficient to meet the passive and active recreation needs of residents of the subdivision, as\nwell of the surrounding neighborhood. The purpose of this Chapter is also to enhance the visual quality of non-\nresidential development, soften the appearance of expansive paved areas and building mass, and create\nand maintain a pleasing appearance in the community, reduce the effects of glare and heat caused by\nparking areas and to reduce visual clutter along commercialized streets. Perimeter buffers are intended to\nprovide spacing and landscaping between proposed development and adjoining property to help mitigate\npotential negative impacts on or from development activities on adjoining properties. Street yard buffers are\nintended to provide spacing and landscaping between proposed development and adjoining streets to\nmitigate potential adverse impacts from traffic on the adjoining street, provide a transition between public\nand private realms, and create an attractive edge along the street for motorists and pedestrians.\nSection 6.2.\nGeneral Site Layout and Design\n6.2.1.\nPurpose & Applicability\nDevelopment in all zoning districts shall comply with the following standards:\n1. The general location, character, and extent of new, extended, or widened or expanded streets, public\nutilities and service facilities, and parks and other public areas shall be generally consistent with the\nComprehensive Plan.\n2. Developments shall be laid out and designed to functionally and visually integrate their design\nelements (open spaces, buildings, parking, utilities, stormwater management facilities, etc.)-both\nwithin the development and in relationship to surrounding developments.\n3.\nThe layout of streets, lots, building sites, and other elements of development shall be designed to\nminimize alteration of natural and historic site features to be preserved.\n4. Developments shall minimize impacts to sensitive natural resources and other unique and fragile site\nelements-including, but not limited to, streams, wetlands, steep slopes, and significant strands of\nmature trees where practicable.\n5.\nAll new lots shall be located wholly outside any riparian buffer required in accordance with Section\n4.2, \"Riparian Buffers.\"\n6. Streets, building sites; and the buildable areas of lots should be located outside floodways and non-\nencroachment areas, this provision does not prohibit crossings at those areas.\n6.2.2.\nBlock and Lot Design Standards\nA. Blocks\n1. Blocks shall be laid out to provide a functional street pattern and circulation and connectivity in\naccordance with the standards in Access and Circulation.\n2.\nBlocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two back-to-back rows of street-fronting lots of\nappropriate depth for the zoning district, excluding any water bodies, public alleys, or other public\nrights-of-way. Exceptions shall be permitted in blocks adjacent to arterials, railroads, or waterways, or\ndue to limiting topographical conditions, the size or configuration of the site, or for approved through\nlots.\n158\n"}, {"page": "159", "text": "Chapter 6. Development Standards\n3. Blocks shall be at least 400 feet long and no more than 1,200 feet long except as necessary to secure\nefficient use of land or desired features of the street pattern, or to reflect the size and configuration of\nthe site.\na. The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined based on the following:\nb. Lot area and width standards;\nC. Needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of vehicular, bicycle, and\npedestrian traffic;\nd. Relationship to existing utilities;\ne. Layout of the water system with regard to eliminating stagnant water, providing adequate fire\nflow, appropriately placing fire hydrants, and meeting minimum pressure requirements.;\nf.\nLayout of the sanitary sewer system with regard to utilizing gravity sewer system wherever possible\nand minimizing the use of sewer force mains;\ng. Layout of the stormwater management system with regard to utilizing natural outfalls adjacent\nto the land being subdivided, and effectively using existing public stormwater or drainage\nsystems;\nh. Location of existing and proposed easements; and\ni.\nEnvironmental or topographical limitations.\nB. Lots\n1.\nEach lot shall meet the applicable lot area and width standards set forth in Chapter 2, \"Zoning District,\"\nand otherwise be developable in accordance with the standards in this Ordinance.\n2.\nLots shall be arranged in relationship to topography, flood hazards, tree protection requirements, or\nother site conditions to minimize difficulties in providing a reasonable building site and yard area\nin\naccordance with requirements of this Ordinance.\n3. Lots shall be configured SO that buildings and general flood sensitive site facilities are not located in\ndrainage ways.\n4.\nLots shall include at least 20 feet of frontage on a public or private street right-of-way for each of the\nfollowing dwelling types:\na.

Uses with Variable Vehicle Parking Demand Characteristics and Unlisted Uses. For some listed uses, Table\n6.4.3.A refers to this Section because the use has widely varying vehicle parking and loading demand\ncharacteristics, making it difficult to establish a single appropriate off- street vehicle parking or loading\nstandard. On receiving an application proposing such a use, or proposing a use not expressly listed in\nTable 6.4.3.A, \"Minimum Number of Off-Street Vehicle and Bicycle Parking Spaces,\" the Planning Director\nis authorized to:\n1. Apply the minimum off-street parking space requirement specified in Table 6.4.3.A for the listed use\nthat is deemed most similar to the proposed use; or\n2.\nEstablish the minimum off-street parking space requirement by reference to standard parking\nresources published by the National Parking Association or the American Planning Association; or\n3. Establish the minimum off-street parking space requirement based on a parking demand study\nprepared by the applicant that estimates parking demand based on the recommendations of the\nInstitute of Traffic Engineers or other acceptable source of parking demand data, and that includes\nrelevant data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same or comparable to the\nproposed use in terms of density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location.\nC. Requirements for Developments with Multiple Uses. Developments containing more than one principal\ninstitutional or commercial use shall provide vehicle parking spaces in an amount equal to the total of the\nrequirements applied to all individual principal uses. This provision shall not limit the opportunity to reduce\nthe minimum number of required off-street vehicle parking spaces through approval of an alternative\nparking plan that justifies the feasibility of shared parking (See Shared Parking.)\nD.\nMaximum Number of Off-Street Vehicle Parking Spaces. The number of off-street vehicle parking spaces\nshall not exceed 125 percent of the minimum number of parking spaces, unless allowed in accordance\nwith Section 6.4.8.A, \"Provision Over Maximum Allowed.\"\nE. Compact Vehicle Parking Spaces.\n1.\nUp to 20 percent of the required number of off-street vehicle parking spaces may be designed to\naccommodate compact vehicles.\n2.\nCompact vehicle parking spaces may only be used where the parking angle is 90 degrees.\n3. Compact vehicle parking spaces shall consist as one or more group(s) of contiguous spaces located\nwhere they can be readily identified by vehicle drivers through signage and/or pavement marking.\nF.\nElectric Vehicle (EV) Charging Stations.\n1. Up to ten percent of the required number of off-street vehicle parking spaces may be used and\ndesignated as electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, subject to the use-specific standards in Table\n6.4.3.A and Subsection 2 below. Such spaces may include one required accessible parking space\n174\n"}, {"page": "175", "text": "Chapter 6. Development Standards\n(see Subsection K below). The Planning Director shall have authority to approve the use and\ndesignation of additional required parking spaces as electric vehicle charging stations, provided that\nsuch additional spaces shall count as only one-half of a parking space when computing the minimum\nnumber of parking spaces required.\n2.\nVehicle parking spaces used as electric vehicle charging stations shall consist as one or more group(s)\nof contiguous spaces located where they can be readily identified by electric vehicle drivers (e.g.,\nthrough directional signage), but where their use by non-electric vehicles is discouraged (e.g., not in\nlocations most convenient to the entrances of the buildings served).\nG.\nOn-Street Vehicle Parking. Except as authorized as part of an alternative parking plan in Section 6.4.8,\n\"Off-Street Parking Alternatives,\" on-street vehicle parking on streets or driveways shall not be used to\nsatisfy the off-street vehicle parking standards of this Section.\nH. Shared Parking. Parking spaces shall not be counted toward a building or use if similarly included for a\nseparate building or use unless authorized by Section 6.4.3.H, \"Shared Parking.\"\nI.\nOff-site Parking. Unless authorized by Section 6.4.8.G, \"Off-Site Parking,\" Off-street parking spaces shall be\nlocated on the same lot as the use, or on a separate lot if:\n1. The parking area is located within 500 feet of the use's principal entrance; and\n2. The lot and use is owned by the same owner.\nJ.\nDriveways Used to Satisfy Off-Street Vehicle Requirements. For single-family detached, duplex,\nmanufactured home, and single-family attached dwellings, only driveways may be used to satisfy\nminimum off-street vehicle parking space requirements, provided sufficient space is available outside\na\nstreet right-of-way or easement to satisfy the standards of this Section and this Ordinance.\nK. Accessible Parking Spaces for Physically Disabled Persons. In each off-street parking area, a portion of the\ntotal number of off-street vehicle parking spaces shall be spaces specifically designated, located, and\nreserved for use by persons with physical disabilities (\"accessible parking spaces\"), in accordance with\nthe standards of the current North Carolina Building Code and applicable ANSI Standards and applicable\nfederal requirements.\n6.4.4.\nOff-Street Loading Space Requirements\nA. Minimum Number of Off-Street Loading Spaces.\n1.\nNew development involving the routine vehicular delivery or shipping of goods, supplies, or equipment\nto or from the development site shall provide a sufficient number of off-street loading spaces to\naccommodate the delivery and shipping operations of the development's uses in a safe and\nconvenient manner.\n2. Table 6.4.4.A, \"Minimum Number of Off-Street Loading Spaces,\" sets forth the minimum number of\nloading spaces that presumptively satisfies the loading space needs of medium-sized and large-sized\ndelivery/shipping trucks based on the use classification or category of the principal use and the size of\nthe development. It is assumed that the needs of small delivery/shipping trucks can be met through\nthe temporary use of parking spaces or vehicle use areas, without impeding or blocking the use of\nadjacent driveways or fire lanes.\n3.\nThe Planning Director may require a higher or lower number of loading spaces than called for by Table\n6.4.4.A, \"Minimum Number of Off-Street Loading Spaces,\" on determining that the characteristics of\nthe particular development warrant such an increase or decrease and the general standard in\nSubsection 1 is met.\n175\n"}, {"page": "176", "text": "Chapter 6.

DEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES\nSection 7.1.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this Chapter is to promote, protect, and sustain the health, welfare, safety, and quality of life\nfor the Pittsboro community and its residents, and to provide tools that offer meaningful benefits to developers\nwhen planning residential and commercial improvements to encourage alignment with these goals and\nvalues. Offering incentives as a tool in this respect, enables developers and the community to work together\nto achieve valuable economic, social, and environmental goals, and are an integral part of creating a more\nsustainable, diverse, and equitable community.\nSection 7.2.\nAffordable Housing\n7.2.1.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and welfare by incentivizing high-quality\nand affordable housing in neighborhoods throughout the Pittsboro for households of all income levels, ages,\nand sizes to meet the Town of Pittsboro's goal of preserving and promoting a community with a culturally and\neconomically diverse population. The diversity of the Pittsboro's housing stock has declined due to increasing\nproperty values and construction costs. The Town of Pittsboro recognizes the need to provide affordable\nhousing to low- to moderate income earning households to maintain a diverse population and to provide\nhousing for those who live or work in the town. This Chapter is intended to attract rather than forcibly compel\nor otherwise mandate affordable housing. This Chapter provides incentives available to developers to\nencourage developers to participate in the construction of affordable housing within Pittsboro.\n7.2.2.\nEligibility (Qualifying Projects)\nAll Affordable Housing Development Projects must provide 30-years of affordability to qualify for the\nDevelopment Incentives listed in Section 7.2. In addition to the requirement that an eligible Development\nProject shall provide 30-years of affordability with its affordable housing, the eligibility for the incentives listed\nin Section 7.2 and the determination of a qualifying project is as follows:\nA. Development Projects that propose and construct at least 5% of the total dwelling units in the\nDevelopment Project with Units allotted for Qualifying Persons or Qualifying Households earning 60% AMI\nor less, or\nB. Development Projects that propose and construct at least 10% of the total dwelling unit in the\nDevelopment Project with Units allotted for Qualifying Persons or Qualifying Households earning more\nthan 60% AMI and up to and including 80% AMI, or\nC.\nDevelopment Projects that propose and construct at least 15% of the total dwelling unit in the\nDevelopment Project with Units allotted for Qualifying Persons or Qualifying Households earning more\nthan 80% and up to and including 120% AMI are eligible for the following incentives, or\nD. Development Projects that propose and construct at least 10% of the total dwelling unit in the\nDevelopment Project with Units allotted for Qualifying Persons or Qualifying Households that include a\nmixture of the three AMI categories listed in A, B or C of this Section.

Density Credit Payment.\n1. In situations where a Developer is not proposing to directly construct an Affordable Housing Dwelling\nUnit but still desires to participate in the Town's Affordable Housing efforts, the Developer may make a\nDensity Credit payment to the Town of Pittsboro in the form of cash or by land donation.\n198\n"}, {"page": "199", "text": "Chapter 7. Development Incentives\n2. One (1) Density Credit, obtained by either cash or land donation, is equal to one (1) Affordable\nHousing Dwelling Unit.\n3. Developers who opt into the Density Credit payment option are eligible to receive an increase in\ndensity and expedited review equal to that of the standards outlined in Sections 7.2.4(A)(1) and\n7.2.4(A)(3). A Density Credit Payment shall not entitle a Developer to Application and Development\nfee rebates nor dimensional standard variations.\n4. The Density Credit payment dollar amount is to be determined annually and specified in the Town of\nPittsboro budget ordinance fee schedule.\n5.\nIf approved by the Town of Pittsboro Board of Commissioners, the Developer may transfer any Density\nCredit not used in the subject Development Project to another Development Project of the Developer,\nor the Developer may transfer any part or all of the Density Credit not used by the Developer to another\nDeveloper of a Development Project. This approval by the Board of Commissioners need not require\na public hearing.\n6. The Density Credit proceeds will be distributed by the Town and may be applied to any targeted AMI\ngroup of Affordable Housing Dwelling Units, including households earning 60% AMI or less, households\nearning more than 60% AMI and up to and including 80% AMI, and households earning more than 80%\nAMI and up to an including 120% AMI.\n7. Density Credits obtained by either cash or land donation added to a qualifying project via the\nprovisions of Section 7.2 shall not count against the minimum threshold to determine project eligibility\ndefined Section 7.2.2. For example, if a Development Project has 100 total units, with 10 affordable\nhousing units, the density may be increased to allow 130 dwelling units using the 3:1 ratio as set forth in\nTable 7.2.1. The percentage used for eligibility determination shall be 10% of 10 of 100, and not 10 of\n130.\n8. In addition to Sections 7.2.3(A)(1-7), the Density Credits associated with Developer land contributions\nare also subject to the following:\na. The Town of Pittsboro Board of Commissioners shall approve all land donations. This approval\nby the Board of Commissioners need not require a public hearing.\nb. Density Credits will be determined using the most recent year's tax valuation of the land to be\ncontributed and using the dollar figure referenced in Section 7.2.3(A)(4) as the denominator to\ndetermine the number of credits. Credits will not be rounded to the nearest whole number SO\nany excess value will be forfeited by the land contributor upon donation. For example, if one\n(1) Density Credit is equal to $100,000 as set forth in the Town's budget ordinance, then a\npayment or land donation equal to $100,000 entitles the developer to one (1) additional\nAffordable Housing Dwelling Unit. If the land being donated is valued at $210,000, the\ndeveloper is entitled to two (2) additional affordable dwelling units. Similarly, a land donation\nequal to a value of $290,000 will only entitle the developer to two (2) additional affordable\ndwelling units.\nC. To qualify for the additional density credits described in this section, the donation of land must\nmeet all of the following criteria:\ni.\nThe donated land must be transferred by warranty deed no later than the date of the\napproval of the final subdivision plat for the first phase of the Development Project; and\nii. The donated land must be zoned in a manner sufficient to permit construction of\naffordable dwelling units; and\niii. The donated land shall be at least one acre in size and a shape configured to permit\nthe development of at least as many affordable dwelling units as the number of Density\nCredits provided; and\niv. The donated land shall be at least 85% upland, and\nV. Land donated for Density Credits shall not include slopes exceeding 15%, and\nvi.\nThe donated land shall be served by adequate public facilities and infrastructure SO\nthat it is connected to a public roadway and public water and sewer systems no later\nthan the date of the approval of the final subdivision plat for the first phase of the\nDevelopment Project; and\n199\n"}, {"page": "200", "text": "Chapter 7.

The rebate shall provide a reimbursement of a percentage of the Application and Development\nFees Paid to the Town for its review for the percentage of Affordable Housing Dwelling Units\nproposed in the Development Project. For example, if a project proposes 100 total dwelling units\nwith 10 Affordable Housing Dwelling Units, then the developer is eligible for a 100% Application\nand Development Fee rebate on those 10 units, or 10% of the total Development Project fee\nexpense.\nb.

Nonconformities\nCHAPTER 8. NONCONFORMITIES\nSection 8.1.\nPurpose\nThere exist lots, uses, structures, signs, and site features that were lawfully established, but that do not conform\nto the applicable standards and requirements of this Ordinance. The lots, uses, structures, signs, and site\nfeatures are collectively referred to as \"nonconformities.\" It is the general policy of the Town to allow\nnonconformities to continue to exist. It also is the policy of the Town to bring as many nonconformities into\nconformance with this Ordinance as practical, subject to the requirements of this Chapter. The purpose and\nintent of this Chapter is to recognize the interests of landowners in continuing to use the land, but to preclude\nthe expansion of a nonconformity or the reconstruction or reestablishment of a substantially destroyed or\ndiscontinued nonconformity unless doing SO can serve as an incentive to achievement of even greater public\nbenefit.\nSection 8.2.\nBurden for Establishing Nonconforming Status\nIn all cases, the burden of establishing that a nonconformity lawfully exists shall be the responsibility of the\nowner of the land on which the nonconformity is located.\nSection 8.3.\nChange of Tenancy or Ownership\nNo change of title or possession or right to possession of land on which there is a nonconforming lot,\nuse,\nstructure, sign, or site feature shall be construed as affecting the status of the lot, use, structure, sign, or site\nfeature as nonconforming, or the applicability of the provisions of this Chapter to the nonconformity.\nSection 8.4.\nNonconforming Lots\nA. Use and Development of Nonconforming Lots. A nonconforming lot may be used and developed for any\nuse or structure subject to compliance with applicable standards of this Ordinance, except:\n1. A single-family dwelling may be built on nonconforming lots in the Agricultural and Residential districts\nif it is located to minimize nonconformities to the maximum extent practical; and\n2.\nNotwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Ordinance, a nonconforming lot in the\nMixed-Use and Nonresidential districts that fails to comply with applicable dimensional standards\n(e.g., lot area, lot width, setbacks) may be developed with a permitted use if the development of\nthe permitted use on the nonconforming lot complies with the applicable dimensional standards to\nthe maximum extent practical.\nB. Merger of Adjoining Lots to Eliminate or Reduce Nonconformity. When a nonconforming lot adjoins\nanother lot (whether conforming or nonconforming) under the same ownership, the lots shall be combined\nor recombined to make the nonconforming lot conforming or reduce the extent of its nonconformity,\nprovided no new nonconforming situation (whether lot, use, structure, sign, lighting, or other site feature)\nis created.\nExample:\nWithin a zoning district with a minimum lot area requirement of 10,000 square feet, the owner of an\n8,000- square-foot nonconforming lot buys the adjoining 8,000-square-foot conforming lot. The owner\nis required to recombine the two lots to increase the area of the nonconforming lot to at least 10,000\nsquare feet if the recombination can be done in a way that does not make the conforming lot\nnonconforming (e.g., reduce its area to under 10,000 square feet)o make any use, structure, sign,\nlighting, or other site feature on the conforming lot nonconforming (e.g., move a lot line too close to a\nstructure to allow its compliance with applicable setback standards).\nC. Governmental Acquisition of a Portion of Lot. If a conforming lot is made nonconforming due to\ngovernmental acquisition of a portion of the lot for a public purpose that results in the lot no longer\ncomplying with applicable lot area or lot width standards, the lot shall be deemed a conforming lot on\nreceipt of a Site Plan approval demonstrating that the development existing or proposed on the lot:\n1. Complies with the permitted uses in Table 3.2.4, \"Principal Use Table\";\n203\n"}, {"page": "204", "text": "Chapter 8.

Nothing in this Subsection exempts a lot from meeting the applicable\nregulations of the Chatham County Health Department.\nSection 8.5.\nNonconforming Uses\n1.\nContinuation of Nonconforming Uses. A nonconforming use may be continued subject to the requirements\nin this Section.\n2. Change in Use. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph B, a nonconforming use may only be changed\nto a use that is permitted in the zoning district in which it is located. A change in the intensity, or frequency\nof activity, or in equipment or processes, associated with a nonconforming use does not constitute a\nchange in use provided such changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than\nchanges in the use itself. A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use with a\nSpecial Use Permit approved in accordance with Section 10.4.10, Special Use Permit, if the Board of\nCommissioners additionally finds that the new use is of equal or less intensity, based on consideration of\nthe following factors:\na. Traffic generated;\nb. Number of off-street parking spaces required;\nC. Number of persons on the premises at a time of peak demand; and\nd.\nOff-site impact (such as noise, glare, dust, vibration, or smoke) to surrounding lands and public health\nand safety.\n3.\nDiscontinuance of Nonconforming Uses. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph B below, if a\nnonconforming use is discontinued for 180 consecutive days, subsequent use of land or structures\npreviously devoted to such use shall not be used for any nonconforming uses and shall thereafter be\ndevoted to conforming uses only. A nonconforming use that has been discontinued for 180 consecutive\ndays, but less than two years, may be reestablished with a Special Use Permit approved in accordance\nwith Section 10.4.10, Special Use Permit, where the Board of Commissioners additionally finds that the\ndiscontinuance resulted from factors that, for all practical purposes, were beyond the control of the person\nmaintaining the nonconforming use.\n4. Extension, Expansion, or Relocation of Nonconforming Uses.\na. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs B and C below, a nonconforming use shall not be\nextended, expanded, or moved to occupy a different or greater area of land or structures than it\noccupied at the time it became nonconforming-provided that:\ni. A nonconforming use of a structure may be extended throughout any parts of the structure\nthat were manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use at the time the use\nbecame nonconforming; and\nii.\nA nonconforming use of open land that involves the removal of natural materials from the land\nmay be expanded only within areas shown on the approved plans associated with\nauthorization of the use, and only if ten percent or more of the natural materials within the site\nhad already been removed when the use became nonconforming.\nb. A structure used as a nonconforming single-family or manufactured home dwelling may be\nextended, enlarged, or replaced with another single-family or manufactured home dwelling of any\nsize-provided the extended, enlarged, or replacement dwelling does not create any new\nnonconformities with respect to setback standards.\nC.\nA structure used for any nonconforming use other than a single-family or manufactured home\ndwelling may be extended, enlarged, or replaced with another structure used for the\nnonconforming use with approval of a Special Use Permit in accordance with Section 10.4.10,\nSpecial Use Permit, where the Board of Commissioners additionally finds that the extended,\nenlarged, or replacement structure does not:\ni.

In all cases, the burden of establishing that a nonconformity lawfully exists shall be the\nresponsibility of the owner.\n5. Displacement of Nonconforming Uses by Government Acquisition. If a government acquisition of a\nportion of a lot for public purposes results in displacement of a nonconforming use, such use may be\nrelocated or expanded on the remainder of the lot, provided the relocation or expansion does not:\na. Increase the total amount of lot area devoted to the nonconforming use; or\nb. Create any greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional standards.\nSection 8.6.\nNonconforming Signs\nA. Continuation of Nonconforming Signs. Nonconforming signs may be continued subject to the\nrequirements in this Section.\nB. Extension, Enlargement, Alteration, or Relocation of Nonconforming Signs. A nonconforming sign shall not\nbe extended, enlarged, structurally altered, or relocated unless the sign is made to conform to the current\nstandards of this Ordinance.\nC.\nRemoval of Nonconforming Signs. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph B below, a nonconforming\nsign shall be removed or made conforming within eight years after the date it became nonconforming\nas\na result of the adoption of this Ordinance or a subsequent amendment to this Ordinance, and any sign\nrequired to be removed under a prior Zoning Ordinance but not yet removed shall be removed or made\nconforming within four years after the effective date of this Ordinance. A nonconforming outdoor\nadvertising sign shall be exempt from the requirement in paragraph A above as long as the Town is\nrequired by State or federal law to pay cash compensation for removal of the sign. When the sign\nbecomes no longer subject to such a compensation requirement, it shall be removed or made conforming\nwithin five and one-half years thereafter.\nSection 8.7.\nNonconforming Site Features\nA. Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to provide a means for the Town to require certain nonconforming\nsite features be brought into compliance with the standards of this Ordinance as part of remodeling or\nexpansion of a structure.\nB. Applicability. For purposes of this Section, the term \"nonconforming site feature\" means nonconforming\noff-street parking, nonconforming landscaping, and nonconforming perimeter buffer.\nC. Extension, Enlargement, Alteration, or Relocation of Nonconforming Site Features. No action shall be taken\nthat increases the degree or extent of a nonconforming site feature, except as otherwise provided below,\nUpgrading of Nonconforming Site Features. A nonconforming site feature shall not be extended, enlarged,\nstructurally altered, or relocated unless the feature is made to conform to the current standards of this\nOrdinance.\nD. Upgrading of Nonconforming Site Features.\n1.\nWith Expansion of Structures. If an application is filed for a Building Permit for the expansion of one or\nmore structures on a site containing nonconforming site features, upgrading of the nonconforming\nsite features towards compliance shall be required, in accordance with the following:\na. If the cumulative increase in the structure's floor area over the past five-year period is 25\npercent or less of the structure's current floor area, the nonconforming site feature may\ncontinue without any upgrading towards compliance with current applicable standards of this\nOrdinance.\nb.\nIf the cumulative increase in the structures' floor area over the past five-year period exceeds\n25 percent, but is 75 percent or less, of the structure's current floor area, the nonconforming\nsite features shall be upgraded towards compliance with current applicable standards of this\nOrdinance by a corresponding percentage of full compliance, up to achievement of 100\npercent compliance.\n205\n"}, {"page": "206", "text": "Chapter 8. Nonconformities\nC. Example: If the cumulative increase in such structures' floor area over the past five-year period\nexceeds 50 percent of the structure's current floor area, the nonconforming site features shall\nbe upgraded to fully conform to the current applicable standards of this Ordinance.\n2. With Remodeling of Structures. If an application is filed for a Building Permit for the remodeling of one\nor more structures on a site containing nonconforming site features, upgrading of the nonconforming\nsite features towards compliance may be required, in accordance with the following:\na. If the cumulative costs of the remodeling over the past five-year period is 25 percent or less of\nthe structure's current floor area, the nonconforming site features may continue without any\nupgrading towards compliance with current applicable standards of this Ordinance.\nb. If the cumulative costs of the remodeling over the past five-year period exceeds 25 percent,\nbut is 75 percent or less, of the structure's current assessed value, the nonconforming site\nfeatures shall be upgraded towards compliance with current applicable standards of this\nOrdinance by a corresponding percentage of full compliance, up to achievement of 100\npercent compliance.\nC. Example: If the cumulative costs of the remodeling over the past five-year period exceeds 50\npercent of the structure's current assessed value, the nonconforming site features shall be\nupgraded to fully conform to the current applicable standards of this Ordinance.\n3.\nSubstantial Expansion of Outdoor Operations, Storage, and Display Areas. If outdoor operations,\nstorage, and display areas are being expanded on a site containing nonconforming perimeter\nbuffer or screening of such outdoor areas, and the increase in the gross square footage of all such\noutdoor areas exceeds 50 percent of the current area used for outdoor operations, storage, and\ndisplays, the nonconforming buffers and screening shall be upgraded in conjunction with the\nexpansion to conform to the current applicable standards of this Ordinance.\n4. Compliance to Maximum Extent Practical. Where full compliance with the requirements of this\nSection is precluded by a lack of sufficient developable area due to the size of the lot, the layout\nof\nexisting development, or the presence of significant wetlands, floodplains, watercourses, or other\nsignificant environmental features or constraints on development, the applicant shall comply with\nthe requirements of this Section to the maximum extent practical.\n206\n"}, {"page": "207", "text": "Chapter 9.

Development Review Procedures\n10.4.16. Development Agreement Review Procedures\nA.\nPurpose. This Section is intended to implement and be consistent with the comprehensive plan of the\nTown. The objective of this Section is accomplished by authorizing development agreements in which a\ndeveloper and the Town of Pittsboro may ensure the adequacy of public facilities and encourage sound\ncapital improvement planning while providing certainty in the process of obtaining development\napproval and reducing the economic costs of development by providing greater regulatory certainty.\nThe purpose of this Section is to establish standards and procedures for entering into Development\nAgreements for long-term, large-scale developments with the following statements of intent:\n1. Large-scale development projects often occur in multiple phases extending over a period of years,\nrequiring a long-term commitment of both public and private resources.\n2. Such large-scale developments often create potential community impacts and potential\nopportunities that are difficult or impossible to accommodate within traditional zoning processes.\n3.\nBecause of their scale and duration, such large-scale projects often require careful integration\nbetween public capital facilities planning, financing, and construction schedules and the phasing\nof the private development.\n4. Because of their scale and duration, such large-scale projects involve substantial commitments of\nprivate capital by private developers, which private developers are unwilling to risk without sufficient\nassurances that development standards will remain stable through the extended period of the\ndevelopment.\n5. Because of their size and duration, such developments often permit communities and developers to\nexperiment with different or nontraditional types of development concepts and standards, while still\nmanaging the impacts on the surrounding areas.\n6.\nTo better structure and manage development approvals for such large-scale developments and\nensure their proper integration into local capital facilities programs, local governments need the\nflexibility in negotiating such developments.\n7.\nIn negotiating for such developments, the intent of the Town is to remain consistent with the adopted\nplans, policies, and goals of the Town as they relate to land use and capital improvements.\nB.\nApplicability. The Town of Pittsboro may enter into a development agreement with a developer, subject\nto the requirements and procedures set forth in this Section. In entering into such an agreement, the Town\nmay not exercise any authority or make any commitment not authorized by general or local act and may\nnot impose any tax or fee not authorized by otherwise applicable law. If more than one local government\nis made party to an agreement, the agreement must specify which local government is responsible for\nthe overall administration of the development agreement. The Town may consider requests to participate\nin development agreements for any development within the land use jurisdiction of the Town or adjoining\njurisdictions in which the development impacts the communities or natural resources of the Town. For\nconsideration of the Town to participate in development agreements, the following standards shall be\nmet:\n1. The property in question must be developable property of any size, including property that is subject\nto an executed brownfields agreement in accordance with Part 5 of Chapter 9 of Chapter 130A of\nthe NCGS.\n2. The duration of the development agreement shall not exceed a reasonable term as specified in the\nagreement.\n3. The estimated appraised value of the development (including all real property) at build-out shall\nequal or exceed $20,000,000.00, or will demonstrate that the proposed development will significantly\nenhance opportunities for very-low income or special populations, protect natural resources, or\npreserve critical watersheds within the Town.\n4.

With the mutual consent of the other parties to the agreement, the Planning\nDirector may approve minor modifications of the Development Agreement, without following the same\nprocedures as required for initial approval of the agreement. Before doing SO, the Planning Director shall\nmake written findings that the proposed minor modifications would not significantly change the use,\nintensity, or design of the development, would be consistent with the purposes and goals of the\nagreement, would comply with this Ordinance, and would not adversely affect the public health, safety,\nor general welfare. Except as otherwise provided, any development agreement entered into and\napproved by the Town or other local government jurisdiction before the effective date of a change of\njurisdiction shall be valid for the duration of the agreement, or eight (8) years from the effective date of\nthe change in jurisdiction, whichever is earlier. The parties to the development agreement and the local\ngovernment assuming jurisdiction have the same rights and obligations with respect to each other\nregarding matters addressed in the development agreement as if the property had remained in the\nprevious jurisdiction. The Town may modify or suspend the provisions of the development agreement if\nthe Town determines that the failure to do SO would place the residents of the territory subject to the\ndevelopment agreement, or the residents of the local government, or both, in a condition dangerous\nto\ntheir health or safety, or both.\nL.\nDevelopment Agreement Review Standards.

Principal Use Classification System\n12.3.1.\nPurpose\nThis Section is intended to provide a systematic framework for identifying, describing, categorizing,\nconsolidating, and distinguishing land uses in a way that makes it easier to determine whether a particular\nuse, activity, or combination of activities is allowable as a principal use in a particular zoning district in\naccordance with Section 3.2.4, \"Principal Use Table,\" or is subject to other use-specific provisions in this\nOrdinance. This Section is also intended to guide interpretations of how a particular unlisted use should be\ncategorized and to address future additions to the use tables.\n12.3.2.\nStructure of Principal Use Classification System\nThe principal use classification system described in this Section groups uses into three levels: use classifications,\nuse categories, and use types.\n1. Use Classifications. The use classifications identify broad general classifications of land use and include\nagriculture and animal-related uses, residential uses, institutional uses, commercial uses, and industrial\nuses. Use classifications are further broken down into a series of general \"use categories.\"\n2.\nUse Categories. The use categories describe the major sub-groups of the respective use classifications,\nand are based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type and\namount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and\nsite conditions. For example, the Residential Uses Classification is divided into the Household Living and\nGroup Living use categories. Each use category is described in terms of the common characteristics of\nincluded uses (including common or typical accessory uses), examples of common use types included\nin the category, and, for a number of use categories, exceptions-i.e., those uses that might appear to\nfall within the use category, but are included in another use category.\n3. Use Types. The specific use types included in each use category identify specific principal uses that are\nconsidered to possess the characteristics identified for the use category. For example, single-family\ndetached dwellings, duplex dwellings, single-family attached dwellings, multifamily dwellings, and\nmanufactured home dwellings are use types in the Household Living use category.\nSection 12.4. Agricultural and Animal Related Use Classification\nThe following rules shall apply for construing or interpreting the terms and provisions of this Ordinance.\n261\n"}, {"page": "262", "text": "Chapter 12. Interpretation and Definitions\n12.4.1.\nAgricultural Use Category\nThe Agriculture use category is characterized by activities related to the production of field crops, fruits,\nvegetables, ornamental and flowering plants, and the breeding, raising, or keeping of livestock, poultry, swine,\nor other animals for food or other marketable products.

A dwelling unit with support and supervisory\npersonnel that provides room and board, personal care and habilitation services in a family environment for\nnot more than six resident persons with physical, emotional, or mental disabilities is treated as any other\nhousehold living use, and not as a group living use. This use category does not include residential use types\nthat generally involve some level of managed personal care for a larger number of residents (e.g.,\ncongregate living facilities), which are categorized as group living uses. It also does not include use types\nwhere persons generally occupy living units for periods of less than 30 days (e.g., hotel/motel), which are\ncategorized in the Lodging use category. Accessory uses common to household living uses include\nrecreational activities, raising of domestic pets, hobbies, swimming pools, and parking of the occupants'\nvehicles.

Interpretation of Unlisted Uses\n12.9.1.\nProcedure for Interpreting Unlisted Uses\nThe Planning Director shall interpret whether a particular principal use or accessory use or structure not\nexpressly listed in Chapter 3, \"Use Standards,\" is allowed in a particular zoning district-as a permitted principal\nuse, a special use, or a permitted accessory use or structure-based on the standards in Subsection B or C\nbelow, as appropriate.\n12.9.2.\nCriteria for Allowing Unlisted Principal Uses\nThe Planning Director shall interpret an unlisted principal use as an allowed permitted use or a Special Use in\na particular zoning district only after finding that the nature, function, and duration of the use and the impact\nof allowing it in the zoning district are SO similar to those of a use type or use category that is allowed in the\nzoning district that the unlisted use should be deemed allowed in the same manner (i.e., as a permitted use\nor a special use) as the similar use type or use category and subject to the same use-specific standards. In\nmaking such interpretation, the Planning Director shall consider the relevant characteristics of the unlisted use\nrelevant to the those of listed and defined use types and/or of the use categories described in this Section,\nthe purpose and intent statements in this Ordinance concerning the zoning district (Chapter 2, \"Zoning\nDistricts\"), and the character of use types allowable in the district. The relevant characteristics of the unlisted\nuse that should be considered in making this interpretation include, but are not limited to, the following:\n1. Actual or projected characteristics of each activity likely to occur at the unlisted use;\n2. The type, size, orientation, and nature of buildings, and structures devoted to each activity;\n3. The number and density of employees and customers per unit area of site in relation to business hours\nand employment shifts;\n4.\nVehicles used and their parking requirements, including the ratio of the number of spaces required per\nunit area or activity;\n5. Transportation demands, including the volume and frequency of trips generated to and from the site,\nthe split of traffic volume among various means of transportation, and other characteristics of trips and\ntraffic;\n6. Relative amounts of sales from each activity;\n7. The nature and location of storage and outdoor display of merchandise, whether enclosed, open,\ninside or outside the principal building, and the predominant types of items stored;\n8. Customer type for each activity;\n9. How each use is advertised, including signage;\n10. The amount and nature of any nuisances generated on the premises, including but not limited to\nnoise, smoke, odor, glare, vibration, radiation, and fumes;\n11. Any special public utility requirements for serving the proposed use type, including but not limited to\nwater supply, wastewater output, pre-treatment of wastes and emissions required or recommended,\nand any significant power structures and communications towers or facilities; and\n12. The impact on adjacent lands created by the proposed use type, which should not be greater than\nthat of other use types allowed in the zoning district.\n12.9.3. Standards for Allowing Unlisted Accessory Uses and Structures\nThe Planning Director shall interpret an unlisted use or structure as an allowable accessory use or structure\nto a principal use allowed in a particular zoning district only after finding that:\n266\n"}, {"page": "267", "text": "Chapter 12.

Lot Width\nLot width shall be determined by measuring the\ndistance along a line delineating the minimum front\nMin. rear setback\nsetback applicable to the lot, between its intersections\nwith the side lot lines, or for corner lots, between a\ncorner side lot line and the opposite side lot line. (Refer\nto Section 12.10.1, Figure \"Lot Dimensions.\")\nLot Dimensions.\n12.10.3. Net Density (Dwelling Units Per Acre)\nA. All Net density (expressed as dwelling units per acre) shall be determined by dividing the total number of\ndwelling units located or proposed on a lot by the net lot area (refer to Section 12.10.1 above). If net lot\narea is measured in square feet, that result shall be multiplied by 43,560.
