A copy of the Official Zoning Map shall be\nlocated in the office of the UDO Administrator.\nSECTION 2.2 - INTERPRETATION OF ZONING MAP\nWhere uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the zoning districts shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall be used to interpret the\nmaps:\nA. Where a map shows a boundary line located within a street or alley right-of-way, railroad or utility line right-of-way, easement, or navigable or non-\nnavigable waterway, it shall be considered to be in the center of the right-of-way, easement, or waterway. If the actual location of such right-of-way,\neasement, or waterway varies slightly from the location as shown on a map, then the actual location shall control. If such a street or alley right-of-way,\nrailroad right-of-way, or utility easement forming the boundary between two (2) separate zoning districts is abandoned or removed from dedication, the\ndistrict boundaries shall be construed as following the centerline of the abandoned or vacated road bed or utility easement.\nB. Where a map shows a boundary line as being located a specific distance from a street line or other physical feature, that distance shall control.\nC. Where a map shows a district boundary to approximately coincide with a property line or city, town, or county border, the property line or city, town, or\ncounty border shall be considered to be the district boundary, unless otherwise indicated.\nD. Where a map shows a district boundary not coincide or approximately coincide with any street, alley, railroad, waterway, or property line, and no\ndimensions are shown, the location of the boundary shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the map.\nE. In instances when a zoning case file contains detailed information regarding the boundary, that information will be used as the correct boundary location.\nF. If it is alleged by any party that an error exists on the zoning maps with respect to any zoning district designation, zoning district boundary, special use\npermit or conditional district boundary, historical district boundary, the lines showing the effective dates of zoning enactment or any other matter with\nrespect to the provisions of this Ordinance relating to zoning information, the party may request a review of the alleged error by the Board of Adjustment.\nG. Reserved.\nH. Whenever a single lot is located within two (2) or more different zoning districts. Each portion of that lot shall be subject to the regulations applicable to\nthe district in which it is located.\nSECTION 2.3 - FRACTIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND DISTANCE MEASUREMENTS\nA. Whenever any requirement of this Ordinance results in a fraction of a unit, a fraction of a half or more will be rounded up to the next whole unit and a\nfraction of less than a half will be disregarded. Whenever a density calculation for a lot of record existing prior to January 21, 1997 results in less than one\ndwelling unit being permitted, the fractional requirement will be disregarded and one dwelling unit will be permitted.\nB.\nDistance separations for various uses are required for many uses in this Ordinance. Unless otherwise specified, the following rules shall apply in\ndetermining such measurements.\n1. Measurements shall be made from lot line to lot line (rather than from the edge of a building footprint).\n2. Measurements shall be made using the shortest straight-line distance (i.e., \"as the crow flies\") between lots.\nSECTION 2.4 - TEXT CONTROLS OVER GRAPHICS\nThis Ordinance contains numerous graphics, pictures, illustrations and drawings. However, in case of conflict between the text and a graphic, picture,\nillustration or drawing or any other depiction, the text shall control.\nSECTION 2.5 - CONFLICTING PROVISIONS\nA.

Normal structural repair and maintenance may be performed to allow the continuation of the nonconforming use.\nC.\nA nonconforming single- or two-family dwelling may be physically expanded (through additions or expansions of the principal or accessory structures) so\nlong as the addition or expansion does not increase the number of dwelling units and so long as the front, side and rear yard requirements of the\nunderlying zoning district, or the RS-8 district, whichever is more restrictive, are met. If any of these yard requirements cannot be met, the expansion may\nonly occur through the issuance of a Special Exception by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with all applicable provisions of Section 5.12.\nNotwithstanding, such Special Exception may only be issued by the Board of Adjustment for an expansion of an existing nonconforming structure if that\nexpansion does not extend any closer to a property line than the existing structure and the expansion into a required yard setback does not more than\ndouble the area of encroachment already existing within that required yard setback.

Normal repair and maintenance may be performed to allow the continuation of nonconforming structures.\nB. An existing nonconforming structure may not be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity except in conformance with a Special\nException permit issued by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with all applicable provisions of Section 5.12 of this Ordinance. One such provision is\nthat a Special Exception may only be issued by the Board of Adjustment for an expansion of an existing nonconforming structure if that expansion does\nnot extend any closer to a property line than the existing structure and the expansion into a required yard setback does not more than double the\namount of encroachment already existing within that required yard setback. Refer to Figure 3.3.4-1 for an example of how this is to be interpreted.\nC.\nIf such nonconforming structure is damaged, it may be rebuilt only after the issuance of a permit from the Administrator. Application for such permit shall\nbe made within one year of destruction. In the issuance of said permit the Administrator shall follow these standards:\n1. If the foundation for the replacement structure is moved or removed, the structure shall be rebuilt in as conforming a manner as possible. If the\noriginal foundation is used, the structure may be rebuilt at that same location on the lot.\n2. A nonconforming structure shall not be rebuilt in a manner that increases its nonconformity.\n3. A structure rebuilt in accordance with this subsection shall not have a gross floor area larger than the structure it replaced unless all setback and\nrelated requirements (e.g., landscaping, parking, etc.) are met for the zoning district in which it is located.\n4.

Except as herein\nprovided, an expansion of an existing use which is deficient in screening and/or landscaping or a change in principal use cannot occur without the required\nscreening and/or landscaping having first been provided on site. The requirements for providing such screening and/or landscaping may be waived or\nmodified by the Administrator under any of the following situations:\nA. Screening requirements shall be waived when the new principal use is a permitted use (i.e., use by right) in the same zoning district as the former\nprincipal use. Notwithstanding, if the new principal use is established within one year of the property in question being rezoned to a more restrictive\ngeneral district or conditional district, said screening requirements shall not be waived.\nB. Screening requirements may be waived on a one-time basis for any principal use (or for a shopping center, office park, or other multi-tenant\ndevelopment), where building expansion of up to ten (10) percent (or up to five (5) percent if adjacent to a residential zoning district) occurs.\n3.3.9 - NONCONFORMING OFF-STREET PARKING AND/OR LOADING\nA.

Conduct of Public Hearing.\n1. Once the Planning Commission public hearing has been conducted, the Planning Commission shall have up to forty-five (45) days to render a decision\non the conditional use application from the date their public hearing was concluded. Any such decision shall require the approval of at least three-\nfourths (3/4) of the members of the Planning Commission present and not excluded from voting at the meeting at which the decision is made. If a\ndecision on the application is made by a vote of less than three-fourths of such Planning Commission membership, or if any person appeals the action\nof the Planning Commission through written notice to the City Manager within fifteen (15) days of the Planning Commission's decision, the application\nshall be forwarded to the City Council for a new public hearing and a final decision.

If any person submits competent, material, and substantial evidence allegedly contrary to any of the facts or conditions listed in\nSubitems (1) and (3) below, the burden of proof for overcoming such evidence shall rest with the applicant.\nThe Planning Commission or City Council shall only issue a conditional use permit if it has evaluated an application and found each of the following\nfindings in the affirmative:\n1.\nThe use will not materially endanger the public health or safety if located where proposed and developed according to plan;\n2. The use meets all required conditions and specifications;\n3. The use will not substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property unless the use is a public necessity; and\n4. The location and character of the use, if developed according to the plan as submitted and approved, will be in harmony with the area in which it is to\nbe located and will be in general conformity with the adopted Land Use Plan and other plans for the physical development of the City as adopted by\nthe governing board.\nC. Additional Review Criteria/Findings of Fact.\nIn addition to the findings of fact listed in Section 5.11.5(B), certain uses require the consideration of additional review criteria. Before a conditional use\npermit may be issued for said uses, the findings of fact listed in Section 5.11.5(B) along with those pertaining to that individual use must each be found in\nthe affirmative.\nD. Effect of Approval.\nIf an application for a conditional use permit is approved, the owner of the property shall have the ability to (i) develop the use in accordance with the\nstipulations contained in the conditional use permit or (ii) develop any other use listed as a \"permitted use\" for the general zoning district in which it is\nlocated. Any uses that would otherwise require the issuance of a conditional use permit under this Chapter, may be approved as part of the\nestablishment of a parallel conditional district, without the issuance of a conditional use permit, so long as the use(s) meets all other applicable standards\nof this Ordinance. In these instances, the property may be used only for the development as approved for the conditional zoning district. Such approval,\nhowever, does not immediately authorize development activity, as the property owner will need to file for and secure a zoning permit, in accordance with\nSection 5.5, in order to proceed with development. The Administrator shall ensure that any development plans submitted with such zoning permit\nrequest are consistent with the terms and conditions of the conditional use permit approved for such property or for any other use by right allowed in the\nunderlying zoning district.\nE. Binding Effect.\nAny conditional use permit herein authorized shall be perpetually binding to the property included in such permit unless subsequently changed or\namended by the Planning Commission or City Council. All conditions contained in the conditional use permit shall run with the land and shall be binding\non the original applicants, their heirs, successors, and assigns, unless subsequently changed or amended as provided for herein. However, the\nAdministrator may approve minor changes in the detail of the approved application. A \"minor change\" to the approved conditional use permit shall be\ndeemed to be a change which:\n1. Will not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property;\n2. Will not increase the gross floor area of any nonresidential use by the smaller of ten (10) percent or ten thousand (10,000) square feet (Note: Such\nlimitations shall be cumulative and shall be based on the gross floor area of the conditional use permit as originally approved);\n3.\nWill not decrease the off-street parking ratio below the minimum number of parking spaces required by this Ordinance or reduce the yards provided\nat the periphery of the site, by the lesser of ten (10) feet or ten (10) percent of the current existing yard measurement;\n4. Will not increase the height of any structure to the extent that additional usable floor space could be added; or\n5. Will not result in an increase in the number of dwelling units constructed;\n6. Will not alter the uses permitted.\nFurther changes to the development may be made only by the Planning Commission or City Council in accordance with Section 5.11.2 through 5.11.5 of\nthis Ordinance.\nNo certificate of occupancy for a use listed as a conditional use shall be issued for any building or land use on a piece of property which has received a\nconditional use permit for such particular use unless the building is constructed or used, or the land is developed or used, in conformity with the\nconditional use permit. In the event that only a segment of a proposed development has been approved, the certificate of occupancy shall be issued only\nfor that portion of the development constructed or used as approved.\nF.

There has been a significant change in the zoning district classification of an adjacent piece of property; or\n2. The governing board has adopted a plan that changes public policy regarding how the property affected by the proposed conditional use should be\ndeveloped; or\n3. Construction or expansion of a road, water line, sewer line, or other such facilities has occurred to serve the property and can accommodate\ncomfortably the intensity of development allowed under the proposed classification; or\n4.\nThere has been some other extraordinary change in conditions or circumstances, outside the control of the petitioner, which justifies waiver of the 12-\nmonth restriction on a new petition; this, however, shall not include a change in the ownership of the subject property.\n5.11.7 PETITION WITHDRAWAL\nA. An applicant who has submitted a complete application for a conditional use permit may withdraw the application prior to a final decision being rendered.\nB. If said petition is withdrawn at least two (2) working days prior to the Planning Commission public hearing, a similar petition submitted by that property\nowner (or his agent) shall not be accepted by the Administrator within one hundred (180) days of the date of withdrawal.\nC. This waiting period shall not apply to any application withdrawn within ten (10) working days after the monthly application deadline as established by the\nAdministrator. (Note: The purpose of this is to allow petitions to be withdrawn without penalty prior to the posting of any public hearing notices or\nsubmittal of such notice to the newspaper of general circulation.)\nD. If said petition is otherwise withdrawn prior to a final decision being rendered, a similar petition submitted by that property owner/or his agent shall not\nbe accepted by the Administrator within one year of the date of withdrawal.\n5.11.8 - CHANGE IN CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT\nAny request to materially change (i.e., undergo a change other than one listed as a \"minor change\" in Section 5.11.5(E)) to the conditional use permit once it\nhas been issued shall require the issuance of a new conditional use permit.

The proposed use will have a less harmful effect on adjacent properties than the existing use; and\n3. The change in use will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Ordinance and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or\notherwise be detrimental to the public welfare.\nC.

Family Care Homes to be Within One-Quarter (1/4) Mile of Each Other (Per Section 8.1.6).\n1. Such reduced separation will not result in further clustering of family care homes that could promote the cloistering and isolation of handicapped\npersons instead of the integration and interaction of handicapped persons with the community mainstream.\n2.

This process is not intended so that variances can be granted so as to merely remove inconveniences or\nfinancial burdens that the requirements of this Ordinance may otherwise impose on property owners. Rather, it is intended to provide relief where the\nrequirements of this Ordinance create unnecessary hardship because of some unique physical attribute of the property itself or some other factor unique\nto the property for which the variance is being requested. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as, hardships resulting from conditions\nthat are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance.

In considering an application for a variance, the Board of Adjustment shall review the application, the approval criteria set forth in Section 5.14.5 and all\ntestimony and evidence received at the public hearing. The Board shall give due consideration to the following:\n1. The citing of other nonconforming or conforming uses of land or structures in the same or other districts, shall not be considered grounds for the\ngranting of a variance.\n2. The request for a variance for a particular use expressly, or by inference, prohibited in the district involved, shall not be granted.\nB. After conclusion of the public hearing, the Board of Adjustment shall have the following options:\n1. Approve the application for a variance as requested; or\n2. Approve the application for a variance with fair and reasonable conditions attached that the Board of Adjustment feels are necessary to satisfy one or\nmore of the findings contained in Section 5.14.5; or\n3. Deny the variance application.\nC.\nUnless otherwise authorized by the Board of Adjustment and included in its decision to grant a variance, any order of the Board of Adjustment in granting\na variance shall expire, if a building permit, or certificate of occupancy (for a use for which a building permit is not required), has not been obtained within\ntwelve (12) months from the date of the Board of Adjustment's decision.\nD. A variance cannot be granted unless each finding set forth in Section 5.14.5 is found in the affirmative by a four-fifths (4/5) majority of the Board. Insofar as\npractical, a motion to make an affirmative finding on each of the findings contained in Section 5.14.5 shall be accompanied by one or more reasons, based\non evidence heard at the public hearing, supporting such motion.\nE. No variance shall be granted if the conditions or circumstances affecting the applicant's property are of so general or recurrent a nature so as to make\nreasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation in the UDO for such condition or standard.\nF. If a variance is granted, it shall represent the least deviation from the regulations of this Ordinance that will afford relief.\nG. The Board of Adjustment, in granting a variance, may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Ordinance. Violation of\nsuch conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which a variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation and shall be punishable as\nprescribed in Section 15.6 of this Ordinance.\n(Ord. No. 13-628, \u00a7 13, 11-19-13)\n5.14.5 - VARIANCE APPROVAL CRITERIA\nThe Board of Adjustment may grant a variance only having first held a public hearing on the matter and having found that each of the following findings\nexist:\nA.\nUnnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the Ordinance. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the\nvariance, no reasonable use could be made of the property;\nB. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal\ncircumstances, as well as, hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for\ngranting a variance;\nC. The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that\ncircumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship;\nD. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose and intent of the Ordinance, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is\nachieved;\nE. Additional findings of fact for properties located in the FH district are found in Section 7.6.1.\n(Ord.

Petition Withdrawal.\nAn applicant who has submitted a complete application for a zoning map amendment may withdraw that application prior to a final decision being\nrendered. Such withdrawal may be made under the following guidelines:\n1. If said petition is withdrawn at least two (2) working days prior to the (Planning Commission) public hearing, a similar application shall not be accepted\nby the Administrator within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date of withdrawal.\nThis waiting period shall not apply to any application withdrawn within ten (10) working days after the monthly application deadline established by the\nAdministrator. (NOTE: The purpose of this is to allow petition to be withdrawn without penalty prior to the cancellation or posting of any public\nhearing notices.)\n2. Otherwise, if said petition is withdrawn less than two (2) working days prior to a final decision being rendered, a similar application shall not be\naccepted by the Administrator within one year of the date of withdrawal.\n3. Notwithstanding the above, the Planning Commission may allow a similar application to be submitted prior to the expiration of said time periods\nhaving first determined:\na. There has been a significant change in the zoning district classification of an adjacent piece of property; or\nb. The governing board has adopted a plan that changes public policy regarding how the property affected by the proposed change would be\ndeveloped; or\nC. Construction or expansion of a road, water line, sewer line, or other such facility has occurred to serve the property and can comfortably\naccommodate the proposed zoning classification; or\nd. There has been some other extraordinary change in conditions or circumstances, outside the control of the petitioner, which justifies the waiver of\nsaid time restrictions. This, however, shall not include a change in property ownership; or\ne. The proposed zoning map amendment is substantially different from that which was previously proposed and, if such amendment were approved,\nwould effect a change substantially different than that contained in the previous application.\n5. Notwithstanding the above, any amendment petition initiated by the Planning Commission or governing board shall be exempt from any time\nrestraints on resubmittal.\nG. Petition Resubmittal.\nIf the Planning Commission of City Council has denied an application for the rezoning of a parcel of land to a general zoning district, a similar application\nshall not be accepted by the Administrator for a period of one year following the date of such denial. Notwithstanding, the Administrator may accept such\nsubmittal within said one-year period if he makes any one of the findings listed in Section 5.16.3(F)(3) of this Ordinance.\n5.16.4 - ZONING MAP AMENDMENT-CONDITIONAL DISTRICTS (CD)\nA. Purpose.\n1. The conditional rezoning process allows particular uses to be established, but only in accordance with a specific development project. Some land uses\nare of such a nature or scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediate surrounding area and/or on the entire community which\ncannot be predetermined and controlled by general district standards or the criteria governing planned developments. There are also circumstances\nin which a general district designation allowing such a use by right would not be appropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could,\nif properly planned, be appropriate for the property and be consistent with the objectives of these regulations, the adopted land use plan, and other\nplans for the physical development of the city as adopted by the City Council. The review process established herein provides for the accommodation\nof such uses by a reclassification of property into a \"parallel conditional\" district.\n2.\nThe \"parallel conditional\" district (CD) approval process is established to address those situations when a particular use may be acceptable but the\ngeneral zoning districts which would allow that use would not be acceptable. Such zones may be approved or changed only by the Planning\nCommission or City Council in accordance with the regulations contained herein.\n3. Any use permitted under this process also must conform to the development regulations for the corresponding general zoning district.\nRezoning of property to any parallel conditional district is a voluntary procedure on the part of the property owner.\nUnlike requests for rezoning to a general zoning district, applications for CD zoning may be filed only by the owner of the property in question or the\nowner's authorized agent.\nProvisions for seeking conditional use approval without an associated request for CD zoning are contained in Section 5.11 of this Ordinance.\nB. Application.\n1.\nabout:blank\n85/294\n"}, {"page": "86", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nPetitioning for a CD zoning district is a voluntary procedure and can be initiated only by the owner(s) of the property(ies) in question or by his/her authorized agent.\nNo CD zoning district may be established until an application has been submitted and the Planning Commission or City Council has approved such application. The\nAdministrator shall schedule a meeting with the applicant, prior to any public information meeting (PIM) being advertised and/or held to review the rezoning\napplication.\n2. Furthermore, no application shall be considered complete unless it is accompanied by all items required by this section and a fee, in accordance with\na fee schedule approved by the governing board for the submittal of an application for rezoning to a CD district. Said fee shall be waived for any\napplication submitted by any official or agency acting on behalf of the City of Gastonia, Gaston County or the State of North Carolina.\n3. The Administrator may require the petitioner to submit more than one copy of the rezoning application in order to have enough copies available to\ncirculate to other government agencies for review and comment. When dealing with the conditional zoning district process, it may be desirable to\nrequest additional information in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding area. Therefore, the Planning Commission\nor City Council may request additional information as they deem necessary.\n4. A sign notifying the public of the development shall be posted in conjunction with the initial application. The sign shall be a maximum of four (4) feet\nby four (4) feet in accordance with the Temporary Sign Ordinance. The applicant will utilize a sign template approved by the City, and shall be\nresponsible for the cost of production and installation. Final design of the sign shall be reviewed and approved by the planning department prior to\ninstallation. The number and location of signs shall be determined by the planning department based on the street frontages of the development.\nC. Public Involvement Meeting.\nBefore a public hearing may be held on a petition for a parallel conditional zoning district, the petitioner must file with the planning department a written\nreport of at least one community meeting held by the petitioner. The community meeting shall be held prior to the public hearing before the Planning\nCommission. Written notice of such a meeting shall be given to the property owners and organizations entitled to notice as provided by Section 5.16.3(C).\nThe report shall include among other things, a listing of those persons and organizations contacted about the meeting and the manner and date of\ncontact, the date, time and location of the meeting, and a description of any changes to the rezoning petition made by petitioner as a result of the\nmeeting. In the event the petitioner has not held at least one meeting pursuant to this subsection, the petitioner shall file a report documenting efforts\nthat were made to arrange such a meeting and stating the reasons such a meeting was not held. The adequacy of a meeting held or report filed pursuant\nto this section shall be considered by the Planning Commission and/or the City Council but shall not be subject to judicial review.\nD. Submittal to Zoning Administrator.\nBefore any property is rezoned to a CD district, a public hearing first must be held by the Planning Commission or City Council. Properties located in a HD\nhistoric overlay district first must be reviewed by the Gastonia Historic District Commission in accordance with Section 7.6.2. Upon submission of a\ncompleted application, the applicant will be informed of the dates of the Planning Commission (and potential City Council) public hearings. The Planning\nCommission public hearing shall be held first and shall take place no sooner than five (5) weeks after the complete application has been submitted to the\nzoning administrator. Notification of the public hearings shall be made as provided by Section 5.16.3(C).\nE. Planning Commission Review.\nOnce the Planning Commission public hearing has been concluded, the Planning Commission shall have up to forty-five (45) days to render a decision on\nthe parallel conditional rezoning. Any decision on a parallel conditional district rezoning shall be accompanied by a statement describing whether the\naction is consistent with an adopted comprehensive plan and any other officially adopted plan that is applicable and explaining why the Planning\nCommission considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the public interest. Any such decision shall require the approval of at least three-fourths\n(3/4) of the members of the Planning Commission present and not excluded from voting at the meeting at which the decision is made. If a decision on the\napplication is made by a vote of less than three-fourths (3/4) of such Planning Commission membership, or if any person appeals the action of the Planning\nCommission through written notice to the City Manager within fifteen (15) days of the Planning Commission's decision, the application shall be forwarded\nto the City Council for a new public hearing and a final decision.\nF. City Council Action.\nAny public hearing held by the City Council pertaining to the zoning of a property to a CD district must be conducted within sixty (60) days of the date\nof\nappeal. The City Council may open and continue this hearing and take action at a later date. The City Council will be apprised of the Planning\nCommission's previous actions on the matter at hand. Any decision on a parallel conditional district rezoning shall be accompanied by a statement\ndescribing whether the action is consistent with an adopted comprehensive plan and any other officially adopted plan that is applicable and explaining\nwhy the City Council considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the public interest.\nG. Conditions to Approval of Petition.\nThe decision to rezone property to a CD district shall be legislative in nature. In approving a petition for the reclassification of a piece of property to a CD\ndistrict, the Planning Commission or City Council may require that reasonable and appropriate conditions be attached to approval of the petition. Such\nconditions shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the development and use of the site to City Ordinances and an officially adopted\ncomprehensive or other plan and those that address the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site. The\npetitioner will have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any additional requirements prior to approval or denial by the governing board.\nIn no instance shall any of these conditions be less restrictive than any requirements that would otherwise pertain to that particular development if it\nwere located in a general or parallel conditional use zoning district. Such conditions may exceed any performance criteria or minimum requirements\nabout:blank\n86/294\n"}, {"page": "87", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nlisted elsewhere in this Ordinance that pertain to that development. Statements that (1) analyze whether the rezoning is consistent with an adopted\ncomprehensive plan and any other officially adopted plan, and (2) other matters that the City deems appropriate and (3) why it considers the action taken\nto be reasonable and in the public interest shall be prepared and accompany each final decision relative to the CD rezoning request.\nH. Effect of Approval; Zoning Map Designation.\nIf a petition for a CD district is approved, the district that is established and all conditions which may have been attached to the approval are binding on\nthe property as an amendment to the zoning map. Subsequent development on the property in question shall be in accordance to the standards for the\napproved CD district, the site plan, and any conditions attached to the approval. The applicant shall be responsible for all expenses involved in the\ndedication of rights-of-way when such dedication is a condition of the rezoning. Following the approval of the petition for a CD district, the subject\nproperty shall be identified on the Zoning Map by the appropriate district designation. If a use requiring a conditional use permit is included in the\napproval of the conditional district, and said conditional use was clearly indicated within the conditions and/or on the approved site plan, and meets all\nother applicable standards of this Ordinance, no additional hearing is required for the conditional use permit.\nI. Binding Effect.\nThe Administrator may approve minor changes in the detail of the approved application. A \"minor change\" to the approved conditional use permit shall\nbe deemed to be a change which:\n1. Will not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development to adjacent property;\n2. Will not increase the gross floor area of any nonresidential use by the smaller of ten (10) percent or ten thousand (10,000) square feet (Note: Such\nlimitations shall be cumulative and shall be based on the gross floor area of the conditional use permit as originally approved);\n3. Will not decrease the off-street parking ratio below the minimum number of parking spaces required by this Ordinance or reduce the yards provided\nat the periphery of the site, by the lesser of ten (10) feet or ten (10) percent of the current existing yard measurement;\n4. Will not increase the height of any structure to the extent that additional usable floor space could be added; or\n5. Will not result in an increase in the number of dwelling units constructed;\n6. Will not alter the uses permitted.\nFurther changes to the development may be made only by the Planning Commission or City Council in accordance with this Ordinance.\nNo certificate of occupancy for a use listed in a conditional district shall be issued for any building or land use on a piece of property unless the building is\nconstructed or used, or the land is developed or used, in conformity with the conditions approved. In the event that only a segment of a proposed\ndevelopment has been approved, the certificate of occupancy shall be issued only for that portion of the development constructed or used as approved.\nJ. Change in CD Zoning.\nOnce a petition for rezoning to a CD district has been approved by the Planning Commission or City Council, any request to materially change (i.e., any\nchange other than a \"minor change\" as defined in Section 6.4 the parallel conditional district shall be considered a new zoning change request. All\nprocedures pertinent to new CD requests as outlined in this Chapter shall be followed.\nK. Petition Resubmission.\nIf a request for CD zoning is denied, a similar application for the same property or any portion thereof shall not be filed until the expiration of a 12-month\nperiod from the date of denial. This waiting period shall not be applicable where the application for a conditional use permit is determined by the\nAdministrator to be substantially different from (i.e., not similar to) the original application.\nNotwithstanding, the Administrator may allow resubmission of a similar application within said 12-month period if it determines that since the date of\naction on the prior petition:\n1. There has been a significant change in the zoning district classification of an adjacent piece of property; or\n2.\nThe governing board has adopted a plan that changes public policy regarding how the property affected by the proposed conditional use should be\ndeveloped; or\n3. Construction or expansion of a road, water line, sewer line, or other such facilities has occurred to serve the property and can accommodate\ncomfortably the intensity of development allowed under the proposed classification; or\n4. There has been some other extraordinary change in conditions or circumstances, outside the control of the petitioner, which justifies waiver of the 12-\nmonth restriction on a new petition; this, however, shall not include a change in the ownership of the subject property.\nL. Petition Withdrawal.\nAn applicant who has submitted a complete application for a CD rezoning may withdraw the application prior to a final decision being rendered.\n1. If said petition is withdrawn at least two (2) working days prior to the Planning Commission public hearing, a similar petition submitted by that\nproperty owner (or his agent) shall not be accepted by the Administrator within one hundred (180) days of the date of withdrawal.\nabout:blank\n87/294\n"}, {"page": "88", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nThis waiting period shall not apply to any application withdrawn within ten (10) working days after the monthly application deadline as established by\nthe Administrator.

A Transportation Impact Analysis (\"TIA\") is a specialized study that evaluates the effects of the traffic generated by any development or redevelopment on\nthe surrounding transportation infrastructure. The TIA helps identify where a development or redevelopment may have a significant impact on public\nsafety, traffic and transportation operations and provides a means for the mitigation of those impacts. The TIA may be used to evaluate whether the scale\nof a development is appropriate for a particular site and what improvements may be necessary in order to provide safe and efficient access and traffic\nflow.\nB. The Planning Director or his/her designee shall determine the need for a TIA upon the receipt of an application for the approval or modification of any site\nplan, building permit, zoning certificate of compliance, certificate of occupancy, temporary use permit, conditional use permit, major/minor subdivision or\nunified development.\nC. The thresholds for determining the need for a TIA, the technical requirements for an acceptable TIA, the procedures for providing an acceptable TIA or the\navailability of alternatives to a full TIA, the responsibility for payment of the costs thereof along with the mitigation that might be required pursuant to the\nTIA shall be set forth in The City of Gastonia Transportation Impact Analysis Policy Manual adopted by, and as modified from time to time by, the City of\nGastonia City Council.\n(Ord.

Former 5.18 pertained\nto protest petition to the Zoning Map change, and derived from the Unified Development Ordinance adopted October 20, 2009.\nChapter 6 ZONING DISTRICTS\nSECTION 6.1 - ZONING DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED\nA. In order to achieve the purposes established for this Ordinance as indicated in Section 6.2, and to further the goals and objectives stated in any plans for\nthe future development of the City of Gastonia as adopted by the governing board, a number of zoning districts are hereby created. Districts are divided\ninto the following categories:\n1. General zoning districts.\n2. Overlay districts.\n3. Conditional districts.\nB. Each general zoning district category serves a different function. A number of \"residential,\" \"commercial,\" \"office\" and \"industrial\" zoning districts have\nbeen created. Most allow for a variety of land use types and categories; certain districts allow for the mixing of land use types is encouraged. All of the\ngeographic area to which this Ordinance applies shall be divided into one of the various general zoning districts.\nC. Overlay districts are created to address issues of particular concern in the community that overlay one or more of the general zoning districts. These\nregulations supplement those that are found in the underlying general zoning district. Any proposed use located within an overlay district would have to\nmeet the requirements of the underlying general zoning district along with the requirements of the overlay district.\nD. Conditional districts are designed to, upon request of the underlying property owner(s) or authorized agent(s) to allow particular uses to be created under\na set of guidelines in accordance with a specific development project approved by the Planning Commission or governing board. Conditional zoning\ninvolves the creation of a completely new zoning district designed to serve the needs of a particular development. No conditional use permit is involved,\nnor are there any quasi-judicial procedures. The owner of the property in question, or his authorized agent, are the only persons who can request a\nconditional district rezoning.\nSECTION 6.2 - GENERAL ZONING DISTRICTS\n6.2.1 - RURAL RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS\nThe RLD, \"Residential Low Density\" district may be located both within and beyond the Urban Standards Overlay District. The district, which contains the\nlargest standard minimum lot size (eighty-seven thousand (87,000) square feet), is used in two (2) ways: to accommodate residential uses in the most rural\nportions of the City's jurisdiction; or, to protect areas from large-scale residential development where industrial or intense commercial development is\ncalled for on the land development plan in the future, but where specific development plans do not currently exist.\n6.2.2 URBAN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS\nabout:blank\n89/294\n"}, {"page": "90", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nFour (4) urban residential districts are hereby created: RS-20, RS-12, RS-8 and RMF. The RS-20, RS-12 and RS-8 districts are primarily geared towards single-\nfamily residential development with standard minimum lot sizes ranging from twenty thousand (20,000) square feet in the RS-20 zone to eight thousand\n(8,000) square feet in the RS-8 zone. The RMF district is geared towards multi-family residential development.\nThese districts will most likely be found in the Urban Standards Overlay District and are served by public utilities. Higher densities than those normally\nallowed and a variety of different residential types may be accommodated in all zones through planned residential developments (PRD's), infill residential\ndevelopments, and traditional neighborhood developments (TND's) and/or through the satisfaction of certain of certain performance design and\nconstruction criteria.\n6.2.3 OFFICE DISTRICTS\nA. Four (4) office and low-impact commercial zoning districts are hereby created: Transitional Mixed Use (TMU), Office/Light Commercial (OLC), Office (O-1)\nand the Medical Office (OM) districts.\nB. The TMU district encourages office and mixed office and residential uses at an intensity to compliment nearby residential land uses. Such areas are most\noften found in developed, urban portions of the County within the Urban Standards Overlay District. Many such areas, especially those found along major\ncorridors, were originally developed for residential areas. But due to their location, the blending of office uses and higher density residential development\nhas taken place. The TMU district is designed to encourage such mixed development to continue.\nC. The OLC district also allows for and is designed to accommodate mixed office, retail and residential development. Such higher intensity development will\nmost likely occur within the Urban Standards Overlay District where public utilities are present and where access to major thoroughfares and/or transit is\nfound. Development in OLC areas will most likely be at a higher intensity level than in the TMU district.\nD. The O-1 district accommodates larger-scale office developments along with complimentary commercial service establishments.\nE. The OM district is designed to accommodate medically oriented uses that lie in close proximity to Gaston Memorial Hospital or other existing or planned\ncommunity medical facilities in the County. In order to serve the general public better, complementary uses (doctors' offices, medical supply shops,\npharmacies, etc.) are encouraged to locate near these medical facilities. Uses that are non-medically related are generally excluded for this zoning district\nso as to not compete for space that could otherwise be developed for medically related uses. Given the relative small amount of land suitable for such\nzoning, uses which predominate in other zoning districts (e.g., residences, non-medically related retail uses) are not allowed in the O-M district.\n6.2.4 - COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS\nA. Five (5) commercial districts are hereby created: Central Business District (CBD), Urban Mixed Use (UMU), Light Commercial (C-1), Highway Commercial (C-\n2), and General Commercial (C-3).\nB. The CBD is designed to accommodate the uses found in a central city location and to encourage high intensity, compact, urban development in a\npedestrian-oriented setting. Retail, office, personal service, and institutional uses normally found in a central business district are allowed. In order to\nencourage more efficient building usage and to take advantage of the area's centralized location, second-story residential uses are permitted, as are high-\ndensity residential developments. Signage requirements shall be specifically tailored for a downtown setting.\nC. The UMU district is generally located in the periphery of central business districts and is designed to allow for the redevelopment of older commercial\ndistricts in a pedestrian-friendly manner. An UMU zoned area may not represent the true downtown business core of a community, but contains\ndevelopment features (e.g., limited or no front yard setbacks, limited amounts of off-street parking) that often pre-date the implementation of land use\nregulations. Redevelopment of such areas, for both commercial and residential purposes, is encouraged.\nD. The C-1 Light Commercial District is designed to accommodate a large variety of retail uses designed to meet the needs of individual neighborhoods, or\nother relatively small geographic areas. Stores and shopping complexes are therefore relatively small in size and are designed to be compatible and\nintegrated with adjoining residential neighborhoods. This zoning district is not intended to accommodate retail uses which attract persons from outside\nthe neighborhood or which attract large numbers of passing motorists.\nE. The C-2 Highway Commercial District is primarily intended to accommodate those retail service and distributive uses that are typically located along or\nadjacent to principal or minor arterials and which require high visibility, good road access, and which cater primarily to passing motorists. Development in\nthis district is designed to promote aesthetics and the safe and efficient movement of traffic so as to not unduly burden adjacent thoroughfares. As larger\nand/or more intensive developments normally will create more significant impacts on adjoining neighborhoods and road and utility infrastructures, larger\ndevelopments may be allowed in this zoning district. Most C-2 zoning districts will be located within the Urban Standards Overlay District.\nF. The C-3 District is intended to accommodate the broadest array of commercial uses of all the commercial zoning districts, some of which are not allowed\nin any of the other commercial zoning districts. Like the C-2 district, the C-3 district is intended to accommodate the community's larger and most intense\ncommercial developments (outside of the central business district) and be located within the Urban Standards Overlay District.\n6.2.5 - INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS\nA. Four (4) industrial districts, light industrial (I-1), general industrial (I-2) exclusive industrial (I-3), and Urban Industrial (IU) are hereby created.\nB.\nabout:blank\n90/294\n"}, {"page": "91", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nThe I-1 district is established to provide for areas that contain a mix of light manufacturing uses, office park and service uses in an attractive setting with proper\nscreening and buffering. I-1 districts should include areas that continue the orderly development and concentration of light industrial uses. Any areas rezoned\nto\nthe I-1 district subsequent to the adoption of this Ordinance should be located so as to have direct access to or lie within close proximity of a principal or minor\narterial.\nC. The I-2 district is established to provide for areas of heavier manufacturing and industrial uses that are properly sited, based on such factors as: adjacent\nland uses, access to the transportation network, and the availability of public services and facilities. It is the intent of this district to provide an\nenvironment for industries that is unencumbered by nearby residential or commercial development. I-2 zoned districts shall be located in areas where\nconflicts with other uses can be minimized to promote orderly transitions and buffers between uses. The I-2 district is established in order to provide sites\nfor activities that involve major transportation terminals, and manufacturing facilities that have a greater impact on the surrounding area than industries\nfound in the I-1 district. I-2 districts shall generally not be located adjacent to any property that is zoned for residential use, except when mitigating factors\n(i.e., terrain, buffering, transportation access) are in place to substantively mitigate any potential negative impacts upon such residential areas caused by\nuses in the I-2 district. Any areas that are rezoned to an I-2 district subsequent to the adoption of this Ordinance shall be located so as to have direct\naccess to or lie in close proximity of a principal or minor arterial.\nD.\nThe I-3 district is established to provide areas for the most intensive heavy manufacturing and industrial uses that may have impacts such as excess noise,\nenvironmental concerns and extended hours of operation. Uses in this district are extremely limited and include extractive and mining uses, petroleum\nrefining and slaughterhouses. I-3 districts shall not be located adjacent to any property that is zoned for residential use. Any areas that are rezoned to an\nI-3 district subsequent to the adoption of this Ordinance shall be located so as to have direct access to or lie in close proximity of a principal or minor\narterial.\nE. The I-U urban industrial district is normally found in older portions of the community that were developed prior to the advent of zoning regulations and\nwhich contain older industrial and warehouse-type uses. Such uses oftentimes do not conform to the parking, bulk, or setback requirements that would\nbe applicable if those structures were developed today. The purpose of this district is to accommodate such existing uses and to encourage the\nredevelopment of such uses for industrial, commercial and/or residential purposes.\n6.2.6 OTHER DISTRICTS\nA. The PD planned district is established to allow various types of planned developments, including Revised Residential Development District, Planned Unit\nDevelopments (PUD), and Traditional Neighborhood Developments (TND). The planned district is a shell in which the planned developments are housed.\nIn some districts, the PD has no setback or lot arrangements associated with the zone, however, each planned development type dictates the particulars\nof the development. A PD planned district shall be established only for the planned developments noted above.\nB. The AP airport district is established in order to ensure that uses within airports are developed in a manner harmonious with each other and to motorists\ntraveling on roads in the vicinity of such airports. To this extent, regulations are established governing such criteria as setbacks and construction\nmaterials.\n1. Uses allowed. Uses allowed within the AP district shall be limited to airports and facilities normally incidental to an airport operation including, but not\nlimited to, passenger terminals, terminal restaurants and lounges, runways, control tower facilities, automobile rental facilities, air freight operations,\nairplane hangars, maintenance facilities, airport-related offices, National Weather Service operations, parking facilities, fire and emergency service\nfacilities, Air National Guard facilities, airplane rental operations, flight service station facilities, and flight training operations.\n2. Minimum lot size. Airports-Fifty (50) acres.\n3. Minimum front, side, and rear yards. The minimum front, side, and or rear yard for any structure shall be fifty (50) feet from the edge of any public\nroad right-of-way.\n4. Maximum building height (except as provided in Sections 7.8 and 9.15 of this Ordinance). All uses-None, except that all structures are subject to\napplicable height limitations and regulations as promulgated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other appropriate agencies in order to\nprevent hazards to the lives and property of the users of the airport and the occupants of land in its vicinity. Such regulations shall supersede any\nheight regulations otherwise called for in this Ordinance.\n5. Screening. Where buildings and structures other than terminals and control/radar instruments and landing towers are located between the\nrunway/taxiway and any public street, a level 2 screen shall be provided. All required trees shall be less than twenty (20) feet in height at maturity.\nC. The SP state park district is established to allow for parks (along with their customary accessory uses) which are owned and operated by the state and for\nthe conservation of public lands for recreation, conservation, and open space purposes. Within any SP district, parks owned and operated by the state\n(i.e., state parks) shall be uses by right irrespective of any other laws or regulations of the city. Uses normally found within such parks include (but are not\nlimited to) museums with indoor and outdoor displays, campgrounds (primitive and developed), overnight accommodations, snack bars and restaurants,\ninformation centers, park ranger facilities (including park ranger residences), and amphitheaters.\n1. Uses allowed. Uses allowed within the SP district include parks owned and operated by the state. Accessory uses within such parks include (but are\nnot limited to) amphitheaters, primitive and developed campgrounds, overnight indoor lodging facilities, restaurants and snack bars, museums with\nindoor and outdoor displays, visitor centers, park ranger centers and residences, and park-related outdoor recreation facilities.\n2. Minimum lot size. Parks-Five (5) acres.\n3.\nabout:blank\n91/294\n"}, {"page": "92", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nMinimum front, side, and rear yards.

No. 19-690, \u00a7 1, 8-20-19)\nSECTION 6.3 OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS\nOverlay districts are established to provide for certain additional requirements and/or uses for properties located in one or more general zoning districts.\nThus, in addition to the requirements of the underlying general zoning district, the provisions of the overlay district would also prevail in the areas so\nzoned. The initial zoning of areas to an overlay district and/or any subsequent rezonings may be initiated by an individual, the Planning Commission, or City\nCouncil. A zoning map change either establishing or changing any overlay district shall be subject to the same procedures and requirements as any other\nzoning map change. In certain areas, two (2) or more overlay districts may apply. In any such instance where there are conflicting provisions, the more\nstringent requirements shall apply.\nSee Chapter 7 for the overlay zoning district regulations.\n6.3.1 FH FLOOD HAZARD OVERLAY DISTRICT\nIt is the purpose of this zoning district to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood\nconditions within floodprone areas by provisions designed to:\nA. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in\nerosion, flood heights or velocities;\nB. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;\nC. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;\nD. Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and\nE. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\nF. Specific objectives of this zoning district are:\n1. To protect human life and health;\n2. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;\n3.\nTo minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding that are at the expense of the general public;\n4. To minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions;\n5. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities (i.e., water and gas mains, electric, telephone, cable and sewer lines, streets, and bridges) that are\nlocated in floodprone areas;\n6. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas; and\n7. To ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area.\n6.3.2 HD HISTORIC DISTRICT OVERLAY\nThe purpose of the historic overlay district is to help maintain the integrity and heritage of older areas of the City contain distinctive historically,\narchitecturally, or archaeologically significant features. In order to protect such characteristics from any adverse effects caused by incompatible\ndevelopment and to contribute to the improvement of the general health and welfare of the City, these regulations are hereby enacted. One or more\nseparate historic overlay districts may be created in various parts of the City and its planning jurisdiction.\nThe following historic overlay districts are hereby created:\nA. York-Chester Historic District.\nB. Brookwood Historic District.\n6.3.3 SV SCENIC VIEW OVERLAY DISTRICT\nThe purpose of the SV District is to protect the scenic views from within the Daniel Stowe Botanical Garden. Gaston County hereby finds that the Daniel\nStowe Botanical Garden has become a major asset to economic development, tourism, recreation, and natural resource conservation for Gaston County\nand the surrounding region. In order to preserve and enhance the natural scenery fostered by the Botanical Garden and enjoyed by visitors to the Garden,\nGaston County finds it necessary to control the height of structures within the view from the Garden. Gaston County also finds that the erection of tall\nstructures in areas within view of the Botanical Garden can result in the degradation of its natural scenic views and thus reduce its attraction as a natural\nscenic area and a retreat from urban development.\nabout:blank\n92/294\n"}, {"page": "93", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\n6.3.4 TH THOROUGHFARE HIGHWAY OVERLAY DISTRICT\nThe TH district has been created to insure that development that takes place along designated thoroughfares be well planned. At some point in the future,\nwidening or construction of these roads will take place. In order to minimize any negative impacts to adjoining property owners occurring as a result of\nsuch widening projects, the TH district has been created to require that all new structures lying on properties along these roads be adequately set back\nfrom existing and/or projected road rights-of-way. In this manner, all structures built per the TH district requirements will be adequately set back from the\nroad when it is widened.\n6.3.5 USO URBAN STANDARDS OVERLAY DISTRICT\nAreas of the County that are located (1) within existing municipal corporate limits or (2) outside their corporate limits but where the provision of public\nwater and sewer services can reasonably be expected to occur over the next ten (10) to fifteen (15) years, have been designated as the \"Urban Standards\nOverlay District\". Accordingly, standards for development, more akin to those that traditionally are found in urban areas, as opposed to rural areas, are\ncalled for. Standards address such issues including, but not limited to, building design, off-street parking, road, lot and subdivision standards.\n6.3.6 GC GATEWAY CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT\nThe purpose of the GC Gateway Corridor Overlay District is to preserve and enhance the streetscape along important highway corridors and to promote the\norderly development of land and safe and efficient movement of traffic. The Gastonia City Council finds that it is desirable to implement basic design\nstandards and use limitations along important gateways in Gastonia. The City Council further finds that the aesthetic quality and orderly development of\nthe City's important interchanges creates lasting impressions of the community by visitors and helps to promote a quality community image, thus helping\nto further the continued growth, economic development and quality of life in the City.\n6.3.7 - CENTER CITY DESIGN OVERLAY\nThe purpose of the Center City Design overlay district is to help maintain the integrity of neighborhoods in and around the Center City that contain\ndistinctive historical, architectural, or archaeologically significant features. In order to protect such characteristics from any adverse effects caused by\nincompatible development and to contribute to the improvement of the general health and welfare of the City, these regulations are hereby enacted. One\nor more separate overlay districts may be created in the Center City to accomplish this goal.\nThe following historic overlay districts are hereby created:\nA. Oakland Area Center City Design District.\nSECTION 6.4 - CONDITIONAL ZONING (CD) DISTRICTS\nThe Conditional Zoning (CD) District process allows for the establishment of certain uses that, because of their nature or scale, have particular impacts on\nboth the immediate area and the community as a whole. The development of these uses cannot be predetermined or controlled by general district\nstandards. In order to accommodate these uses, this Section establishes the conditional zoning district process. The process for approval of a CD Zoning\nDistrict is explained in Section 5.16.4. The rezoning of any parcel of land to a CD district shall be a voluntary process initiated by the property owner or his\nauthorized agent. Any area rezoned to a CD district shall be in strict compliance with the goals, objectives and implementation strategies of the Gastonia\nComprehensive Plan and all other plans and regulations officially adopted by the Gastonia City Council. The review process established in this Section\nprovides for the accommodation of such uses by a reclassification of property into a CD district, subject to specific conditions (which may exceed those that\nwould otherwise be required for the use in question), which ensure compatibility of the use with the enjoyment of neighboring properties and in\naccordance with the general plans of development of the City. A conditional zoning district is not intended for securing early zoning for a proposal.\n(Ord. No. 11-586, 3, 1-18-11)\nChapter 7 USE AND BUILDING LOT STANDARDS\nSECTION 7.1 TABLE OF USES\nUses designated as \"permitted uses\" are allowed in a zone as a matter of right and are designated with an \"X\" in Table 7.1-1. Uses designated with a \"C\" in\nTable 7.1-1 are \"conditional uses\" are allowed only after a conditional use permit has been issued per Section 5.11. Uses designated with an \"E\" are existing\nuses that are subject to certain limitations on expansions. If an \"S\" follows either the \"X,\" \"C\" or \"E\" in Table 7.1-1 it means that that use is subject to\nadditional performance criteria specific to that use. The location of those performance criteria for that use is shown in Table 7.1-1.\nSECTION 7.2 USES NOT EXPRESSLY LISTED OR ADDRESSED\nabout:blank\n93/294\n"}, {"page": "94", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nNo building or structure, sign or land shall hereafter be used, erected or occupied and no building or structure shall be erected, expanded or moved except\nin conformity with the regulations of this Ordinance. Table 7.1-1 shows the principal uses that are allowed in each zoning district. Temporary uses are\ndiscussed in Section 5.8; accessory uses, customary home occupations, and private residential quarters are discussed in Chapter 9.\nCertain uses predating the adoption of this Ordinance are allowed to remain as nonconforming uses in accordance with Section 3.3 of this Ordinance.\nUnless a use is allowed as a \"permitted,\" \"conditional,\" \"nonconforming use,\" \"temporary use,\" or otherwise specifically address in this Ordinance, then\nsuch use shall be expressly prohibited in that zoning district. The Board of Adjustment shall have no authority to grant a variance or special exception to\nallow for such prohibited use.\nSECTION 7.3 - BULK AND DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS\nBulk and dimensional standards for all uses in all general zoning districts are shown in Table 7.3-1. Such dimensional standards shall prevail unless specific\nstandards for individual uses are found elsewhere in this Ordinance.\nSECTION 7.4 - LOCATION OF REQUIRED YARDS ON CORNER AND IRREGULAR LOTS\nIf a lot is abutted on three (3) sides by streets, the front yard (for setback purposes) shall be designated by the property owner. Notwithstanding, the front\nand rear yards, and subsequent placement of structures on said lot, to the greatest degree possible, shall be in keeping with the architectural fronts and\nrears of other pre-existing structures situated on that block.\nThe location of required front yard setbacks and side and rear yards on other irregularly shaped lots shall be determined by the Administrator based on the\nspirit and intent of this Ordinance to achieve an appropriate spacing and location of buildings and structures on individual lots.\n(Ord. No. 14-632, \u00a7 5, 8-19-14)\nSECTION 7.5 - PRE-EXISTING LOTS OF RECORD\nA. In any zone in which residences are permitted, where a lot has an area or width of less than the required area or width, and said lot was a lot of record at\nthe time of the adoption of this Ordinance, including any revision or amendment thereto, said lot may be occupied by a single-family dwelling, provided\nthat the minimum yard and bulk requirements for the zone in which it is located are met.\nB. In any nonresidential zoning district, a residential structure which existed on or before the date of adoption of this Ordinance, may be converted to a\npermitted nonresidential use (or a mixed-use dwelling), so long as all applicable building code requirements, off-street parking and landscaping, and\nscreening requirements are met. If such use is a conditional use, the Planning Commission or City Council may attach fair and reasonable conditions\nwhich would serve to mitigate any existing nonconforming situations arising from such conversion.\nTable 7.1-1\nTable of Uses\nabout:blank\n94/294\nCELL (1, 1): \nX\nCELL (1, 2): \nPermitted by right\nCELL (2, 1): \nXS\nCELL (2, 2): \nPermitted by right with supplemental

Flood Hazard (FH) Overlay District.\nThe Legislature of the State of North Carolina has in G.S. ch. 143, art. 21, pt. 6; G.S. ch. 160A, art. 19, pts. 3, 5, and 8; and G.S. ch. 160A, art. 8, delegated to\nlocal governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.\n1. Causes of flood loss. The flood hazard areas within the zoning jurisdiction of the City of Gastonia, North Carolina are subject to periodic inundation\nwhich results in loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for\nflood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. These flood\nlosses are caused by:\na. The cumulative effect of obstruction in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and\nb. The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, or hazardous to other lands, which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or\notherwise unprotected flood damages.\n2. Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private\nlosses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to:\na. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in\nerosion, flood heights or velocities;\nb. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial\nconstruction;\nC. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of\nfloodwaters;\nd. Control filling, grading, dredging, and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and\ne. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.\n3. Declaration of legislative objectives. The objectives of this overlay zoning district are:\na. To protect human life, safety, and health;\nb. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly control projects;\nC. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;\nd. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;\ne. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges\nlocated in floodplains;\nf. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future\nflood blight areas; and\ng. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.\n4. Definitions. The following definitions shall be applicable to the FH overlay district only. Definitions of other terms are found in Section 2.7. For\npurposes of the FH district only, wherever a conflict exists between a definition of a word herein described and one found in Section 2.7, the\ndefinitions listed herein shall apply.\n1.

Purpose. The purpose of the Central Business District (CBD) design standards is to ensure that development which takes place in the Central Business\nDistrict is executed with appropriate urban design, site planning and architectural principles and techniques. A goal of these standards is to promote a\nstable, attractive, economically viable, pedestrian-scaled environment in the downtown area of Gastonia. The City Council finds that the downtown area\nand its immediate environs is very important to the economic and social well-being of the city, and further desires to provide protections to property\nowners who invest in the downtown area from the negative impacts of development that is inharmonious with the unique environment of the historic\ndowntown. To accomplish the goals stated herein, architectural standards, site layout, building materials, and sign standards are specified to insure high\nquality design. Where there is conflict with other portions of the ordinance in terms of allowed uses, yard and height requirements, parking and\nlandscaping standards, etc., the requirements herein prevail, whether more or less restrictive.\nB.\nDesign Review Required. Unless otherwise provided in this Ordinance, no exterior portion of any building or other structure (including but not limited to\nmasonry walls, fences, light fixtures, satellite dish signal transmission equipment, steps and pavement, or other appurtenant features) nor aboveground\nutility structures within the CBD shall be erected, altered or moved until an Application for Design Review (Application) has been submitted to and\napproved by a Design Review Committee (DRC) to review and approve such applications. The DRC shall be a committee comprised of City staff, appointed\nby the City Manager.\nApplication approval is required prior to the issuance of a building permit or other permit granted for the purposes of constructing, altering, moving or\ndemolishing structures, which approval may be issued subject to reasonable conditions necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. An approved\napplication shall be required whether or not a building permit is required, but said approval does not obviate the necessity of procuring a building permit\nor such other permit as may be required by law; provided, however, any building permit or other permit issued other than in conformity with this Chapter\nshall be invalid.\n1.\nabout:blank\n139/294\n"}, {"page": "140", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nSubmission of application. An application for design review shall be complete and include all information as described in this section. Applications must be signed\nby the owner of the subject property or his agent. Such application must be accompanied by sketches, drawings, photographs, specifications, descriptions, etc. of\nthe proposed project sufficient to inform the DRC of the nature and extent of the application. An application shall not be deemed complete until all the required\ninformation shall have been submitted. Nothing shall prevent the applicant from filing with the application additional relevant information bearing on the\napplication. Properly completed applications shall be filed with the Planning Department who shall forward such applications to the DRC. The DRC will complete the\nreview process and issue its decision with thirty (30) days of submittal.\n2. Appeal of decision. An appeal of any decision of the DRC may be taken to the Board of Adjustment. Any appeal from the decision of the Board of\nAdjustment in any such case shall be heard by the Superior Court of Gaston County in accordance with this Ordinance.\n3. Compliance required. Compliance with the terms of the DRC's written decision shall be enforced by the zoning administrator or his designee. Failure\nto comply shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance. Design review approval shall remain in effect until its terms and conditions are completed;\nprovided, discontinuance of work or the lack of progress toward achieving compliance with the approval for a period of six (6) months shall be\ndeemed a failure to comply with the approved application.\nC. Architectural Standards and Design Criteria. The DRC shall review the application for compliance with the design standards established herein (Section\n7.11).\nD. Central Business District Design Review Area DRC recommendation on Conditional Use Applications. When a site plan is required to be submitted with a\nconditional use application regarding property in the CBD, the site plan shall be reviewed by the DRC prior to presentation to the Planning Commission\nand City Council. This review shall be limited to exterior features, as set forth in the applicable standards as set forth herein. The DRC may make\nrecommendations regarding the exterior features of the site and shall forward such comments within thirty (30) days of the filing of the complete\nconditional use application. The comments shall be presented to the Planning Commission and City Council.\nE.\nLand Use Considerations. All uses listed in Section 7.1-1 for the CBD are retained, with the following exceptions.\n1. Restaurant, fast food. Permitted in the district provided that no drive-through service shall be allowed except in instances where properties have\nfrontage on at least two (2) major thoroughfares as designated in the most recently adopted version of the thoroughfare plan of the Gaston Urban\nArea. In those instances where drive-thru service is permitted, the vehicle stacking area for the drive-thru service area shall not be subject to the\nminimum standards established elsewhere in this Ordinance. Any fast food that includes a drive-thru shall also include outdoor dining areas and on-\nsite bike racks. The DRC, as part of its review of a proposed fast food with a drive-thru, may require certain additional site improvements and\narchitectural standards be met in addition to ordinance minimums. These include, but are not limited to: alternate paving treatments for pedestrian\nand vehicular traffic areas, roof extensions to cover drive-thru service windows, and menu board dimensional and material specifications including\nlighting. In addition, no high intensity colors (such as yellow, red, orange, etc.) metallic colors, or fluorescent colors shall be allowed on any building or\narchitectural element. The use of such colors shall be permitted on business identification signs, provided all other sign requirements herein are\nadhered to. Furthermore, the use of \"franchise architecture\" shall not be allowed. For purposes of this section franchise architecture shall be defined\nas a distinct architectural building style and/or elements commonly employed by a fast food franchise that serves to enhance or promote brand\nidentity through visual recognition. This type of architecture has been shown to contribute to the dilution of a unique community identity. Finally, any\nchildren's play area provided by the restaurant may not be located in the front or side yard of any lot. As with all other new and renovated sites and\nbuildings within the CBD, these uses shall be subject to review by the DRC and must meet all site and design standards established for the CBD.\n2. Dwelling units. While residential use above the street level is encouraged, residential use at the street level is generally discouraged (whether it be\nconversion of existing nonresidential space or new construction), as residential at the street level in the core retail/arts/entertainment area does not\nprovide adequate street-level activity to contribute to pedestrian and urban vitality. However, for areas in the CBD outside the core\nretail/arts/entertainment area, street-level residential may be allowed subject to approval by the DRC. This allowance includes locations where existing\nstreet-level residential may be expanded and also the potential for ground-floor residential located internal to a block (no street frontage). Single-\nfamily and two-family detached residential dwelling units shall not be allowed anywhere in the district, regardless of size. Residential dwelling units\nmay be provided on the second or higher floor of any building containing commercial uses, non-profit organizations, or office-type uses on the ground\nfloor, provided each unit meets or exceeds all applicable fire safety and minimum housing and/or building codes.\na. When located internal to a block (not fronting a public street) and when more than one building is proposed, all buildings shall be oriented parallel\ntoward either a public street, or an interior courtyard. All buildings shall be separated from one another by at least sixteen (16) feet.\nb. Minimum driveway widths shall be twelve (12) feet for one-way drives, and twenty (20) feet for two-way drives.\n3. Bail bonding offices. Office uses within the CBD shall not include bail bonding offices.\nF.\nSign Consideration, Required. See Section 12.10, Signs permitted in the central business district.\nG. General Design Standards.\nUnless otherwise noted, these requirements shall apply to all new and renovated buildings within the CBD constructed after the date of passage of these\nstandards. All modifications or changes to the design or materials of existing buildings shall be in conformance with the standards herein. These building\ndesign standards do not mandate a particular style and permit a wide variety of architectural expressions. However, when a design exhibits a known\narchitectural style (i.e. Colonial, Victorian, Classical Revival) the details shall be consistent with that style.\n1. Proportion: A buildings' mass and scale shall be visually compatible with the buildings, structures and places to which it is related.\na.\nabout:blank\n140/294\n"}, {"page": "141", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nSmaller scale buildings and the use of traditionally sized building components help to establish human scale and maintain the character of downtown. Standard\nsize brick, uniform building components, and standard window sizes are most appropriate.\nb. Floor-to-floor heights should appear to be similar to those seen traditionally. In particular, the windows in a building should appear similar in\nheight to those seen traditionally.\nC. Design of buildings should clearly define a base, middle and top.\nd. Buildings should be divided into \"modules\" that are similar in scale to buildings seen traditionally. If a larger building is divided into \"modules,\"\nthey should be expressed three-dimensionally throughout the entire building facade.\ne. Building wall offsets, including projections and recesses add architectural interest and variety; relieve the visual effect of a single, long wall; and\nsubdivide the wall into human size proportions.\n2. Openings: The relationship of the placement, dimensions and characteristics of the windows and doors in the building shall be visually compatible\nwith buildings, structures and places to which it is related.\na. Buildings shall be required to maintain a functional public entrance on one or more public streets with a public sidewalk. A public or private\nparking lot shall not be construed to be a public street for purposes of this section.\nb.\nThe rhythm of recessed entrances on the street contributes to visual continuity and historic character. Recessed entries identify the entrance and\nprovide shelter, while corner entries on buildings located on the intersections of key streets draw pedestrians inside.\nC. Entryways shall have a strong design that is consistent with the architecture of the rest of the building. Elements of strong entryway design include\ncanopies, lawnings, porticos, arcades, raised cornice parapets over the door, peaked roof forms, arches or other architectural details such as tile\nwork and mouldings that are integrated into the building structure and design.\nd. Entry doors along public streets should be constructed of and framed with wood, or finished metal. Such doors should have glass panes to allow\nlight and visibility. Unfinished metal frames should be avoided. Metal security doors are acceptable for entrances not readily visible from a street\nor public activity area.\ne.\nFor new and existing buildings, no openings on any portion of a wall oriented toward a public street shall be covered or blocked with any material\nso as to render the opening functionally obsolete. Furthermore, no security bars, or panels, whether retractable or permanent, shall be\nconstructed, erected, or utilized on the exterior portion of any building wall oriented toward a public street.\nf. All windows should be framed with wood, or finished metal. Windows with true-divided panes are encouraged, however, if snap-in mullions are\nused, they should be attached to the outside of the glass in order to provide a shadow line. Internal mullions and vinyl-clad windows should be\navoided.\ng. Window openings should be framed with wood or brick sills, and an exposed header, head molding or lintel course of masonry.\n3. Patterns: The relationships of elements in a fa\u00e7ade of a building or structure shall be visually compatible with buildings, structures and places to which\nit is related.\na. Maintain the rhythm of facade widths, especially for projects that extend over several lots, by changing materials, patterns, reveals, building\nsetbacks, facade portions, or by using design elements such as columns or pilasters.\nb. Develop the first floor facade as primarily transparent, making it inviting to the public. Use windows and other architectural features to create a\npattern that will reinforce the traditional facade rhythm found on historic buildings in the downtown area. Upper floors generally are\ndifferentiated through the use of more solid areas than voids and with smaller, though still vertically oriented, windows in a regular pattern.\nC. Honor the alignment of architectural features with other buildings on the block. These lines unify the street visually. The alignment of architectural\nfeatures, from one building to the next, creates visual continuity and establishes a coherent visual context throughout the downtown and create\npatterns along the face of the block that contribute to the overall character of the area. Some facade elements that typically align with adjoining\nbuildings include:\nParapet and cornice line\nBuilding kickplate\nThe top and bottom height of first floor display windows\nTransom over the entranceway\nClerestory portion of display windows\nHorizontal and vertical proportions of the building\nStorefront and restaurant front windows\nWindow openings and styles, especially upper story windows\nSign band above the street level\nWindow sills on upper floors\nabout:blank\n141/294\n"}, {"page": "142", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nRoof lines and proportions\n4. Spacing: The relationship of a building to the open areas between it and the adjoining buildings shall be visually compatible with the buildings,\nstructures and places to which it is related.\na. Through-block connections can be used in large projects to promote pedestrian circulation throughout the downtown. Design such connections to\nbe interesting places, not merely hallways to parking lots or alley service loading areas. They shall be handicap accessible, well lighted,\nappropriately landscaped, and paved in materials compatible with their locations and surrounding context. Opportunities for artwork or other\nvisual innovations are encouraged.\nb. Locate sidewalk restaurants or outdoor dining areas on or adjacent to open spaces and pedestrian routes such as sidewalks and green areas.\nConnect shops or office entrances directly to places where people gather or walk. Where appropriate and allowable, the use of well designed and\nshielded rooftop decks for restaurants and access to views is encouraged.\nC. When possible, orient open spaces (plazas, courtyards, pocket parks, terraces, etc) to the sun and important views or vistas. Create a sense of\nenclosure while maintaining safety, so that open spaces feel like outdoor rooms.\n5. Presence: The projection, supports, height and relationship to streets and sidewalks, of awnings, canopies and balconies of a building shall be visually\ncompatible to the buildings, structures and places to which it is related.\na. Buildings or other design features that are built up to the sidewalk maintain a line of visual continuity and provide visual interest for pedestrians. If\na portion of the building fa\u00e7ade is set back from the sidewalk, the sidewalk edge shall be visually maintained through the use of a line of columns\nsupporting upper floors or other features, such as a change in surface texture, a line of planters, portals, or railings.\nb. Awnings should be designed to fit the storefront opening to emphasize the building's proportions. Awnings should not obscure or damage\nimportant architectural details. Align awnings with others on the block.\nC. Awnings should be canvass. Mansard style wood lawnings, awnings with roof shingles, and all metal awnings should be avoided, with the exception\nof copper- or bronze-clad awnings.\nd. Awnings, canopies and hanging signs shall be allowed to protrude a maximum of five (5) feet from the building face over a public sidewalk,\nprovided that the bottom edge of the awning or sign leaves at least eight (8) feet of vertical clearance from the sidewalk; and provided that the\nlawning or sign comes no closer than two (2) feet to the street pavement. Entryway canopies shall not be subject to the five-foot limit described\nherein; but all other rules shall apply.\n6. Materials, Textures and Colors: The materials, textures and colors of the fa\u00e7ade of a building shall be visually compatible with the predominant\nmaterials, textures and colors used in the buildings and structures to which they are related.\na.\nBrick has historically been the predominant building material used in the downtown, therefore, the use of brick as the primary building material is\nstrongly encouraged.\nb. Acceptable primary building materials include:\nBrick\nBrick veneer\nStone or simulated stone/marble\nOrnamental split-faced concrete block or similar ornamental concrete masonry unit (CMU)\nLightly textured stucco (synthetic or natural)\nC. Choose accent materials similar in texture and scale to others in the district. Appropriate accent materials include:\nBrick and stone masonry\nWood details such as windows\nFinished lumber, applied to achieve traditional patterns e.g.: horizontal siding rather than diagonal\nFinished painted metal\nClear or lightly tinted glass\nCeramic tiles\nBrick, clay and ceramic pavers\nSlate, finished metal, glazed ceramic and tile roofs\nConcrete and stone as lintels and wood or concrete columns\nEmbossed metal or corrugated metal\nCast or wrought iron\nQuoins are encouraged to frame building edges\nabout:blank\n142/294\n"}, {"page": "143", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nd. Materials specifically disallowed as primary siding materials include (but may not be limited to):\nVinyl siding\nUnfinished wood\nConcrete block (except split-faced block)\nHeavily textured stucco\nMetal siding, metal cladding, and/or metal architectural panels shall be prohibited within the district for use on the exterior of new or existing\nbuildings. Ornamental metal trim work (i.e., copper sheathing, brass, wrought iron, etc.) and/or architectural details shall be allowed provided\nthe cumulative area of such materials does not exceed fifteen (15) percent of the total square footage of the wall onto which it is affixed\ne. No high intensity colors (such as yellow, red, orange, etc.) metallic colors, or fluorescent colors shall be allowed on any building or architectural\nelement.\nf. In specific and exceptional circumstances (such as LEED standards), where the design review committee finds that the spirit and intent of the\nordinance are clearly met with the use of other materials, textures and colors than are listed herein, certain other alternate utilizations of these\nitems may be approved by the DRC.\n7.\nRoofs: The roof shape and materials of a building shall be visually compatible with the buildings and structures to which it is related.\na. The predominant roof form in downtown is a flat roof with a raised parapet and decorative cornice. This roof form is appropriate in nearly all\nareas of the CBD.\nb. The use of pitched roof is generally discouraged, except when the building is geographically isolated from nearby construction or when there is a\nstrong visual connection with an existing building or structure with a pitched roof.\nC. Roof materials should not be of the type that harshly reflects sunlight, causing glare.\n8. Historic Building Rehabilitation or Expansion: Projects involving the rehabilitation or expansion of downtown historic buildings should reflect the\noriginal architectural character of the building.\na. Introduction of new design elements should be consistent with the traditional features of the building.\nb. It is encouraged that all projects involving rehabilitation or expansion of historic buildings be consistent with the Secretary of Interior's Standards\nfor Rehabilitation to the greatest extent practicable.\nC.\nIt is not the intention of these design guidelines to recreate the past if an original building facade does not exist. However, if the original facade\ndoes not exist, but documentary evidence such as photographs of the original does exist, then one recommended alternative is to restore the\nfacade. Where exact reconstruction is not practical, new simplified contemporary interpretations of the original details are possible as long as the\nscale and character of the original detail is retained.\n9. Accessory Features: All dumpster enclosures, walkways, stairways, landings or other significant accessory features shall be visually compatible with\nbuildings and structures to which they are related.\na. Pedestrian routes in structures and lots shall be easily identifiable and accessed. Clear visual connections between a garage, or surface parking lot,\nand adjacent sidewalks and buildings are required. Interior and exterior lighting should be designed for safety as well as nighttime appearance.\nb. Elements such as trash collection areas shall be screened, designed as an integral part of the overall building design, and present an attractive\nfeature when viewed from adjacent areas.\nH. Site Considerations, Required.\n1.\nAt least forty (40) percent of the front facade length of any new building shall be set back not more than eight (8) feet from the front property line;\nhowever, in no case shall any building be sited closer than ten (10) feet to the back of existing curb. On corner lots, the wall fronting the side road and\nconsidered to be a \"side wall\" of the building may be set back not more than twelve (12) feet from the corner side property line.\n2. There is no parking requirement for residential uses in the CBD. Any parking voluntarily provided shall be placed in the side and rear yards.\n3. For buildings on corner lots, on-site parking may be provided only in the interior side yard or rear yard.\n4. Any off-street parking spaces provided in the CBD shall be a minimum of eight and one-half (8 1/2) feet in width and sixteen (16) feet in length.\n5. Any above-grade parking structures must have leasable retail or service space(s) on the ground floor, for the entire length of the facade abutting or\nwithin twenty (20) feet of any public street(s) except where ingress and egress drives are provided. The facade treatments for the leasable space(s)\nshall be subject to the same design requirements detailed herein.\n6.\nAll parking lots adjoining a public street shall be screened from the view of any public street in one of the following three (3) ways, or a combination of\nany:\na. With a wall constructed of masonry, ornamental split-face block, or concrete block covered with stucco or synthetic stucco, between three (3) and\nsix (6) feet in height. Any portion of such a wall above three (3) feet in height above grade shall be at least sixty (60) percent open. In addition there\nshall be masonry piers providing a visual break in the wall, and placed at increments of not less than one for each twelve (12) feet of wall length,\nabout:blank\n143/294\n"}, {"page": "144", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nand one on any corner of such a wall. Where there are driveway openings in the wall, the height shall be reduced to not more than three (3) feet for the first twelve\n(12) feet on either side of the driveway. Street trees otherwise required by this subsection (i) shall not be required under this provision.\nb. Masonry piers at intervals of between eight (8) and twelve (12) feet, supporting vertically oriented wrought-iron or aluminum fencing panels. The\nheight of this design shall be between four (4) and six (6) feet. Aluminum fencing panels shall have a medium or dark finish. Street trees otherwise\nrequired by this subsection (i) shall not be required under this provision.\nC. A masonry wall, ornamental split-face block wall, or concrete block wall covered with stucco or synthetic stucco, three (3) feet in height above\ngrade, and with a landscaped strip immediately behind the wall planted with street trees and shrubs.\n7.\nAll new fences in the CBD shall be constructed of brick, stone, stucco or other decorative masonry finish. Fences with columns constructed of brick,\nstone, stucco or other decorative masonry finish used in combination with wrought-iron (or brushed aluminum or anodized aluminum that mimic the\nstyle and appearance of wrought iron) pickets shall also be acceptable. For fences installed to meet the requirements for parking lot screening, the\nspecific standards set forth in Section 7.11(h)(5) shall apply.\nPicket fences (constructed with either wood or vinyl pickets) and vinyl-coated chain link fences are allowed subject to the following: (1) they do not\nexceed six (6) feet in height; (2) they are shielded from view from all adjoining streets, parking areas (including drive aisles) and activity areas such as\ncourtyards and pedestrian walkways; (3) they are not closer than seventy-five (75) feet to a public street right-of-way; (4) temporary chain link fencing\nfor construction or demolition is allowed with an active building or demolition permit. Temporary chain link fences may also be permitted by the\nZoning Administrator for up to six (6) months (and renewable up to two (2) times) when he deems it necessary to protect the public from unexpected\ntemporary structural dangers, such as building collapse.\nI. Approval of Alternate Designs. In order to allow for flexibility in the design of buildings and site construction and renovation, while at the same time\nsubstantially satisfying the purpose and intent of this section, the Design Review Committee may approve certain alternate designs which may not meet\nthe strict requirements of this section but clearly satisfy its purpose and intent. No request for alternate design shall be considered unless an application\nhas been filed with the Planning Department on forms provided by the department and accompanied by plans or drawings as may be specified on such\nforms. The Design Review Committee may approve such alternate design only upon making all of the following findings in the affirmative:\n1. The proposed design substantially meets the requirements of this section.\n2.\nThe proposed design is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this section and preserves its spirit.\n3. The public interest achieved by this section will be served at least equally by allowing the alternate design as opposed to not allowing such alternate\ndesign.\n4. The granting of the alternate design will not endanger the public health or safety if approved; and, that it will not substantially injure the value of\nadjoining properties or other properties within the downtown area.\n5. The applicant has submitted reasons justifying the need for the alternate design and that such need results from the strict application of this section.\nBuilding codes, or other law as opposed to reasons not resulting from the ordinance or law such as personal hardship, economic hardship, or\nviolation of this section.\nUpon making all such findings in the affirmative the director shall send notice that, unless an appeal to the Board of Adjustment is filed, the alternate\ndesign will take effect within fifteen (15) days of said notice. Said notice shall be sent, by hand delivery or first class mail, to all adjoining property owners,\nthe City Manager, and any other persons who have filed with the Planning Department, a request to be notified of any alternated designs approved under\nthis section. If the DRC fails to find all five (5) findings in the affirmative, the director shall send notice along with reason(s) for denial by hand-delivery or\ncertified mail to the applicant. The notice shall state that the applicant shall have up to thirty (30) days from the date the notice is received to file an\nappeal to the Board of Adjustment.\nThe Board of Adjustment shall conduct a public hearing on such appeal after having provided public notice in accordance with this Ordinance. The Board\nof Adjustment may grant the request for an alternate design only after having made all five (5) findings set forth in this section. The decision of the Board\nof Adjustment is appealable only to the Superior Court by writ of certiorari.\n(Ord. No. 11-586, \u00a7 4, 1-18-11; Ord.

For additional requirements specific to Attached Single Family R-4 and R-5 Districts see Section\n8.1.17.\n1. Site Grading, Streets, Alleys and Blocks Requirements:\na. Grading shall provide for smooth grade transitions in accordance with the most recent version of the \"Subdivision Grading Minimum Design\nStandards\" to avoid abrupt \"v\" ditches, swales and other disruptions to the landscape, particularly between buildings where open space\nenhancements for use by persons actively utilizing the landscape and/or yard area. The use of crawl space, skim walls, and raised slab\nconstruction techniques in attached residential structures and professional landscape design are required to meet this characteristic of site\ndevelopment to establish a Finished Floor Elevation (FFE) as measured from the top of curb of fronting street to the minimums established for\neach building type, See Table 1, in Section 8.1.11 and Tables 1 and 2 in Section 8.1.17.\nb. Primary pedestrian access into the building shall be from a street frontage line, sidewalk, or parking area. Primary Pedestrian entry for buildings\nfronting an open space may be located from the open space. For Townhomes facing onto a common open space, entrances to other units either\nadjacent, or opposite, shall also face the common open space. See Section 8.1.17.B.1(d) for Townhomes facing onto designated open space.\nC. Streets and alleys shall terminate with other streets and alleys within a development and shall connect, wherever practicable, to existing and\nprojected streets outside the development.\nd. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed five hundred (500) feet in length in the R-1, R-2, and R-3 Districts, must be accessed from a street providing internal or\nexternal connectivity, shall be permanently terminated by a vehicular turnaround, and are permitted only where topography makes a street\nconnection impracticable. In most instances, a \"close\" or \"eyebrow\" is preferred to a cul-de-sac. In R-4 Districts, cul-de-sacs in Detached Single-\nFamily developments shall not exceed five hundred (500) feet. In R-4 Districts, cul-de-sacs in Attached Single-Family developments shall not exceed\ntwo hundred fifty (250) feet.\ne. Cul-de-sacs shall have a minimum ten (10) foot wide pedestrian access easement connecting to the nearest public space, street right-of-way, or\ncommon open space, and have paved pedestrian connections, where practicable.\nf. The average perimeter of all blocks shall not exceed one thousand three hundred fifty (1,350) feet. See Section 8.1.17 for Townhome development.\ng. Water and Sewer utilities are encouraged to run along fronting streets, and \"dry\" utilities along rear lanes/alleys provided that a permanent access\nand utility easement is recorded for the full length of alley being used for utilities or public services such as garbage collection.\nh.\nabout:blank\n156/294\n"}, {"page": "157", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nStreets shall be organized according to a hierarchy based on function, size, capacity, and design speed; streets and rights-of-way are therefore expected to differ in\ndimension. The proposed hierarchy of streets shall be indicated on the submitted site plan. Each street type shall be separately detailed.\ni. To prevent speeding, continuous street segments greater than one thousand (1,000) feet in length shall employ traffic calming measures as\noutlined in the Gastonia Public Works Traffic Calming Toolkit.\nj. Consistent build-to lines shall be established along all streets and public space frontages; build-to lines determine the width and ratio of enclosure\nfor each public street or space. A minimum percentage build-out at the build-to line shall be established on the plan along all streets and public\nsquare frontages.\nk. Lots containing Townhomes parked within the front setback shall not face across a street onto Townhomes serviced by a rear lane/alley, unless an\nintervening open space a minimum of thirty-five (35) feet is provided on the rear lane/alley served block, along the entirety of the length that such\nfrontage occurs.\nI. Townhome developed property abutting Detached Single-Family uses shall provide a landscaped buffer, per Chapter 11.3 of the UDO, along the\nlength of the shared frontage, unless the Townhome units orient their front facades toward the Detached Housing. Such housing shall be served\nvia rear lane/alley to qualify.\n2. On Street Parking Requirements\na. Parking on Residential Streets\nParking shall be allowed along all residential streets except along rear lanes, designated bike lanes, within eight (8) feet of a driveway apron, within\nfifteen (15) linear feet of a fire hydrant, and areas specifically signed for no parking. In no case shall minimum off-street parking space(s), whether\nenclosed or not, extend into the public right of way, or into an easement, or a public sidewalk on private property.\nb. On Street Parking Requirements\nOn street parking at the lot front may be counted toward all or part of the parking requirement of a dwelling unit provided the standards in the\nabove paragraph are satisfied.\n3. Building Architecture Requirements:\na. Garage doors for parking located in a front setback shall be setback a min of twenty (20) feet from back of sidewalk of fronting street.\nb. Garage doors shall be designed to have a second story element extend at least one foot beyond the ground floor wall plane for the length of the\ngarage door.\nC. Garage door facades visible from a ROW shall harmonize with the architecture of the home as regards materials and colors and include at least\ntwo (2) of the following design elements: windows, glazed paneling, matching or complimentary hardware to home, decorative accents.\nd. Porches shall form a predominant motif of home designs and be located on the front or to the side of the dwelling. When attached to the front,\nthey shall extend over at least forty (40) percent of the front facade. All porches shall be constructed of materials in keeping with those of the main\nbuilding.\ne. Townhomes located at street corners or, located abutting a common open space a minimum of forty (40) feet in width, shall return a minimum of\ntwo (2) of the following architectural features so that the entirety of the side elevation has no more than twenty (20) feet of blank wall space: a bay\nwindow, windows, wrap around porch, or a prominent entry with direct access to the street, or open space on the side elevation,\nf. For Townhomes, individual unit variation may not be accomplished using step-backs for groupings of five (5) or less. Within groupings of five (5)\nindividual units variation shall be accomplished using a combination of the following architectural elements:\ni. Change in roofline no more than once per grouping\nii. Application of balconies, bay windows, porches a min of four (4) feet in width, or stoops.\ng. Maximum grouping of individual Townhome units in a single building shall be fifteen (15.) Minimum number shall be three (3.)\n4. Accessory Uses & Structures\na. Accessory uses and structures are permitted in conjunction with allowed principal uses. Allowed accessory uses and structures include those listed\nin this Chapter, and additional accessory uses and structures that, as interpreted by the Zoning Administrator, meet the following:\ni.

Lot coverage for each District is calculated by subtracting all required\nminimum setbacks from total lot area. Existing Buildings that have the minimum side and front setbacks permissible, shall construct additions into\nrear yard setbacks only. Maximum encroachment into a required rear yard setback shall not exceed seventy-five (75) percent.\nSTREETS\nStreets are integral components of municipal development. Streets impact levels of societal accessibility and equality, influence modes of transportation,\nand contribute to a community's environmental and economic adaptability. Street networks that encourage equitable growth, access, and support the\nenvironment have high levels of connectivity. All streets shall connect to help create a comprehensive network that enables the efficient movement of\nautomobiles, bicycles, and pedestrians. The dispersion of trips through a connected network is dependent upon providing numerous opportunities for\ningress, egress, and internal circulation within neighborhoods, districts, and corridors.\nStreets are also integral components of municipal character. Taken collectively streets constitute the largest percentage of land area and public realm in\nmost communities. Street networks that support urban character must have numerous street types within a hierarchy of context sensitive designs. Context\nsensitive designs must equally address a street's traffic capacity and urban character.\nAs an alternative to current N.C. Department of Transportation road standards, the following street standards are provided for non-state maintained\nstreets within the City of Gastonia and for streets proposed to be maintained by the City upon annexation. Streets built to the standards identified in this\nsection are eligible for consideration by the City Council for acceptance into City maintenance.\n1. Street and Associated Infrastructure Standards\nStreets in the City of Gastonia shall be:\nInterconnected.\nInterconnected within a development and with adjoining development. Cul-de-sacs shall be allowed only where topographical configurations offer no\npractical alternatives for future connections or through traffic. The location of streets as may be shown in all applicable plans and adopted area plans\nshall govern connectivity designs. Street stubs shall be provided within developments adjacent to open land to provide for future connections except\nwhere environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands, 303d listed streams, slopes greater than twelve (12) percent and conservation areas are\nvulnerable to harmful impacts by the extension of the street.\nPedestrian Scaled.\nBe designed as the most prevalent public space of the City and, thus, scaled to the pedestrian harmonious with bicycles and motor vehicles.\nBordered by Sidewalks.\nBe bordered by sidewalks with a minimum width of five (5) feet on both sides of the street, with the exception of rural roads, lanes, alleys, and the\nundeveloped edge of neighborhood parkways, and as may be shown in Street Sections as illustrated herein. Sidewalks may be located in the street right-\nof-way, on private or public property, or in common areas. All sidewalks not located within the public right-of-way shall have a public access easement\npermitting public use of the sidewalk.\nStreet Trees. Be lined with street trees located on both sides, with the exception of rural roads, lanes, alleys, and the undeveloped edge of neighborhood\nparkways. Street trees along streets shall be located in a planting strip as per herein.\nPublic Streets.\nAlleys will be classified as public or private depending on function, according to the street acceptance policy.\nOrientation of Buildings. Provide access to principal buildings. The principal building shall front on public streets as specified by the lot and building type\nstandards herein.\nStreet Lights. Be illuminated by street lights located on at least one side and at all intersections, with exception of rural roads, lanes, alleys, and the\nundeveloped edge of neighborhood parkways. Street lights along streets shall be located in a planting strip as per standards set forth herein. Maximum\nspacing of street light fixtures shall be forty (40) linear feet measured along the street centerline. Street light fixtures shall not produce direct light onto\nadjacent properties at a height above four (4) vertical feet at the building setback line of residential districts.\nabout:blank\n161/294\n"}, {"page": "162", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\n2. Intersections\nSegments of straight streets shall be interrupted by intersections designed to:\nReduce Speed. Disperse traffic flow and reduce speeds, thereby eliminating the creation of de facto collector streets with high speed, high volume traffic;\nand\nTerminate Vistas. Terminate vistas with a landmark such as a significant natural feature, a building, a park, or other public space.\nOther traffic calming measures such as neck-downs, chicanes, mid-block diverters, intersection diverters, curb bulbs, serial hill crests, and related devices\nmay be specified on a case by case basis, based on improving traffic safety and functional appropriateness in the proposed location.\n3. Blocks\nStreet blocks defined by public streets are the fundamental design elements of neighborhoods. The block pattern should continue to establish the\ndevelopment pattern at the project edge. Where a longer block will reduce the number of railroad grade crossings, major stream crossings, or where\nlonger blocks will result in an arrangement of street connections, lots and public space more consistent with this section, the Subdivision Administrator\nmay approve greater block lengths.\n4. Street Plan\nlayout of streets should provide structure to the neighborhoods. The formality of the street plan will vary depending upon site conditions and topography.\nUnique site conditions should be used to create special character and comply with the standards set forth herein. Alleys and Rear Lanes may be used to\nenhance and preserve open space by reducing the need for direct access of units/buildings onto a fronting public Street. To qualify, such open space shall\nbe fronted on all sides by a combination of public ROW and residential units. In such instances the minimum paved surface width of the rear lane/alley\nservicing the units shall be eighteen (18) feet, with a maximum length of six hundred (600) feet before intersecting with a Street.\n5. Street and Associated Infrastructure Design\nDesigns should permit comfortable use of the street by motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Pavement widths, design speeds, and the number of motor\ntravel lanes should be minimized to enhance safety for motorists and non-motorists alike. The specific design of any given street must consider the\nbuilding types as shown herein that have frontage and the relationship of the street to the overall street network. The following specifications apply to\nstreet design:\na. Alleys/rear lanes shall be provided in all new high-density residential developments where residential lots are less than twenty (20) feet in width, so as\nto increase on-street parking capacity at the curb, reduce pedestrian conflicts due to sidewalk incursions, minimize impacts of utility easement\nrequirements along fronting streets, and disperse service/delivery vehicle congestion.\nb. Garages and accessory dwelling units accessed from an alley/rear lane shall display addresses that are clearly visible from the alley/lane.\nC. Streets, alleys/rear lanes, and pedestrian ways shall be interconnected so that access throughout a development is direct and convenient.\nd. Street trees and sidewalks are required on both sides of public streets except rural roads, lanes, alleys, and the undeveloped edge of neighborhood\nparkways. The street tree planting strip shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet in width and sidewalks shall be a minimum of five feet (5'0\") in width\nunless otherwise provided as shown in the Street Sections herein. Generally, canopy trees shall be planted at a spacing not to exceed forty (40) feet on\ncenter, not including distance from driveways. Where overhead utility lines preclude the use of canopy trees, small maturing trees may be substituted,\nplanted not more than thirty-four (34) feet on center.\ne.\nOn-street parking: An on-street parking lane at least nine (9) feet in width, on at least one (1) side of the street is required on streets serving attached\nhouses and detached houses with lots less than fifty (50) feet in width.\nf. Design speeds shall not exceed twenty-five (25) miles per hour on any neighborhood, street. Only arterials and City boulevards may exceed this design\nspeed. Design speed is separate from posted speed, which may vary from the design speed.\ng. Covenants and restrictions made a part of development shall not restrict vehicle types in conflict with adopted City policies.\nh.\nTraffic control plans showing signage and pavement markings shall be prepared in accordance with the guidance of the Manual on Uniform Traffic\nControl Devices. The developer is responsible for the initial installation of the devices or markings and the maintenance thereof until a public agency\n(City or NCDOT) accepts the street for maintenance. Design standards and specifications for City streets are set forth herein and in the City of\nGastonia Technical Standards & Specifications Manual. The street specifications in this manual may only be varied in accordance with Chapter 13\nSubdivisions.\ni. Cul-de-sacs shall have a minimum ten (10) foot wide pedestrian access easement connecting to the nearest public space, street right-of-way, or\ncommon open space, and have paved pedestrian connections, where practicable to provide pedestrian access connectivity.

Preservation of open space in developing areas serves a variety of purposes, including meeting\nthe recreational needs of residents, improving the aesthetic character of the community, reducing stormwater runoff, improving stormwater runoff water\nquality, and enhancing air quality. The standards set forth below establish regulations for open space.\nOpen Space.\nAlthough open space can be agricultural or natural in character, sub-urban open space is typically planned and developed as part of a development. The\nfollowing standards are hereby established for open space.\na. Detached Home and Attached Home Open Space Requirements.\ni. Subdivisions six (6) acres, or less are exempt from providing open space.\nii. Subdivisions greater than six (6) acres and less than ten (10) acres located within one mile, an existing park, measured as a straight line from the\nnearest edge of the subdivision to the nearest edge of the park, having a minimum of four (4) acres, are exempt from providing open space.\niii. For all other subdivisions a minimum of ten (10) percent of the total subdivision project site shall be set aside as open space designed as described\nby the Open Space Types.\nOpen space land area requirements.\nSingle-family/and/or duplex subdivisions: Ten (10) percent of total subdivision project site area. Other residential: the greatest of five hundred (500) square\nfeet of open space per dwelling unit or nine (9) percent of lot area. Open space shall be provided in accordance with the following:\nA. Initial residential development containing eight (8) or more units,\nB. Redevelopment or additional development that adds eight (8) or more residential units,\nLand designated as future open space. Regardless of the requirements and exemptions of this subsection, any portion of the site of the proposed\ndevelopment that is designated as future open space or greenway in the adopted Comprehensive Land Use Plan adopted by the City of Gastonia, as\namended from time to time, shall be reserved for open space. This area may be counted toward the total amount of open space required for the\ndevelopment. If the total amount of land designated as future open space or greenway is less than the total amount of open space required for the\ndevelopment, then the developer shall provide additional open space to meet the requirement listed above. If the amount of land designated as future\nopen space or greenway exceeds the total amount of open space required, then the developer must provide the open space designated in the official\nadopted plan. As compensation for any open space dedication associated with implementing any official adopted plan above the requirement listed herein,\nthe developer is eligible for a density bonus of one (1) dwelling unit per each four thousand three hundred fifty-six (4,356) square feet of land area in excess\nof that required, up to a maximum of a fifteen (15) percent increase above the maximum density or intensity allowed in the applicable zoning district.

Individual areas designated as open space areas shall not contain less than five hundred (500) square feet, although smaller\nareas may be approved by the Planning Director if the intent of this Ordinance is determined to be met.\nImprovement of open space. With the exception of Natural and Agricultural Open Space, open space shall be planned and improved, accessible and usable\nby persons living nearby. Improved shall mean cleared of underbrush and debris and shall contain four (4) or more of the following improvements:\nlandscaping, walls/fences, walks, statues, fountains, demarked ball fields, and/or playground equipment. Walls and fences shall be made of brick, stone,\nwrought iron, or wood and shall not exceed three and one-half (3.5) feet in height with the following exceptions: fences used in conjunction with ball fields,\ntennis courts, swimming pools, and/or play grounds.\nDesign and location. In major subdivisions and multi-building developments, open space shall be integrated into the design of the site. In subdivisions\nwhere fifty (50) percent or more of the lots are less than 0.75 acre in size, open space shall be located within one-fourth (1/4) mile of at least ninety (90)\npercent of the building lots, as measured along the rights-of-way of streets providing access between the two (2). In subdivisions where fifty (50) percent or\nmore of the lots are 0.75 acre or more in size, open space shall be located within one-half (1/2) mile of at least 90% of the building lots, as measured along\nthe rights-of-way of streets providing access between the two.\nFocal point. Open space features should provide focal points for the neighborhood. A central square or green, for example, may comprise a majority of the\nopen space. There should be a hierarchy of open space within new neighborhoods so that open space serves the needs of multiple age groups.\nabout:blank\n167/294\n"}, {"page": "168", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nTypes of open space. Open space types include Squares, Parks, Forecourts, Plazas, Greenways, and Natural and Agricultural. Standards for these open\nspace types are set forth below:\nA. Squares.\nSquares are areas for passive recreational use. Squares shall be bounded by streets on either a minimum of three (3) sides or fifty-six (56) percent of\ntheir perimeter.\nSquares should be used in high density environments where residents have little yard space. Squares are used to bring a natural landscape into a high\ndensity environment. As such, not more than twenty-five (25) percent of a square shall be impervious surface coverage. Hardscaping shall be\ndecorative (example brick pavers instead of asphalt for walkways).\nMin size: 500 square feet\nMax Size: 4 acres\nB. Parks.\nParks are areas for passive or active recreational use. Parks shall be bounded by streets on either a minimum of two (2) sides or thirty-two (32) of their\nperimeter.\nMinimum Size: 6,500 square feet\nMaximum Size: 8 Acres. Maximum size may exceed eight (8) acres if the park serves multiple neighborhoods or preserves environmental features.\nParks shall be areas where both passive and active recreation may occur simultaneously (example: park benches for elderly and a tot-lot for young\nchildren), encouraging intergenerational interactions among park users.\nC. Forecourt.\nForecourts are open spaces that act as buffers between residential buildings and streets or non-residential buildings. Forecourts are entirely bounded\nby buildings or streets. Forecourts shall be planted parallel to all primary street right-of-ways as shown in the illustration above.\nMinimum Size: 500 square feet\nMaximum Size: 1.5 acre\nabout:blank\n168/294\n"}, {"page": "169", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nD.

A\ntraditional neighborhood development that substantially meets the guiding principles of traditional neighborhood development design as set forth in this\nsection.\nIn keeping with the stated purpose of this section, a Traditional Neighborhood Development shall only be allowed through conditional district zoning as\npart of a PD planned district.\nA. Purpose and Intent.\nThe purpose of this section is to set forth guiding principles for traditional neighborhood development design and to provide relief from some of the\nstandards found in this Ordinance, when such developments are found to substantially meet the guiding principles of this section.\nB. TND Guiding Principles.\nFor organizational purposes, the guiding principles have been divided into six (6) categories; however, most principles relate to multiple categories. A TND\nmust substantially meet these principles. Where the development application does not meet a principle, the applicant shall submit justification therefore,\nunless the principle is described as optional. The guiding principles are as follows:\n1. The principles of the public realm:\na. The central element of traditional neighborhood design is the emphasis and weight given to the public realm (the streets and plazas, and the\npublic open spaces such as parks, playgrounds, greens, and natural areas, together with semi-public spaces which frame the public realm and\nprovide transition between public and entirely private spaces).\nb. TNDs feature well-designed public spaces, special emphasis on public and cultural buildings, and special design treatment for vista terminations.\nC. A sense of enclosure is maintained along the public street through an appropriate ratio between the height of building fronts and the distance\nbetween buildings on opposite sides of the street. Where street frontage consists of single story buildings or open space, street trees can be a\nsubstitute for front building walls to maintain this sense of enclosure.\nd. Non-residential buildings are set at or very near the sidewalk. In most situations, the same is true for attached housing. Single homes have\nrelatively shallow setbacks, typically one-fourth (1/4) to one-third (1/3) the lot width. Encroachments are allowed for porches, steps, bay windows, and\nbalconies.\ne. The public realm is appropriately landscaped. Unless good landscape design would otherwise dictate, each street is provided with an orderly\nregimen of street trees of substantial nursery stock, which will grow quickly to provide a street canopy. Planting strips wide enough to\naccommodate street trees typically separate sidewalks from street roadways (see Section 8.1.13B2f).\nf.\nSingle-family home lots in TNDs are typically smaller and narrower than in conventional subdivisions. A substantial amount of land area savings\nfrom reduced lot sizes is dedicated toward common areas.\ng. Narrower lots necessitate alternative treatment of certain fixtures that can diminish the aesthetic quality of the public realm. A system of rear\naccess lanes (alleys) can provide garage access at the rear of the lot. This is especially preferred for lots less than fifty (50) feet in width. When built\nto a 16-foot standard with a 24-foot right-of-way, the alley can also serve as an appropriate location for electric, gas, cable TV, and telephone\nequipment as well as access for garbage pick-up and mail delivery. On lots at least fifty (50) feet wide, alternate, less preferred methods of garage\naccess include (in descending order of preference):\n1. Front driveway accessing a garage behind the house or near the back of the lot;\n2.\nTurning the garage so that it does not face the front (provided the garage is set behind the front building line);\nabout:blank\n173/294\n"}, {"page": "174", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nthe TND should be given consideration for future route expansions when ridership can be expected.\n3. The principles of mixed use:\nabout:blank\n174/294\nCELL (1, 1): \nCELL (1, 2): \nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \n3. Setting the garage at least twenty (20) feet behind the front of the house; or\n4. Providing special architectural treatment to the house to visually de-emphasize a garage at the front.\nWhere alleys are not available, other measures are taken to hide unsightly utility equipment; however, fire hydrants are always located on the\nfronting street, ideally situated on planting strip bulb-outs at intersections.\nCELL (3, 1): \nCELL (3, 2): \nh. TNDs are designed so that there are linkages between the private realm and the public realm while protecting private spaces. Single homes have\nfront porches large enough for sitting (six (6) to eight (8) feet minimum depth), and attached dwellings typically have sitting porches or front\nstoops. Guidelines to allow for low front picket fences are often provided. Always for single homes served by alleys, and where feasible and\ndesigned appropriately for town homes, private spaces are protected at the rear using privacy devices according to the development guidelines.\nThe bottom floor of any dwelling whose sidewalk facing wall is within five (5) feet of such sidewalk should be elevated sufficiently above the\nsidewalk to provide additional privacy inside the dwelling.\nCELL (4, 1): \nCELL (4, 2): \ni.\nTNDs are designed to feature vista terminations at multiple locations. Vistas can terminate to important buildings, parks and greens, civic features\nin the town center, a carefully sited dwelling, a curve in the road, natural green edge, distant objects and scenery, and other features as\nappropriate. Entry into the community usually uses an important vista termination to provide a sense of place arrival.\nCELL (5, 1): \nCELL (5, 2): \nj. Utility wiring is underground and decorative street lighting fixtures are typically provided. Exceptions are provided for industrial areas.\nCELL (6, 1): \n2. The principles of the transportation system:\nCELL (6, 2): \n2. The principles of the transportation system:\nCELL (7, 1): \nCELL (7, 2): \na. TNDs always have a connecting web of streets, typically provided by a grid or modified grid street pattern. The street system is organized in a\ncomprehensible network hierarchy that forms an orderly discernable neighborhood or town structure.\nCELL (8, 1): \nCELL (8, 2): \nb. Culs-de-sac are avoided unless natural site or site boundary conditions require them. In such situations, special street design features such as\neyebrows and cul-de-sac loops are encouraged instead of standard ball-end cul-de-sacs.\nCELL (9, 1): \nCELL (9, 2): \nC. Curved as well as straight streets are allowed; however, each must contribute to the connecting web. Where possible, curved streets maintain the\nsame cardinal orientation. Long blocks are to be avoided with an average block being no more than six hundred (600) feet in length or one\nthousand eight hundred (1,800) feet in perimeter.\nCELL (10, 1): \nCELL (10, 2): \nd. While the \"sense of enclosure\" described in Section 8.1.13B1c., will help to reduce traffic speeds, additional design measures will be needed to\nslow traffic. Examples of such measures include such features as \"bulbing out\" the curb line at intersections, traffic circles, streets no wider than\nnecessary to provide adequate access, design for and encouragement of on-street parking, and safe but unconventional street geometrics. The\ninternal streets should be designed to feel safe driving at a speed no more than twenty-five (25) miles per hour.\nCELL (11, 1): \nCELL (11, 2): \ne. Typical street widths include: 34-38 feet for a main street with marked parking on both sides, 32-34 feet for lesser streets with marked parking\non both sides); 27-29 feet for through streets with marked parking on one side, 24-26 feet for standard streets with unmarked parking allowed\nto stagger from side to side; 20-24 feet for low density local streets with unmarked parking on one side; twenty (20) feet for one-way streets with\nparking on one side; and sixteen (16) feet for public residential alleys (private alleys may be allowed as narrow as twelve (12) feet) with commercial\nalleys typically being twenty-four (24) feet. Where possible, streets are encouraged to narrow to 22-24 feet at intersections and at mid-block cross\nwalks. Curve radii at intersections are ten (10) feet to twenty (20) feet, depending on street function. Standard vertical curb is preferred, and it is\nrequired on all residential streets without driveways (auto access is provided via a rear alley) and all commercial streets.\nCELL (12, 1): \nCELL (12, 2): \nf.\nTNDs are always walkable communities in the fullest sense. They typically contain sidewalks on both sides of the street and, in addition, may\ncontain a network of off-road walking and bike trails. Pedestrian facilities always meet the three (3) standards of safety, comfort and interest.\nSidewalks are well separated from the roadway with planting strips that are planted with indigenous, mostly deciduous shade trees (on\ncommercial streets sidewalks may extend to the curb with street trees planted in grates or other sufficiently sized planting space). Planting strips\nshould be six (6) feet to ten (10) feet wide (eight (8) feet is recommended), but may be reduced to four (6) feet in situations that are both unusual\nand difficult. Sidewalks are recommended five (5) feet in width on residential streets, wider on commercial streets.\nCELL (13, 1): \nCELL (13, 2): \ng. TNDs always have multiple points of ingress and egress from collector and major roads. The street system should also flow seamlessly to adjoining\nneighborhoods either existing or future.\nCELL (14, 1): \nCELL (14, 2): \nh. TNDs are never gated.\nCELL (15, 1): \nCELL (15, 2): \ni. Parking lots should not front along a street. On-street parking is provided throughout the development, and particularly so on streets with\ncommercial buildings and attached housing. Where additional parking is needed, it is provided behind buildings in the interior of the block. The\ncalculation of parking needs for nonresidential uses should always take into consideration available on-street parking and the expected walkable\npatronage. Parking lots shall include shade trees and no space in a parking lot shall be further than sixty (60) feet from the trunk of a shade tree.\nEach shade tree shall be planted in a planting area sized and shaped to enable healthy growth, a minimum of two hundred (200) square feet.\nPedestrian access from interior block parking area is best provided via a mid-block passageway to the street front. This passageway can also be\nused for other activities such as front entrances for small shops, access to second floor apartments, outdoor dining, outdoor vendors and outdoor\ndisplay of plants, flowers and other appropriate items for sale.\nCELL (16, 1): \nCELL (16, 2): \nj.

Exceptions may be made for TNDs of less than twenty-five (25) acres and/or one\nthat is within safe, easy walking distance to retail and other neighborhood services.\nb. TNDs always feature a mixture of residential types. While a mix of single homes and at least one type of attached housing is required in the\ndevelopment, an appropriate and carefully designed blending of single and attached housing within the development is encouraged.\nC. TNDs offer housing at a variety of affordability levels. Allowing garage apartments and \"granny flats\" at the rear of single home lots, in accordance\nwith the development's private guidelines (whether rented or not) is encouraged. These innovative (but historically traditional) housing forms help\nto accommodate family situations and promote income diversity within the TND.\nd.\nLive-work units (shop or office at the street level and residence at the second level), apartments over businesses, and covenant provisions for\nzero-impact customary home occupations are encouraged.\ne.\nIn traditional communities the denser housing and live-work units are typically located closer to the town center with a transition outward to less\ndense housing such as single homes. This principle should not be construed to discourage the careful blending of housing types as this transition\noccurs.\nf. Schools and churches are encouraged within the TND as is the provision of pedestrian and bicycle routes to connect to such facilities inside or\noutside the TND. It is, however, recognized that school location will, in most cases, not be possible unless the public school system considers\nsmaller site standards.\ng. Where buildings are on both sides of the street, similar building types should face each other when possible. Single house, townhouse, live-work\nunit, apartment building and store building are examples of building types.\nh. TNDs are expected to provide some on-site and/or adjacent to site employment opportunities. This can include employment in the services and\nstores within the TND, live-work units (the owners dwelling over his/her shop or office), or larger employment centers such as office buildings and\nlight industry. Industry should be located along a major road at the outer edge of the TND, where direct major road access is provided for trucks\nand workers who live elsewhere. Also, appropriate transition (and pedestrian access) must be designed between the industry and the\nneighborhood. Industrial buildings and their sites should include features sympathetic to traditional design principles, along with landscaped and\nnatural areas used to create transition to the rest of the TND.\ni. In general TNDs should be built in approximate proportions to the overall percentages of dwelling types shown on the overall site plan; provided\nhowever, lower density housing may be built at any faster rate than higher density housing. The initiation of commercial phases shall follow at any\ntime after the initiation of construction of at least ten (10) percent of single homes.\n4. The architectural principles:\na. The architecture should respond to the surrounding fabric of buildings and spaces and to local traditions. The principle that structures should be\nseamlessly linked to their surroundings (within the TND) transcends the issue of style.\nb. Each building always exhibits principles of human and pedestrian scale and contributes appropriately to the pedestrian life of the street.\nC. Architecture within the development should reflect styles that are complimentary of each other. Private development controls assure a variety\nstyles or sub-styles which serve to compliment each other while providing for overall consistency and reflection of the principles of traditional\nneighborhood design.\nd. Affordability variations between housing types and choices do not translate into meaningful inferior architectural treatment of lower cost housing\nchoices, as such housing relates to the public realm.\ne. Commercial buildings typically take on a \"shop front\" type appearance, joined by common walls, set with the front and entrance at the sidewalk\nalong the street, and are typically two (2) or more stories high (other uses such as residential and offices may occupy upper floors). Commercial\nbuildings should not face intersecting streets with blank walls.\nf. Residential buildings, other than bungalows and patio homes, should be at least two (2) stories tall.\ng. Except to more accurately portray pre-1940 architectural styles, buildings should employ relatively flat fronts and simple roofs. (Note: This\nprinciple shall not be construed to require pre-1940 architectural styles). Building articulations and setback encroachments for porches, stoops,\nsteps, bay windows, balconies and other such features that form the transition between the public and private realms are encouraged.\nh. Corner-lot homes should face their front door to the larger street (unless said street is a thoroughfare), except for an end-unit townhouse or row\nhouse, which may turn the corner with its front (unless the side street is an alley). Fronting a townhouse on both the primary street and the\nintersecting street with two (2) doors and/or wrap-around porch is encouraged.\n5. The principles of the neighborhood center:\na. TNDs have at least one defined center. Neighborhood centers typically feature uses such as shops and services, live-work units, attached\ndwellings, apartments over businesses, a formal open space such as a village square or green, and public/civic buildings (church, community\nbuilding/center, and post office are examples).\nb. Automobile oriented uses are typically not found in a neighborhood center and drive-thru facilities are strongly discouraged; an exception may be\nmade for a bank abutting a thoroughfare.\nC. A public gathering space such as a plaza, green or square is almost always present along with one or more focal features in or near this public\nspace such as a clock tower, fountain, monument, bandstand and/or public art which serve to terminate vistas and define the community.\nabout:blank\n175/294\n"}, {"page": "176", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nd. The TND center is ideally located near the geographic center of the development; however, it may also identify itself jointly with a thoroughfare\nbordering the TND (and therefore, be located near this major road or be linked to this road with an entrance street) in order that businesses\nwithin the center may more easily attract patrons from outside the development. This can serve to improve chances for economic success of the\nTND center. Ideally, the neighborhood center is no farther than one-fourth (1/4) mile radius of most dwellings; however, a neighborhood center that\nis within two thousand four hundred (2,400) feet of eighty (80) percent of the dwellings in the TND is acceptable in order to allow the center to\nidentify itself jointly with an adjoining thoroughfare.\ne.\nDevelopment form in the center typically reflects the traditional \"main street\" or \"town square\" vernacular of the region as described in Section\n8.1.13(b)(4)e. and parking is provided in accordance with Section 8.1.13(b)(2)c.\nf.\nOther civic uses are encouraged, including schools and day care centers; however, such uses should take on design features and lot sizes\nsympathetic to traditional principles and a walkable community. Office employment may occur at the TND center or along major roads adjoining\nthe TND. Light industrial employment, if present, is more appropriately located along a major road boundary in accordance with Section 8.1.13(b)\n(3)c.\ng. At least one site should be reserved at or near the neighborhood center, for an important community or civic building such as a community\ncenter, church, school, amenity center (club house and recreation facility) or community hall. The site should be prominent and special.\n6. The principles of open spaces and natural site characteristics:\na. A substantial amount of land savings generated by a more compact development form is converted to common open spaces.\nb. TNDs always have formal public open spaces such as greens, village squares, parks and playgrounds. They may also have substantial amounts of\nnatural or semi-natural open spaces that typically feature more informal amenities such as walking/bicycling trails and picnic areas.\nC.\nThere is always a significant civic space such as a town square, green, commons, or plaza at the neighborhood center.\nd. Small parks are distributed throughout the development, usually within one thousand (1,000) feet of any dwelling.\ne. Pre-existing or natural water features should be retained and made a community asset.\nf. The site should be designed in a manner that preserves specimen trees and significant groups of mature deciduous trees. Major tree stands\nshould be incorporated into public open spaces, where possible.\ng. The neighborhood design should adapt itself, as much as possible, to the existing topography to minimize the amount of grading necessary to\nachieve a viable street network.\nh. Parks, plazas, and commons should be equipped with proper furnishings and shade trees to encourage outdoor sitting, human interaction and\npeople watching; while some common areas should be grassed and left open (except for street trees) to encourage the types of\nleisure/recreational activities that require open areas.\nC. Relief From (or Establishment of Greater Standards for) Certain PRD and PUD Requirements.\nIn order that TNDs may meet the principles set forth in this section the following provisions of Sections 8.1.11 and 8.2.26 are hereby modified for\ndevelopments which are found to substantially meet the guiding principles of TND:\n1. Section 8.1.11A5B, for TNDs minimum project boundary setback shall be twenty (20) feet. Allowed encroachments into rear setbacks along the project\nboundary include accessory buildings (including accessory dwellings) up to ten (10) feet from the project boundary (twenty (20) feet for two-story\nstructures); utility equipment; alleys up to eight (8) feet provided an evergreen tree planting strip is provided if the alley is not used by development\noutside the project boundary; fences and walls. Where commercial uses within the TND adjoin single-family areas outside the TND, the Planning\nCommission or City Council may require additional setbacks, not to exceeding a cumulative total of fifty (50) feet.\n2. Section 8.1.11A8C, for TNDs on street parking ma count towards a portion of the parking requirements. Parking spaces inside garages are counted.\n3. Section 8.1.11A9A, minimum screening requirements, do not apply to TNDs; provided, however, the Planning Commission may require screening in\nany situation along the boundary of a TND or inside a TND as a condition for approval wherever it deems appropriate for the protection of adjoining\nproperties or to establish necessary transition. As a general rule, following of the best TND design principles should negate the need for screening,\nand screening should not be allowed to substitute for poor design or the lack of adequate design transition between less compatible buildings or\nuses.\n4. Section 8.2.26A is modified for TNDs to be the purpose and intent of Section 8.1.13.\n5. Section 8.2.26B1b does not apply to TNDs because a TND always contains dwellings.\n6. Section 8.2.26B3b does not apply to TNDs.\n7. Section 8.2.26B10b, C and d shall be modified for TNDs as set forth in Section 8.1.13C1 for residential buildings. Nonresidential buildings shall observe\nsetbacks of thirty (30) feet minimum along any external project boundary that is not a street and ten (10) feet where a street right-of-way is the\nexternal boundary. Where commercial uses within the TND adjoin single-family areas outside the TND, the Planning Commission may require\nadditional setbacks, not to exceed a cumulative total of fifty (50) feet.\n8. Section 8.2.26B8 is replaced for TNDs with the applicable provisions of Section 8.1.13B and the principles set forth in Section 8.1.13C3.\n9. Section 8.2.26B10e does not apply to TNDs.\n10. Sections 8.2.26B9 and 8.2.26B10 g, h, i, and j are replaced for TNDs with the applicable provisions of Section 8.1.13B.\nabout:blank\n176/294\n"}, {"page": "177", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nD.

NSCs shall be designed so that pedestrian traffic is encouraged and accommodated, through a combination of providing visual appeal, well-designed\nsidewalk systems, and enhancement of pedestrian comfort and safety. Furthermore, they should provide amenities that serve pedestrian and bicycle\ntraffic, such as outdoor seating, bike racks, landscaping elements, awnings over sidewalks where appropriate, etc. These centers shall be designed\nto\nprovide a reasonable level of accommodation for automobiles, but with less functional and visual emphasis than in typical suburban centers.\nB. NSCs shall avoid auto-oriented, \"franchise\" or prototypical architecture and site design typically used in suburban settings.\nC. NSCs shall typically be between one and three (3) acres. Sites larger than three (3) acres may be utilized, but all buildings and automobile parking and\ncirculation facilities shall be contained within a sub-area not larger than three (3) acres.\nabout:blank\n189/294\n"}, {"page": "190", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nD. NSCs shall provide retail and service oriented businesses of a scale that serves a more local population, typically living within one-half (1/2) mile of the site.\nIn order to promote the economic viability of such centers, there should generally be an existing or expected minimum net density of two thousand\n(2,000) dwelling units within a one-half-mile radius of the external boundaries of the site. The area within a one-half-mile radius should also have a\nreasonably well-developed system of sidewalks or other pedestrian or bicycle pathways, whether existing or planned for near-term construction.\nE. NSCs shall be located at an intersection of a thoroughfare and another public street of any size. An exception may be made that allows NSCs to be\nconstructed on lots with frontage on only one road (a thoroughfare) if the site has a well-developed greenway, pedestrian or combination\nbicycle/pedestrian connection to substantial existing or planned residential neighborhoods behind or adjacent to the site. Such connections must be\npermanent and open for use by the general public. All NSCs should be within comfortable walking distance of a mixture of housing types (typically not\nmore than one-fourth (1/4) mile).\nBuilding Design Principles:\nA. As a general design principle, buildings shall be designed and oriented on the site so as to front both intersecting streets on corner lots, or the single\nthoroughfare on non-corner lots. The primary goal is to mirror commercial design patterns in traditional downtown areas. To achieve this it will generally\nbe necessary to design buildings whose long edges are oriented parallel to public streets and are longer than they are deep by a factor of at least two to\none. It will further be necessary to establish a \"build-to\" line whereby the average building setback from a public street shall not exceed fifteen (15) feet.\nArticulation in the setback shall be incorporated to provide visual breaks in the facade and to permit sight triangles at intersections of two (2) roads.\nWhere subject property under one ownership is divided by a public street, buildings shall be oriented to provide frontage on all streets. Typical suburban\nyards (setbacks) shall not be allowed. On sites where the primary goals stated herein are achieved and there remains unused square footage allowance,\nadditional buildings may be constructed on the site at other suitable locations. Such additional buildings shall meet all required C-1 district setbacks.\nB. Square foot allowances and number of tenants for NSCs:\n1. For parcels between one and one and one-half (1.5) acres, the non-residential portion of NSCs shall not exceed twenty thousand (20,000) square feet\nin size and shall contain not fewer than three (3) non-residential uses. Second floor residential units shall be allowed, the total area of which shall not\nexceed twelve thousand (12,000) square feet. If second-floor residential uses are incorporated into the design, for every two (2) square feet of heated\nfloor area devoted to such uses, one additional square foot of non-residential space shall be allowed (not to exceed a total bonus of six thousand\n(6,000) square feet of additional non-residential space). One parking space for each one thousand (1,000) square feet of residential space shall be\nrequired.\n2. For parcels between one and fifty-one hundredths (1.51) and two (2) acres, the non-residential portion of NSCs shall not exceed twenty-five thousand\n(25,000) square feet in size and shall contain not fewer than four (4) non-residential uses. Second floor residential units shall be allowed, the total area\nof which shall not exceed sixteen thousand (16,000) square feet. If second-floor residential uses are incorporated into the design, for every two (2)\nsquare feet of heated floor area devoted to such uses, one additional square foot of non-residential space shall be allowed (not to exceed a total\nbonus of eight thousand (8,000) square feet of additional non-residential space). One parking space for each one thousand (1,000) square feet of\nresidential space shall be required.\n3. For parcels larger than two (2) acres, the non-residential portion of NSCs shall not exceed thirty thousand (30,000) square feet and shall contain not\nfewer than five (5) non-residential uses. Second floor residential units shall be allowed, the total area of which shall not exceed twenty thousand\n(20,000) square feet. If second-floor residential uses are incorporated into the design, for every two (2) square feet of heated floor area devoted to\nsuch uses, one additional square foot of non-residential space shall be allowed (not to exceed a total bonus of ten thousand (10,000) square feet of\nadditional non-residential space). One parking space for each one thousand (1,000) square feet of residential space shall be required.\n4. Any single retail establishment shall be limited to 6,000 square feet, except those offering multiple lines of general merchandise, such as groceries,\nnotions, drugs, household goods, etc. Such uses may have a floor area not exceeding 12,000 square feet. Examples of such uses include, but are not\nlimited to, full-service drug stores, convenience stores without fuel sales, etc.\nC.\nBuildings may be one or two (2) stories. No portion of a single story structure may exceed 18 feet in height. Second stories must be structurally functional,\nand should incorporate fenestration on the exterior facades.\nD.\nThe total floor area of any NSC shall be enclosed within one or two (2) freestanding buildings unless the site is divided by a public street; in which case up\nto four (4) buildings may be permitted. In general, separate buildings for each tenant, with independent and/or disconnected parking, circulation systems,\nand signage, shall be prohibited. If two (2) structures are built along the \"build-to-line,\" the space separating them shall not be used for vehicular access.\nE. Buildings shall be designed so that each facade facing a public street contains significant fenestration at the street level, and should if practical,\nincorporate functional means of ingress/egress for pedestrians.\nF.\nDetailed building facade elevations and material specifications shall be required as part of the submission process.\nG. Buildings should incorporate common design elements while avoiding mass uniformity. Small variations in height, materials, and roof articulation are\nencouraged.\nH. Drive through service lanes and windows may be utilized only in association with pharmacies, dry cleaning shops, automated bank teller machines, and\nphotographic film deposit stations.\nI. Awnings, arcades, or porte-cocheres should be provided near building entrances and sidewalks. Awning may extend beyond property lines if necessary to\ncover a public sidewalk provided there are no obvious or foreseeable public utility conflicts. However, such lawnings shall not extend closer than six (6)\nfeet to the pavement edge of any travel lane.\nabout:blank\n190/294\n"}, {"page": "191", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nJ.

Intent. It is the intent of the city: to allow communication towers for mobile telephone services and other radio and television information services which\nprovide for the needs of its citizens while minimizing adverse visual and operational effects of such towers through careful design, placement, and\nscreening; to avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure and falling ice; and to maximize the use of any existing towers and to\nreduce the number of new towers which are needed.\nB. Location.\n1. Location of freestanding communication towers in residential (R) zones (except RLD), the C-1, CBD, O-1, OLC, O-M, and TMU districts shall be as\nfollows:\na. The tower shall be a use by right if mounted to an existing structure.\nb. Communication towers in the aforementioned zoning districts (except CBD) may not be free-standing structures unless designed as stealth towers\nand approved through the conditional use permit process in subsection (f) of this section. Free-standing towers, including stealth, shall be\nprohibited in the CBD, as well as, the Historic District and the Center City Design District.\nC.\nabout:blank\n216/294\n"}, {"page": "217", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nA stealth tower, in residential (R) zones (except R-A), the C-1, C-1A, O-1, O-2, O-M, and O-P districts, shall not be permitted if it is independent or not customarily\ncomplementary to existing use(s) on the lot in which the proposed tower is to be constructed. For example, a bell tower would not be considered appropriate on a\nsingle-family residential lot and, for example, a cell tower disguised as a tree would not be appropriate in the center of an open field.\n2. Location of freestanding communication towers in the RLD, C-2, C-3, UMU, I-1, I-2, I-3, and I-U districts shall be governed as follows:\na. A monopole tower may be built, subject to the tower meeting all other performance criteria contained herein and elsewhere in this Ordinance.\nb. A lattice tower may be built subject to certain height and distance separations based on how far the base of the tower is set back from the nearest\nthoroughfare (as designated on the most recently adopted version of the thoroughfare plan of the Gaston Urban Area) along with other\nperformance criteria as herein listed. The following chart shows distance and height requirements for the placement of lattice towers:\nAn example of this is as follows:\nA communication tower (of lattice construction) is proposed to be located in the I-1 district. The tower, meeting all other conditions of this Ordinance,\nis to be located three hundred fifty (350) linear feet (as measured using the straightest short line distance) from the nearest thoroughfare right-of-way.\nThe tower may therefore be no greater than one hundred twenty (120) feet in height.\nIf said tower were of monopole construction, the tower could be placed elsewhere on the lot, subject to it meeting all other applicable regulations of\nthis Ordinance.\n3. Two-way local communication radio towers incidental to a business use (i.e., used by said business for their operational communications only) may be\nup to two hundred (200) feet in height in any zone other than a residential zone. Any such tower shall meet the applicable setback requirements for\nthe zoning district in which it is located. Any such tower shall be set back from any lot in a residential zoning district by a distance equal to the height\nof the tower, or two hundred (200) feet, whichever is less. Said towers shall be of monopole construction only.\nC. Maximum height. Maximum tower height of lattice towers is discussed in Section 9-15B2. There are no maximum height restrictions for monopole towers,\nexcept for two-way local communication radio towers (as discussed in Section 9-15B3.\nIf the communication tower is placed on top of an existing structure it may extend above the height of that structure by no greater than twenty (20) feet in\nall residential zones (except R-A) and fifty (50) feet in all other zoning districts.\nD. Minimum setbacks. Minimum setbacks, as herein indicated, shall be measured from the base of the tower. If a tower is to be placed on a leased portion of\na lot which is owned by someone other than the tower owner, setbacks shall be measured from the boundaries of said lot.\n1. No additional setbacks shall be required if the tower is to be placed on an existing structure.\n2. In all office, commercial, and industrial districts and the RLD district, a minimum setback of forty (40) feet from any adjoining lot line shall be required,\nunless the lot line separates the lot from a residential district (except RLD) or a lot containing a residential use. In such instances, a minimum setback\nof two hundred (200) feet from such residential district or a lot containing a residential use shall be required unless the tower is affixed to an existing\nstructure or a waiver is granted by the Planning Commission or City Council.\n3. Maximum setbacks of monopole, two-way local communication radio towers are discussed in Section 9-15B3.\n4.\nMinimum lot size for any communication tower which is a principal use shall be ten thousand (10,000) square feet.\nE.\nBuffering/materials. Buffering shall be required for all communication towers which are freestanding structures. Such landscaping shall not be required\nwhen the tower is physically placed within another structure or when incorporated within another structure (e.g., church steeple).\nabout:blank\n217/294\nCELL (1, 1): \nSetback Distance from Nearest\nThoroughfare Right-of-Way Line (linear feet)\nCELL (1, 2): \nMaximum Height of Lattice Tower (feet)\nCELL (2, 1): \n0-200\nCELL (2, 2): \n35\nCELL (3, 1): \n201-300\nCELL (3, 2): \n100\nCELL (4, 1): \n301-400\nCELL (4, 2): \n120\nCELL (5, 1): \n401-500\nCELL (5, 2): \n140\nCELL (6, 1): \n501-600\nCELL (6, 2): \n160\nCELL (7, 1): \n601-700\nCELL (7, 2): \n180\nCELL (8, 1): \n701+\nCELL (8, 2): \n200\n"}, {"page": "218", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nA type D buffer shall be required when a freestanding communication tower is placed in a residential, except RLD, office, C-1, CBD, and TMU zoning\ndistrict. A type C buffer shall be required for freestanding communication towers in all other zoning districts.\nIrrespective of all minimum screening requirements, towers shall be screened with trees so as to minimize the sight impact from surrounding residences.\nAll towers shall not be obtrusive in the neighborhoods in which they are located and shall be constructed of materials so as to have an external finish\nwhich renders them compatible with surrounding neighborhoods.\nThe planning director, or Planning Commission or City Council (through the issuance of a conditional use permit) may waive any or all of these screening\nrequirements upon a finding that the existing topography or existing screening materials on site screen the property as effectively as the screening which\nordinarily would be required; or that the installation of new screening materials would be impractical or would serve no useful purpose (such waiver may\nalso include situations when the type of nonresidential adjoining use would not warrant screening); provided, however, that the spirit and intent of this\nsection is preserved. This shall not be construed to relieve the requirement of establishing screening for towers to be located adjacent to vacant\nproperties or along any public street.\nF. Conditional use permit procedures. The Planning Commission and City Council shall generally follow the procedures found in Section 5.11 in deciding\nwhether to issue a conditional use permit for a communication tower, with the following exceptions:\n1. Prior to issuing a conditional use permit, the Planning Commission or City Council shall make, in addition the findings found in Section 5.11, the\nfollowing findings:\na. The tower will not interfere with the FAA Part 77 surfaces surrounding the Gastonia Municipal Airport or affect the radio and navigational signals\nof the operating ground and airborne equipment in the vicinity of the airport.\nb. If the proposed tower is to be located in a residential zone, except RLD, the applicant has provided substantial evidence that the tower cannot\nfeasibly be located upon an existing wireless support structure or structures within the applicant's search ring (as those terms are defined in G.S.\n160A-400.51) or, if the proposed tower is to be located in a residential zone, except RLD, it will be housed within or upon a special structure which\nwill be compatible architecturally with the surrounding residential area. (Note: These findings shall only be applicable in a residential zone, except\nRLD).\nThe term \"architecturally compatible,\" as herein used, shall mean \"adequately disguised by the structure on which the antenna is located so as to\ndisguise or camouflage the tower in such manner so that the structure housing the tower takes on the appearance of a structure other than a\ncommunication tower.\" In addition, \"the design and materials used on the structure and its exterior materials blend harmoniously with the\nbuildings and use of the host sight.\"\nIn no case shall the height of said communication tower exceed one hundred fifty (150) feet.\n2. The Planning Commission or City Council, in issuing a conditional use permit, may waive all or portions of the screening and/or landscape\nrequirements when a tower is located in or on a new special structure which is architecturally compatible with the surrounding area.\nG. Discontinuance of tower. If at any time after the effective date of this Ordinance a communication tower becomes unused for cellular transmission\npurposes, the tower shall be removed within one year of the date of discontinuance.\nH.\nCommunication tower, combined. The City Council finds it to be in the public interest to encourage the co-location on the same tower of multiple wireless\ntelephone service providers or co-location of public safety communication with wireless telephone service providers. The City Council further finds that\nthe wireless telephone industry is growing and the number of service providers is so increasing that co-location between providers must be achieved if\nthe community is to avoid a proliferation of tall communication towers. The City Council also finds that the policies of the Federal Communication\nCommission necessitate the city to establish multiple transmission tower locations for the purpose of public safety communications, causing significant\npublic costs as well as aesthetic degradation of the community. Furthermore, the City Council finds that the location of wireless telephone and public\nsafety communication tower facilities on public property, where they are so designed for co-location of at least three (3) users on the same tower,\nproduces an outcome more preferable to the public than single users on single sites due to: (i) a greater degree of co-location being achieved; (ii) a greater\ncontrol of siting with respect to surrounding land uses and a mitigation of aesthetic harm being achieved; (iii) increased opportunities for tower-sharing\nfor public safety communication being achieved; and (iv) public benefits from the rent being paid to the city by the tower user.\nAccordingly, the following performance criteria are placed on combined communication towers:\n1. Irrespective of property ownership, a communication tower may not be located in an historic overlay district.\n2.\nThe tower shall be of a monopole design or be housed within or upon a \"special structure\" designed to appear like something other than\na\ncommunications tower and be aesthetically suitable for the site; provided, however, that the City Council, in approving the ground lease and public\nsafety communications use agreement, may approve a lattice-type tower if it determines that a lattice type design is necessary to accommodate the\ntransmission and/or reception needs of the city public safety communications. If a \"special structure\" is used, the City Council shall determine that the\nsuitability of such special structure in approving the ground lease. In so doing, it shall consider the natural and built characteristics and public use\n(existing and proposed) of the particular site and surrounding land uses, as well as the need for height and co-location capability. Examples of such\nspecial structures include bell towers, athletic field lighting, structures for flying flags, and towers disguised as trees. Design information, certified by a\nregistered professional engineer, must be submitted to the planning department showing how all of the potential multiple users will be\naccommodated on the pole.\nabout:blank\n218/294\n"}, {"page": "219", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\n3. If there is an existing (including built or permitted and not yet constructed) tower within the applicant's search ring, the applicant for the proposed\ntower shall prove to the Planning Commission that the applicant's antennae facilities cannot feasibly be accommodated on said existing tower.\n4. From a residentially zoned parcel which may or may not adjoin the subject property and which is not owned by the city, used for governmental\npurposes, or public utility purposes, the required setback shall be two hundred (200) feet from the base of the tower. Setbacks from all other property\nlines not owned by the city shall be forty (40) feet. Any of the above setbacks may be waived up to fifty (50) percent by the City Council provided that\nthe greatest degree of separation from residentially zoned properties is maintained.\n5. In lieu of the screening and landscaping standards contained in Chapter 11, the following standards for combined communication towers shall apply:\na. Within, or where adjoining, a residential district or between the tower and a thoroughfare (as designated on the most recently adopted version of\nthe thoroughfare plan): A 20-foot wide planted buffer consisting of tall growing evergreen trees, such as Leyland Cypress, Tree Holly, Magnolia\nGrandiflora, or Deodar Cedar, which are at least eight (8) feet in height at time of planting, and with spacing approved by the planning director so\nas to best provide for opacity after five (5) years of growth.\nb. For all other situations: A ten-foot wide planted buffer shall be required according to the standards contained in Section 9-15H5(a).\nC.\nPlants shall be installed and maintained by the tower owner in accordance with Section 11.2.2E.\nd. Modifications to the buffer requirements may be made by the planning director in situations where there are existing plants and terrain features\nthat can help provide a buffer. In such cases, a plan enhancing such existing features for performance which equals or betters what normally\nwould be expected from a newly planted buffer after five (5) years of growth may be approved by the planning director.\ne.\nThe City Council may partially or totally waive any buffer requirement in situations where a \"special structure\" is used or where such waiver is\nnecessary to accommodate city public safety communications, provided the base of the tower is screened from view from any adjoining street by\neither a brick, stone, or decorative masonry wall at least eight (8) feet in height, a principal building on the site, or any combination thereof.\nf.\nThe tower shall have at least one wireless telephone service provider or a city public safety communications tower committed for active use within\nninety (90) days of completion of construction. Evidence of writing of commitment for such use shall be submitted with the site plan.\ng. A site plan shall be submitted and approved, in accordance with Section 5.2 prior to issuance of a zoning permit.\nh. If a tower remains unused for wireless telephone paging services or public safety communications for a continuous period of one year, the tower\nshall then be removed by the tower owner.\nI. Eligible facilities request. The City shall approve an eligible facilities request, which shall be defined as a request for a modification of an existing\ncommunication tower or base station that involves collocation of new transmission equipment or replacement of transmission equipment but does not\ninclude a substantial modification, provided that the application for such eligible facilities request is complete. A substantial modification for purposes of\nthis section shall be defined as set forth in G.S. 160A-400.51.\n(Ord. No. 13-628, \u00a7 16, 11-19-13)\nSECTION 9.15.1 - SMALL WIRELESS FACILITIES\nA. Intent. The purpose of this section is to:\n1. Minimize the impacts of small wireless facilities on surrounding areas by establishing standards for location, structural integrity and compatibility;\n2. Encourage the location and collocation of small wireless facilities equipment on existing structures thereby minimizing new visual, aesthetic, and\npublic safety impacts, and to reduce the need for additional antenna-supporting structures;\n3. Accommodate the growing demand for wireless services and the resulting need for small wireless facilities;\n4. Regulate in accordance with all applicable federal and state laws;\n5. Establish review procedures to ensure that applications for small wireless facilities are reviewed and acted upon within a reasonable period of time or\nany specific period of time required by law;\n6. Protect the aesthetics of the City while meeting the needs of its citizens and businesses to enjoy the benefits of wireless communications services; and\n7.\nEncourage the use of existing buildings and structures as locations for small wireless facilities infrastructure as a method to minimize the aesthetic\nimpact of related infrastructure.\nIt is not the purpose or intent of this section to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting wireless communications services; unreasonably discriminate among\nproviders of functionally equivalent wireless communication services; regulate the placement, construction or modification of wireless communications facilities on\nthe basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions where it is demonstrated that the small wireless facility does or will comply with applicable FCC\nregulations; or prohibit or effectively prohibit collocations or modification that the City must approve under state or federal law.

Managed parking encourages a balanced supply adequate to meet\nthe day-to-day demands of drivers for access to work, home, shopping and entertainment; and moderates the impacts of its physical presence on the\nprices paid for goods and services, and the costs of environmental mitigation, which are incurred by all.\nWhen mismanaged parking is a liability for both the driving and non-driving public, delivering excess spaces almost exclusively in the form of low tax\nrevenue generating, and expensive to build, surface lots. The true cost of excess parking raises the price of housing for all residents, specifically burdening\nthose with lower incomes; increases the cost of business development, specifically for small businesses; and increases the cost of utilities and the\ninfrastructure needed mitigate flooding, stormwater runoff quality, and heat island impacts for all. Because the costs of mismanaged parking are inflicted\nat the community level, while the benefits accrue only to drivers, parking standards must be calibrated to manage an equitable balance between driver\naccessibility and public cost.\nTherefore, the provisions of this Chapter mandate maximum off-street parking requirements for all uses in all Zoning Districts to reduce oversupply with\nthe expressed intent of promoting affordable housing and small business development, reducing parking lot surface areas to lower mitigation costs for,\nand replenishment of, environmental systems, and making alternative modes of transit economically viable. The provisions of this Chapter establish robust\nstandards for locating and calculating off and on-street parking, encourage ride sharing, and provide bicycle parking to meet these stated goals.\n(Ord.

Violations.\nFailure to provide or maintain landscaping or buffering in accordance with an approved landscaping plan shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance and\nshall subject the violating party(ies) to any and all of the remedies as called for in this Ordinance (Chapter 13).\nE. Installation and Maintenance.\nThe plantings that constitute required buffering and landscaping shall be properly installed and maintained in order to fulfill the purpose of which it is\nestablished. Plant species shall be recommended for healthy growth under local climate conditions, not be of a type highly prone to disease, and be of a\ntype expected to grow in a manner that will satisfy the spirit and intent of this Ordinance. Plant materials shall be planted in accordance with the\nrecommended practices of the American Standard for Nursery Stock of the American Nursery and Landscape Association. The owner of the property and\nany tenant on the property where buffering and landscaping are required shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all required\nlandscaped materials. Such maintenance shall include all actions necessary: to keep the buffered and landscaped areas free of litter and debris; to keep\nplantings healthy; to keep growth from interfering with safe vehicular or pedestrian travel, or use of parking areas, or from creating any nuisances to\nadjoining properties; and, to keep walls, fences and berms in good repair and neat appearance. Any vegetation that constitutes a required screen or\nlandscaped area shall be replaced in the event that it dies. All buffering and landscaping material shall be protected from damage.\nF. Relief.\n1. The Administrator may modify or waive certain portions of this Ordinance when he determines that unusual topography or elevation of a\ndevelopment site, the location, shape or size of the parcel to be developed would make either (1) strict adherence to the requirements of this\nOrdinance serve no meaningful purpose; (2) not achieve one or more of the goals of this Ordinance; or (3) would make it physically impossible to\ninstall or maintain the required screening or landscaping materials as otherwise called for.\n2.\nSuch modification or waiver may occur only at the request of the developer, who shall submit as part of his landscape plan the existing site features\nthat would screen the proposed use and any additional buffer materials that are to be planted or installed that would serve as the proposed screened\nor landscaped area. The Administrator shall have no authority to provide said modification or waiver unless the developer demonstrates that existing\nor proposed buffering material will screen the proposed use as effectively as the required buffer. This section shall not be construed to negate the\nnecessity for establishing buffers for uses that lie adjacent to vacant properties.\n3. Where the Historic District commission, in considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, finds that portions of this Ordinance come\ninto direct conflict with the purpose and intent of any historic district, the Commission may recommend to the Planning Director, that certain portions\nof this section be waived or alternate plans accepted.\nG.

Purpose\nIn order to absorb carbon dioxide and provide oxygen necessary for human life; purify air through transpiration; provide cooling through shade; reduce\nthe impact of wind; retard the rate of water runoff; reduce glare and noise; to conserve property values; and to contribute to the natural beauty and\naesthetics of the community, street trees, as herein provided, are required. Additional landscape planting strip standards associated with parking decks\nare found in Sections 10.9.1, 10.9.2 and 10.9.3. The required street trees may be planted within said landscaped area or elsewhere on the lot as herein\ncalled for in Subsection D. Greenstrips may also be required as provided for in Section 9.18.2.\nB. Where Required\n1. Street yard and landscaping requirements shall be met along and parallel to any public road for all new developments (except those listed in Section\n11.2.2), new developments along road frontage not developed, or substantial redevelopment of an existing site to another use (except for those listed\nin Section 11.2.2) within the Urban Standards (USO) Overlay and CH Corridor Highway Overlay Districts. In addition, street yard and landscaping\nrequirements shall be met on any internal road two-hundred fifty (250) linear feet or greater in length that is used as an entryway into a parking lot for\na commercial development within said districts. Street trees shall also be required on lots located within a planned residential development (PRD),\ntraditional neighborhood development (TND), and planned unit development (PUD) whether such developments are located in a USO or CH overlay\ndistrict.\n2. Where the distance between the building line and the right-of-way is less than that proscribed, the zoning administrator may waive planting\nrequirements where the measurement is less than six (6) feet or when planting is not in the best interest of public safety or where planting the\nmaterial would serve no practical purpose. In these cases, the administrator may require a planting alternative, such as planting within the street\nright-of-way.\nC. Number of Street Trees Required\nCanopy and understory trees shall be planted, where required, as follows:\n1. One canopy tree for each forty (40) linear feet of frontage; or\n2. One understory tree for each thirty (30) feet of frontage; or\n3. A combination of canopy and understory trees at the rate of one per thirty-five (35) feet of frontage.\n4. For interior roads only, any combination of canopy trees so long as the type and spacing of trees placed can be expected to form a substantial canopy\nwithin twenty (20) years of initial planting.\nabout:blank\n246/294\n"}, {"page": "247", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nD. Location of Trees.\n1. Street trees must be located within forty-five (45) feet of the curb or right-of-way and in front of the building line in order to be counted toward the\nrequired total. The Administrator shall have the authority to approve the placement of street trees in a variety of locations, based on (1) the nature of\nthe development (2) the underlying zoning district (3) the presence of other street trees on adjacent or nearby lots (4) the presence of overhead utility\nlines (5) road maintenance, and (5) other factors that directly affect the maintenance and long-term viability of the trees.\nAccordingly, the Administrator shall have the authority to have the street trees in the following locations, each of which is listed in descending order of\npreference:\na. In the greenstrip area between the sidewalk and the back of curb, provided per Section 9.18.2;\nb. Within a landscape area on private property, shown in Figure 11.4-1;\nC. Elsewhere in the front yard as practical;\nd. Within the sidewalk in planters or grates, as long as all applicable construction and disability standards can be met.\nWhere the Administrator deems none of the above locations feasible and practical, he shall have the authority to modify the placement of street trees.\nRefer to Figure 11.4-1 below for a schematic of these possible locations.\nFigure 11.4-1\n2. In no instance shall canopy trees be placed underneath aboveground utility lines.\n3. Distribution shall be generally proportionate along the road frontage; however, this shall not be construed to require equal intervals between trees.\nThe intent is to allow flexibility in design while discouraging long intervals without trees.\nE. Peninsula Lots.\nProperties with street frontage (not including Interstate 85 or the limited access portion of US 321) on three (3) or more sides may reduce the number of\nrequired street trees by one-half (1/2) for each street not listed as an thoroughfare on the most recently adopted version of the local thoroughfare plan.\nF. Existing Trees.\nExisting trees with a caliper of at least ten (10) inches Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) may be counted as two (2) trees.\nG. Median Landscaping.\nAny median which is at any point three (3) feet or greater in width (except medians which are used for sidewalks and as handicapped access ramps) shall\ncontain a general cover of planted ground materials or be planted with shrubs or trees. Areas lying beneath and around the shrub or tree materials shall\nbe covered with mulch, wood bark, wood chips, pine straw, or other decorative ground cover. Notwithstanding, the foregoing trees may be planted in tree\nplanters and in such areas as brick or concrete walks. There shall be no bare soil in the medians.\nH. Internal Road Landscaping.\nAny internal road two hundred fifty (250) linear feet or greater in length which is used as an entryway into a parking lot for a commercial development\nshall be planted (on both sides) with any combination of canopy trees so long as the type and spacing of trees is such that the trees touch each other at\nthe date of maturity.\nSECTION 11.5 RESERVED\nEditor's note- - Ord.

To provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance.\n12.1.3 - SIGN AREA AND HEIGHT MEASUREMENTS\nA. Sign Area Computations\nThe Administrator shall employ the following principles when determining the area of sign:\n1. The area of a sign face shall be computed by using up to three (3) of the smallest basic geometric shapes (i.e. square, circle, triangle) that will\nencompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of\nthe background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed. Such measurement shall not\ninclude any supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall is clearly incidental to the display itself and does not\ncontain any sign copy. For pole signs, poles covered with corporate logos or with more than one corporate color will be considered part of the sign\narea.\n2. For a single wall (i.e., the entire wall that shares the same architectural elevation as shown on the approved sign permit) all pieces of information or\nother graphic representations on the wall that are logically related shall be measured as part of one sign. If multiple signs on a single wall share a\nframe or other material of color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate the signs from the background against which they are\nplaced, such area will be measured as part of one sign.\n3. Regardless of whether a single wall has wall sections that project, recess or otherwise vary from the predominate wall plane, the sign area\nmeasurement shall include the area of all sign faces that can be viewed from a single vantage point. Signs may be placed back-to-back, side-by-side, or\nin V-type construction. Side-by-side signs must be structurally tied together and considered as one sign. V-type and back-to-back signs must be\nconsidered as two (2) signs if the angle between the faces is forty-five (45) degrees or more. In all other cases, the areas of each face of a multi-faced\nsign shall be added together to compute the sign area. Sign area of multi-faced signs is calculated based on the principle that all sign elements that\ncan be seen at one time or from one vantage point should be considered when measuring the area of such sign.\nExamples Of How Sign Area Is To Be Computed Are Indicated Below:\nabout:blank\n249/294\n"}, {"page": "250", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nB. Sign Height Computation\nThe height of a sign shall be measured from the highest point of a sign to the street grade level. In the case of a ground or monument sign, the maximum\nsign height shall be measured from the ground or street grade level from which the sign is to be viewed, whichever is higher.\nSECTION 12.2 - SIGNS NOT REQUIRING A PERMIT\nThe following signs shall be exempt from the regulations contained in this Ordinance and shall not be required to have had a permit issued from the\nAdministrator for their placement.

The first purposes of this Subsection shall be to\nallow the removal and consolidation of older, structurally deteriorating, obsolete or visually deteriorated off-premise advertising signs into fewer more\nstructurally sound and visually appealing structures and fewer sign faces in the City's zoning jurisdiction. The second purpose shall be to allow the\nrelocation of off-premise advertising signs from locations of significant aesthetic interest, such as historical areas and gateways as set forth in Paragraph\n(2) of this Subsection.\n1. Consolidation/relocation/replacement of Off-premise Advertising Signs. The Zoning Administrator may approve an application for the\nconsolidation, relocation and replacement of off-premise advertising signs with static, electronic changeable face, or changing/tri-vision off-premise\nadvertising signs identified by the owner of said signs (and/or owner of the property on which the signs are located) in the application.\nEach consolidation/relocation/replacement plan shall result in the removal of at least two (2) active off-premise advertising signs and two (2) sign\nstructures. Each plan shall result in the erection of either one static, electronic changeable face, or changing/tri-vision off-premise advertising sign\nstructure with no more than two (2) faces, having no more than one face per direction of travel.

Signs using modern materials and construction methods can be well designed or poorly done, as can\nsigns constructed with traditional materials. For this reason all signs proposed for the district shall first be reviewed and approved by the Design Review\nCommittee as provided for under Section 7.11.B\nApplicants must submit, at a minimum, a detailed scale drawing of the sign, indicating its dimensions, placement on the site or building, lettering sizes\nand fonts, and all materials that are to be used in its construction. In addition, committee members may require the submission of samples of materials\nproposed, if deemed necessary for proper review and consideration of the application. Where there is conflict with other sections of this Chapter, central\nbusiness district signage standards within this section shall prevail. Where the standards of this section are silent, the requirements of Chapter 12 shall\nprevail.\n1. Due to the flexibility inherent in this review process, there are no materials or techniques that are categorically disallowed in the construction of signs.\n2. All freestanding identification signs shall be ground signs with a maximum height of seven (7) feet.\n3. The maximum area of the sign face for freestanding signs shall be a maximum of sixty-four (64) square feet for buildings whose primary entrance\nfronts Franklin Boulevard. For all other properties the maximum shall be forty (40) square feet.\n4.\nFor signage attached to the building wall (attached signs), signage may be attached to any building wall facing a public street or facing a public or\nprivate parking lot where customers are allowed to park, and the area of allowed signage on any such wall face shall be calculated separately. Each\nsuch facade shall be allowed two (2) square feet of sign area for each linear foot of building wall width along said facade up to a maximum of sixty-\nfour (64) square feet for each facade. Such sign area may be distributed between multiple signs carrying separate messages. The zoning administrator\nmay grant up to twenty-five (25) additional square feet of signage that would otherwise meet the standards of this section in order to make use of an\nhistoric sign frieze, or on a new building, in the creation of a new sign frieze.\nIn addition to such facades, one identification sign (either single tenant or multitenant), up to thirty-two (32) square feet in size, may be placed on any\nother building wall which is generally perpendicular to the building front face and is placed where it is visible from the street on which the building\nfronts. Additional attached signage is allowed for uses located on upper floors. For separate uses located on upper floors of buildings having only one\ntenant at the street level, one separate sign (per premises), each with a maximum area of nine (9) square feet is allowed.\nFor other multitenant buildings, separate retail or office uses facing along a street at the street pedestrian level shall be treated as if they were\nseparate buildings for the purpose of calculating attached sign area; and, for other uses in the same building (ground floor uses not fronting along a\nstreet and upper or basement floor uses), a single common tenant directory sign may be allowed on each facade containing a separate or common\nentrance leading to such use. Such directory sign shall not exceed twenty-four (24) square feet or nine (9) square feet for each tenant accessed by the\nentrance, whichever is less. The use of plastic or vinyl sign faces, sandblasted sign, and/or \"sign foam\" faces and lettering is strongly discouraged,\nthough not categorically disallowed.\n5.\nProperty owners shall be allowed to attach to the ground floor facade, a bulletin board not exceeding nine (9) square feet in size, upon which\ncommunity notices, flyers, brochures, etc., may be attached. Such bulletin board may not contain any permanent advertising material or verbiage.\nSuch bulletin boards may not be framed with or constructed from plastic or unfinished metal. The owner of such bulletin boards shall be responsible\nfor controlling who may attach community notices, flyers, or brochures thereto.\n6.\nabout:blank\n273/294\n"}, {"page": "274", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nSign proposals shall be evaluated and approved upon a finding that:\na.

Other Sign Considerations.\n1. Signs should be framed in stone, brick, wood, or ornamental metal. Vinyl lettering may be appropriate if attached to windows, but should be avoided\nas a lettering material on constructed sign faces. Constructed sign faces should have painted backgrounds, with contrasting painted letters, and a\npainted border framing the sign face.\n2. The sandblasting of sign panels to provide three-dimensional relief is not an historically accurate sign-making technique, and should be avoided.\nHowever, such signs are generally considered preferable to plastic or vinyl sign faces.\n3. Three-dimensional ornamental metal lettering (bronze, wrought iron, copper, etc.) may be appropriate if directly attached to a building wall. Sheet\nmetal, aluminum, and tin should be discouraged as a lettering material, as should flat metal lettering of any kind.\n4. Signs protruding from a wall should be attached with ornamental metal framing and support hardware.\n(Ord. No. 11-589, \u00a7 1, 6-21-11; Ord.

Advertising Signs (Off-Premise Signs, \"Billboards\" or \"Outdoor Advertising Signs.\") No advertising sign shall be permitted within the city's zoning\njurisdiction, except as provided under Section 12.8M of this Ordinance.\nB. Planned Non-Residential Multitenant Development Off-Premise Directional Signs.\n1. Purpose. In order to maintain the flow of traffic on thoroughfares and to promote vehicular safety, the number of points of ingress and egress on\nthoroughfares is limited. Certain planned non-residential multitenant developments therefore may not be directly accessible and visible by motorists\ntraveling on thoroughfares. The purpose of the regulations is to give notice to the motorist of such developments and to promote the public health,\nwelfare and safety.\n2.

The Planning Commission may, upon application, permit any single or multitenant non-residential development not having direct access to a major or\nminor thoroughfare to have an off-site directional sign. Said directional sign shall be a ground sign, have a maximum size of sixteen (16) square feet, and\nmay be allowed only upon the findings by the Planning Commission that one or more of the following factors create a situation whereby without said sign\nit will be difficult for the business located on a local or collector street to be identified from a major or minor thoroughfare:\n1. The property location;\n2. The finish elevation of said property; or\n3. Other factors that are unique to the property.\nSaid signs shall be set back at least ten (10) feet from the street right-of-way and be located outside of required site triangles. In no case shall an off-site\ndirectional sign be allowed within a residential zoning district (except RLD). Where said directional signs are permitted, the maximum size of any\nfreestanding, onsite sign, shall be reduced by the amount of each off-site monument sign permitted. Said reductions shall apply to existing or proposed\nonsite identification signs. Included in the application submission, the owner/developer must indicate in writing that he is in agreement with said sign\nproposal including the reduction of the maximum allowance for the identification sign. The application shall also include permission from the property\nowner where the off-site directional sign is located.\nD. Off-Premises Residential Directional Monument Sign.\n1.\nPurpose and Applicability. Certain residential developments may not be directly accessible and visible by motorists traveling on thoroughfares. The\npurpose of this section is to provide for directional signage from a nearby thoroughfare during marketing of such developments in a manner that\npromotes the public safety, health and welfare while ensuring compatibility with surrounding land uses. In order for the Zoning Administrator to\nevaluate a proposed off-premises residential directional monument sign under the standards established herein the applicant shall provide drawings\nto scale of the plans and specifications of the sign to be erected. Such plans shall include, but not be limited to, details of the location, design,\ndimensions and material of the proposed sign, as well as proposed landscaping, if any is associated with the sign structure and location. Subject to all\nstandards and requirements established herein, eligible signs may be placed in any commercial, office or industrial zoning district. Signs proposed\neither within a residential district or on a property immediately adjacent to a residential district shall require the issuance of a conditional use permit\naccording to the procedures provided for such permits in Article IX of this Chapter.\n2. Only developments that meet the following qualification, placement and design requirements are eligible for an off-premises residential directional\nmonument sign.\n3. Qualification Requirements.\na. Residential developments of greater than two hundred fifty (250) dwelling units that do not have direct access to an existing thoroughfare (as\ndesignated on the most recently adopted version of the Official Gaston Urban Area Thoroughfare Plan) may be eligible for a maximum of one sign\nsubject to all standards established herein.

The zoning administrator shall have the authority to designate certain signs as historic signs based on the criteria stated below. An existing historic sign\nmay be allowed to remain and a previously existing historic sign may be reconstructed, without counting towards the total sign square footage allowed for\na property, when the following conditions are met.\n1. The sign was erected at prior to 12/21/74; and\n2. The sign will comply with the appropriate provisions of the North Carolina State Building and Electrical Codes; and\n3. The sign is an on-premise sign; and\n4. The sign is part of a building or property renovation endorsed by the State Historic Preservation Office, the sign exhibits unique or rare characteristics\nthat enhance the building, streetscape, or the community at large, or the sign is an historic, mural type wall sign painted on the side of a building; and\n5. The historic nature of the sign is documented to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator.\nB.\nabout:blank\n276/294\n"}, {"page": "277", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nAn historic sign shall be maintained in its original condition, shape and size, except for minor changes required for structural enhancements or changes required to\ncomply with minimum electrical or building codes, or to remove portions from a public right-of-way. Where original materials are unavailable, substitute materials,\nwhich are as near as possible to the original, may be used.\nC. Once designated as an historic sign, the sign shall be deemed to be in compliance with the zoning regulations of this Chapter, however, designation as an\nhistoric sign does not prevent the zoning administrator from enforcing other, applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. If the sign is moved on the\npremises, it shall be subject to the location standards of this Chapter.\nD. Any appeal of the Zoning Administrator's decision to designate a sign as historic shall be heard by the Board of Adjustment, where the burden of proof is\non the applicant to show how the criteria are met.\nSECTION 12.14 - SIGN FLEXIBILITY OPTIONS\nA. This Section contains provisions for sign bonus options, allowing greater sign area when specifications are met. The provisions of this Section apply to all\nzoning districts unless noted.\n1. The aggregate area of all wall signs per premises may be increased based on the distance the principle building is set back from the required front\nsetback line. Said increase shall be in accordance with the following table:\nB. Where a freestanding sign is not used and/or permitted, a projecting sign may be substituted for part or all of the allowable wall signage per premises. A\nprojecting sign shall not project more than four (4) feet from a building. In no instance shall a projecting sign extend into a street right-of-way, except in\nthe CBD (where such extensions may be permitted subject to approval of the Subdivision Administrator).\nC. Design review alternative.\n1. Purpose. The purpose of this Subsection is to provide functional flexibility, encourage variety, and create an incentive to relate wall signs to basic\nprinciples of good building design. This Subsection promotes the integration of signage and building facades and rewards design innovation and\ncreativity. The goal is to create a better product, than would typically be provided through strict adherence to the signage requirements, by offering a\nvoluntary procedure for building design review. This option encourages wall signage that is context sensitive to the building on which it is placed.\nIn order to provide such signage flexibility and incentives for well designed buildings, provisions are hereby made to allow a review committee to\napprove an increase in wall sign square footage where external building features create an attractive wall face, reducing the negative impacts of larger\nsigns. Such determination shall be made through a voluntary building design review submittal. Said flexibility shall be available for structures within\ncommercial and industrial zoning districts. Applicants are required to have a consultation with Planning Department staff before submitting a\nproposal for increased wall sign size.\n2. Process. All submittals shall be reviewed and approved by a three- to seven-person committee consisting of the zoning administrator, the planning\ndirector or his designee, and such additional staff as the City Manager may designate. The committee shall meet not more than ten (10) working days\nafter submittal or re-submittal of a sign proposal. Actions of this committee may be as follows: approval of the sign as submitted, or rejection of the\nproposal with recommendations for design changes that would elicit favorable consideration upon re-submittal. Such actions shall also govern re-\nsubmittals. Appeals of any decision made by the committee shall be made to the Planning Commission at the first meeting following a 30-day period\nabout:blank\n277/294\nCELL (1, 1): \nPrincipal Building Distance Setback From the Required Front Setback\nCELL (1, 2): \nAllowed Aggregate Wall Sign Area Increase (Percent)\nCELL (2, 1): \n0-49 feet\nCELL (2, 2): \n0\nCELL (3, 1): \n50-99 feet\nCELL (3, 2): \n25\nCELL (4, 1): \n100-149 feet\nCELL (4, 2): \n50\nCELL (5, 1): \n150-199 feet\nCELL (5, 2): \n75\nCELL (6, 1): \n200-249 feet\nCELL (6, 2): \n100\nCELL (7, 1): \n250-299 feet\nCELL (7, 2): \n125\nCELL (8, 1): \n300-349 feet\nCELL (8, 2): \n150\nCELL (9, 1): \n350-399 feet\nCELL (9, 2): \n175\nCELL (10, 1): \n400 feet or more\nCELL (10, 2): \n200\n"}, {"page": "278", "text": "6/26/23, 9:17 AM\nGastonia, NC Unified Development Ordinance\nafter the committee decision.

The decision of the Planning Commission is appealable only to the\nsuperior court by writ of certiorari.\n3. Submittal. Applicants must submit, at a minimum, a detailed scale drawing of all building facade(s) including proposed building materials, colors to be\nused, and applicable dimensions (roof overhand and/or roof slope, wall height, etc.). Submittal shall also include sign dimensions, proposed\nplacement on the building, copy, color, sign illumination plans, and all materials that are to be used in sign construction. In addition, committee\nmembers may require the submission of samples of materials proposed, if deemed necessary for proper review and consideration of the application.\n4. Review Criteria. When reviewing applicable building facades in association with wall sign size, the following concepts are encouraged by the committee\nto create context sensitive signage:\na. Building entrances should be articulated (recessed or protruding) from the main facade line sufficient to provide emphasis and variation to the\nbuilding wall. Applicable building facades should have adequate openings (window and/or doors) to break up long expanses of building wall.\nb. Building facades should not include dominating architectural elements that are identified or associated with the particular franchise or chain and\nrepetitive from community to community. Prototype franchise buildings are discouraged, whereas, creative design is encouraged.\nC. The primary external building materials should include one or more of the following: brick, brick veneer, ornamental split-faced concrete block or\nsimilar ornamental concrete masonry unit (CMU), stucco (synthetic or natural), stone or simulated stone/marble. Other materials such as vinyl,\naluminum, and ornamental metals may be used as trim only.\nd.\nThe use of subdued or earth tone colors and shades, such as beige, tan, rust, brown, and green, are encouraged in building facade materials.\nBright colors typically used in franchise architecture are discouraged.\ne. All signs within a particular project should be coordinated in terms of design features and materials.\n5. Approval Procedure. The committee, or Planning Commission upon appeal, may approve an increase in sign square footage for a particular structure\nonly upon making the following findings in the affirmative:\na. The building architecture and materials coordinated with the proposed wall sign to create a context sensitive design solution consistent with the\ngeneral purpose and intent of this subsection;\nb. The proposal will provide needed sign visibility to motorists and pedestrians visiting the facility;\nC. The proposal will enhance the aesthetics of the development and surrounding area and will not substantially injure the value of adjoining\nproperties (as measured against the non use of the design review alternative);\nd. The proposal will not be detrimental to the public's health, safety, or welfare.\ne. Increases allowed by the design review alternative may be combined with those allowed in paragraph A but may not be combined with those\nallowed by the planned development flexibility option.\nD. Special Exception for Commercial Markers. In addition to any other signs allowed by this Chapter, the Planning Commission may approve a freestanding\nmarker that incorporates a corporate logo in office and commercial districts (except CBD) after making certain findings. Only one marker shall be allowed\nper unified development. The Planning Commission shall conduct a design review to evaluate the aesthetics of the proposed marker, compatibility with\nthe site, location on the property, and how much signage is actually gained for the business. The Planning Commission shall approve a commercial marker\nonly after making the following findings in the affirmative:\n1. The marker is primarily made of natural materials, such as stone, brick, or wrought iron, and uses subdued colors to make the marker non-obtrusive.\nIf the marker is a sculpture or other piece of art, metals may be used provided the glare from such marker does not endanger motorists or shine into\nadjoining residential areas.\n2. The corporate logo or sign copy for business identification does not exceed ten (10) percent of the marker face (area calculated same as for signage).\nThis restriction shall not apply to sculpture or other pieces of art.\n3. The size of the marker and the business identification copy do not result in a significant increase in business signage that would give the business an\nunfair advantage over other nearby businesses, within or outside the multitenant development.\n4. The marker is set back ten (10) feet from the public right-of-way, outside required sight triangles, does not impair any ingress or egress, and does not\nfit under any of the categories of prohibited signs (i.e., Section 12-3).\n5. The lot containing the marker is not directly across a public street (excluding thoroughfares) from a residentially zoned lot.\nThe decision of the Planning Commission is appealable only to the superior court by writ of certiorari.\n(Ord.
