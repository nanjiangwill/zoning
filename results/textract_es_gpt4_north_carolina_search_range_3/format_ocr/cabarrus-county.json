To a\nlesser degree, these are also those lands which are conducive to providing recreationally\noriented open space. These land areas should remain the farmland and undeveloped/forested\nland of the County. Public utilities will not be planned for these areas. Consequently, residential\nuses that support those working and/or owning the land, home occupations allied with existing\nresidences, and very limited business endeavors are envisioned as complementary to the area.\nIn sum, the primary activity of these lands is agricultural - housing and business are typically\nrelated to, and supportive of, the practice of modern day agriculture. It is not, however,\nimprobable that a small hamlet type settlement might evolve in this zoning district. As to those\nareas constituting open space, manmade uses must take care to enhance and not detract from\nthe essential character of the area.\nRationale\nCabarrus County, due largely to its proximity to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg metropolitan area,\nis in a growth mode which will, in all probability, continue. While the issue of farmland\npreservation may ultimately be more driven by market economics, it still behooves policy\nmakers to prudently attempt farmland preservation.

For example, an area may be zoned General Industrial,\none of the basic zoning districts. Generally speaking, all of the rules and regulations of this zone,\nthe General Industrial Zone, apply to any land use within the zone. Because the area also has a\nmajor road running through it, it may also be partially within the Thoroughfare Overlay zone\n(TOZ). This additional zone is \"overlaid\" upon the top of the underlying General Industrial zone\nand its rules and regulations must also be observed. Using overlay zones on top of basic zoning\ndistricts helps to customize the actual land use.

These standards allow for variety in housing\ntypes while maintaining the overall character of neighborhoods and commercial areas of the\nCounty. Development standards are based on the County's suburban and rural planning tiers.\nSeparate standards are established to regulate development in each residential district. This\napproach to district development standards and planning tiers has several public benefits:\n1. It allows for development that is more sensitive to the environment and allows for the\npreservation of open and natural areas.\n2. It promotes quality site layout and energy-efficient development.\n3. It promotes affordable and life-cycle housing.\n4. It promotes development intensities that match existing and proposed infrastructure\ninvestments.\nSection 5-2 How to use this Chapter\nThis Chapter is divided into the following parts:\nChapter 5 Page 1 of 21\nAmended 01/18/2022\nCELL (1, 1): \nPART I.

They require additional regulations to ensure their compatibility\nwith other permitted development and often, require large land areas. These uses are such\nthat their effects on the surrounding environment cannot be fully determined in advance of\ntheir being proposed for a specific area. The review and approval process is intended to\nmitigate the impacts of the proposed special use as it relates to the surrounding area.\nSection 8-2 How to use this chapter\nSpecial uses are set forth below. At the beginning of each section is a statement showing which\nzoning districts allow the special use. Specific standards that must be met to permit the use are\nthen listed. While all special uses require submittal of a site plan meeting the established\ngeneral standards of the ordinance (described in Chapter Twelve), some require that additional\ninformation be shown on the site plan or that additional information be submitted as part of\nthe application.\nSection 8-3 Petitioning for a Special Use\nBecause of their potential for affecting neighboring landowners, special uses warrant review in\na public forum. The Planning and Zoning Commission, acting as Board of Adjustment, hears the\nrequest for a special use permit. A simple majority vote by the Commission members present\nand not excused from voting is required for the issuance of a special use permit. If a special use\npermit request is denied by the Board of Adjustment, the applicant may appeal the decision to\nthe Superior Court of Cabarrus County, North Carolina.\nIn general, the process for seeking a special use permit is as follows (Please see Chapter 12 for\nmore details regarding the special use permit process):\nStep 1 Prior to filing a Special Use Permit Application, the Applicant is required to attend a pre-\napplication meeting with Planning and Development Staff. At that time, the proposed project\nwill be discussed and required submittal materials will be determined. Examples of items that\nmay be required, in addition to a complete application and site plan, include but are not limited\nto:\nTraffic Impact Analysis Documents (See Appendix A)\nIntent to Serve Letters\nNCDOT Driveway Permits\nPost-Construction Stormwater Permits\nSoil and Erosion Control Permits\nStep 2 The applicant is required to hold a neighborhood meeting with adjacent property\nowners to explain the proposed project, display the proposed site plan and to answer questions\nthat the neighbors may have related to the proposal. To the greatest extent possible, the\nChapter 8 Page 1 of 39\nAmended 01/19/2021\n"}, {"page": "181", "text": "CABARRUS COUNTY DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nCHAPTER 8-SPECIAL USES\napplicant is encouraged to incorporate design elements into the project that mitigate impacts\nidentified as part of the neighborhood meeting process. Minutes from the neighborhood\nmeeting shall be included with the application materials.\nStep 3 The Applicant files a complete application with Cabarrus County Planning and\nDevelopment. This includes filing the required number of copies of the proposed site plan and\nany other materials required for the application to be considered complete, as determined\nduring the pre-application meeting (See Step 1).\nStep 4 The project is distributed to review agents and comments are returned by Staff to the\nApplicant regarding changes or revisions needed to the proposed plan and/or application\nmaterials.\nStep 5 When revisions are submitted, approved, and the plan and application materials\nconform to the applicable ordinances, the revised complete application is presented to the\nPlanning and Zoning Commission, acting as Board of Adjustment, for consideration.\nApplications for a Special Use must demonstrate compliance with the general standards of\nreview. Additionally, Special Uses must:\na. Maintain or enhance the public health, safety and general welfare\nb. Maintain or enhance the value of contiguous property (unless the use is a public\nnecessity, in which case the use need not do so);\nC. Assure the adequacy of:\nWaste water disposal\nSolid waste management\nOn site drinking water and waste water disposal\nGovernmental water and sewer (if applicable)\nPolice, Fire and-Emergency Medical Services protection\nSchool adequacy (if applicable)\nTransportation systems (in and around the site) and\nOther public facilities\nd. Comply with the general plans for the physical development of the County as embodied\nin these regulations\nSpecial conditions arrived at by the Planning and Zoning Commission\nWhen the Commission finds that circumstances relating to a particular use warrant more\nrequirements, in addition to those listed in connection with the use, the Commission may\nimpose reasonable and appropriate safeguards upon the special use permit. Where\nappropriate, such conditions may include requirements that street and utility rights-of-way be\ndedicated to the public and that provision be made for recreational space and facilities.\nTo summarize, special uses are subject to both general and specific requirements, rather than\nbeing automatically permitted.

As a result, much of the existing\nnatural landscape could be destroyed in the development process. Landscaping requirements\nprovide balance against this loss.\nScreening between incompatible adjacent land uses\nZoning regulations were once based on a strict separation of land uses. Today, that is no longer\nthe case. Greater freedom in the use of property and privacy for landowners is accomplished\nby adding a buffer between land uses that includes vegetation, land forms or distance.\nErosion control and water pollution\nTrees and plants reduce erosion by binding soil particles with their roots and holding soils\ntogether against the effects of wind and water. When development occurs and impervious\nsurfaces are created, the flow of water across exposed soils can greatly increase, causing water\npollution. The installation of vegetation can slow runoff by acting as a sponge, resulting in less\nwater pollution and stream bed damage.\nModification of the climate in the immediate vicinity\nLandscaping helps improve air quality and moderate temperatures by absorbing pollution,\nproviding shade and offering protection from the wind. In addition, trees, grass, leaves, shrubs,\neven twigs and branches, can absorb and disperse sound energy, reducing overall noise levels.\nAesthetics\nWithout the softening effect of trees and shrubs, the built environment appears harsh and\nuninviting.\nCumulatively, the purpose of these requirements is to provide standards that will protect the\nhealth, safety and general welfare of the public, enhance property values, improve the\nappearance of the community, and preserve natural resources, such as trees and native plants.\nHOW TO USE THIS CHAPTER\nPART I APPLICABILITY OF LANDSCAPE BUFFER YARD STANDARDS AND TERMS\nPART II PERIMETER LANDSCAPE BUFFER YARD AREAS\nPart III LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS FOR PARKING AREAS AND STREET YARDS\nPART IV LANDSCAPE PLANS\nPART V APPROVED PLANT LIST\nPART I APPLICABILITY OF LANDSCAPE BUFFER STANDARDS AND TERMS\nSECTION 9-1 APPLICABILITY\nChapter 9 Page 1 of 15\nAmended 01/19/2021\n"}, {"page": "220", "text": "CABARRUS COUNTY DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nCHAPTER 9-LANDSCAPE AND BUFFERING\nLandscaping requirements shall apply to all developing uses and are a condition of\ndevelopment permit approval.

Traffic Impact Analysis\nTransportation impacts, and how to mitigate them, are an important consideration for the\ncommunity when development is proposed. Public policy makers, citizens and developers all\nhave a stake in understanding and responding to additional demands on the transportation\nsystem. A Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) is a tool used to evaluate the incremental\nimpacts on the surrounding transportation infrastructure and how to mitigate them to maintain\nsafe traffic and transportation operations.\nA.\nApplicability\n1.

A TIA shall be required for any nonresidential or mixed use development estimated\nto produce 3,000 vehicles per day or greater and/or 150 total trips both entering\nand exiting the site during either the AM or PM peak hours during an average\nweekday based on a five day national average as defined in the ITE Trip Generation\nManual.\n4. A TIA may also be required for proposed access within 1,000 feet of an interchange,\nin the vicinity of a high accident location, on a major arterial roadway, when\ninvolvement with an existing or proposed median crossover is necessary, when the\nproject includes highway improvements that are in the Transportation Improvement\nProgram, when involvement with an active roadway construction project is\nnecessary or at the discretion of the NCDOT District Engineer.\n5.\nA TIA or Technical Memorandum may also be required based on special\ncircumstances associated with the proposed development, even if the number of\ngross trips falls below the above stated thresholds. This includes when:\na. Traffic is being generated from a non-residential development that\ncould potentially impact adjacent residential neighborhoods.\nb. Traffic operation issues for current and/or future years on nearby roads\nis expected to be worsened by traffic generated from the new\ndevelopment.\nC.\nTraffic near the site is experiencing significant or unacceptable delays.\nd. The proposed land use differs from the proposed land use classification\nin the Land Use Plan.\ne. The existing street or access system is not anticipated to accommodate\nthe expected traffic generation.\nf.\nThe proposed development includes a drive-through facility, or other\nuses, such as schools, that require significant on site circulation that\nmay have off-site impacts to adjoining roads and/or intersections.\ng. The amount, behavior or assignment of traffic is different from a\npreviously approved TIA for the same property.\nThe need for a TIA may be waived when Cabarrus County and NCDOT agree a TIA is not needed.\nIn the event a waiver is requested, the applicant must provide evidence to show that a waiver is\nappropriate.

It also explains the concept of Conditional District rezoning, a form of\nrezoning which changes a zoning classification from one to another but limits the number of\nuses in the newly proposed zone and requires that a site specific development plan be filed\nwith the application. This is in contrast to a conventional rezoning, which changes from one\ngeneral zoning classification to another and includes all of the uses permitted in the district, as\nlong as the proper permits can be issued.\nSection 13-2 How to use this Chapter\nSection 13-3 Definitions\nGeneral Zoning District-Any of the basic zoning districts created by Chapter Three of this\nOrdinance.\nSite Specific Development Plan- A site specific development plan showing the design, layout\nand configuration of the site, including existing and proposed conditions. See Chapter 12, Major\nSite Development Plans. This plan is used when affixing Conditional District zoning status to a\nproperty.\nConditional District (CD District)-Considered a \"floating\" zoning district.

At this meeting, staff will discuss the proposed rezoning with the\nPetitioner along with information related to the rezoning process, water and sewer availability,\napplicable land use plans, established deadlines for submittal and the format used for the\nPlanning and Zoning Commission meetings. Design Professionals working on the project with\nthe Petitioner should also attend this meeting as staff will go into detail about the submittal\nrequirements and materials needed for the application to be considered complete.\nStep 2 Neighborhood Meeting\nThe applicant is required to hold a neighborhood meeting with adjacent property owners to\nexplain the proposed project, display the proposed site plan (if applicable) and to answer\nquestions that the neighbors may have related to the proposal. The applicant is encouraged to\nincorporate design elements into the project that mitigate impacts and concerns identified\nduring neighborhood meeting process.

While passage of the law or its modification seems to be the direct\ncause of the nonconformity, the change in the law is a result of changing development patterns\ncommunity wide. While the use may have been appropriate in the past, development has\noccurred about it which makes the use seem out of character for the area.\nDiffering views on nonconformities\nNonconformities have been viewed in several different ways. One view is that, over time,\nnonconformities must be eliminated. One of the primary drawbacks to this approach is that a\nlocal government forcing cessation of a nonconformity (called \"amortizing\") could be liable for\na monetary amount to the nonconformity owner. Another view of nonconformities, the\n\"property rights' view\", sees them as deserving of full protection and immunity. This Ordinance\nadopts a more moderate view of nonconformities. Essentially, nonconformities will continue to\nbe phased out but only when their phasing out is a result of destruction, regardless of cause, or\ncessation of operation. Nonconformities will have no limitation on maintenance and repair\nactivity but, prior to expansion or alteration, must successfully obtain a Certificate of\nNonconformity Adjustment. The Certificate basically helps bring the nonconformity into\nconformity or so significantly adjusts any negative effects as to render it harmless.\nSection 14-2 How to use this chapter\nDifferent types of nonconformities are outlined in the following sections of this chapter.\nSection 14-3 Definitions of terms frequently used in this Chapter\nASSESSED VALUE- The current monetary amount on file for any piece of property in the Office\nof the Cabarrus County Tax Assessor.\nCERTIFICATE OF NONCONFORMITY ADJUSTMENT Certification issued by the Zoning\nAdministrator of Cabarrus County attesting to the fact that a nonconformity is being modified\nand causes no harm to either neighboring landowners or the community at large.\nCOMBINE- To create one lot by combining two or more lots usually with common ownership to\nmeet development standards.\nLOT OF RECORD-A lot which exists as shown or described on a plat or deed in the records of the\nlocal register of deeds and in Cabarrus County's GIS land records.\nNONCONFORMING LOT- A lot which was lawfully created prior to the adoption of this\nOrdinance but which does not conform to the dimensional requirements for lots in its zoning\ndistrict.\nChapter 14 Page 1 of 8\nAmended 01/19/2021\n"}, {"page": "301", "text": "CABARRUS COUNTY ZONING ORDINANCE\nCHAPTER 14-NONCONFORMITIES\nNONCONFORMITY- A use of land, buildings or structures or combination thereof that was\nlawfully established prior to the adoption of this Ordinance but does not conform with the\nTable of Permitted Uses set forth in Chapter Three or other requirements of this Ordinance.\nNONCONFORMING FEATURE- A physical feature or characteristic of a use, building or structure\nor other development of land established prior to the adoption of this Ordinance that does not\ncomply with the current standards of the Ordinance.\nPREMISES- A lot, parcel, tract or plot of land together with any buildings and structures\nthereon.\nSTRUCTURE- Anything constructed or erected which requires location on or in the ground or is\nattached to something having a location on the ground or anything as defined by the Building\nCode.\nSection 14-4 Intention\nThe intent of this Ordinance with regard to nonconformities is threefold:\nA. to not arbitrarily require the cessation of all nonconformities but instead, provide a\nprocess whereby owners/operators of negligible nonconformities can possibly continue\nto use and operate including expansions and alterations after review by the Zoning\nAdministrator;\nB. to encourage the cessation (stopping) of those nonconformities, the negative effects of\nwhich cannot otherwise be mitigated; and,\nC. to phase out those nonconformities which must be eliminated in such a manner as to\navoid unjust economic hardship for their owners.\nSection 14-5 Nonconforming land, lots, divisions of land and existing structures\nChapter 14 Page 2 of 8\nAmended 01/19/2021\nCELL (1, 1): \nA.\nCELL (1, 2): \nSubdivision\nCELL (2, 1): \nCELL (2, 2): \nNonconforming land may not be subdivided except for purposes and in a manner\nconforming to district regulations.\nCELL (3, 1): \nB.\nCELL (3, 2): \nUse of single nonconforming lot\nAny lot of record which is nonconforming may become the site of any use permitted\nwithin its zoning district as long as it can meet setback requirements and all other\nrelated development requirements.\n"}, {"page": "302", "text": "CABARRUS COUNTY DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE\nCHAPTER 14-NONCONFORMITIES\nC.\nLots made nonconforming as a result of public taking or court order\nIf a lot becomes nonconforming through no fault of the owner, for example, as a result\nof losing square footage by public taking or court order, while still recognized as\nnonconforming, it may be used and developed in accordance with the design standards\nof its district nor will it be required to be combined.\nD.\nExisting lots of record in the AO, CR or LDR zoning districts\nExisting lots of record located in the AO, CR or LDR zoning districts that do not meet the\ndimensional standards for required lot area or required average lot width as established\nin Chapter 5, District Development Standards, Section 5-5, Conventional Subdivision\nStandards, B.

It is an essential\npart of the development review process to assist developers and local government\nagencies in making land use decisions involving annexations, subdivisions, rezoning\nrequests, special land uses, and other development reviews. The TIA helps identify\nwhere the development may have a significant impact on safety, traffic and\ntransportation operations and provides a means for the developer and the government\nagencies to mitigate these impacts. Ultimately, the TIA can be used to evaluate if the\nscale of the development is appropriate for a particular site and what improvements\nmay be necessary, on and off the site, to provide safe and efficient access and traffic\nflow. Mitigation measures may involve strategies other than roadway construction or\nother physical improvements such as changes to traffic signal timing or phasing and\ntransportation management strategies.\nA.\nApplicability\n1. A traffic impact analysis (TIA) shall be required for any conditional use\nrezoning, conditional use permit, preliminary plat, site plan or zoning\ncompliance permit application or request estimated to produce 2,000\nvehicles per day or greater and/or 100 total trips both entering and exiting\nthe site during either the AM or PM peak hours during an average weekday\nbased on a five day national average as defined in the Institute of\nTransportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual.\n2.
