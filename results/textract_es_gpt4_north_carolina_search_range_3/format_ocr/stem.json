Purpose\nConditional Zoning Districts are zoning districts in which the development and use of the property\nis subject to predetermined standards and rules, regulations, or other conditions imposed as part of\nthe legislative decision creating the district and applying it to the particular property. A conditional\nzoning district allows particular uses to be established only in accordance with specific standards\nand conditions pertaining to each individual development project. Some land uses are of such a\nnature or scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediate surrounding area and on\nthe entire community, which cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district standards.\nThere are also circumstances in which a general district designation allowing such a use by right\nwould not be appropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could, if properly\nplanned, be appropriate for the property consistent with the objectives of these regulations, the\nadopted comprehensive plan, and adopted district and area plans.\nB. There are two types of Conditional Zoning Districts available:\n1) Conditional Zoning District Type 1\na)\nIs defined as a conditional zoning district created as a stand-alone district with its\nown unique conditions.

Purpose\n1) In accordance with Objective 2A of the Town of Stem Town Plan 2040, the purposes of\nthis design philosophy is to provide flexibility in the design of residential development, as\nfollows:\n2) To conserve open land, including those areas containing unique and sensitive natural\nfeatures such as woodlands, wildlife corridors, streams, floodplains and wetlands, by\nsetting them aside from development;\n3) To provide greater design flexibility and efficiency in the siting of services and\ninfrastructure, including the opportunity to reduce length of roads, utility runs, and the\namount of paving required for residential development;\n4) To reduce erosion and sedimentation by the retention of existing vegetation;\n5)\nTo implement adopted municipal policies to conserve a variety of irreplaceable and\nenvironmentally sensitive resource lands, including provisions for reasonable incentives to\ncreate a greenway and/or open space system for the benefit of present and future residents;\n6) To implement adopted land use, transportation, and community policies, as identified in\nthe Town's Comprehensive plan;\n7)\nTo protect areas of the Town for continued or future agricultural use, by conserving blocks\nof land large enough to allow for efficient farm operations;\n8) To create neighborhoods with direct visual access to open land, with amenities in the form\nof neighborhood open space and create an interconnected trail network within the Town's\nzoning limits.\n9) To provide for the conservation and maintenance of open land within the Town to achieve\nthe above-mentioned goals and for active or passive recreational use by residents;\n10) To provide multiple options for landowners in order to minimize impacts on environmental\nresources (sensitive lands such as wetlands, floodplain, and) and disturbance of natural or\ncultural features;\n11) To provide standards reflecting the varying circumstances and interests of individual\nlandowners, and the individual characteristics of their properties; and\n12) To conserve scenic views and elements of the municipality's rural character, and to\nminimize perceived density, by minimizing views of new development from existing roads.\n"}, {"page": "32", "text": "B. In order to achieve these purposes, this Section provides for flexibility in designing new\nresidential subdivisions by allowing two forms of \"by-right\" development referred to as\n\"options\", as summarized below:\n1) Option One: Basic Conservation, providing for residential uses at the density permitted by\nthe underlying zoning. One dwelling unit per acre and not exceeding twelve percent (12%)\nbuilt-upon area for the entire development project. This option shall be allowable for all\nresidential development of five (5) acres or fewer.\n2) Option Two: Enhanced Density with Greater Conservation, providing for higher density\nresidential uses. A maximum of two dwelling units per acre not exceeding twenty-four\npercent (24%) built-upon area for the entire development project. This option shall be\nallowable for all residential development, and required for all residential development of\nmore than five (5) acres.\nC. General Regulations\nThe design of all new subdivisions in areas designated R1 or R2 shall be governed by the\nfollowing minimum standards:\n1) Ownership: The tract of land may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple\nownership. However, when a tract is held in multiple ownership, the application must be\nsigned by all owners and the proposed development shall be subject to a common plan\nof\ndevelopment with standards which apply to all land within the district.\n2) Site Suitability: As evidenced by the conceptual Preliminary Plan, and the detailed Final\nPlan, the tract incorporating this design option shall be suitable for supporting development\nin terms of environmental conditions, size, and configuration.\n3) Intersections and Access: New intersections with existing public roads shall be minimized.\nAlthough two access ways into and out of subdivisions containing more than 15 (fifteen)\ndwellings are generally required for safety, proposals for more than two entrances onto\npublic roads shall be discouraged if they would unnecessarily disrupt traffic flow.\n4) Sensitive Area Disturbance: The proposed design shall strictly minimize disturbance of\nenvironmentally sensitive areas, as shown on the Preliminary Plan. Lands within the 100-\nyear floodplain, wetlands, and surface waters constitute such environmentally sensitive\nareas, where disturbance shall be strictly minimized. Demonstration by the applicant that\nthese features will be protected by the proposed application shall be prerequisite to\napproval of both the conceptual Preliminary Plan and the detailed Final Plan.\nD.

The\nboard of adjustment may reduce the number of spaces required upon finding that\nsufficient parking is available to accommodate each use during peak demand.\nb)\nWhere seating capacity is the standard for determining space requirements, it shall\nbe determined by the number of seating units (i.e. chairs), or each 18 lineal inches of\nbenches or pews. When the number of employees is the standard, it shall be based on\nmaximum shift.\nc)\nWhen the total computed for required off-street parking or loading spaces results in\na fraction equal to or greater than one-half, the next higher whole number shall be\nrequired.\n3) Buffer and Screening: In addition to the standards of Section 5.05, a 5-foot buffer strip\nshall separate all vehicular use areas from the right-of-way and any abutting property line\nexcept at permitted points of access.\n4) Construction and Maintenance:\na)\nAll vehicular use areas shall be paved with a permanent, all-weather surface (i.e.\nasphalt, concrete, stone) and maintained to minimize nuisance from dust and loose\ndebris.
