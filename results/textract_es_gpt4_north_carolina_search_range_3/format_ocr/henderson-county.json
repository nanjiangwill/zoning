Conditional Zoning Districts\n42-45. Conditional Zoning Districts Established\nConditional Zoning Districts are created for the purpose of providing an optional rezoning choice\nwhere the owner of property proposes to rezone property and, in order to, among other reasons,\ncarry out the purposes of the Comprehensive Plan, proposes to impose special limitations and\nconditions on the use of the property proposed for rezoning.\nConditional Zoning Districts are zoning districts in which the development and use of the property is\nsubject to predetermined Chapter standards and the rules, regulations, and conditions imposed as\npart of the legislative decision creating the district and applying it to each individual development\nproject.\nA. Dimensional and Use Requirements. Each use proposed in a petition for a Conditional Zoning\nDistrict shall, at a minimum, conform to the following dimensional and use requirements. In some\ncases, a specific use may be required to meet the Supplemental Requirements as set forth in\n42-62 (Supplemental Requirements).\n(1) Dimensional requirements for single and multifamily residential uses shall be the same as those\nfound in the R1 District.\n(2) If the subject area, or any portion thereof, is zoned R1, R2, R2R, R3, R4, R-40, WR or SW, then no\nconditional zoning shall be allowed to add additional uses beyond those otherwise allowed in the\narea as zoned. Dimensional requirements for non-residential uses shall be the same as those found\nin the LC District.\nB. General Provisions.\n(1)Site Plan. Major Site Plan required in accordance with 42-330 (Major Site Plan Review).\n(2)All CD districts shall adhere to a site-specific vesting plan.\nPage 29 of 319\n"}, {"page": "30", "text": "Chapter 42 - Land Development Code\nHENDERSON\nCOUNTY\nPublished on Henderson County North Carolina (https://www.hendersoncountync.gov)\n(3)Neighborhood Compatibility Meetings. A neighborhood compatibility meeting is required. See\n42-372. Neighborhood Compatibility Meeting.\nCertain types of zoning districts would be inappropriate at certain locations in the absence of special\nconditions. Some land uses are of a nature or scale that may have significant impacts on both the\nimmediately surrounding area and the entire community, which cannot be predetermined or\ncontrolled by general district standards. There are also circumstances in which a general use district\ndesignation allowing such a use by right would not be appropriate for a particular property though\nthe use could, if properly planned, be appropriate for the property consistent with the objectives of\nthese regulations, the adopted Comprehensive Plan, and adopted district. The review process\nestablished in this section provides for the accommodation of such uses by a reclassification of\nproperty into a conditional zoning district, subject to specific conditions, which ensure compatibility\nof the use with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties.\nWhere the applicant for rezoning desires property to be rezoned to such a district in such situations,\nthe Conditional Zoning District is a means by which such special conditions can be imposed in the\nfurtherance of the purpose of this Chapter and the recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan.\nThe Conditional Zoning District classification will be considered for rezoning only with the consent of\nthe property owner. If, for any reason, any condition imposed pursuant to these regulations is found\nto be illegal or invalid or if the applicant should fail to accept any condition, it is the intent of this\nChapter that the authorization of such Conditional Zoning District shall be null and void and of no\neffect and that proceedings shall be instituted to rezone the property to its previous zoning\nclassification.\n42-46. Plans and Other Information to Accompany Petition\nProperty may be rezoned to a Conditional Zoning District only in response to, and consistent with, a\npetition submitted by the owners of all of the property to be included in the district. A petition for\nconditional zoning must include a site plan, drawn to scale, and supporting information and text that\nspecifies the actual use or uses intended for the property and any rules, regulations and conditions\nthat, in addition to all predetermined requirements, will govern the development and use of the\nproperty.\n42-47. Approval of Conditional Zoning District\nConditional Zoning District decisions are a legislative process subject to judicial review using the\nsame procedures and standard of review as applicable to general use district zoning decisions.\nConditional Zoning District decisions shall be made in consideration of identified relevant adopted\nland use plans for the area, including, but not limited to, the Comprehensive Plan, strategic plans,\ndistrict plans, community plans, neighborhood plans, corridor plans, and other land-use policy\ndocuments.\n42-48. Conditions to Approval of Petition\nIn approving a petition for the reclassification of property to a Conditional Zoning District, the\nPlanning Board may recommend, and the Board of Commissioners may request that reasonable and\nappropriate conditions be attached to the approval of the petition. Conditions and site-specific\nstandards shall be limited to those that address the conformance of the development and use of the\nsite to County ordinances and any officially adopted Comprehensive Plan or other land use plan, that\naddress the impacts reasonably expected to be generated by the development or use of the site.\nAny such conditions should relate to the impact of the proposed use on surrounding property,\nsupport facilities (such as parking areas and driveways), pedestrian and vehicular circulation\nsystems, screening and buffering areas, timing of development, road and right-of-way\nPage 30 of 319\n"}, {"page": "31", "text": "Chapter 42 - Land Development Code\nCOUNTY\nHENDERSON\nPublished on Henderson County North Carolina (https://www.hendersoncountync.gov)\nimprovements, water and sewer improvements, stormwater drainage, provision of open space, and\nother matters that the Commissioners may find appropriate or the applicant may propose. Such\nconditions to approval of the petition may include dedication to the County, State or other public\nentity, as appropriate, of any rights-of-way or easements for roads, water, sewer, or other public\nutilities necessary to serve the proposed development. The applicant shall have a reasonable\nopportunity to consider and respond to any such conditions prior to final action by the Board of\nCommissioners. Only those conditions mutually approved by the Board of Commissioners and the\napplicant may be incorporated into the petition through written consent.\n42-49. Effect of Approval\nIf a petition for conditional zoning is approved, the development and use of the property shall be\ngoverned by the existing Chapter requirements applicable to the special requirements for approved\nuse or uses, the approved site plan for the district, and any additional approved rules, regulations,\nand conditions, all of which shall constitute zoning regulations for the approved district and are\nbinding on the property as an amendment to these regulations and to the Official Zoning Map.\nOnly those uses and structures indicated in the approved petition and site plan shall be allowed on\nthe subject property. A change of location of the structures may be authorized pursuant to 42-50\n(Alterations to Approval). Changes to the site plan layout shall not increase the number of structures.\nFollowing the approval of the petition for a Conditional Zoning District, the subject property shall be\nidentified on the Official Zoning Map by the appropriate district designation. A conditional zoning\nshall be identified by the letters \"CD\" then followed by the calendar year and application number\n(for example \"CD-2019-01\"). Approved conditions shall be recorded with the approved site plan in\nthe registered of deeds office\n42-50. Alterations to Approval\nExcept as provided herein, changes to an approved petition or to the conditions attached to the\napproved petition shall be treated the same as minor modifications to these regulations or to the\nOfficial Zoning Map and shall be processed in accordance with the procedures of this Chapter.\nThe Planning Director or designee shall have the delegated authority to approve a minor\nmodification to an approved site plan. The standard for approving or denying such a minor\nmodification shall be that the change does not significantly alter the site plan or its conditions and\nthat the change does not have a significant impact upon abutting properties. Any decision must be in\nwriting stating the grounds for approval or denial.\nFor nonresidential development, an increase in the intensity of the development is limited to ten (10)\npercent of the approved structure size or 1,000 square feet, whichever is less. For residential\ndevelopment minor modifications are permitted in the conditional district standards that do not\ninvolve a change in uses permitted or the density of overall development permitted, may be\nreviewed and approved by the Planning Director.\nThe Planning Director, however, shall have the discretion to decline to exercise the delegated\nauthority either because of uncertainty about approval of the change pursuant to the standard or\nbecause Board of Commissioner consideration and public hearing is deemed appropriate under the\ncircumstances. If the Planning Director declines to exercise this authority, the applicant may request\na map amendment as permitted by this Chapter.\n42-51.

Overlay Districts\n42-52. Overlay Districts Established\nOverlay Zoning Districts are established to provide special additional development standards for\nspecially identified areas such as the Water Supply Watershed. Certain Overlay Zoning Districts are\nalso available to allow flexibility in design for certain types of developments. Overlay Zoning Districts\ncombine with the regulatory provisions of the underlying General or Conditional Zoning Districts to\nprovide additional or alternative standards. The districts listed in this Subpart D generally apply a\nhigher degree of regulation to affected properties. In order to become effective, individual overlay\ndistricts must be adopted on the zoning map as an addendum to the underlying zoning district\nthrough a public hearing process. Affected properties will be subject to the standards of both the\noverlay and underlying districts.\n42-54. Corridor Overlay (Reserved)\n42-53. Airport Overlay District (AI) (Reserved)\n42-57.

The intent of the overlay district is to manage the\nuses of land and structures encompassed by water supply watersheds within the County in order\nto\nmaintain the high quality of surface water in these watersheds; this being accomplished by enforcing\nstandards that limit the impact from existing or potential sources of contamination through the\nregulation of average lot size and development intensity.\nA. Scope. Land use within the WSWP overlay district must comply with all the requirements of\nboth the underlying general use district and the applicable Water Supply Watershed overlay\ndistrict classification. If a use or class of use is not specifically indicated as being permitted in\na watershed area, such use or class of use is prohibited.\nB. Establishment. This incorporates by reference the \"Official Water Supply Watershed Map for\nHenderson County,\" hereinafter \"Official Water Supply Watershed Map,\" and subsequent\namendments thereto, showing all water supply watershed areas designated by the North\nCarolina Environmental Management Commission, hereinafter NCEMC. The Official Water\nSupply Watershed Map shall be maintained by the Planning Director and kept in the Planning\nDepartment. The water supply watershed map shall also be shown on and become part of\nthe Official Zoning Map for the County. The rules of interpretation for the boundaries of the\nmap (see 42-239.3 (Interpretation of Boundaries of the Water Supply Watershed Map))\napply. In addition, where any WSWP overlay district boundaries lie at a scaled distance of\nmore than 25 feet from any parallel lot line, the location of these map boundaries shall be\ndetermined by using the scale of the map.\nC. Application of Regulations.\n1. General Application. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no development\nshall take place in the WSWP overlay district except in conformity with the regulations\nherein specified for the watershed sub-district in which it is located. All development\nmust minimize built-upon surface area; direct stormwater away from surface waters;\nand incorporate best management practices to minimize water quality impacts.

Existing development shall be subject to the\nregulations contained in 42-294 (Nonconforming Lots). Expansions to\nstructures classified as \"existing development\" must meet the requirements\nof this subsection; however, the built-upon area of the existing development is\nnot required to be included in density calculations.\nb. Lots Created as Part of Any Ordinance. Any lot or parcel created as part of any\nsubdivision that is exempt from the requirements of this Chapter shall be\nsubject to the land use requirements (including impervious surface\nrequirements) of this subsection, except that such lot or parcel must meet the\nminimum stream buffer requirements of 42-250 (Perennial and Intermittent\nSurface Water Buffers) to the maximum extent practicable.\nC. Cemetery Lots. The division of a tract into plots or lots used as a cemetery.\nD. Sub-Districts and Sub-District Regulations.\n1. General. The regulations of this subsection shall apply uniformly to each class or kind\nof structure or land located within any of the enumerated sub-district classifications.\nWithin the sub-districts as established below, the requirements set forth in this\nsubsection shall be complied with in addition to any other applicable general\nor\nspecial requirements of this Chapter.\n2. Impact on Water Quality and Public Health. No activity, situation, structure or land\nuse shall be allowed within a WSWP overlay sub-district that poses a threat to water\nquality and/or the public health, safety and welfare. Such conditions may arise from\ninadequate on-site sewage systems which utilize ground absorption; inadequate\nsedimentation and erosion control measures; the improper storage or disposal of\njunk, trash or other refuse within a buffer area; the improper management of\nstormwater runoff; or any other situation found to pose a threat to water quality.

Requirement for Sedimentation and Erosion Control Plan. The\ndevelopment project does not require a sedimentation and erosion\ncontrol plan and permit under the rules and regulations promulgated\nby the North Carolina Sedimentation Control Commission.\n2. Nonresidential. The development is nonresidential.\n3. Initial Development Activity. The development is the initial\ndevelopment activity on the project site or tract and is not an\nexpansion of any improvements already existing on the project site or\ntract having a built- upon area as defined in this subsection.\nb. Evaluation of Criteria. In evaluating whether the development project meets\nthe criteria listed above for the sedimentation and erosion control exemption,\nthe following rules shall apply:\n1.

Residential Developments. The exemption shall not be available for\nsingle-family or any other residential development projects, including\ngeneral home occupations.\n3. Discontinuance of Construction. If construction of the development\nproject is discontinued for a period of time in excess of 180\nconsecutive calendar days, any further construction shall be\nconsidered an expansion to improvements already existing on the\nproject site or tract. Any such further construction shall meet the\nrequirements of this subsection. However, only the built-upon area of\nsaid further construction and the remainder of the project site or tract\nshall be used in the density calculations.\n4. Damage and Destruction. Any exempted development project may be\nrepaired/reconstructed if damaged or destroyed. Any such\nreconstruction or repair shall not be considered an expansion of an\nimprovement already existing, provided that the repair/reconstruction\nrestores the building or built-upon area to substantially the same\ncondition and built-upon area as before any such damage or\ndestruction. To the extent that any such repair/reconstruction enlarges\nthe impervious surface associated with the building or built-upon area\nbeing repaired/reconstructed, the repair/reconstruction shall be\nconsidered an expansion to an exempted development project and\nshall be required to meet the density and built-upon limits contained\nin this subsection in accordance with subsection C.\nC. Exempted Expansions. Expansions to development projects which were\nexempted under the terms listed above shall not be exempted from the terms\nof this section. All such expansions shall be required to meet the requirements\nof this section. However, only the built-upon area of the expansion and the\nundeveloped area of the project site or tract shall be used in the density\ncalculations.\nE. Mixed-Use Development. In cases where both residential and nonresidential uses are\nproposed for one (1) lot in single ownership, such mixed-use developments may be permitted\nwithout further subdivision of the lot. However, each use must adhere to its respective\ndensity/built-upon area requirements. For purposes of this subsection, home occupations\nshall, be considered as residential uses.\nF. Existing Development.\n1. Existing Development. Existing development may be continued and maintained\nsubject to the provisions provided herein. Expansions to structures classified as\n\"existing development\" must meet the requirements of this section; however, only\nthe built-upon area of the expansion and the undeveloped area of the lot are used in\nthe built-upon calculations.\n2. Existing Vacant Lots. Existing vacant lots are lots for which plats or deeds have been\nrecorded as of May 23, 1994 in the office of the Register of Deeds of Henderson\nCounty. An existing lot may be used for any of the uses allowed in the watershed area\nin which it is located provided that where the lot size is less than the minimum\nspecified in this subsection; the Water Quality Administrator is authorized to issue a\npermit.\n3. Use of Land. Uses of land existing at the time of the initial adoption of watershed\nregulations for a particular area and where such use of the land is not permitted to be\nestablished hereafter in the watershed area in which it is located may be continued in\naccordance with this Chapter (see Article VIII Subpart B (Water Supply Watershed\nProtection)).\n4. Reconstruction of Buildings or Built-upon Areas. Any existing building or built-upon\narea not in conformance with the restrictions of this subsection that has been\ndamaged or removed may be repaired and/or reconstructed, provided that the\nfollowing are complied with:\na. Repair or reconstruction is initiated within 12 months and completed within\ntwo (2) years of such damage.\nb.

Requirement Thresholds. A TIS is required for any proposed development that meets any of\nthe following requirement thresholds:\n1. Any residential subdivision proposing 100 or more lots/units.\n2. Any residential or nonresidential development proposed to generate an average daily\ntraffic count of 1,000 plus vehicles per day or 100 plus trips during peak traffic hour.\nThis traffic count must be based on the latest version of the Institute of\nTransportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual.\n3.\nAny expansion or change to an existing or proposed residential or nonresidential\ndevelopment that would generate an additional 1,000 plus vehicles per day or 100\nplus trips during peak traffic hour. This traffic count must be based on the latest\nversion of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual.\nNotwithstanding the above, a TIS shall not be required if the property to be developed has been the\nsubject of a TIS within the previous three (3) years and the projected trip generation of the newly\nproposed development is equal to or less than the previous TIS preformed and the trip distribution\nhas not significantly changed.\nB. Traffic Impact Study (TIS) Guidelines.\n1. Any TIS, whether required or voluntarily, must be prepared by a licensed engineer\nand submitted as part, or as a condition, of the master plan approval or site plan\napproval. Prior to conducting the TIS, the developer must meet with County Staff, the\nTechnical Review Committee, and NCDOT to identify certain assumptions that shall\nbe addressed in the TIS.\n2. An executive summary shall be provided with the TIS outlining the following: (1)\ndetailed description of the proposed development, (2) number of access points\nproposed and studied, (3) existing and future Level of Service (LOS) for studied\nintersections and road segments including the LOS at the time of build-out, (4)\nexisting traffic counts for road(s) and intersection(s) studied and dates/times counts\nwere conducted, (5) AM and PM Peak Hour Trips, (6) Average Daily Trips created by\nthe development at build-out, (7) Existing Traffic Accident Counts, and (8) any\nrecommended improvements.\n3. The TIS shall address the: (1) proposed land use, (2) site access and site distances at\nall proposed access points, (3) impacts on the transportation system from the\nproposed development, and (4) physical improvements or enforceable management\nstrategies to mitigate negative impacts.\n4. The TIS shall take into consideration proposed/planned NCDOT roadway improvement\nprojects as identified on the Metropolitan Transportation Improvement Program\n(MTIP), State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP), the French Broad River\nPage 130 of 319\n"}, {"page": "131", "text": "Chapter 42 - Land Development Code\nHENDERSON\nCOUNTY\nPublished on Henderson County North Carolina (https://www.hendersoncountync.gov)\nMetropolitan Planning Organization Long Range Plan, and the Comprehensive\nTransportation Plan.\n5.

However, a TIS shall not be utilized as a means for the County to require the\nparty developing the property to make needed transportation improvements remote from\nand not affected by the property for which the TIS is submitted, nor shall identified\ndeficiencies in LOS automatically preclude approval of the proposed development.\n1. Left Turn Lane, Right Turn Lane, and/or Right Turn Taper: Based on requirements of\nthe NCDOT Policy on Street and Driveway Access to North Carolina Highways or other\nNCDOT standards.\n2. Additional Right-of-Way: If a subject development falls along a road projected to be\nwidened by NCDOT or an adopted County plan, additional right-of-way along the\ndevelopment's road frontage shall be dedicated as deemed acceptable by NCDOT.\n3. Offsite Improvements: If a road segment or intersection is currently performing at\nLOS-D or better and is projected to perform at LOS-E or F at the time of build-out,\nimprovements must be made to maintain the road segment or intersection at LOS-D.\nIf a road segment or intersection is currently performing at LOS-E or F and is\nprojected to continue to perform at LOS-E or F at the time of build-out, the TIS shall\ndemonstrate how an LOS-D could be achieved and also specify what improvements\nmust be made to ensure that the road segment or intersection is not degraded any\nfurther than the current levels. The County may require improvements be made to\npreserve the existing LOS.\n4.\nOther Necessary Improvements: Additional improvements may be required based on\nthe TIS recommendations related to topographic/environmental conditions, sight\ndistance, street offsets, conflicting movements, existing traffic accident counts,\ncirculation, and other potential traffic issues resulting from the proposed\ndevelopment.

Short title.\nThis Article shall be known as the Mountain Ridge Protection Act of 1983. (1983, C. 676, S. 1.)\n113A-206. Definitions. Within the meaning of this Article:\n1. The word \"person\" includes any individual, partnership, firm, association, joint venture, public\nor private corporation, trust, estate, commission, board, public or private institution, utility,\ncooperative, interstate body, the State of North Carolina and its agencies and political\nsubdivisions, or other legal entity.\n2. A person, as defined in this section, doing business or maintaining an office within a county is\na resident of the county.\n3. \"Tall buildings or structures\" include any building, structure or unit within a multiunit building\nwith a vertical height of more than 40 feet measured from the top of the foundation of said\nbuilding, structure or unit and the uppermost point of said building, structure or unit;\nprovided, however, that where such foundation measured from the natural finished grade of\nthe crest or the natural finished grade of the high side of the slope of a ridge exceeds 3 feet,\nthen such measurement in excess of 3 feet shall be included in the 40-foot limitation\ndescribed herein; provided, further, that no such building, structure or unit shall protrude at\nits uppermost point above the crest of the ridge by more than 35 feet. \"Tall buildings or\nstructures\" do not include:\na. Water, radio, telephone or television towers or any equipment for the transmission of\nelectricity or communications or both.\nb. Structures of a relatively slender nature and minor vertical projections of a parent\nbuilding, including chimneys, flagpoles, flues, spires, steeples, belfries, cupolas,\nantennas, poles, wires, or windmills.\nC. Buildings and structures designated as National Historic Sites on the National\nArchives Registry.\n4. \"Construction\" includes reconstruction, alteration, or expansion.\n5. \"Ridge\" means the elongated crest or series of crests at the apex or uppermost point of\nintersection between two opposite slopes or sides of a mountain, and includes all land within\n100 feet below the elevation of any portion of such line or surface along the crest.\n6. \"Protected mountain ridges\" are all mountain ridges whose elevation is 3,000 feet and whose\nelevation is 500 or more feet above the elevation of an adjacent valley floor; provided,\nhowever, that a county, or a city with a population of fifty thousand (50,000) or more, may\nelect to eliminate the requirement for an elevation of 3,000 feet, and such election shall\napply both to an ordinance adopted under G.S. 113A-208 and the prohibition against\nconstruction under G.S. 113A-209; provided, further, that such ordinance shall be adopted\npursuant to the procedures of G.S. 113A-208.\n7. Crest\" means the uppermost line of a mountain or chain of mountains from which the land\nfalls away on at least two sides to a lower elevation or elevations. (1983, C. 676, S. 1; 1985, C.\n713, S. 1.)\n\u00a7 113A-207. Legislative findings.\nThe construction of tall or major buildings and structures on the ridges and higher elevations of\nNorth Carolina's mountains in an inappropriate or badly designed manner can cause unusual\nproblems and hazards to the residents of and to visitors to the mountains. Supplying water to, and\ndisposing of the sewage from, buildings at high elevations with significant numbers of residents may\ninfringe on the ground water rights and endanger the health of those persons living at lower\nelevations. Providing fire protection may be difficult given the lack of water supply and pressure and\nthe possibility that fire will be fanned by high winds. Extremes of weather can endanger buildings,\nstructures, vehicles, and persons. Tall or major buildings and structures located on ridges are a\nhazard to air navigation and persons on the ground and detract from the natural beauty of the\nmountains.

Projects On, Over or Under Water. This subsection shall not apply to a land-\ndisturbing activity in connection with the construction of facilities to be\nPage 188 of 319\n"}, {"page": "189", "text": "Chapter 42 - Land Development Code\nCOUNTY\nPublished on Henderson County North Carolina (https://www.hendersoncountync.gov)\nlocated on, over, or under a lake or natural watercourse.\n2. Buffer Measurement. Unless otherwise provided, the width of a buffer zone\nis\nmeasured horizontally from the edge of the water to the nearest edge of the\ndisturbed area, with the 25 percent of the strip nearer the land-disturbing\nactivity containing natural or artificial means of confining visible siltation.\n2. Trout Buffer. Waters that have been classified as trout waters by the Environmental\nManagement Commission shall have an undisturbed buffer zone 25 feet wide or of\nsufficient width to confine visible siltation within the 25 percent of the buffer zone\nnearest the land-disturbing activity, whichever is greater. Provided, however, that\nthe Commission may approve plans which include land-disturbing activity along trout\nwaters when the duration of said disturbance would be temporary and the extent of\nsaid disturbance would be minimal.\n1. Projects On, Over or Under Water. This subsection shall not apply to a land-\ndisturbing activity in connection with the construction of facilities to be\nlocated on, over, or under a lake or natural watercourse.\n2.\nTrout Buffer Measurement. The 25 foot minimum width for an undisturbed\nbuffer zone adjacent to designated trout waters shall be measured\nhorizontally from the top of the bank to the nearest edge of the disturbed\narea.\n3.\nLimit on Land Disturbance. Where a temporary and minimal disturbance has\nbeen permitted as an exception to the trout buffer, land-disturbing activities\nin the buffer zone adjacent to designated trout waters shall be limited to a\nmaximum of ten (10) percent of the total length of the buffer zone within the\ntract to be disturbed such that there is not more than 100 linear feet of\ndisturbance in each 1000 linear feet of buffer zone. Larger areas may be\ndisturbed with the written approval of the Director.\n4. Limit on Temperature Fluctuations. No land-disturbing activity shall be\nundertaken within a buffer zone adjacent to designated trout waters that will\ncause adverse temperature fluctuations in the trout waters, as set forth in 15\nNCAC 2B.0211 \"Fresh Surface Water Classification and Standards.\"\n2. Graded Slopes and Fills. The angle for graded slopes and fills shall be no greater than the\nangle that can be retained by vegetative cover or other adequate erosion control devices or\nstructures. In any event, slopes left exposed will, within 21 calendar days of completion of\nany phase of grading, be planted or otherwise provided with temporary or permanent ground\ncover, devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion. The angle for graded slopes and\nfills must be demonstrated to be stable. Stable is the condition where the soil remains in its\noriginal configuration, with or without mechanical constraints.\n3. Fill Material. Materials being used as fill shall be consistent with those described in 15A\nNCAC 13B .0562 unless the site is permitted by the Departments Division of Waste\nManagement to operate as a landfill. Not all materials described in Section .0562 may be\nsuitable to meet geotechnical considerations of the fill activity and should be evaluated\naccordingly.\n4. Ground Cover. Whenever land-disturbing activity that will disturb more than one acre is\nundertaken on a tract, the Person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install erosion\nand sedimentation control devices and practices that are sufficient to retain the sediment\ngenerated by the land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of the tract during\nconstruction upon and development of said tract, and shall plant or otherwise provide a\npermanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion after completion of construction or\ndevelopment. Except as provided in 42-257 (Design and Performance Standards) B(5) of this\nsubpart, provisions for a ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be accomplished\nwithin 90 calendar days following completion of construction or development.\n5. Prior Plan Approval. No Person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity that will disturb more\nthan one acre on a tract unless, 30 or more days prior to initiating the activity, a Plan for the\nactivity is filed with and approved by the Henderson County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation\nControl Administrator.

No erosion and sedimentation control plan submitted under section 1.(b) above shall\nrequire any of the following:\n1. A silt fence or other erosion control measure to be placed in a location where,\ndue to the contour and topography of the development site, that erosion\ncontrol measure would not substantially and materially retain the sediment\ngenerated by the land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of the tract\nduring construction upon and development of the tract.\n2.\nA wire-backed reinforced silt fence where, due to the contour and topography\nof the development site, that fence would not substantially and materially\nretain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the\nboundaries of the tract during construction upon and development of the\ntract.\n10. Disapproval for Content. The Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Administrator may\ndisapprove an Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan or draft Erosion and Sedimentation\nControl Plan based on its content. A disapproval based upon an Erosion and Sedimentation\nControl Plan's content must specifically state in writing the reasons for disapproval.\n11.\nOther Disapprovals. The Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Administrator may\ndisapprove an Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan or draft Erosion and Sedimentation\nControl Plans if implementation of the Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan would result in\na violation of the rules adopted by the Environmental Management Commission to protect\nriparian buffers along surface waters. A local government may disapprove an Erosion and\nSedimentation Control Plan upon finding that an applicant, or a parent, subsidiary, or other\naffiliate of the applicant:\n1. Is conducting or has conducted land-disturbing activity without an approved Erosion\nand Sedimentation Control Plan, or has received notice of violation of an Erosion and\nSedimentation Control Plan previously approved by the North Carolina Sedimentation\nControl Commission or a local government pursuant to the North Carolina\nSedimentation Pollution Control Act of 1973 and has not complied with the notice\nwithin the time specified in the notice;\n2. Has failed to pay a civil penalty assessed pursuant to the North Carolina\nSedimentation Pollution Control Act of 1973 or a local ordinance adopted pursuant to\nthe North Carolina Sedimentation Pollution Control Act of 1973 by the time the\npayment is due;\n3.\nHas been convicted of a misdemeanor pursuant to NCG S $113A-64(b) or any criminal\nprovision of a local ordinance adopted pursuant to the North Carolina Sedimentation\nPollution Control Act of 1973; or\n4. Has failed to substantially comply with State rules or local ordinances and regulations\nadopted pursuant to the North Carolina Sedimentation Pollution Control Act of 1973.\nFor purposes of this subsection, an applicant's record may be considered for only the two (2) years\nprior to the application date.\nIn the event that an Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan is disapproved pursuant to this\nsubsection, the Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Administrator shall notify the Director of the\nDivision of Land Resources of NCDENR of such disapproval within ten (10) days. The Soil Erosion and\nSedimentation Control Administrator shall advise the applicant and the Director of the Division of\nLand Resources of NCDENR in writing as to the specific reasons that the Erosion and Sedimentation\nControl Plan was disapproved.\n1. Notice of Activity Initiation. No person may initiate a land-disturbing activity before notifying\nthe agency that issued the Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan approval of the date that\nland-disturbing activity will begin.\n2. Preconstruction Conference. When deemed necessary by the approving authority a\npreconstruction conference may be required.\n3. Display of Plan Approval. An Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan approval issued under\nthis subpart shall be prominently displayed until all construction is complete, all permanent\nPage 192 of 319\n"}, {"page": "193", "text": "Chapter 42 - Land Development Code\nHENDERSON\nCOUNTY\nPublished on Henderson County North Carolina (https://www.hendersoncountync.gov)\nsedimentation and erosion control measures are installed and the site has been stabilized. A\ncopy of the approved plan shall be kept on file at the job site.\n4. Required Revisions. After approving an Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan, if the Soil\nErosion and Sedimentation Control Administrator either upon review of such Erosion and\nSedimentation Control Plan or on inspection of the job site, determines that a significant risk\nof accelerated erosion or off-site sedimentation exists, the Soil Erosion and Sedimentation\nControl Administrator shall require a revised Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan. Pending\nthe preparation of the revised Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan, work shall cease or\nshall continue under conditions outlined by the appropriate authority. If following\ncommencement of a land-disturbing activity pursuant to an approved Erosion and\nSedimentation Control Plan, the Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Administrator\ndetermines that the Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan is inadequate to meet the\nrequirements of this subpart, the Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Administrator may\nrequire any revision of the Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan that is necessary to\ncomply with this subpart.\n5. Amendment to a Plan. Applications for amendment of an Erosion and Sedimentation Control\nPlan in written and/or graphic form may be made at any time under the same conditions as\nthe original application. Until such time as said amendment is approved by the Soil Erosion\nand Sedimentation Control Administrator the land-disturbing activity shall not proceed except\nin accordance with the Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan as originally approved.\n6. Failure to File a Plan. Any person engaged in land-disturbing activity who fails to file an\nErosion and Sedimentation Control Plan in accordance with this subpart, or who conducts a\nland-disturbing activity except in accordance with provisions of an approved Erosion and\nSedimentation Control Plan shall be deemed in violation of this Chapter.\n42-256. Basic Control Objectives\nAn erosion and sedimentation control Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan may be disapproved if\nthe Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan fails to address the following control objectives:\nA. Identify Critical Areas. On-site areas which are subject to severe erosion, and off-site areas\nwhich are especially vulnerable to damage from erosion and/or sedimentation, are to be\nidentified and receive special attention.\nB. Limit Time of Exposure. All land-disturbing activities are to be planned and conducted to limit\nexposure to the shortest feasible time.\nC. Limit Exposed Areas. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to minimize\nthe size of the area to be exposed at any one (1) time.\nD. Control Surface Water. Surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas should be\ncontrolled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during the period of exposure.\nE. Control Sedimentation. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted so as to\nprevent off-site sedimentation damage.\nF. Manage Stormwater Runoff. When the increase in the velocity of stormwater runoff resulting\nfrom a land-disturbing activity is sufficient to cause accelerated erosion of the receiving\nwatercourse, an Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan is to include measures to control the\nvelocity to the point of discharge so as to minimize accelerated erosion of the site and\nincreased sedimentation of the stream.\n42-257. Design and Performance Standards\n1. Except as provided in 42-257 (Design and Performance Standards) B(2) of this subpart,\nerosion and sedimentation control measures, structures, and devices shall be planned,\nPage 193 of 319\n"}, {"page": "194", "text": "Chapter 42 - Land Development Code\nHENDERSON\nCOUNTY\nPublished on Henderson County North Carolina (https://www.hendersoncountync.gov)\ndesigned, and constructed to provide protection from the calculated maximum peak rate of\nrunoff from the ten (10) year storm. Runoff rates shall be calculated using the procedures in\nthe United States Department of Agricultural (USDA), Natural Resource Conservation\nService's \"National Engineering Field Handbook\", or other acceptable calculation procedures.\n2. HQW Zones. In High Quality Water (HQW) zones the following design standards shall apply:\n1. Limit on Uncovered Area. Uncovered areas in HQW zones shall be limited at any time\nto a maximum total area of 20 acres within the boundaries of the tract. Only the\nportion of the land- disturbing activity within a HQW zone shall be governed by this\nsection. Larger areas may be uncovered within the boundaries of the tract with the\nwritten approval of the Director upon providing engineering justification with a\nconstruction sequence that considers phasing, limiting exposure, weekly submitted\nself-inspection reports, and a more conservation design than the Twenty-Five Year\nStorm.\n2. Maximum Peak Rate of Runoff Protection. Erosion and sedimentation control\nmeasures, structures, and devices within HQW zones shall be planned, designed and\nconstructed to provide protection from the runoff of the 25-year storm which\nproduces the maximum peak rate of runoff as calculated according to procedures in\nthe latest edition of the United States Department of Agriculture Natural\nResources Conservation Service's \"National Engineering Field Handbook\" or\naccording to procedures adopted by any other agency of this state or the United\nStates or any generally recognized organization or association.\n3. Sediment Basin Design. Sediment basin within HQW zones shall be designed and\nconstructed according to the following or association.\n1. use a surface withdrawal mechanism, except when the basin drainage area is\nless than 1.0 acre:\n2. have a minimum of 1800 cubic feet of storage area per acre of disturbed area;\n3. have a minimum surface area of 325 square feet per cfs of the Twenty-Five\nYear Storm (Q25) peak flow;\n4. have a minimum dewatering time of 48 hours;\n5. incorporate 3 baffles, unless the basin is less than 20 feet in length, in which\ncase 2 baffles shall be sufficient.\nUpon a written request of the applicant, the Director may allow alternative design and control\nmeasures in lieu of meeting the conditions required in subparagraphs (3)(ii) through (3)(v of this sub-\nsection if the applicant demonstrates that meeting all of those conditions will result in design or\noperational hardships and that the alternative measures will provide an equal or more effective level\nof erosion and sediment control on the site. Alternative measures may include quicker application of\nground cover, use of sediment flocculants, and use of enhanced ground cover practices.\n4. Grade. Newly constructed open channels in HQW zones shall be designed and constructed with\nside slopes no steeper than two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical if a vegetative cover is used for\nstabilization unless soil conditions permit a steeper slope or where the slopes are stabilized by using\nmechanical devices, structural devices or other forms of ditch liners proven as being effective in\nrestraining accelerated erosion. In any event, the angle for side slopes shall be sufficient to restrain\naccelerated erosion.\n42-258. Stormwater Outlet Protection\n1. Intent. Stream banks and channels downstream from any land-disturbing activity shall be\nprotected from increased degradation by accelerated erosion caused by increased velocity of\nrunoff from the land- disturbing activity.\n2. Performance Standard. Persons shall conduct land-disturbing activity so that the post\nconstruction velocity of the ten (10) year storm runoff in the receiving watercourse to the\ndischarge point does not exceed the greater of:\n1. the velocity established by the Maximum Permissible Velocities Table set out within\nthis subsection; or\nPage 194 of 319\n"}, {"page": "195", "text": "Chapter 42 - Land Development Code\nCOUNTY\nHENDERSON\nPublished on Henderson County North Carolina (https://www.hendersoncountync.gov)\n2. the velocity of the ten-year storm runoff in the receiving watercourse prior to\ndevelopment.\nIf condition (1) or (2) of this Paragraph cannot be met, then the receiving watercourse to and\nincluding the discharge point shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity\nanywhere the velocity exceeds the \"prior to development\" velocity by 10 percent.\nThe following is a table for maximum permissible velocity for storm water discharges in feet per\nsecond (F.P.S.) and meters per second (M.P.S.):\nSource - Adapted from recommendations by Special Committee on Irrigation Research, American\nSociety of Civil Engineers, 1926, for channels with straight alignment. For sinuous channels, multiply\nallowable velocity by 0.95 for slightly sinuous, by 0.9 for moderately sinuous channels, and by 0.8 for\nhighly sinuous channel\n3. Acceptable Management Measures. Measures applied alone or in combination to satisfy the\nintent of this section are acceptable if there are no objectionable secondary consequences. The\nHenderson County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Administrator recognizes that the\nmanagement of stormwater runoff to minimize or control downstream channel and bank erosion is\na developing technology. Innovative techniques and ideas will be considered and may be used when\nshown to have the potential to produce successful results. Some alternatives, while not exhaustive,\nare to:\n1. Avoid increases in surface runoff volume and velocity by including measures to promote\ninfiltration to compensate for increased runoff from areas rendered impervious;\n2. Avoid increases in stormwater discharge velocities by using vegetated or roughened swales\nand waterways in place of closed drains and high velocity paved sections;\n3. Provide energy dissipators at outlets of storm drainage facilities to reduce flow velocities to\nthe point of discharge;\n4. Protect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving cross sections and/or\nproviding erosion-resistant lining; and\n5. Upgrade or replace the receiving device structure or watercourse such that it will receive and\nconduct the flow to a point where it is no longer subject to degradation from the increased\nrate of flow or increased velocity.\n4. Exceptions. This rule shall not apply where it can be demonstrated to the Henderson County Soil\nErosion and Sedimentation Control Administrator that stormwater discharge velocities will not create\nan erosion problem in the receiving watercourse.\n42-259.

Investigation. The Henderson County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Administrator\nshall have the power to conduct such investigation as it may reasonably deem necessary to\ncarry out its duties as prescribed in this subpart, and who presents appropriate credentials\nfor this purpose to enter at reasonable times any property, public or private, for the purpose\nof investigating and inspecting the sites of any land-disturbing activity.\n5. Statements and Reports. The Henderson County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control\nAdministrator shall also have the power to require written statements, or filing of reports\nunder oath, with respect to pertinent questions relating to land-disturbing activity.\n42-268. Penalties\n1. Civil Penalties\n1.\nCivil Penalty for a Violation. Any Person who violates any of the provisions of this\nsubpart, or rule or order adopted or issued pursuant to this subpart, or who initiates\nor continues a land-disturbing activity for which a Plan is required except in\naccordance with the terms, conditions, and provisions of an approved Plan, is subject\nto a civil penalty. The maximum civil penalty amount that the Henderson County Soil\nErosion and Sedimentation Control Administrator may assess per violation is 5,000\ndollars. A civil penalty may be assessed from the date of the violation. Each day of a\ncontinuing violation shall constitute a separate violation. When the Person has not\nbeen assessed any civil penalty under this subsection for any previous violation, and\nthat Person abated continuing environmental damage resulting from the violation\nwithin 180 days from the date of the notice of violation, the maximum cumulative\ntotal civil penalty assessed under this subsection for all violations associated with the\nland-disturbing activity for which the erosion and sedimentation control plan is\nrequired is twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).]\n2. Damage or Destruction of a silt fence occurring during land-disturbance activities or\nconstruction on a development project shall not be assessed a civil penalty provided\nthat the silt fence is repaired or replaced within the compliance period/deadline noted\nin the inspection report or notice of violation. This will ensure violators have an\nopportunity to correct these violations. G.S. $113A-61.1(d) does not apply to off-site\nsediment that occurs due to the silt fence not being in place, but merely damage to\nthe silt fence itself.\n3. Civil Penalty Assessment Factors. The Henderson County Soil Erosion and\nSedimentation Control Administrator shall determine the amount of the civil penalty\nbased upon the following factors:\n1. the degree and extent of harm caused by the violation,\n2. the cost of rectifying the damage,\n3. the amount of money the violator saved by noncompliance,\n4. whether the violation was committed willfully, and\n5. the prior record of the violator in complying or failing to comply with this\nsubpart.\nNotice of Civil Penalty Assessment. The Henderson County Soil Erosion and\nSedimentation Control Administrator shall provide notice of the civil penalty\namount and basis for assessment to the Person assessed. The notice of\nassessment shall be served by any means authorized under G.S. 1A-1, Rule\n4. A notice of assessment by the Henderson County Soil Erosion and\nSedimentation Control Administrator shall direct the violator to either pay the\nassessment, contest the assessment, within 30 days by filing a petition for\nhearing with the Henderson County Zoning Board of Adjustment, or file a\nrequest with the Henderson County Board of Commissioners for remission of\nthe assessment within 30 days of receipt of the notice of assessment.

The Water Quality Administrator shall prepare a staff\nrecommendation for the Water Quality Board on the application for a Watershed Regulation\nVariance.\nD. Formal Review. Prior to taking any action on a Watershed Regulation Variance, the Water\nQuality Board shall consider the Water Quality Administrator's recommendation on the\nWatershed Regulation Variance. Comments received from local governments (if applicable)\nshall become a part of the record of proceedings of the Water Quality Board. The Water\nQuality Board shall refuse to hear an application for a Watershed Regulation Variance\npreviously denied if it finds that there have been no substantial changes in conditions or\ncircumstances bearing on the appeal or application. The Water Quality Board shall not grant\na Watershed Regulation Variance without making the following three (3) findings, which shall\nbe recorded in the permanent record of the case, and shall include the factual reasons on\nwhich they are based:\nA. Finding One (1). There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of\ncarrying out the strict letter of this Chapter, specifically Article VIII (Natural\nResources) Subpart B. (Water Supply Watershed Protection). In order to determine\nthat there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, the Water Quality Board\nmust find that the following conditions exist:\na. If the applicant complies with the provisions of this Chapter, the applicant can\nsecure no reasonable return from, nor make reasonable use of, his/her\nproperty. Merely proving that the Watershed Regulation Variance would\npermit a greater profit to be made from the property will not be considered\nadequate to justify the Water Quality Board in granting a Watershed\nRegulation Variance. Moreover, the Water Quality Board shall consider\nwhether the Watershed Regulation Variance is the minimum possible\ndeviation from the terms of this Chapter that will make possible the\nreasonable use of the property;\nb.\nThe hardship results from the application of this Chapter to the property\nrather than from other factors, such as deed restrictions or other hardship;\nC. The hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicant's property, such as\nits size, shape or topography, which is different from that of neighboring\nproperty;\nd. The hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly\nor\nunknowingly violates this Chapter or who purchases the property after the\neffective date of this Chapter then comes to the Water Quality Board for relief;\nand/or\ne. The hardship is peculiar to the applicant's property, rather than the result of\nPage 262 of 319\n"}, {"page": "263", "text": "Chapter 42 - Land Development Code\nHENDERSON\nCOUNTY\nPublished on Henderson County North Carolina (https://www.hendersoncountync.gov)\nconditions that are widespread. If other properties are equally subject to the\nhardship created in the restriction, then granting a Watershed Regulation\nVariance would be a special privilege denied to others and would not promote\nequal justice.\nB. Finding Two (2). The Watershed Regulation Variance is in harmony with the general\npurpose and intent of this Chapter, specifically Article VIII (Natural Resources)\nSubpart B (Water Supply Watershed Protection), and preserves its spirit.\nC. Finding Three (3). In the granting of the Watershed Regulation Variance, the public\nsafety and welfare have been assured and substantial justice has been done. The\nWater Quality Board shall not grant a Watershed Regulation Variance if it finds that\ndoing so would in any respect impair the public health, safety or general welfare.\nE. Environmental Management Commission Review. Where the application calls for the granting\nof a Watershed Major Variance, and if the Water Quality Board decides in favor of granting\nthe Watershed Regulation Variance, the Water Quality Board shall prepare a preliminary\nrecord of the hearing with all deliberate speed. The preliminary record of the hearing shall\ninclude the: (1) Watershed Regulation Variance application; (2) hearing notices; (3) evidence\npresented; (4) motions, offers of proof, objections to evidence and rulings on them; (5)\nproposed findings and exceptions; and (6) proposed decision, including all conditions\nproposed to be added to the Watershed Regulation Variance. The preliminary record shall be\nsent to the Environmental Management Commission for its review as follows:\nA. Situation One (1). If the Environmental Management Commission concludes from the\npreliminary record that the Watershed Regulation Variance qualifies as a Watershed\nMajor Variance and that the property owner can secure no reasonable return from,\nnor make any practical use of, the property unless the proposed Watershed\nRegulation Variance is granted and that the Watershed Regulation Variance, if\ngranted, will not result in a serious threat to the water supply, then the Environmental\nManagement Commission may approve the Watershed Regulation Variance as\nproposed or approve the proposed variance with conditions and stipulations. The\nEnvironmental Management Commission will prepare a Commission decision and\nsend it to the Water Quality Board. If the Environmental Management Commission\napproves the Watershed Regulation Variance as proposed, the Water Quality Board\nshall prepare a final decision granting the proposed Watershed Regulation Variance.\nIf\nthe Commission approves the variance with conditions and stipulations, the Water\nQuality Board shall prepare a final decision, including such conditions and\nstipulations, granting the proposed Watershed Regulation Variance.\nB. Section Two (2). If the Commission concludes from the preliminary record that the\nWatershed Regulation Variance qualifies as a Watershed Major Variance and that the\nproperty owner can secure a reasonable return from or make a practical use of the\nproperty without the Watershed Regulation Variance or that the Watershed\nRegulation Variance, if granted, will result in a serious threat to the water supply,\nthen the Commission may deny approval of the Watershed Regulation Variance as\nproposed. The Commission shall prepare a Commission decision and send it to the\nWater Quality Board. The Water Quality Board will prepare a final decision denying\nthe Watershed Regulation Variance as proposed.\nF. Conditions. The Water Quality Board may, in granting a Watershed Regulation Variance,\nprescribe: (1) additional conditions regarding the location, character and other features of\nthe proposed building, structure or use; (2) additional safeguards; (3) a time limit within\nwhich the action for which a Watershed Regulation Variance is sought shall be begun; (4)\na\ntime limit within which the action for a Watershed Regulation Variance is sought shall be\ncompleted; and (5) a time duration within which construction, operation or installation shall\ncommence on the project for which the variance was obtained. If a Watershed Regulation\nVariance for the construction, alteration or use of property is granted, such construction,\nalteration or use shall be in accordance with the approved site plan.\nG. Variance Validity. Upon issuance of a Watershed Regulation Variance, it shall then be\nconsidered as a Water Supply Watershed Use Permit (see 42-358 (Water Supply Watershed\nUse Permits)), and shall adhere to the permit validity outlined therefore.\nPage 263 of 319\n"}, {"page": "264", "text": "Chapter 42 - Land Development Code\nCOUNTY\nPublished on Henderson County North Carolina (https://www.hendersoncountync.gov)\nSubpart H.
