This Ordinance may also regulate territory\nwithin the zoning regulation jurisdiction of any municipality whose governing body by resolution\nagrees to such regulation; provided, however, that any such municipal governing body may, upon\none year's written notice or such lesser time on which both Boards may agree, (#19) withdraw\nfrom the jurisdiction of the county zoning regulations, and those regulations shall have no further\neffect within the municipality's jurisdiction.\nSection 31 Bona Fide Farms Exempt\nStokes County does not intend to regulate farming activities. Cropland or farm buildings, including\nsuch structures as farmhouses, tenant housing (dwelling for workers who are employed on the farm\nwhere they reside), tobacco barns, and apple sheds, are excluded from the regulations described in\nthe zoning text. The regulations of this zoning ordinance take effect only when farmland is\ndeveloped for some type of non-farm activity. For example, if a farmer sold his farm for a 50-unit\nresidential subdivision, or a 5-acre tract for a shopping center, or a 2-acre tract for an industrial\nsite, the land-whoever owned it-would then be regulated by this Ordinance.\nThe rationale for excluding farming activities from zoning controls is simply that farming activities\ngenerally take place on relatively large tracts of land -- 20, 50, 100 acres or more. The\nlocation\nof\na farmhouse, or a tobacco barn has little impact on a neighbor who may live two miles away. This\nis not the case when a person owns a lot of an acre or less in size. What happens on the neighboring\nproperty has direct impact on his property.\nAmendment #19 -- Amended August 5, 1985\nFor example, the property owner wants to develop his property for a residential subdivision or a\ncommercial or industrial use, and the adjoining landowner wants to be assured that his property is\nprotected. This could be done either by excluding certain incompatible uses or insuring that other\nuses are developed to specific standards that enhance the quality of the neighborhood.\nSection 32 Grandfather Clause\nAny use of land or building shall be regulated by this Ordinance. However, any outstanding\nbuilding permit valid at the time of adoption shall remain in force, and nothing in this Ordinance\nshall require a change of plans, construction, or designated use of any structure for which such\npermit has been issued.\nStokes County Zoning Ordinance\n3\n"}, {"page": "7", "text": "ARTICLE IV\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of interpreting this Ordinance certain words or terms are herein defined.
