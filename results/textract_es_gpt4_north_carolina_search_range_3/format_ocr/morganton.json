The City Council has determined that there is a factual basis for believing that some or all of the conditions noted above\nmay result from the lack of zoning regulations and the Council has given due consideration to the character of each\nzoning district, its suitability for particular uses, with a view to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the\nmost appropriate use of land throughout the City and its perimeter area.\n1.3 Authority and Interpretation\n1.3.1 Definition of Zoning\nA. Zoning is the process by which an area is divided into various districts, each of which is specifically intended for\ndifferent uses and intensity of uses and within which the use of land and buildings, the height and dimension of\nbuildings, the size of required yards and the population density are regulated.\nB.\nFurther, the regulations are to be made with reasonable consideration, among other things, to the character of the district\nand its unique suitability for particular uses, and with a view to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the\nmost appropriate use of land throughout the City's jurisdiction.\n1.3.2 Zoning District Authority\nA. In accordance with NCGS 160D-703, the City, as shown on the Zoning Map accompanying this Ordinance, is hereby\ndivided into districts which shall be governed by all of the uniform use and dimensional requirements of this Ordinance.\nB. Zoning divides a City's territorial jurisdiction into districts, or zones, of any number, shape and area. Within those\ndistricts, the municipality may regulate and restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, or use of\nbuildings, structures, or land. All regulations must be uniform for each class or kind of building throughout each\ndistrict, but the regulations in one (1) district may differ from those in other districts.\nEffective on: 5/1/2023\n1.3.3 Zoning Map\nA.\nFor the purposes of this Ordinance, the City of Morganton is hereby divided into zoning districts whose locations and\nboundaries are shown on the Official Zoning Map for the City of Morganton which is hereby adopted by reference and\ndeclared to be a part of this Ordinance.\nB. This Zoning Map and all the notations, references and all amendments thereto, and other information shown thereon are\nhereby made a part of this Ordinance the same as if such information set forth on the map were all fully described and\nset out herein. The Zoning Map properly attested is on file in the City Hall and is available for inspection by the public.\nC. The Administrator or his representative shall be responsible for the maintenance and revision of the Official Zoning\nMap. Upon notification by the City Board that a zoning change has been made, the Administrator shall make the\nnecessary changes on the Official Zoning Map.\nD. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any district shown on the Official Zoning Map, the Administrator shall\nemploy the following rules of interpretation:\n1. Centerline\nWhere a boundary line lies within and follows a street or alley right-of-way, railroad right-of-way, or utility easement,\ntps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/morganton-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nPage 13 of 266\n"}, {"page": "14", "text": "3/10/24, 20:52\nthe boundary shall be construed to be in the center of such street or alley right-of-right, railroad right-of-way, or utility\neasement forming the boundary between two (2) separate zoning districts. If such right-of-way is abandoned or\nremoved from dedication, the district boundaries shall be construed as following the centerline of the abandoned or\nvacated street or utility easement.\n2. Edge Line\nWhere a boundary line follows the edge of a street or alley right-of-way, a railroad right-of-way, or utility easement,\nthe boundary shall be construed to be on the edge of such street or alley right-of-way, railroad right-of-way, or utility\neasement. If such a street or alley right-of-way, railroad right-of-way, or utility easement forming the boundary\nbetween two (2) separate zoning districts is abandoned or removed from dedication, the district boundaries shall be\nconstrued as following the edge of the abandoned or vacated street or utility easement.\n3. Lot Line\nBoundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines. In the event\nthat a district boundary line divides a lot or tract, each part of the lot or tract SO divided shall be used in conformity\nwith the regulations established by this Ordinance for the district in which said part is located.\n4. City Limits\nBoundaries indicated as approximately following City limits or extraterritorial boundary lines shall be construed as\nfollowing the City limits or extraterritorial boundary lines.\n5. Watercourses\nBoundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or other bodies of\nwater shall be construed to follow such center lines.\n6. Extensions\nBoundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of street or alley rights-of-way, utility easements, lot lines, City\nlimits, county lines, or extraterritorial boundaries shall be SO construed.\n7. Scaling\nIn a case where a district boundary does not coincide with any boundary lines as above and no distances are described\nby specific ordinance; the boundary shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing on the map.\nE. Where the Administrator determines that physical features existing on the ground, or actual property lines or other man-\nmade boundary lines used to depict zoning district boundaries, are different than those shown on the Official Zoning\nMap, the Board of Adjustment shall have the authority to interpret Zoning district boundaries.\n1.4 Applicability\n1.4.1 Jurisdiction\nFor the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance, the zoning jurisdiction of the City shall include the land within the corporate\nlimits of the City and that land located between these limits and the boundaries established in the municipal ordinance\nestablishing extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) boundaries.\n1.4.2 Exemptions to Applicability\nA. These regulations shall not apply to any land or structure for which, prior to the effective date hereof, there is a properly\napproved site specific plan as required by the requirements previously adopted. Any preliminary or final development\nplat approvals required for such approved and exempted site specific plans shall be conducted in accordance with the\nrequirements of the Zoning Ordinance or Subdivision Ordinance under which they were approved.\n0s://online.encodeplus.com/regs/morganton-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nPage 14 of 266\n"}, {"page": "15", "text": "3/10/24, 20:52\nB.

Property that is located in the ETJ and that ceases to be\nused for bona fide farm purposes shall become subject to zoning regulations.\nC. Properties with existing Conditional Use District zoning shall retain their existing zoning with all conditions as\napproved unless the property owner requests a map amendment to one of the zoning designations as set forth in this\nOrdinance.\nEffective on: 5/1/2023\n1.4.3 Minimum Regulations\nRegulations set forth by this Ordinance shall be minimum regulations.

It is not intended by this Ordinance to interfere with, abrogate, or annul easements, covenants, water supply watershed\nregulations, or other agreements between parties; provided, however, that where this Ordinance imposes a greater\nrestriction upon the use of buildings or premises or upon the height of buildings, or requires larger open spaces than are\nimposed or required by other ordinances, rules, regulations, or by easements, covenants, or agreements, the provisions\nof this Ordinance shall govern.\nB. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this Ordinance is for any reason held to be invalid by the courts,\nsuch decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Ordinance. The City Council hereby declares\nthat it has passed this Ordinance and each section, subsection, clause and phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any\none (1) or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases be declared invalid.\n1.6 Conformance with Adopted Plans and Right-of-Way Dedication\nA. In accordance with the requirement of NCGS 160D-604 and 160D-605, the regulations adopted pursuant to this\nOrdinance shall be consistent with the City's adopted Comprehensive Plan, as may be modified from time to time, and\nany specific plans adopted by the City Council. All new developments shall be designed in conformance with adopted\nplans including but not limited to adopted comprehensive plans, comprehensive transportation plans, small area plans,\nland use plans, parks and recreation plans and any other adopted plans.\nB. When a proposed development includes any part of a thoroughfare which has been designated as such upon the\nofficially adopted Comprehensive Transportation Plan, such thoroughfare right(s)-of-way shall be dedicated and\nconstructed by the developer(s) as shown on the plan. Where such right-of way does not currently exist, the developer\nshall be required to dedicate the necessary right-of-way on the development side of the street.\nEffective on: 5/1/2023\n1.7 Vested Rights and Development Agreements\n1.7.1 Purpose and Authority\nbs://online.encodeplus.com/regs/morganton-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nPage 15 of 266\n"}, {"page": "16", "text": "3/10/24, 20:52\nA.

Power Generation, wind\n1. An individual use wind power generation facility shall be a single system designed to supplement other electricity\nsources as an accessory use to existing buildings or facilities, wherein the power generated is used primarily for on-\nsite consumption.

Decommissioning shall include removal of wind turbines, buildings,\ncabling, electrical components, roads, and any other associated facilities.\nH. Telecommunications Towers\n1. Findings. The proliferation of telecommunication towers create visual blight that detracts from the natural and\nhistorical scenic beauty of this area. Further, towers which are not properly erected are subject to collapse and create a\nrisk of damage to property as well as personal injury. Because of the effects that telecommunication towers may have\non the general health, happiness, welfare and safety of Morganton and its citizens, reasonable regulations will balance\nthe need for some regulation and the need for telecommunication systems.\n2. Policy. It is the policy of the City of Morganton that the visual impact of telecommunication towers and/or antenna\nshould be minimized through the use, where feasible, of alternative tower structures. If alternative tower structures are\nnot available or it is technically or economically not feasible to use an alternative tower structure, then the joint or\nmultiple use of a single tower in less objectionable locations by different communication companies (sometimes\ncalled \"co-location\") should be and is encouraged, SO as to minimize the need to construct new towers and to\nminimize the overall number of towers throughout the City. This section is intended to implement that policy.\n3. Approval Required. No telecommunication tower and/or antenna shall be erected, located, constructed or relocated\nwithin the zoning jurisdiction of the City of Morganton without first obtaining a special use permit issued in\naccordance with this section. The permit may be issued by the Zoning Administrator under the circumstances set forth\nin Paragraph (4) below. Otherwise, the permit may be issued by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with\nParagraph (5) below. All permits shall be subject to the requirements at Paragraph (6) and those requirements shall be\ndeemed to be a part of the permit. Notwithstanding the above, permits shall not be required for residential television\nantennas, satellite dishes, and satellite earth stations or amateur radio towers owned and operated by an amateur radio\noperator licensed by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) if such antenna are used for residential purposes\nonly and are not used for commercial purposes.

Significant trees, forest stands, natural\nvegetation, specimen trees, severe natural topography, drainage features and water courses are encouraged to be\npreserved to the extent that is reasonable and practical while otherwise not reasonably prohibiting development.\nB. In cases where an existing, landscaped or vegetated area is located on the same property as the proposed development,\nfurther plantings and or improvements shall not be required SO long as existing vegetation is of sufficient width and\ncontains adequate materials to meet the requirements of this Ordinance. If the landscaped or vegetated area is deficient,\nthe developer shall make needed improvements and/or additions to satisfy the landscaping requirements and intent of\nthis Ordinance.\nC. No structure other than a wall, fence, sidewalk, mailbox, sign, light fixture, or driveway shall be permitted within a\nrequired landscaping area. No off-street parking may take place in any required landscaping area. Where plant materials\nare required, the required amount of plant materials shall be installed on the side of any wall or fence opposite the new\ndevelopment.\nD. Within 30 feet of overhead utility lines, two (2) small trees shall be used in lieu of each large tree required. Such small\ntrees shall not reach a mature height of greater than 15 feet. No landscaping shall be used that at maturity will impede\non fire hydrants, water meters, sewer cleanouts or other similar above ground utility features. The landscaping plan for\nthe site shall provide a three-foot clearance exclusive of large and small trees, as well as large shrubs, around these\nfeatures.\ntps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/morganton-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nPage 95 of 266\n"}, {"page": "96", "text": "3/10/24, 20:52\nE.

Buffer yards are intended to separate higher intensity and lower intensity uses. Buffers shall be measured from the\nsubject property line into the site to be developed. All required buffer yards shall abut the subject property line, except\nwhere there is conflict with an existing underground easement running along the subject property line; in such instances,\nthe buffer yard shall be required to abut the edge of the easement. For new developments, the buffer yard shall abut the\nproperty line with the easement abutting the buffer yard to the inside of the property. Required buffer yard width shall\nnot decrease the required building setback for each zoning district as set forth in Section 4.2.\nB. Buffer yards shall function as opaque visual screens with a minimum height of six (6) feet. Plant selection should\nensure that the minimum height is achieved within one year of installation.\nC. Generally, the responsibility for screening is that of the more intense land use. However, new developments with a less\nintense use being constructed next to an existing more intense use shall provide the required landscaping on the new\ndevelopment's property.\nD. Fences located within a buffer yard shall be located on the side closest to the neighboring property line while allowing\nadequate room to maintain both sides of the fence.\nE. In addition to the requirements of this Section, buffer yard landscaping shall meet the general standards set forth in\nSection 4.4.2.\nF. There are three types of buffer yards. The requirements and depictions of these buffer yards are shown on the following\npages.\n1. Type 1: Multi-family residential development adjacent to single-family and two-family residential development\n2. Type 2: Non-residential development adjacent to any type of residential development (not including development\nwithin an Exclusive Industrial District)\n3.

A building's scale refers to its perceived size in relation to a person (i.e.,\nhuman scale) or neighboring structures (i.e., architectural scale). Adjacent buildings sharing human-scaled architectural\nelements (e.g., windows, doors, porches, vestibules, stoops, lawnings at entrance level, other ground-level pedestrian\namenities) help establish an inviting, pedestrian-oriented streetscape. The following standards regarding massing and scale\nshall be met:\nA.\nNew construction on lots that are significantly wider than adjacent existing lots shall utilize a design that divides and\nproportions the building to replicate the massing and scale of adjacent buildings.\nB. Where other buildings within 250 feet on the same side of the street and within the same block occupy the full width of\nthe lot b at the front build-to line, the new construction shall occupy the full width of the lot at the build-to line between\nthe side lot lines unless sufficient width exists to provide driveway or pedestrian access to a rear parking area.

A storefront designed\nto be open and inviting will help to welcome patrons inside, while a storefront that is hardened presents the opposite\nmessage. Most storefronts have an abundance of glass, which is a contributing factor in good storefront design since the\nopenness of the glass invites browsing and allows pedestrians to see interior activity. Good storefront design also allows\nfor pedestrians to be able to view the interior of the building from the main portion of the sidewalk. Therefore, excessively\nrecessed storefronts are discouraged since they require a passerby to leave the main sidewalk to see clearly into the\nstorefront. The following storefront design standards requirements shall apply to all new construction and reconstruction of\nstorefronts:\nA. Buildings shall be designed SO that the majority (greater than 50 percent) of the width of the storefront wall is located\nimmediately adjacent to the public sidewalk. Storefronts shall run the length of the first floor facade between the exterior\nbuilding piers.\nB. No more than 20 percent of the storefront wall may be recessed beyond eight (8) feet from the public sidewalk.\nC. Storefront design shall be proportional to that of other buildings within the same block on the same side of the street\nwithout being an exact replication of those buildings.\nD. Bulkheads should be neither too high, blocking the view of pedestrians, nor too low, SO that a completely glass walled\nstorefront is created. Bulkheads shall be constructed along all storefront areas, excluding customer entrances. Bulkheads\nshall be a minimum of 24 inches and maximum of 36 inches in height. Bulkheads may be constructed of brick, wood, or\na combination of those two materials. Bulkheads shall include architectural detailing such as inlays, trim, changes in\ncolor or changes in material.\nE. A minimum of 70 percent and maximum of 90 percent of the surface area of the storefront shall consist of transparent\nglass between a height of two (2) feet and 10 feet above the grade of the adjacent sidewalk. Glass block does not count\ntoward this requirement.\nF. Reflective or opaque glass is prohibited.\nG.\nPermanent bars, gates, shutters, fencing or other barrier materials are prohibited on the exterior of a primary facade.\nSecurity gates may be used after business hours.\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/morganton-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nPage 180 of 266\n"}, {"page": "181", "text": "3/10/24, 20:52\nFIGURE 4.60: STOREFRONT DESIGN\n42\"\n24'\nProperly Sized Bulkhead\nImproperly Sized Bulkhead\n10'\n70%-90%\nGlazing Ratio\n2'\nStorefront extends along the width of the\nfa\u00e7ade between the piers.\nThe diagram above illustrates the proper glazing ratio for a storefront design.\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/morganton-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nPage 181 of 266\n"}, {"page": "182", "text": "3/10/24, 20:52\nThese illustrations are examples of acceptable storefront designs that\ndemonstrate diversity of design while still meeting the standards of this\nsection.\n4.8.7.10 Upper Story Windows\nA.

Awnings\nare recommended to provide visual interest and protect pedestrians\nfrom inclement weather. Awning shall meet the following standards:\nA. Awnings shall not extend in width past the storefront area into the\nbuilding piers. Awning shape shall relate to the window or door\nopening. Barrel shaped lawnings should be used to complement\narched openings while rectangular awnings should be used on\nrectangular openings.\nB.

The Standards are listed below:\nA. A property shall be used for its historical purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining\ncharacteristics of the building and its site and environment.\nB. The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of\nfeatures and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.\nC. Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of\nhistorical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not\nbe\nundertaken.\n). Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historical significance in their own right shall be\nretained and preserved.\nE. Distinctive features, finishes, and constructive techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall\nbe preserved.\nF. Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires\nreplacement of a distinctive feature, the new one shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities\nand where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or\npictorial evidence.\nG. Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The\nsurface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible.\nH. Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be\ndisturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.\nI.\nNew additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historical materials that characterize the\nproperty. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, and\narchitectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.\nJ. New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the\nfuture, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.\nB.3.2 Maintenance of Historic Features\nProperty owners should take care to properly maintain and repair historic buildings in a way that will preserve the\nimportant architectural features and elements of the building that are consistent with the established architectural pattern of\nMorganton. Some basic guidelines to keep in mind are as follows:\nA. Preserve historic entrances by preventing enclosure or relocation. If an entrance requires modification to meet ADA\nrequirements, modification shall occur in a manner that has minimal impact on the location and configuration of the\noriginal entrance and meets the NC Building Code standards for rehabilitation.\nB. Preserve existing display and transom windows openings. Property owners can achieve restoration of covered or altered\nwindow openings by carefully removing cladding or infill material.\nC. Transom windows should be retained to add light to the building interior. Repair glass and framing using original style\nmaterials. Do not paint or fill in transom windows.\nD. Remove any inappropriate cladding that covers historic materials.\nE. To prevent deterioration and rusting, property owners should paint, or seal in a proper manner, any wood or metal\ntps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/morganton-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=\nPage 256 of 266\n"}, {"page": "257", "text": "3/10/24, 20:52\nfeatures, including doors, trim bulkheads and cornices.\nF. Property owners should properly maintain and repoint any damaged joints in brick, stone or other material to protect\nfrom water infiltration and deterioration.\nG. Replace broken glass in display windows, transoms and doors.\nH. Use interior storm windows or approved awnings to reduce heat gain and improve energy efficiency.\nI.\nIf new framing is required for insulated glass, install it SO that the framing matches the exterior profile and material of\nthe existing historic storefront.\nJ.\nIn order to match the design and material of intact features, the following methods should be employed:\n1. Look for physical evidence (shadow lines) of missing features.\n2. Look for evidence of missing features in historic photographs.\n3. Look for features on similar buildings nearby to replicate.\nB.4 Wildfire Reduction Techniques\nWhile the preservation of natural vegetation and trees is encouraged, on slopes of greater than 20 percent, wildfire risk is\ngreatly increased. In order to protect life and property, the following table recommends defensible space distances for\ndifferent types of vegetation based on slope. Within this defensible space, vegetation should be extensively pruned or\ncleared in order to minimize loss in the event of wildfire.\nSource: Minimizing Wildfire Risk: A Forest Landowner's Guide. Bardon & Carter, NC Cooperative Extension, 2003.\nB.5 Low Impact Development\nLow impact development design is a comprehensive stormwater management approach intended to maintain and restore a\ndeveloping watershed's hydrologic functions. Developers interested in using innovative stormwater filtration methods\nshould refer to low impact development design guidelines as set forth in the latest edition of the Low Impact Development\nGuidebook for North Carolina from NC State University, published by the North Carolina Cooperative Extension.\nB.6 Lighting\nIn an effort to reduce light pollution and excessive glare developers may use the Model Lighting Ordinance (MLO) with\nUser's Guide written by the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) and the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA).\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/morganton-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nPage 257 of 266\nCELL (1, 1): \nTABLE B.1: RECOMMENDED DEFENSIBLE SPACE DISTANCES\nCELL (1, 2): \nTABLE B.1: RECOMMENDED DEFENSIBLE SPACE DISTANCES\nCELL (1, 3): \nTABLE B.1: RECOMMENDED DEFENSIBLE SPACE DISTANCES\nCELL (1, 4): \nCELL (2, 1): \nVegetation Type\nCELL (2, 2): \nNo Slope to Moderate Slope\n(0-19%)\nCELL (2, 3): \nSteep Slope\n(20%-39%)\nCELL (2, 4): \nSlopes Upon Which Building is\nNot Recommended\n(40% or greater)\nCELL (3, 1): \nGrass\nCELL (3, 2): \n30 feet\nCELL (3, 3): \n40 feet\nCELL (3, 4): \n50 feet\nCELL (4, 1): \nShrubs\nCELL (4, 2): \n30 feet\nCELL (4, 3): \n30-60 feet\nCELL (4, 4): \n60-100 feet\nCELL (5, 1): \nno\nTrees\nCELL (5, 2): \n30 feet\nCELL (5, 3): \n30-100 feet\nCELL (5, 4): \n100-200 feet\n"}, {"page": "258", "text": "3/10/24, 20:52\nB.7 Green Building Techniques\nGreen building techniques can be accessed through the U.S. Green Building Council, North Carolina Chapter at\nhttp://www.usgbcnc.org/. The information below is from this site:\nLEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, is an internationally-recognized green building certification\nsystem. Developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) in March 2000, LEED provides building owners and\noperators with a framework for identifying and implementing practical and measurable green building design,\nconstruction, operations and maintenance solutions. LEED promotes sustainable building and development practices\nthrough a suite of rating systems that recognize projects that implement strategies for better environmental and health\nperformance. The LEED rating systems are developed through an open, consensus-based process led by LEED\ncommittees, diverse groups of volunteers representing a cross-section of the building and construction industry. Key\nelements of the process include a balanced and transparent committee structure, technical advisory groups that ensure\nscientific consistency and rigor, opportunities for stakeholder comment and review, member ballot of new rating systems,\nand fair and open appeals.\nThe Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System\u2122 encourages sustainable\ngreen building and development practices through the creation and implementation of universally understood and accepted\ntools and performance criteria. LEED is an internationally recognized certification system that measures how well a\nbuilding or community performs across all the metrics that matter most: energy savings, water efficiency, CO2 emissions\nreduction, improved indoor environmental quality, and stewardship of resources and sensitivity to their impacts.\nLANDSCAPE MANUAL 3-23-20\nTable 4.18 Large
