It shall\nnot be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use\ncan be made of the property.\n(ii.) The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location,\nsize, or topography.

A variance may be granted when necessary\nand appropriate to make reasonable accommodation under the Federal Fair Housing Act\nfor persons with disability.\n(iii.) The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner.\nThe act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify\nthe granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.\n(iv.) The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the regulation,\nsuch that public safety is secured and substantial justice is achieved.\n(b) After conducting the hearing, the quasi-judicial board shall make a decision within a reasonable\ntime and may:\n(i) Deny the application.\n(ii) Conduct an additional public hearing on the application.\n(iii) Approve the application.\nf.\nVote.\nA Approve the at application with addition the members of the quasi-judicial board shall be\nnecessary to grant a variance.\ng.\nConditions.

This\ndetermination shall take into account the land use of adjacent property, number of plantings, species,\narrangement and coverage, location of plantings on the lot, and the level of screening, height, spread, and\ncanopy of the plantings at maturity.\n2.\nLot of Record Provisions: For lots less than one hundred (100) feet in width the following provisions may be\napplied:\n185 of 373\n10/20/2023, 4:06\n"}, {"page": "186", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/guilfordcounty-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\na.\nFor lots less than one hundred (100) feet and greater than eighty (80) feet in width where Type D planting\nyards are required, one (1) Type D planting yard may be eliminated from the landscaping plan if the\nPlanning & Development Director finds that strict application of the requirements of this Section prevents\nreasonable use of the property. However, the plantings required for this yard shall be installed in remaining\nplanting yards.\nb.\nFor lots less than eighty (80) feet in width where Type D planting yards are required, two (2) Type D\nplanting yards may be eliminated from the landscaping plan if the Planning & Development Director finds\nthat strict application of the requirements of this Section prevents reasonable use of the property. All\nrequired plants for these yards shall be installed in remaining planting yards.\nI.\nTREE PRESERVATION\n1.\nGeneral: Any existing tree or group of trees which stands within or near a required planting area and meets or\nexceeds the standards of this Ordinance may be used to satisfy the tree requirements of the planting area. The\nprotection of tree stands, rather than individual trees, is strongly encouraged. Trees of greater age shall be\nprioritized.\n2.\nProtection of Existing Trees: To receive credit, trees must be protected from any root damage and trunk and\ncrown disturbance. The following standards shall apply:\na.\nThe protected area around trees shall include all land within the canopy drip line or enough area to ensure\nthe health of the tree.\nb.\nConstruction site activities such as parking, material storage, soil stock piling and concrete washout shall\nnot be permitted within tree protection areas.\nC.\nProtective fencing shall be installed around tree protection areas prior to any land disturbance. Such\nfences shall be at least four (4) feet high and may consist of snow fence or polyethylene safety fencing.\nFencing shall remain in place until construction is complete and other landscaping has been installed.\n3.\nDead or Unhealthy Trees: No credit will be allowed for any dead tree, any tree in poor health or any tree\nsubjected to grade alterations. The death of any tree used for preservation credit shall require the owner to\nplant new trees equal to the number of credited trees.\n4.\nRate of Credit: Credits shall be allowed at the rate of one (1) canopy tree for every three inches of\ncircumference measured at four and one-half (41/2) feet above grade. Credits shall be subtracted from the total\nnumber of canopy and understory trees required in the same planting yard where the tree is located. In every\ncase, however, there shall be at least one (1) canopy tree for every fifty (50) linear feet of street planting yard,\nexisting or planted.\n(File No. 21-01-GCPL-00607, 04/01/2021; File No. 21-08-GCPL-07440, 11/04/2021)\nEffective on: 11/4/2021\n6.3 LIGHTING\nA.

Additionally this Ordinance will help protect the water\nsupply uses of Jordan Reservoir and of designated water supplies throughout the Jordan Watershed.\nThe requirements of this Section shall supersede all other locally implemented buffer requirements\nas outlined in Section 9.1.IN.2. Buffers adjacent to streams provide multiple environmental\nprotection and resource management benefits. Forested buffers enhance and protect the natural\necology of stream systems, as well as water quality through bank stabilization, shading, and nutrient\nremoval. They also help to minimize flood damage in flood prone areas. Well-vegetated streamside\nriparian areas help to remove nitrogen and prevent sediment and sediment-bound pollutants such\nas phosphorous from reaching the streams.\nc. Jurisdiction:\n(1)\nThis section shall be applied to all land in the planning jurisdiction of the County that is located\nwithin the Jordan Reservoir Watershed. The Jordan Reservoir Watershed includes the Greensboro,\nHaw River, Lake Mackintosh, Reidsville, and the non-water supply watersheds as designated on the\nStormwater Map of Guilford County.\nd. Applicability:\n(1)\nThis section applies to all landowners and other persons conducting activities in the area described\nin this section, with the exception of activities conducted under the authority of the State, the\nUnited States, multiple jurisdictions, or local units of government, and forest harvesting and\nagricultural activities. The NC Division of Water Quality shall administer the requirements of Rule\n15A NCAC 02B .0267 and .0268 (Jordan Water Supply Nutrient Strategy: Protection of Existing\nRiparian Buffers and Mitigation of Existing Riparian Buffers, respectively) for these activities.\ne.\nRiparian Area Protection within the Jordan Reservoir Watershed:\n(1)\nBuffers Protected. The following minimum criteria shall be used for identifying regulated buffers.\n(a) This Section shall apply to activities conducted within, or outside of with hydrologic impacts in\nviolation of the diffuse flow requirements set out in this Section upon, fifty (50)-foot wide\nriparian buffers directly adjacent to surface waters in the Jordan Watershed (intermittent\nstreams, perennial streams, lakes, reservoirs and ponds), excluding wetlands.\n(b) Wetlands adjacent to surface waters or within fifty (50) feet of surface waters shall be\nconsidered as part of the riparian buffer but are regulated pursuant to Rules 15A NCAC 2B\n.0230 and .0231, Rules 15A NCAC 2H .0500, 15A NCAC 2H .1300, and Sections 401 and 404 of\nthe Federal Water Pollution Control Act.\n(c) For the purpose of this Ordinance, only one (1) of the following types of maps shall be used for\npurposes of identifying a water body subject to the requirements of this Ordinance:\n(i)\nThe most recent version of the soil survey map prepared by the Natural Resources\nConservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture.\n(ii)\nThe most recent version of the 1:24,000 scale (7.5 minute) quadrangle topographic maps\nprepared by the United States Geologic Survey (USGS).\n(iii)\nA map approved by the Geographic Information Coordinating Council and by the NC\nEnvironmental Management Commission. Prior to approving a map under this Item, the\nCommission shall provide a thirty (30)-day public notice and opportunity for comment.\nAlternative maps approved by the Commission shall not be used for buffer delineation on\nprojects that are existing and ongoing within the meaning of this Section.\n(d) Where the specific origination point of a stream regulated under this Item is in question, upon\nrequest of the NC Division of Water Quality or another party, the County shall make an on-site\ndetermination. A County representative who has successfully completed the Division's Surface\nWater Identification Training Certification course, its successor, or other equivalent training\n248 of 373\n10/20/2023, 4:06\n"}, {"page": "249", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/guilfordcounty-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\ncurriculum approved by the Division, shall establish that point using the latest version of the\nDivision publication, Identification Methods for the Origins of Intermittent and Perennial\nStreams,\navailable\nat:\nhttp://h2o.enr.state.nc.us/ncwetlands/documents,\n/NC_Stream_ID_Manual.pdf or from the NC Division of Water Quality - 401 Oversight Express\nPermitting Unit, or its successor. The County may accept the results of a site assessment made\nby another party who meets these criteria. Any disputes over on-site determinations made\naccording to this Item shall be referred to the Director of the Division of Water Quality c/o the\n401 Oversight Express Permitting Unit, or its successor, in writing. The Director's determination\nis subject to review as provided in Articles 3 and 4 of NCGS 150B.\n(e) Ripar\u00edan buffers protected by this Ordinance shall be measured pursuant to this section.\n(f) Parties subject to this Ordinance shall abide by all State rules and laws regarding waters of the\nstate including but not limited to Rules 15A NCAC 2B .0230 and .0231, Rules 15A NCAC\n2H\n.0500, 15A NCAC 2H .1300, and Sections 401 and 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control\nAct.\n(g) No new clearing, grading, or development shall take place, nor shall any new building permits\nbe issued in violation of this Ordinance.\n(2)\nExemption Based on On-site Determination. When a landowner or other affected party including the\nDivision believes that the maps have inaccurately depicted surface waters, he or she shall consult\nthe County. Upon request, a County representative who has successfully completed the Division\nof\nWater Quality's Surface Water Identification Training Certification course, its successor, or other\nequivalent training curriculum approved by the Division, shall make an on-site determination. The\nCounty may also accept the results of site assessments made by other parties who have successfully\ncompleted such training. Any disputes over site determinations shall be referred to the Director\nof the Division of Water Quality c/o the 401 Oversight Express Permitting Unit, or its successor, in\nwriting. A determination of the Director as to the accuracy or application of the maps is subject to\nreview as provided in Articles 3 and 4 of NCGS 150B. Surface waters that appear on the maps shall\nnot be subject to these buffer requirements if a site evaluation reveals any of the following cases:\n(a)\nMan-made ponds and lakes that are not part of a natural drainage way that is classified in\naccordance with 15A NCAC 2B .0100, including ponds and lakes created for animal watering,\nirrigation, or other agricultural uses. (A pond or lake is part of a natural drainage way when it is\nfed by an intermittent or perennial stream or when it has a direct discharge point to an\nintermittent or perennial stream.);\n(b) Ephemeral streams;\n(c) The absence on the ground of a corresponding intermittent or perennial stream, lake, reservoir,\nor pond; or\n(d) Ditches or other man-made water conveyances, other than modified natural streams.\n(3)\nExemption when Existing Uses are Present and Ongoing. This Ordinance shall not apply to uses that\nare existing and ongoing; however, this Ordinance shall apply at the time an existing, ongoing use is\nchanged to another use. Change of use shall involve the initiation of any activity that does not meet\neither of the following criteria for existing, ongoing activity:\n(a) It was present within the riparian buffer as of the effective date of this Ordinance and has\ncontinued to exist since that time. Existing uses shall include agriculture, buildings, industrial\nfacilities, commercial areas, transportation facilities, maintained lawns, utility lines and on-site\nsanitary sewage systems, any of which involve either specific, periodic management of\nvegetation or displacement of vegetation by structures or regular activity. Only the portion of\nthe riparian buffer occupied by the footprint of the existing use is exempt from this Ordinance.\nChange of ownership through purchase or inheritance is not a change of use. Activities\nnecessary to maintain uses are allowed provided that the site remains similarly vegetated, no\nimpervious surface is added within (fifty) 50 feet of the surface water where it did not\npreviously exist as of the effective date of this Ordinance, and existing diffuse flow is\nmaintained. Grading and revegetating Zone 2 is allowed provided that the health of the\nvegetation in Zone 1 is not compromised, the ground is stabilized, and existing diffuse flow is\n249 of 373\n10/20/2023, 4:06 PM\n"}, {"page": "250", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/guilfordcounty-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nmaintained; or\n(b)\nProjects or proposed development that are determined by the County to meet at least one (1)\nof the following criteria:\n(i)\nProject requires a 401 Certification or Permit, and these were issued prior to the effective\ndate this Ordinance;\n(ii)\nProjects that require a state permit, such as landfills, NPDES wastewater discharges, land\napplication of residuals and road construction activities, have begun construction or are\nunder contract to begin construction and had received all required state permits and\ncertifications prior to the effective date of this Ordinance;\n(iii) Projects that are being reviewed through the Clean Water Act Section 404/National\nEnvironmental Policy Act Merger 01 Process (published by the US Army Corps of\nEngineers and Federal Highway Administration, 2003) or its immediate successor and that\nhave reached agreement with NCDEQ on avoidance and minimization by the effective\ndate of the Ordinance; or\n(iv) Projects that are not required to be reviewed by the Clean Water Act Section\n404/National Environmental Policy Act Merger 01 Process (published by the US Army\nCorps of Engineers and Federal Highway Administration, 2003) or its immediate successor\nif a Finding of No Significant Impact has been issued for the project and the project has\nwritten approval of the County prior to the effective date of this Ordinance.\n(4)\nZones of the Riparian Buffer.

Guilford County shall determine the required area of mitigation, which shall apply\nto all mitigation options identified in this Section and as further specified in the requirements for each\noption set out in this Section, according to the following:\n(1)\nThe impacts in square feet to each zone of the riparian buffer shall be determined by Guilford\nCounty by adding the following:\na)\nThe area of the footprint of the use causing the impact to the riparian buffer.\nb)\nThe area of the boundary of any clearing and grading activities within the riparian buffer\nnecessary to accommodate the use; and\nc)\nThe area of any ongoing maintenance corridors within the riparian buffer associated with\nthe use.\n(2)\nThe required area of mitigation shall be determined by applying the following multipliers to the\nimpacts determined in Section 9.1.P.4.a of this Ordinance to each zone of the riparian buffer:\na)\nImpacts to Zone 1 of the riparian buffer shall be multiplied by three.\nb)\nImpacts to Zone 2 of the riparian buffer shall be multiplied by one and one- half; and\nc)\nImpacts to wetlands within Zones 1 and 2 of the riparian buffer that are subject to\nmitigation under 15A NCAC 2H .0506 shall comply with the mitigation ratios in 15A NCAC\n2H .0506.\nr.\nThe Location of Mitigation. For any option chosen, the mitigation effort shall be located within the same\nsub-watershed of the Jordan Watershed, as defined in 15A NCAC 02B.0262, and the same distance from\nthe Jordan Reservoir as the proposed impact, or closer to the Reservoir than the impact, and as close to\nthe location of the impact as feasible. Alternatively, the applicant may propose mitigation anywhere within\nthe same sub-watershed of the Randleman Lake Watershed, as defined in 15A NCAC 02B.0262, provided\nthat the mitigation proposal accounts for differences in delivery of nutrients to the affected arm of\nRandleman Lake Reservoir resulting from differences between the locations of the buffer impact and\nmitigation. Additional location requirements for the property donation option are enumerated in Section\n9.1.P.6.c(1) of this Ordinance.\nS.\nDonation of Property. Persons who choose to satisfy their mitigation determination by donating real\nproperty or an interest in real property shall meet the following requirements:\n(1)\nThe donation of real property interests may be used to either partially or fully satisfy the payment of\na compensatory mitigation fee to the Riparian Buffer Restoration Fund pursuant to 15A NCAC 02B\n.0269. The value of the property interest shall be determined by an appraisal performed in\naccordance with Section 9.1.P.6.d(4) of this Ordinance.

Runoff rates shall be\ncalculated using the procedures in the USDA, Soil Conservation Service's \"National Engineering Field Manual for\nConservation Practices,\" or other acceptable calculation procedures.\n2. High Quality Water Zones: In High Quality Water (HQW) zones the following design standards shall apply:\na.\nLimit on Uncovered Area: Uncovered areas in HQW zones shall be limited at any time to a maximum total\narea of (20) twenty acres within the boundaries of the tract. Only the portion of the land-disturbing\nactivity within a HQW zone shall be governed by this subsection. Larger areas may be uncovered within the\nboundaries of the tract with the written approval.\nb.\nMaximum Peak Rate of Runoff Protection: erosion and sedimentation control measures, structures and\ndevices within HQW zones shall be so planned, designed and constructed to provide protection from the\nrunoff of the twenty-five-year storm which produces the maximum peak rate of runoff as calculated\n287 of 373\n10/20/2023,\n"}, {"page": "288", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/guilfordcounty-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\naccording to procedures in the United States Department of Agricultural Soil Conservation Service's\n\"National Engineering Field Manual for Conservation Practices\" or according to procedures adopted by any\nother agency of this state or the United States or any generally recognized organization or association.\nC.\nSettling Efficiency: Sediment basins within HQW zones shall be designed and constructed such that the\nbasin will have a settling efficiency of at least seventy percent (70%) for the forty (40) micron (0.04\nmillimeter) size soil particle transported into the basin by the runoff of that two-year storm which\nproduces the maximum peak rate of runoff as calculated according to procedures in the United States\nDepartment of Agricultural Soil Conservation Service's \"National Engineering Field Manual for\nConservation Practices\" or according to procedures adopted by any other agency of this State or the\nUnited States or any generally reorganized organization or association.\nd.\nGrade: Newly constructed open channels in HQW zones shall be designed and constructed with side slopes\nno steeper than two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical if a vegetative cover is used for stabilization unless\nsoil conditions permit a steeper slope or where the slopes are stabilized by using mechanical devices,\nstructural devices, or other acceptable ditch liners. In any event, the angle for side slopes shall be sufficient\nto restrain accelerated erosion.\ne.\nGround Cover: Ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion must be provided for any portion of a land-\ndisturbing activity in a HQW zone within fifteen (15) working days or sixty (60) calendar days following\ncompletion of construction or development, whichever period is shorter.\nH.\nSTORM WATER OUTLET PROTECTION\n1.\nIntent: Stream banks and channels downstream from any land-disturbing activity shall be protected from\nincreased degradation by accelerated erosion caused by increased velocity of runoff from the land-disturbing\nactivity.\n2.\nPerformance Standard: Persons shall conduct land-disturbing activity so that the construction velocity of\nthe 10-year storm runoff in the receiving watercourse to the discharge point does not exceed the greater of:\na.\nThe velocity established by Table 9.2.1 - Maximum Permissible Velocity for Stormwater Discharge.\nb.\nThe velocity of the ten (10)-year storm runoff in the receiving watercourse prior to development.\nC.\nIf conditions a or b above cannot be met, then the receiving watercourse to and including the discharge\npoint shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity anywhere the velocity exceeds\nthe \"prior to development\" velocity by ten percent (10%).\n3.\nAcceptable Management Measures: Measures applied alone or in combination to satisfy the intent of this\nsection is acceptable if there are no objectionable secondary consequences. The Jurisdiction recognizes that the\nmanagement of storm water runoff to minimize or control downstream channel and bank erosion is a\ndeveloping technology. Innovative techniques and ideas will be considered and may be used when shown to\nhave the potential to produce successful results.\n4.\nSome alternatives, while not exhaustive, are to:\na.\nAvoid increases to surface runoff volume and velocity by including measures to promote infiltration to\ncompensate for increased runoff from areas rendered impervious;\nb.\nAvoid increases in storm water discharge velocities by using vegetated or roughened swales and\nwaterways in place of closed drains and high velocity paved sections;\nC.\nProvide energy dissipators at outlets of storm drainage facilities to reduce flow velocities to the point of\ndischarge.\nd.\nProtect watercourses subject to accelerated erosion by improving cross sections and/or providing erosion-\nresistant lining.\ne.\nUpgrade or replace the receiving device structure, or water course such that it will receive and conduct the\nflow to a point where it is no longer subject to degradation from the increased rate of flow or increased\nvelocity.\n5.\nExceptions: This rule shall not apply where it can be demonstrated to the Jurisdiction that storm water\ndischarge velocities will not create an erosion problem in the receiving watercourse.\nTABLE 9.2.1 - MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE VELOCITY FOR STORMWATER DISCHARGES\n288 of 373\n10/20/2023,\n"}, {"page": "289", "text": "Firefox\nhttps://online.encodeplus.com/regs/guilfordcounty-nc/doc-view.aspx?print=1\nSource: Adapted from recommendations by Special Committee on Irrigation Research, American Society of Civil Engineers, 1926, for channels with\nstraight alignment.
